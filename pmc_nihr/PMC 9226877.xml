                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>At least one in four people treated by the primary care improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) programme in England experiences distressing psychotic experiences (PE) in addition to common mental disorder (CMD). These individuals are less likely to achieve recovery. IAPT services do not routinely screen for nor offer specific treatments for CMD including PE. The Tailoring evidence-based psychological therapY for People with common mental disorder including Psychotic EXperiences study will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an enhanced training for cognitive behavioural therapists that aims to address this clinical gap.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multisite, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. The setting will be IAPT services within three mental health trusts. The participants will be (1) 56–80 qualified IAPT cognitive behavioural therapists and (2) 600 service users who are triaged as appropriate for cognitive behavioural therapy in an IAPT service <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> have PE according to the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences—Positive 15-items Scale. IAPT therapists will be grouped into eight study clusters subsequently randomised to the control-intervention sequence. We will obtain pseudonymous clinical outcome data from IAPT clinical records for eligible service users. We will invite service users to complete health economic measures at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with common mental disorder psychotic experiences who have recovered by the end of treatment as measured by the official IAPT measure for recovery.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Psychotic experiences (PE), such as attenuated and/or fragmentary paranoid beliefs and hallucinations, are relatively common in the general population, especially among young people.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Though systematic reviews and evidence synthesis indicate that 30%–40% of those with intense and frequent attenuated psychotic symptoms will transition to a psychotic disorder,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> studies including individuals with shorter and less intense mental symptoms have shown that far fewer (~10%) make such a conversion.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Nonetheless, PE still predict propensity to seek treatment from mental health services<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and are a marker for severity of other, non-psychotic common mental disorders (CMD), particularly depression and anxiety.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7 8</xref></p>
              <p>In England, the improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) programme is the main provision for people with CMD. Offering UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-approved psychological therapies, the programme is predominantly based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). National standards specify that 50% of IAPT service users should achieve recovery, a key performance indicator defined by reduction in scores on indices of depression and anxiety. For the first time since its inception in 2008, IAPT met this target in 2016–2017, with 51% of people nationally being considered recovered by the end of treatment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence suggests that at least one in four people treated by IAPT may have a common mental disorder that includes psychotic experiences (CMD-PE). These individuals are at increased risk of not demonstrating recovery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10</xref> Currently, IAPT neither screens for, nor offers specific treatments for CMD-PE. Treatment protocols focus exclusively on mood disturbance, leaving PE undetected and untreated. Given the complexity and comorbidity of CMD-PE, standard treatment interventions are likely to be suboptimal.</p>
              <p>Though some effective psychological treatments for PE exist, such as CBT for at-risk mental states,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> they are dispersed throughout various service settings, and as such are inadequate to assess or treat the whole condition of CMD-PE. An innovative National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded programme—Tailoring evidence-based psychological therapY for People with common mental disorder including Psychotic EXperiences (TYPPEX)—is targeting this clinical gap. It seeks to adapt and assemble available treatment options for CMD-PE into a practical therapeutic toolbox for cognitive behavioural therapists in IAPT known as CBT tailoring for severity (CBT-ts), rolled out via an enhanced training package and supervision programme.</p>
              <p>A single-arm, three-site feasibility study (National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee (REC) reference 19/SC/0077) demonstrated the successful delivery of CBT-ts to 31 therapists and outcome data collection for 153 Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) +patients on their caseload, and provided qualitative information used to refine the training intervention (study report available by request from the authors).</p>
              <p>This protocol paper describes the TYPPEX stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (TYPPEX swcRCT), which aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CBT-ts versus IAPT standard care (SC) in IAPT service users with CMD and also PE, as determined by the CAPE—Positive 15-items Scale (CAPE-P15).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This pragmatic trial will be the first to identify and treat people with CMD-PE in IAPT services. It will provide valuable evidence for the development of interventions for this important and underserved population, while adding to the body of knowledge about design and conduct of randomised controlled trials in the IAPT setting.</p>

                <title>Public and patient involvement</title>
                <p>An experienced public and patient involvement (PPI) representative contributed significantly to the development of the PPI strategy set out in the grant application and continues to have study oversight as a member of the steering committee. The submission was endorsed by a co-applicant with relevant lived and academic experience and a PPI coordinator with lived experience was employed to facilitate PPI activity.</p>
                <p>At the planning stage a Lived Experience Advisory Panel (‘LEAP’) was convened comprising 11 people with lived experience including diverse community members. The LEAP influenced some research questions extending the scope of a systematic review within the research programme<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and informing qualitative interview questions.</p>
                <p>Since TYPPEX is a pragmatic trial, the study design is largely dictated according to the way that IAPT services operate. The primary outcome measure is a national metric of ‘recovery’ derived from routinely collected IAPT data, and is not open to alteration. LEAP members positively influenced secondary outcome measures including introducing the CAPE-P15 at final follow-up.</p>
                <p>LEAP involvement in the development of the intervention (CBT-ts) was highly influential, for example, in review of the training resources and ideas about language and delivery. All patient-facing resources are produced in partnership with the LEAP, who have been invaluable in raising issues around acceptability and accessibility. The panel reviewed the feasibility study protocol and gave feedback on adaptations to remote working for the main trial. All ethical submissions undergo thorough PPI review with strong focus on acceptability of consent processes.</p>
                <p>PPI representation from IAPT services was not initially possible since primary care services do not routinely screen for PE. However, after the trial’s feasibility study, we have expanded involvement to include three people recruited for such study, who have lived experience that matches our target population. We have also expanded involvement to include four IAPT CBT therapists, also drawn from the feasibility study, to ensure acceptability and usability of CBT-ts and research methods within an IAPT setting, together contributing an additional seven perspectives.</p>
                <p>People with lived experience will be involved in qualitative data interpretation to provide context and sense checking of themes and anonymised service-user quotes as part of the process evaluation. LEAP members have coauthored papers and presented posters at public events and dissemination activity will continue to be informed and enhanced by people with lived experience.</p>
                <p>PPI will remain reflective and responsive to new insights and the needs of the study, working to the NIHR INVOLVE’s standards for public involvement.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p>The IAPT programme in England began in 2008 with the aim of improving access to evidence-based psychological treatment for CMD, particularly depression and anxiety. It sought to increase public access to NICE-approved psychological therapies, predominantly CBT, by offering flexible referral routes, including self-referral. The programme has continued to expand over time and currently assesses over 1.3 million people with CMD annually, delivering therapy to approximately 550 000.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> NHS England has committed to further expansion of the programme, aiming to see 1.9 million patients annually by 2024.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                <p>The programme provides treatment for CMD for people aged 17 or over. Its pathways involve a stepped care model, providing steps 2 and 3 of the NICE five-step approach to the treatment of CMD. At step 2 in the IAPT programme, large numbers of service users, with less severe conditions may be allocated to a single therapist. These service users may receive a variety of interventions, including brief face-to-face therapy, telephone support, computerised CBT or guided self-help. At step 3, highly trained CBT therapists manage smaller caseloads of people with more severe CMD. These therapists use more intensive treatment methods, delivering up to 20 individual face-to-face psychological therapy sessions. This clinical setting is immediately below psychiatric treatment by secondary mental health services (NICE step 4).</p>
                <p>Step 3 IAPT CBT therapists will have completed a 1 year postgraduate diploma (PG Dip) in CBT accredited by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP). Entry requirements for the PG Dip include a secured work placement for clinical practice and a BABCP recognised core profession, such as mental health nursing or counselling psychology.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

                <title>Trial design and participants</title>
                <p>The TYPPEX study is a pragmatic, multicentre swcRCT with nested health economic and process evaluations. It involves eight NICE step-3 IAPT teams (clusters) of CBT therapists across three mental health trusts in England: Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. Each trust (organisational unit within the National Health Services of England and Wales) serves a mixed urban and rural population with a wide socioeconomic range, including some high levels of deprivation, covering a total population of approximately 2.8 million.</p>
                <p>Clusters will be randomised to different sequences rather than, strictly speaking, different arms. The sequences dictate the order in which each cluster switches from the control to intervention condition. TYPPEX swcRCT has five measurement periods and four steps, with two clusters switching to the intervention condition at each step. As the intervention is cluster randomised at the level of IAPT team, and the delivery of therapy by these teams may be subject to regional variation, each cluster will act as its own internal control. All clusters will start in the control condition and move to the intervention condition (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

IAPT therapist exclusion criteria are: (1) does not deliver CBT therapy in current role, (2) works across more than one locality IAPT team (to avoid potential contamination eg, via team meetings, shared office space) and (3) participated in an earlier TYPPEX feasibility study.</p>
                <p>Service user participants are those individuals accepted onto the NICE step-3 IAPT caseload for participating therapists and meeting the study eligibility criteria, which are: (1) accepted onto the IAPT caseload for therapy and therefore meet service-specific inclusion criteria to access IAPT treatment (irrespective of whether service has been accessed previously or not), (2) meet current criteria for IAPT CBT treatment and (3) assessed for PE, according to the CAPE-P15 questionnaire in their clinical record. Additional inclusion criteria for health economics substudy only: (4) presence of PE according to the CAPE-P15 score, (5) in the judgement of the treating therapist has sufficient proficiency in English to complete research questionnaires and (6) able and willing to provide written informed consent.</p>

In these cases, two local IAPT teams will be merged to create a cluster. Once clusters are allocated, IAPT service managers will be approached and CBT-ts training courses arranged in line with each cluster randomisation point.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>CBT-ts training will be delivered to step-3 CBT therapists in eight clusters, randomised at four steps. In each cluster, approximately 7–10 therapists will receive training, with the intention for at least five therapists to deliver therapy throughout each cluster period, to allow for inevitable therapist turnover and sickness.</p>
                <p>Based on our prevalence studies of CMD-PE in IAPT<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10</xref> and considering average caseloads of 15–20 services users per therapist over 6 months, each therapist will deliver therapy to a minimum of three people. Pragmatically, the total number of eligible service users receiving therapy from a participating therapist during the whole trial may be higher, but only control service users who complete therapy during their cluster’s control phase and intervention service users who complete therapy prior to the end of the intervention phase, will be included in the primary outcome analysis. Based on results from our previous TYPPEX feasibility work, we expect that 6-month steps would be sufficient for this.</p>
                <p>All service users will be identified as having PE with the CAPE-P15 score threshold of 1.47<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for both frequency of and distress associated to psychotic experiences at baseline, resulting in a minimum of 15 service users per cluster period. Eight clusters and four randomisation steps result in 20 control condition cluster periods and 20 intervention condition cluster periods. Three hundred IAPT service users will be recruited during the control condition and 300 during the intervention condition across all sites. In addition to the number of clusters and the steps presented above, we have assumed: an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05, a significance level of 0.05 and an improvement in recovery from 0.39 (control) to 0.58 (intervention).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10</xref> Based on these assumptions, the proposed sample size will allow us to detect such a difference with just over 80% power. Although this ignores that clustering also happens at the therapist level, it has been shown that ignoring an additional, lower level of clustering is a conservative estimate of the power. This is not sensitive to the choice of intracluster correlation coefficient.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>Also during the feasibility work we found that approximately 50% of the sample providing pseudonymised routine data would consent to complete the health economic measures. Thus, we aim that 150 service users will be consented to complete health economic measures during the control condition and 150 during the intervention phase across all sites.</p>

                <p>All IAPT service users who begin a course of CBT from the outset of the trial will be asked to complete a CAPE-P15 screening questionnaire and will receive a leaflet during their first treatment session. The leaflet explains that the trial is taking place in the service, and if eligible, their pseudonymous clinical data will be used for the research. Awareness of the trial is also raised in participating sites using posters. Both the poster and leaflet provide service users with information on the local policy for how they can opt out should they wish their data not to be used for research purposes. The CAPE-P15 screening questionnaire is currently accessible for clinical information as part of routine service use for participating sites.</p>
                <p>IAPT service users with PE according to the CAPE-P15 will be asked by their therapist to provide consent to be contacted about participating in the health economic data collection, since this data cannot be collected from clinical records. If consent is obtained, the service user will be sent a participant information sheet and an electronic consent form by email (or paper versions by post) prior to the following treatment session, followed by baseline health economics measures.</p>
                <p>Recruited service users will receive standard IAPT care from a participating therapist (control condition) or standard IAPT care from a participating therapist following CBT-ts training (intervention condition). They will be contacted by email or post for follow-up health economics data collection at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after baseline.</p>

                  <title>CBT-ts</title>
                  <p>CBT-ts is a team-level service improvement intervention. It aims to enhance existing CBT skills of NICE step-3 IAPT CBT therapists and is not a novel therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is important to highlight that all IAPT service-users receiving CBT under the care of a CBT-ts trained therapist, including those who do not have CMD-PE, may be exposed to the effects of the training.</p>
                  <p>CBT-ts is based on the CBT framework currently used nationally in IAPT but includes adaptations to existing interventions to specifically address PE. The training takes a knowledge, skills and attitude focus enhancing existing knowledge of CBT. It includes three modules delivered online as workshops supplemented by a blended learning package with access to an online network and provision of written resources. Therapists are provided with a single pack of editable templates, which they may or may not use in their clinical practice.</p>
                  <p>The structured training programme includes:</p>

                  <p>Training is supported by six CBT-ts supervision sessions, which commence 1 month post training and are subsequently delivered monthly, either online or face-to-face. Following completion of training, CBT therapists will identify people with CMD-PE according to the CAPE-P15 and treat them in line with current CBT interventions, incorporating their enhanced skills, as necessary. Treatment duration is non-prescriptive and expected to range between 8 and 14 sessions dependent on therapists’ clinical decisions. Treatment duration is not expected to exceed 20 weekly sessions, in line with current standard guidance in IAPT services, nationally.</p>

                <p>The control comparator is standard CBT care delivered within IAPT services prior to CBT-ts training. CBT is delivered as part of range of interventions offered at step 3 within the NICE stepped care model. CBT treatment protocols are delivered in accordance with NICE guidance for people with CMD. Treatment duration varies according to presenting problem and minimum dose necessary to achieve recovery, but NICE recommends individuals should receive up to 20 weekly sessions unless they recover beforehand (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg123/chapter/1-guidance" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg123/chapter/1-guidance</ext-link>).</p>

Where possible, purposive sampling will be used to ensure diversity of gender and ethnicity and exposure to number of sessions of therapy.</p>
                <p>Between 16 and 24 IAPT therapists (with a minimum of two per cluster) who completed CBT-ts training and subsequently delivered at least three treatment sessions to a minimum of two service-users scoring 1.47 and above on the CAPE-P15 will be recruited. Additionally, we will conduct 18–25 interviews with IAPT clinical supervisors/managers from participating IAPT teams who line manage or supervise a CBT-ts trained therapist, senior non-clinical NHS managers with responsibility for delivery of IAPT services at Trust level or responsibility for commissioning IAPT services, and members of the trial team and collaborators who contributed to the design, development or implementation of TYPPEX. In all cases, purposive sampling will be used to ensure representation of a wide range of perspectives and experiences.</p>

                <p>Data collection will include retrospectively recorded IAPT data from 23 March 2020 until trial start. This data, covering the period of UK lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, will provide information on the nature of IAPT service provision during this time, and any changes in baseline morbidity.

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>The primary analysis will compare IAPT-defined recovery of service users with CMD-PE as determined by the CAPE-P15 cut-off of 1.47 in the control phase with those in the intervention phase (post-training). Recovery proportions and means will be compared at individual therapist and team level after adjusting for the stepped-wedge cluster design. Adjustment will also be made for the baseline characteristics and other covariates. Time will be included as a set of indicator variables.</p>
                <p>Analyses of clinical effectiveness will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population with all available follow-up data from all new service users with CMD-PE on the caseload of participating therapists, controlling for baseline scores on depression and anxiety disorder specific measures. The primary ITT analysis is intended to provide inferences regarding the effectiveness of the intervention overall. It does not provide inferences regarding the causal effect of the intervention itself, but on the intervention as deployed in ‘real life’, therefore compliance information is not necessary to ensure that the ITT analysis is valid. As soon as a therapist has their first session of CBT-ts training, they begin to practise differently, so this date will mark the beginning of their intervention phase.</p>
                <p>A logistic mixed effects regression model will be used for the primary outcome analysis. The cluster effect by both the therapist team and therapist will be considered in the multilevel analysis. Adjustment for potential prognostic variables will be agreed prior to analysis between the trial statisticians and the chief investigator.</p>
                <p>Intracluster correlation coefficients and 95% CIs will be reported for the primary and secondary outcomes. All analyses will be two-tailed and at the 5% level of significance.</p>
                <p>Summary statistics of baseline characteristics at the cluster and the individual level will be reported where appropriate. Analyses will be conducted in Stata or R.

Data on indirect time, including preparation and supervision, will be collected directly from the therapists. Details of resources required to deliver the CBT-ts training and supervision will be provided by the TYPPEX research team. Use of all other health and social care services will be collected via a modified version of the adult service use schedule for early intervention (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) collected using REDCap data collection software at baseline (covering the last 3 months) and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (covering the period since the last interview). Resource use data will be combined with nationally applicable unit costs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Productivity losses (applicable to sensitivity analyses only) will be calculated using the human capital approach by multiplying days off work for mental health reasons by the national average wage rate.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
                <p>Our primary economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis using quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EuroQol measure of health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) based on complete case data. The EQ-5D-5L has been proposed as being more sensitive to change in mental health populations compared with the EQ-5D-3L.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Therefore, we will compare the psychometric properties of the 3L and 5L versions. The version of the EQ-5D used in this analysis will be dependent on analyses comparing the two. QALYs will be calculated by applying appropriate utility weights to EQ-5D health states<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and using the total area under the curve approach with linear interpolation between assessment points.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A secondary analysis will additionally explore cost-effectiveness using the primary outcome measure: IAPT-defined recovery.</p>
                <p>Costs and outcomes will be compared at the final follow-up point and presented as mean values by trial phase with SD. Mean differences in costs and 95% CIs will be obtained by non-parametric bootstrap regressions to account for the non-normal distribution commonly found in economic data.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated. Uncertainty will be explored using cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves based on the net-benefit approach.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These curves are an alternative to CIs around ICERs and show the probability that one intervention is cost-effective compared with the other for a range of values that a decision maker would be willing to pay for an additional unit of an outcome. To provide more relevant treatment-effect estimates, all economic analyses will include adjustment for stepped-wedge cluster design, relevant baseline characteristics and other covariates,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> in line with the clinical analyses.</p>
                <p>Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore the impact of missing data (using multiple imputation) and to explore cost-effectiveness from a broader perspective, including productivity losses because of time off work due to illness. Additionally, to assess the impact of missing data, we will compare those with economic data to the full sample included in the main clinical analysis to examine any potential biases in terms of demographic and clinical factors.</p>

Data analysis will take place after each stage of data collection so the analysis from each stage can inform data collection in the next. Some data analysis will also take place in parallel. The data will initially be subject to open coding using a combination of pre-selected questions and sensitising constructs identified from the literature. Codes will be increasingly grouped into higher-order explanatory categories through comparison and refinement in rounds of discussion and sense making. A set of overarching thematic categories will be agreed and used as a framework for further, more deductive, coding across the whole data set.</p>

              <p>CBT-ts, including therapist training and supervision, is low risk for all participants. IAPT service users scoring above the CAPE-P15 thresholds for PE on whom data are being pseudonymously collected are under the care of the IAPT service for the duration of their participation and are subject to normal IAPT safety procedures. No specific risks, untoward incidents or adverse events related to CBT-ts are anticipated as the intervention aims to up-skill therapists rather than offering a new therapeutic intervention. This approach was supported by the results of a feasibility study as part of the wider TYPPEX research programme, during which no related serious adverse events were reported.</p>
              <p>Safety outcome variables will be collected retrospectively each month from the routinely collected pseudonymous data. Aggregated safety information will be reported to the TYPPEX Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee throughout the randomisation condition. In addition, Principal Investigators, IAPT managers and therapists will be requested to report reports relating to TYPPEX by eligible participants to the trial team.</p>
              <p>The clinical data generated during therapy (CAPE-P15, General Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and anxiety disorder specific measure) is recorded as part of routine care and is used by this trial via an opt-out consent process. This is designed to remove the burden on IAPT therapists with respect to recruitment, and to ensure a representative sample.</p>
              <p>A subgroup of service users are consented via an opt-in process to provide additional data outside of the clinical setting. This includes cost and quality of life health economic data, and follow-up clinical data at 12 months (see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). This data will be linked with their IAPT clinical record.</p>
              <p>Results from this trial will be presented at national and international conferences, including the Schizophrenia International Research Society Conference and IEPA <italic toggle="yes">Early Intervention in Mental Health Conference</italic>. Dissemination will also occur through the submission of a primary article on the outcomes and several subsequent articles considering the effects of the intervention stratified by service user and therapist variables. Primary outcomes will be disseminated more widely as part of a theory-driven implementation plan, developing a community of practise including patients, the public, economists and systems engineers experienced in care pathway design and evaluation, in addition to stakeholders in the IAPT services.</p>
              <p>The training materials will be shared electronically and will be widely available to the NHS.</p>
