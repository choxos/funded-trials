                  <p id="Par1">Video clinics, where patients can have a hospital appointment with their clinician from home, are emerging in practice, but their effectiveness is unclear. This study will evaluate whether a video clinic implemented at the University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust improves patient satisfaction compared to standard face-to-face appointments for liver transplant patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This will be a parallel, two-arm, statistician-blinded, randomised evaluation. Clinically stable liver patients at 1 to 5 years post-transplant (<italic>n</italic> = 180) will be randomised in equal numbers to video clinic appointments (intervention) or standard face-to-face appointments (control). The intervention group will have outpatient appointments from home via a secure video link accessed through the UHB patient portal. All patients will complete baseline questionnaires before randomisation and electronic follow-up questionnaires after each follow-up appointment during the subsequent 12 months. The primary outcome is the difference in scores between groups for three domains of patient satisfaction, namely ‘convenience of location’, ‘getting through to the office by phone’ and ‘length of time waiting’ (modified Visit-Specific Satisfaction Instrument). Secondary outcomes include quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L), costs, clinical contacts and user experience. Statistical analysis will be descriptive and performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome will be analysed using baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month questionnaires (according to patient follow-up appointment frequency) and comparisons made between study arms. A within-trial cost consequences analysis will be undertaken on the economic data. Patients (<italic>n</italic> = 8), carers/family members (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and health professionals (<italic>n</italic> = 14) will be interviewed about the experience of video clinics and the interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will allow an in depth understanding of whether video clinics can improve patient satisfaction with their care. In addition, the intervention could save patients time and costs, removing the need to travel long distances for outpatient appointments. Video clinics may be applicable to a wide range of other clinical settings and health conditions. The study has been approved by the NHS Health Research Authority and a National Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/WM/0338) and research governance approval has been obtained from UHB (Ref: RRK6080).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Increasing the use of technological interventions to improve patient care is becoming more prominent in national policy, especially for people with chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with the UK Government having set a target to offer digital services, including electronic consultations, to 95% of general practice patients by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Emerging interventions have included online patient access to health records, computerised therapy, video conferencing and home sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The 2016 Wachter Review on Health Information Technology to Improve Care in England concluded that the English secondary care sector is ready for a national digital strategy to help create a user-centred infrastructure that is high quality and manageable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Video clinics (also known as tele-consultations, virtual clinics, virtual consultations, e-consultations, remote video visits, skype consultations or videoconferencing) have started to emerge in the evidence base for different patient groups, including patients in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and integrated/joint care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In secondary care, some studies have used videoconference technology for remote consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, video clinic studies in secondary care have typically had small sample sizes and differ in their findings. For example, one study of video clinics in orthopaedics found higher rates of patient satisfaction in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], whilst another found similar levels of patient satisfaction in both intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The evidence is also unclear about the cost-effectiveness of telehealth services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, studies focusing on teledermatology have found that remote consultation costs were less than those of conventional medicine when large geographical distances exist between specialist care providers and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and that teledermatology is not cost-effective for patients travelling smaller distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In contrast, a large, well-designed UK study focusing specifically on the effectiveness of joint consultation between patients, General Practitioners (GPs) and hospital specialists found that joint consultations can significantly increase patient satisfaction with treatment, but were associated with higher costs over 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Numerous examples of video clinic interventions have emerged in clinical practice in recent years in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, current evidence does not clearly show the benefits of video clinics in secondary care and there is a lack of large well-designed studies assessing the effectiveness of video clinics to facilitate outpatient appointments in patients’ homes. There is an ongoing need for randomised controlled e-health studies and high-quality evaluations that include research on patient perspectives, satisfaction and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                <title>Video clinics for liver transplant patients at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust</title>
                <p id="Par16">The UHB NHS Foundation Trust Liver and Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) Unit is one of the largest in the UK, performing over 250 liver transplants annually. Once patients are considered clinically stable (usually 1 year post-transplant), they must attend the hospital regularly for ongoing monitoring (follow-up appointments every 3 or 6 months). As one of only six specialist adult liver transplant centres in the UK, the Liver and HPB Unit covers an extensive catchment area, and many transplant patients travel large distances to attend follow-up appointments. In collaboration with patients and clinicians, UHB has developed a video clinic tool that is accessible via the Trust patient records portal (myhealth@QEHB). The portal was developed by the Technical Development and Informatics team at the Trust, and is currently used by over 7000 patients across 40 clinical specialties. It allows patients to remotely access some of their clinical information, including letters, laboratory results, email correspondence with their consultant and GP referrals, and patients can co-manage their treatment plans with the relevant clinicians. Patients can also view appointments, receive reminders, upload/share files on the system and interact with other patients to create their own peer-support networks.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Of the 3000 liver transplant patients considered stable at any one time at UHB, approximately 1000 currently use myhealth@QEHB and the Liver and HPB Unit is introducing video clinic appointments (termed myVideoClinic) via the portal for these patients. Video clinics will allow routine 3 or 6 monthly hospital appointments to be carried out remotely via a secure video and/or voice link between the patient and their hospital consultant. MyVideoClinic will also allow patients to pre-specify three questions/topics that they would like to discuss during their video clinic, and an audio recording of the video clinic will be made available in their patient record after their appointment. Patients using the video clinic service will need to have the relevant clinical testing for each appointment (blood tests, weight and blood pressure measurements) carried out at a GP practice or dialysis centre local to their home and the test results must be uploaded to the portal prior to each myVideoClinic appointment.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Audit data collected from one of the UHB liver clinics in early 2017 showed that, although satisfaction with outpatient care in liver transplant patients is generally high (as measured by the modified Visit-Specific Satisfaction Instrument, VSQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], satisfaction was significantly lower in the specific VSQ-9 domains of ‘convenience of location’, ‘getting through to the office by phone’ and ‘length of time waiting’ when these were compared to other domains (<italic>n</italic> = 83; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Perceived convenience, ease of contacting the hospital and waiting times are therefore all aspects of patient satisfaction that could potentially be improved by offering video clinics and introducing flexibility in how patients receive their post-transplant outpatient care. MyVideoClinic may also lower patient and secondary care costs.</p>
                <p id="Par19">This protocol outlines a pragmatic, two-armed, parallel group, statistician-blinded randomised evaluation designed to assess the effectiveness of providing video clinics as an alternative to standard face-to-face consultations in delivering routine follow-up care for clinically stable liver transplant patients.</p>

                <p id="Par46">Prior to each clinic where recruitment is taking place, a member of the clinical team will screen the day’s clinic list to identify eligible patients on the basis of time since transplant and age (inclusion criteria 1 and 2). Patients who meet these criteria will have the study introduced to them at the end of their routine outpatient appointment and their further eligibility assessed against inclusion criteria 3 to 7. The consultant will give eligible patients a Participant Information Sheet and those interested in study participation will have the opportunity to discuss the study with a member of the University of Birmingham research team. The research team will take written informed consent during the clinic from patients who wish to participate and the latter will complete a baseline questionnaire prior to randomisation. Patients who require more time to consider participation will be able to take the study information away and will be contacted by telephone within 7 days by a member of the research team. If a patient agrees to take part over the telephone, a consent form and baseline questionnaire will be posted to them along with a reply-paid envelope for return of the completed documents to the University of Birmingham. Once recruited, participants will stay in the study for 12 months. This will equate to between two and four follow-up appointments since the participants’ usual appointment schedule and frequency will continue to be defined by clinical need regardless of group allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par47">If a patient does not wish to participate in the study, their reason for refusal will be recorded, along with routinely collected information (age, sex and clinic attended). To further understand reasons for participants not taking part, a selection of non-participating patients (<italic>n</italic> = 4) will be invited to take part in a short semi-structured interview (see qualitative study section).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p id="Par48">After giving consent and completing the baseline questionnaire, participating patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention (myVideoClinic) or control (standard care) arm of the study using the GraphPad online randomisation tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Participants will be randomised by the member of the research team who has taken participant consent. Patients randomised to the myVideoClinic group will be registered on the myVideoClinic system and given printed information on how to access an online training tool that includes instructions on how to use the video clinic. Patients from both study arms will be registered on the myhealth@QEHB data collection system. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of study participants or clinical staff administering myVideoClinic will not be possible. The statistician analysing the primary outcome data will be blinded to each participant’s study group for the intention-to-treat analysis.</p>

                <title>Intervention group</title>
                <p id="Par49">Patients randomised to the myVideoClinic group will be sent appointments for their video clinic through the post and will receive standard text reminders about their appointment. Patients will be required to have their clinical tests (blood test, weight and blood pressure) carried out locally at their GP practice or at a nearby dialysis centre and make the test results available through myhealth@QEHB before each video clinic appointment. At each appointment, patients will log in to myhealth@QEHB and speak to their consultant via an embedded video link or voice call (depending on their internet bandwidth). Video clinics will use the secure system Vidyo as the videoconferencing platform. In addition to having their follow-up appointment via myVideoClinic, the system will allow patients to submit up to three questions or topics prior to their appointment that they would like to discuss with their clinician, and patients will be able to access an audio recording of the video clinic from their patient record after each appointment.</p>
                <p id="Par50">If there are any technical issues with myVideoClinic during a video appointment, the consultant will telephone the patient to finish the appointment and schedule a face-to-face appointment if necessary. All instances where appointment rescheduling has occurred will be recorded by the clinician. If patients in the intervention group experience any technical problems with myVideoClinic during the study, they are advised to contact the myhealth@QEHB support team.</p>

              <sec id="Sec11">
                <title>Control group</title>
                <p id="Par51">Patients randomised to the control group will receive standard face-to-face care at the hospital and will not be offered video clinics. They will receive standard written notifications of the date and time of their appointment and routine text reminders, and will also complete their clinical tests in hospital on the day of their appointment, the results of which will be reviewed by the clinician after each patient’s appointment.</p>
                <sec id="Sec12">
                  <title>Crossover between study arms</title>
                  <p id="Par52">Patients allocated to the intervention group will be made aware that the intervention is the option of having a video clinic as an alternative to face-to-face appointments and that they can ask to come to the hospital for a standard face-to-face appointment if they wish. They will still be able to have a video clinic for their next appointment as long as they complete their clinical tests locally. Clinical staff will also be able to change patients from using myVideoClinic to a standard face-to-face appointment if (1) the patient has requested this, (2) there is a clinical need to see the patient face-to-face, or (3) if a consultant has not seen the results of pre-appointment clinical testing for a myVideoClinic patient for two successive appointments. Staff will be asked to record any reasons for changing patients from myVideoClinic to standard care. The attendance to a face-to-face appointment by a patient assigned to the video clinic group will not be treated as study withdrawal as we have allowed for patients in the video clinic group to crossover between face-to-face appointments and video clinics for clinical reasons and because pilot work has shown that patients have a preference for flexibility. Crossover between study arms will be monitored, recorded and reported in both interim and main study analyses and will be discussed with the study’s independent monitoring group if crossover exceeds 60%.</p>

The VSQ-9 has been validated and used in previous studies conducted in different health settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and an earlier version of this questionnaire (SVQ13) was used in a randomised controlled trial of virtual outreach in a UK context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The VSQ-9 asks participants to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of their clinic appointment on a 5-point scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent). Scores are then transformed into a 0–100 linear scale, where higher scores denote higher levels of satisfaction. VSQ-9 data will be collected at baseline and after every video clinic or face-to-face appointment via patient questionnaires. A difference of 10 points between the intervention and control groups in the three selected domains of the VSQ-9 at study end (12 months) will be taken as clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par56">HRQoL data will be collected at baseline, 6 months and study end using the EQ-5D-5 L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which assesses patient functioning and wellbeing with respect to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety or depression. Levels of difficulty in each of these areas are reported using a five-point ordinal scale, the combination of which gives each patient a health profile. Although it is recommended that quality of life for liver transplant patients should be measured using both a generic quality of life questionnaire and a disease-specific instrument, a precise and reliable measure of quality of life for liver transplant patients could not be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

Over a 12 month period, an estimated 267 eligible patients will be available for recruitment to the study from the four liver clinics of interest. Annually, approximately 1% of liver transplant patients at UHB undergo a re-transplant and 2% die. Thus, around 21 patients per month will be eligible for recruitment. Audit data collected from one liver clinic in early 2017 suggest that approximately 60% of eligible patients will be willing to participate in the study (13 per month). A previous randomised controlled study of video clinics in diabetes care reported an attrition rate of 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Applying this attrition rate to our patient sample, and allowing for participant withdrawals, missing data and losses to follow-up, the required sample size for the study is 90 per group (<italic>n</italic> = 180 total). Recruiting at a rate of 13 patients per month, we anticipate recruitment to take approximately 14 months in total (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Recruitment rate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2953_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par77">An interim analysis will be undertaken once 25% of the target recruitment sample have completed two appointments. This interim analysis will focus on crossover from the intervention to control groups due to patients being unable to complete their clinical testing locally. The findings from this interim analysis will be discussed with the study’s independent monitoring group as high rates of crossover have implications for the feasibility of the intervention and will reduce study power to detect significant differences between intervention and control arms in the outcomes of interest. The main data analysis will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat basis, although an unblinded per protocol analysis will also be performed for the primary outcome measure to assess whether similar results are obtained with regard to any statistically significant findings. It is acknowledged that younger patients may potentially find the intervention more beneficial due to greater familiarity with technology, so age will be controlled for and a sensitivity analysis will assess whether age has an independent effect on outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par78">The characteristics of study participants at baseline will be summarised descriptively, with comparison of proportions tests used to assess any differences between intervention and control groups on the basis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Analysis of the primary outcome measure (difference between groups in scores in three domains of the VSQ-9) will use independent <italic>t</italic> tests if data are normally distributed. If data are not normally distributed, the Mann–Whitney U test will be used. For patients with missing end-of-study VSQ-9 data, their most recently collected data will be used in the analysis. If participant numbers allow, subgroup analysis will assess patient satisfaction scores adjusting for the level of engagement that intervention patients had with myVideoClinic (i.e. those with 6 months or less of video clinic appointments vs. those with more than 6 months of video clinic appointments).</p>
                <p id="Par79">Secondary outcome measures will be analysed descriptively where the same data have been collected from patients in both study arms (e.g. health service use). Where secondary outcome data are relevant to the intervention group only (e.g. the incidence of technical issues during myVideoClinic appointments), these will be tabulated and basic statistical analyses performed (numbers, percentages, means/medians etc.). Attrition/withdrawal rates and rates of questionnaire completion will be analysed for both study arms and overall. Analysis of HRQoL data will follow the recommendations in the EQ-5D-5 L User Guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Health state valuations will be calculated for each profile based on pre-calculated scoring coefficients. Changes in HRQoL between baseline and study end will be assessed for each patient and both descriptive and comparative analyses will be performed to compare HRQoL between participants in the intervention and control groups.</p>

                  <title>Economic analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par80">A within-trial cost consequences analysis (CCA) will be undertaken. CCA allows consideration of a number of outcome measures alongside costs, rather than a pre-defined single outcome measure, as would be the case in a cost utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years. Base-case analysis will be conducted from the NHS perspective, with additional analyses from the societal perspective. The NHS perspective will include health service resource utilisation in terms of provider costs, commissioner costs (prices) and costs that are sometimes paid for by patients (e.g. travel). Analysis will also include data on NHS resource use for patient appointments (e.g. number of face-to-face appointments, myVideoClinic calls, telephone calls, emails) and costs of clinical tests. The societal perspective will include non-NHS costs, such as patients’ out-of-pocket expenses (e.g. travel costs, car parking, childcare costs), and wider costs such as productivity loss due to absence from work. The CCA will include a sensitivity analysis to model the cost consequences of a number of different scenarios, whereby patients take up different numbers of appointments and different proportions of patients take up myVideoClinic. Including both the NHS and societal perspectives will provide a full picture of how video clinics affect the financial burden on both the NHS and patients and may help to inform the development of new payment currencies for patient management. This is important in terms of the acceptability of myVideoClinic to the provider and commissioners because any move away from traditional face-to-face appointments risks a loss of provider income, unless locally agreed funding arrangements are implemented, which reflect the intervention’s aims to promote more efficient use of resources.</p>

At the initial eligibility screening stage, an eligibility case report form will be completed by the patient’s consultant, which records patient initials, age and sex. Once a patient has given written consent to be involved in the study, a randomisation case report form will be completed by a member of the research team and the participant assigned a unique, anonymised identifier. Members of the research team will have access to patient-identifiable data during the study, but this will only be after participants have given consent. All electronic files will be held at the University of Birmingham on password-protected secure university servers to which only members of the research team will have access. Paper copies of research data or study documentation will be held securely in a locked archive in a locked office in a swipe-card restricted area of the University of Birmingham Institute of Applied Health Research.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par85">The myVideoClinic study is patient centred and has been designed with input from patients, clinicians, researchers and IT staff. It is anticipated that myVideoClinic will utilise technology to improve patient satisfaction with their care. In addition, myVideoClinic could provide cost and time savings for patients, removing the need to travel long distances for outpatient appointments. Findings from this research could be applicable to a wide range of settings that could use video clinics. The embedded qualitative study will allow the views of patients, carers/family members and healthcare professionals on the video clinic to be explored. These findings will allow a more in-depth understanding of how the video clinic was beneficial or how it could be improved for future practice.</p>
