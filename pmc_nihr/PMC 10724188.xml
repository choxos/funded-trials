                <p id="Par1">Bioenergetic failure caused by impaired utilisation of glucose and fatty acids contributes to organ dysfunction across multiple tissues in critical illness. Ketone bodies may form an alternative substrate source, but the feasibility and safety of inducing a ketogenic state in physiologically unstable patients is not known. Twenty-nine mechanically ventilated adults with multi-organ failure managed on intensive care units were randomised (Ketogenic <italic>n</italic> = 14, Control <italic>n</italic> = 15) into a two-centre pilot open-label trial of ketogenic versus standard enteral feeding. The primary endpoints were assessment of feasibility and safety, recruitment and retention rates and achievement of ketosis and glucose control. Ketogenic feeding was feasible, safe, well tolerated and resulted in ketosis in all patients in the intervention group, with a refusal rate of 4.1% and 82.8% retention. Patients who received ketogenic feeding had fewer hypoglycaemic events (0.0% vs. 1.6%), required less exogenous international units of insulin (0 (Interquartile range 0-16) vs.78 (Interquartile range 0-412) but had slightly more daily episodes of diarrhoea (53.5% vs. 42.9%) over the trial period. Ketogenic feeding was feasible and may be an intervention for addressing bioenergetic failure in critically ill patients. Clinical Trials.gov registration: NCT04101071.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Critical illness is a state of ill health with vital organ dysfunction and a high risk of imminent death if care (pharmacological or mechanical) is not provided and has the potential for reversibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The physiological characteristics of critical illness have significant overlap across a wide range of presenting diseases, challenging commonly used disease-related taxonomies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Interventions that target such derangements are therefore likely to impact on a wide range of diseases. Multiple diverse stressors result in a unifying state of altered tissue metabolism and bioenergetics, compounding organ dysfunction and cell death in multiple tissues such as the brain, lung, kidney and skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Specifically, substrate utilisation in the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is impaired in critical illness, with tissue hypoxia and inflammation preventing glucose-derived pyruvate from being converted to acetyl-CoA, as a result of the Pasteur effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Amino acids may be recycled for pyruvate reconstitution in starvation, but such processes (e.g., the Cahill cycle) are affected by tissue hypoxia, inflammation, impaired Glucose Transporter Type 4 (GLUT-4) translocation, exogenous insulin therapy and other hallmarks of critical illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Finally, peripheral mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is downregulated, and the resultant inability to use any of these three substrates efficiently leads to a bioenergetic crisis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Hepatic metabolism of fatty acids can yield ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. Under conditions of physiological stress, these act as substrates for Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) generation in the mitochondria of extra-hepatic tissues. In high intensity exercise, ketogenic diets provide ketone body substrates, improving ATP production, decreasing muscle protein breakdown and improving physical performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> During periods of starvation, brain metabolism relies on ketone bodies instead of fat or glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and ketone bodies may provide up to 50% of total body basal energy, enabling the high-energy requirement of the human brain to be met whilst sparing muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> Ketogenic diets reverse the metabolic defects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Patients with diabetes use ketone bodies for cardiac ATP synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par5">Ketolysis occurs in mitochondria of extra-hepatic tissues, resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA. The rate-determining step is the reconstitution of acetoacetyl-CoA from acetoacetate by the enzyme succinyl CoA-oxoacid transferase, which is not regulated by hypoxia or inflammation, unlike pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Ketone bodies may therefore offer an alternative substrate source for energy production in critically ill patients. In addition, ketones may have other beneficial impacts in critically ill patients: in those with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), beta-hydroxybutyrate metabolically reprogrammes T-cells to improve functionality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par6">One specific physiological consequence of critical illness that may be attenuated by a ketogenic diet is that of muscle wasting. Critically ill patients lose 2–3% of their muscle mass per day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This is associated with increases in length of stay and mortality, and associated physical functional disability may persist for up to 5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Patients, carers and health services are burdened by this physical function disability, which is recognised as a public health issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Muscle wasting and subsequent weakness in these patients has proven resistant to all forms of exercise rehabilitation and increased nutritional delivery of energy and protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This loss of muscle mass appears driven by a decrease in muscle protein synthesis and unchecked muscle protein breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This in turn may be a consequence of bioenergetic failure and a lack of ATP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Muscle protein synthesis is a highly energy-dependent process and is likely to remain depressed until muscle bioenergetics normalise.</p>
              <p id="Par7">However, the feasibility and safety of achieving ketosis in unstable patients in multi-organ failure has yet to be proven. Ketoacidosis might occur if ketones were not metabolised, exacerbating pre-existing systemic and cellular acidosis that carries a mortality risk to critically ill patients. Ketogenic diets minimise exogenous glucose delivery, which might predispose patients to hypoglycaemia, which is harmful to patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Lastly, a ketogenic high lipid feed might increase the risk of vomiting (and therefore pulmonary aspiration), diarrhoea and pancreatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par8">We therefore performed a randomised trial to determine the feasibility and safety of delivering a ketogenic enteral feed in critically ill patients and collecting physical function-specific outcomes. We additionally performed an exploratory analysis of plasma metabolomic profiling to ascertain the presence or absence of a signal for efficacy in altering tissue metabolism, which might warrant further research in a larger trial.</p>

              <p id="Par30">We have demonstrated that inducing sustained ketosis using a ketogenic enteral feeding regimen is safe, well tolerated, and feasible in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure. Although some secondary endpoints could not be collected due to COVID-19 restrictions, recruitment and retention rates were high. Variability in glycaemic control improved, and differences between arms in terms of hypoglycaemia, insulin dosing and glucose variability all point towards a favourable metabolic profile and ketone bodies being used as a substrate preferentially over glucose. In keeping with tissue ketone body metabolism, ketosis was not associated with development of arterial blood acidaemia. Exploratory untargeted metabolomic analyses showed a clear separation of arms at the end of the intervention. Metabolite abundance data suggest that a favourable metabolic profile developed in response to the intervention, within pathways involved in protein homeostasis and urea cycle flux. This hypothesis requires prospective testing in a larger trial.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Prior to this trial, concerns had been raised regarding the safety and feasibility of inducing ketosis in physiologically unstable patients. Ketosis is traditionally associated with pathological states in clinical medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. However, staff and patient education and engagement led to excellent rates of recruitment and retention of patients. Staff questionnaires suggest not only a high level of enthusiasm for the study, but also that this was, in the main, scalable, if a pre-made enteral feed could be sourced, of which several are available commercially.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Support for the study may be in part due to the safety profile observed, with little differences seen in adverse events or tolerability, except for the incidence of diarrhoea. We had not pre-specified the definition of diarrhoea, and several such definitions exist. Diarrhoea is common in critically ill patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and it is not clear whether the high medium chain triglyceride load led to an increased incidence although diarrhoea is a well-known consequence of enteral feeding when there is a high proportion of medium chain triglycerides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Future trials should pre-specify such definitions for monitoring purposes. Recently a number of ketone ester supplements have become commercially available, use of which might not only circumvent the impairment of mitochondrial fat oxidation, the rate limiting process for therapeutic ketosis, and also circumvent fat intolerance. These products may or may not be feasible to use in critically ill patients and require testing.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Octanoic Acid and Decanoic Acid were delivered as part of the intervention, and the increased presence of these in the circulation supports data from recent stable isotope studies that gastrointestinal absorption is not a limiting factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Moderate levels of both medium chain fatty acids and ketone bodies in the participants receiving ketogenic enteral feeding suggest that the pathway of medium chain triglyceride lipolysis, absorption, hepatic ketogenesis and extra-hepatic ketone body utilisation is functionally intact and operative in these patients, supporting the hypothesis that provision of a ketogenic enteral feed to critically ill patients provides an alternative metabolic substrate. Dodecanoic acid is not present in either the ketogenic or standard enteral feeds and its concentrations were no different between arms, acting as a form of internal control. Despite the altered composition of the enteral feed formula, nutritional adequacy was achieved equally across arms. In an exploratory analysis the respiratory quotient (RQ) was lower in the ketogenic enteral feeding arm, adding further data suggestive of ketone metabolism occurring for energy generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The equivalence in pyruvate concentrations despite reduced glycolysis may result from ketone derived acetyl-CoA production leading not only to better ATP production, but also negative feedback on pyruvate influx via pyruvate carboxylase activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Whilst the lower lactate levels see in the intervention arm is an attractive signal of substrate switching, these data are likely the result of baseline variation, and the value of lactate measurements in ketogenic feeding needs to be assessed in a larger cohort. The collection of outcome data was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bedside collection of 24-hour urinary data (and hence nitrogen levels) and reliable muscle ultrasound measurements were not possible due to a combination of infection control requirements, the use of PPE, and staff shortages due to redeployment. Routinely collected physical outcome data were limited to the minimum possible as a result. Acceptability of the study protocol to staff indicated some level of difficulty with collecting the quality-of-life data both retrospectively (pre-ICU admission) and following ICU discharge. This is highly likely to be related to difficulties in communicating with family members due to COVID-19-related suspension of hospital visiting.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Of note, measurement of muscle mass was neither an essential nor recommended outcome measure in the Core Outcome Set for metabolic and nutritional interventions in critically ill patients and would therefore be unlikely to form part of our subsequent efficacy trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Exploratory metabophenotyping demonstrated good metabolic separation between arms following the 10-day intervention. Given the multiple tissue metabolites contributing to plasma metabolite profiles, this separation lends weight to the hypothesis that ketone bodies are being used for substrate metabolism in diverse physiological pathways. Pathways unrelated to metabolism of nutritional lipids were differentially regulated implying tissue metabolism was additionally altered. Alterations in Cahill cycle flux result in a differential metabolite abundance in the alanine pathway, suggesting a decrease in muscle protein breakdown for alanine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This is supported by alterations in Ureidopropionic acid, a urea derivative of beta-alanine and therefore a marker of said flux. Increase urea cycle flux has been previously described in critically ill patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Altered alanine and urea cycle flux have also been seen in healthy subjects in response to ketogenic diets though the relevance of this is unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Alterations in the abundance of Phosphocholine residue have been noted with ketogenic diets in healthy volunteers, and are hypothesised to be related to carnitine metabolism and mitochondrial fatty acid transport, offering further support to the presence of the uptake and metabolism of decanoic (partially carnitine dependent) acid to maintain ATP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Lower phosphocholine abundances which may reflect the dysregulation of beta-oxidation have been both described and linked to mortality in critically ill patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Pentose and glucoronate interconversions suggest a differential regulation of hepatic detoxification potentially related to amino acid breakdown products such as ammonia, and glucoronate abundance differences has been seen previously comparing critically ill trauma patients to healthy volunteers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Ketogenic diets result in altered pentose and glucoronate interconversions in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Lithocholate Glucuronide is a bile acid metabolite, which may be related to ketogenic diet-related early satiety via Glucagon Like Peptide-1 activation, although differential bile salt abundance was not seen relative to controls in observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par36">This study has considerable strengths. First, the very comprehensive prospective data collection gives a high level of confidence in the safety data for future trials, and suggests that such trials are unlikely to require such extensive data collection (thus reducing the data collection burden). Second, the extensive biochemical and metabolomic analysis gives insight into metabolic processes brought into play by the delivery of ketogenic enteral feeding. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was used in an exploratory fashion, to generate potential panels for future targeted work, coupled with targeted ketone and medium chain fatty acid analyses. The advantage of this approach was seen in the identification of panels separate from those that we would have used a priori e.g. energetic intermediate pathways such as TCA Cycle metabolites and NAD Metabolites. In our future trials, additional targeted panels will include those pertaining to urea cycle flux, glucoronate metabolism, carbohydrate and lipid disposal and ketone metabolites. Limitations include the need to focus on safety and feasibility which determined the sample size. Imbalances in the study cohort between arms are likely driven by this (e.g., APACHE score inequality versus SOFA equality). Regardless, all patients recruited were in multi-organ failure, and at risk of both altered substrate utilisation, muscle wasting, and subsequent physical functional impairment. All signals reported relating to efficacy should be viewed as hypothesis generating only as this trial was not powered to detect these endpoints. A further limitation relates to the missing data for some of the physical outcomes – an indication of the strain put on healthcare systems by the COVID-19 pandemic. From a feasibility perspective, future trials would require dedicated time and funding for this, as these data expose the fragility of using routinely collected physical outcome data. A lack of data on functional impacts might be considered a weakness. However, this study was primarily intended to provide feasibility and safety data, while also garnering mechanistic/physiological data upon which to base design of a trial adequately powered to detect impact on meaningful functional outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In conclusion, ketogenic enteral feeding in critically ill patients with multi-organ failure is safe and feasible. Patients who received ketogenic enteral feeding developed a different metabolic profile from controls. The efficacy of this altered metabolic profile in improving patient outcomes requires testing in prospective trials.</p>

A dietitian assessed individual patients’ nutritional needs within 72 hours of randomisation. The Modified Penn State equation or a weight-based equation (e.g., 25 kcal/kg) was used to estimate energy targets. Protein targets were individualised to each patient with a range of 0.83–1.5 g/kg/d being used according to specific clinical need. Patients were considered to have received adequate nutrition if they achieved &gt;80% of their prescribed targets. Ketogenic enteral feeding continued for the duration of the 10-day trial period as tolerated, before reverting to standard enteral feed, as per the clinician responsible for the patient’s care. Patients in the control arm received the site-specific enteral feed as per Trust protocols with an agreed daily energy target to meet their nutritional needs. Multivitamins were administered daily in the ketogenic arm as micronutrients were otherwise not in the modular feed. Intravenous glucose was only to be administered for the emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose levels in both feeding arms were managed according to local protocols. Given that the aim was to generate ketogenesis rather than to test a standardised feed, lipid composition was varied over time as safety and tolerance parameters allowed with medium chain triglycerides making up 40-80% of macronutrients Control participants received micronutrients as part of their standard feed, and participants in the intervention group received Sanatogen A-Z, (Bayer, UK 1 tablet dail<italic>y</italic>).

Metabolites were putatively identified by metID which utilises m/z and MS<sup>2</sup> spectra matching from public metabolomics databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Mapping of metabolites to relevant pathways was performed by over representation analysis (ORA) using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml">www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/home.xhtml</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.

Length of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stays, and hospital discharge destination were collected and noted from medical records.
