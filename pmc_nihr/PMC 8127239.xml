                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Up to three quarters of surgical patients receive inadequate pain relief, with 40% of patients reporting severe pain following knee replacement, which may indicate the current pain relief strategies using opiate-based analgesia cannot achieve patient satisfaction. Liposomal bupivacaine is liposome-encapsulated bupivacaine which has been reported to be effective for up to 72âh. The study of Peri-Articular Anaesthetic for Replacement of the Knee (SPAARK) trial has been designed to assess the effectiveness of peri-articular liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine hydrochloride compared with peri-articular bupivacaine hydrochloride alone in the management of post-operative pain following knee replacement.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The SPAARK trial is a multi-centre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial. The co-primary outcomes are post-operative recovery assessed by global QoR-40 scores at 72âh and cumulative pain VAS score from 6 to 72âh following surgery. Longer-term measures of the co-primary outcomes are collected at 6âweeks and 6 and 12âmonths post randomisation, together with secondary outcomes, i.e. the Oxford Knee Score, and the American Knee Society Score. Cumulative opiate use and fitness for discharge are measured up to 72âh post-surgery. The analysis approaches for the primary and secondary outcomes are described here, as are the descriptive statistics which will be reported. The full SPAARK protocol has already been published.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The co-primary outcomes will be analysed using multivariate linear regression adjusting for stratification factors and other important prognostic variables, including baseline scores in the case of the QoR-40. The adjusted mean difference between the two groups together with 97.5% confidence intervals will be reported for each of the primary outcomes. Other continuous variables will be assessed using the same method. Binary outcomes will be assessed using chi-squared tests.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">The paper provides details of the planned statistical analyses for the SPAARK trial and aims to reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias from prior data knowledge. Any changes or deviations from this statistical analysis plan will be described and justified in the final study report.</p>

              <p id="Par20">Around 100,000 primary knee replacements are performed in the UK each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It has been reported that up to three quarters of surgical patients receive inadequate pain relief, with 40% of patients reporting severe pain following knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Optimising peri-operative pain management through the use of multi-modal analgesia reduces the surgical stress response and permits early rehabilitation whilst optimising recovery benefits for both the patients (reduced morbidity and mortality) and the healthcare system (reduced costs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Current pain relief strategies use opiate-based analgesia; however, these drugs have significant side effects seen in up to 50% of patients. Opioid-sparing techniques have been associated with enhanced patient satisfaction in the acute phase and there is increasing evidence about their longer-term benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">The concept of multi-modal analgesia was introduced two decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Multiple studies report the superiority of multi-modal analgesia over single agent therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Local anaesthetic infiltration is commonly used as part of a multi-modal technique; however, the length of duration of action is a major limiting factor of current local anaesthetic techniques. Liposomal bupivacaine is liposome-encapsulated bupivacaine which has been reported to be effective for up to 72âh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Liposomal bupivacaine is not yet licensed in the UK for any indication, whereas, in the USA, it was licensed by the FDA in October 2011 with evidence of patients discharged on the day of surgery following knee and hip replacement with no reported incidents of increased readmission rates or wound issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A series of randomised controlled trials have investigated the use of liposomal bupivacaine for post-operative pain; however, a recent Cochrane Review has demonstrated no sufficient evidence to support the use of liposomal bupivacaine in the management of post-operative pain following knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">The Study of Peri-Articular Anaesthetic for Replacement of the Knee (SPAARK) trial is a multi-centre, patient-blinded, randomised controlled trial designed to assess the effectiveness of peri-articular liposomal bupivacaine with bupivacaine hydrochloride compared to bupivacaine hydrochloride alone on post-operative recovery (systemic and local) in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. The protocol paper for the SPAARK trial has been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; the aim of this paper is to report in detail the analysis plan as agreed by the trial steering committee in January 2020. This paper has been prepared according to the published guidelines on the content of statistical analysis plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par23">The SPAARK trial is a patient-blinded, multi-centre, active comparator, two-arm, parallel group, randomised, controlled, superiority trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of peri-articular liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine hydrochloride with bupivacaine hydrochloride alone for post-operative recovery after knee replacement surgery. Patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio using stratified randomisation with variable block sizes stratified by study centre and operation type (total knee replacement (TKR) or unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR)).

                  <p id="Par26">The primary objective of improved patient recovery is assessed at two primary endpoints: global QoR-40 scores at 72âh post-surgery and cumulative pain score from 6 to 72âh following surgery. The QoR-40 has been widely used across a range of surgeries including knee replacement to assess the overall post-operative recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is a validated patient reported peri-operative recovery score that incorporates five dimensions of health: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain. Each QoR-40 item is graded on a five-point Likert scale with the total score range from 40 (extremely poor quality of recovery) to 200 (excellent quality of recovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Missing QoR-40 items will be imputed using median imputation based on the other questions in the same domain if 3 or fewer answers are missing. If more than 3 answers are missing, no imputation of the missing answers and the total score will be treated as missing.</p>
                  <p id="Par27">The cumulative pain score is measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Measurements are taken at baseline, 6, 24, 48, and 72âh post-surgery. Cumulative score is calculated as area under the curve (AUC) from 6 to 72âh post-surgery.</p>

The trial will be assessed as providing evidence of a difference if either of the two primary endpoints is statistically and clinically significant.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The study requires 240 patients per treatment arm in order to be 90% powered to detect a 5 point difference in global QoR-40 score between groups at a significance level of 0.025 (2-sided, adjusted for multiplicity) assuming the standard deviation is 15.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To allow for 4% loss to follow-up, this has been inflated to 500 patients (250 per treatment arm). Low loss to follow-up is anticipated for this study since the co-primary outcomes are up to 72âh post-operation.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The study also requires a minimum of 225 patients per treatment arm in order to be 90% powered to detect a standardised difference of 33% between groups in cumulative pain score calculated as area under the curve from 6 to 72âh post-surgery at a significance level of 0.025 (2-sided, adjusted for multiplicity). Inflating the sample size to 500 patients (250 per treatment arm) allows for 10% loss to follow-up on this variable; therefore, we propose to recruit 500 patients in total (250 per treatment arm).</p>

The ITT population will include participants in the group they were randomised to, regardless of treatment actually received. The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which excludes participants with major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations include participants who (i) did not receive the treatment to which they were randomised, (ii) did not provide sufficient follow-up data for analysis, or (iii) did not satisfy the eligibility criteria for the study. The definition of the PP population will be reviewed and finalised during a blinded analysis of the data prior to the primary analysis time-point.</p>
                  <p id="Par37">A significance level of 0.025 will be used and 97.5% confidence intervals will be presented for each of the two primary outcomes. The trial will be considered to have a positive result if either of the dual primary outcomes returns a positive result at the 0.025 significance level. All secondary analyses will be considered as supporting the primary analysis and will be analysed using a significance level of 0.05 with 95% confidence intervals. The primary conclusion of the trial will be based on the results from the primary analysis of the co-primary outcomes. For the co-primary outcomes, a sensitivity analysis will be carried out on a per-protocol basis using the definition of the PP population. Sensitivity analyses for checking the validity of multiple imputation assumptions, if applicable, will be performed.</p>

A summary statistics approach will be used to calculate the AUC of cumulative daily pain scores from 6 to 72âh post-surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Specifically, parameters from a repeated measures mixed effects linear regression model will be used to calculate the pain AUC for each treatment group. The model will include repeated measures of the pain scores (from 6 to 72âh post-surgery) (level 1) nested within participants (level 2) and adjusted for recruitment centre as a random effect (level 3). Time will be treated as categorical and a treatment by time interaction will be included. The model will be adjusted for type of surgery, baseline pain score, age, gender, and the use of pre-operative opiate pain medication as fixed effects. The AUC for each treatment group and associated standard deviation will be calculated. Time will be treated linearly and AUCs will be calculated for the median values of continuous covariates and most common value of categorical covariates. The AUC for each treatment group and associated SD will be calculated following the formula lay out by Bell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and using the lincom command in Stata. Similar methods will be used to calculate the difference between the two groups which will be compared using a <italic>t</italic> test; mean differences with 97.5% confidence intervals will be provided.

The functional score domain composes of four subgroups, including walking and standing, standard activities, advanced activities, and discretionary activities. No imputation will be undertaken for the walking and standing domain. Mean imputation will be used for standard and advanced activities domains. In the discretionary activities domain where participants are asked to select up to 3 activities and rate how much bother their knee gives them during this activity, if a patient indicates less than three activities, two assumptions will be investigated: (i) assume that where a discretionary activity is missing, this does not necessarily mean they could not do any; therefore, mean imputation will be used. If no activities are given, the discretionary activities score will be treated as missing. (ii) Assume that where a discretionary activity is missing, this is because the participant could not do any further discretionary activities, and a score of zero will be given for this activity (worst score). If no activities are given, the discretionary activities score will be treated as zero.</p>
