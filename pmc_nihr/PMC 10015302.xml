                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Is there an association between standardized e-cigarette packaging and interest in trying e-cigarette products among samples of youths and adults in Great Britain?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi230084-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this study comprising 2 surveys conducted among 2469 youths (aged 11-18 years) and 12 046 adults (aged ≥18 years) from Great Britain, youths had higher odds of reporting no interest in trying e-cigarettes in standardized green packaging than e-cigarettes in branded packaging, but adults had lower odds of reporting no interest in trying e-cigarettes in standardized green packaging than e-cigarettes in branded packaging.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>This study suggests that standardized packaging measures may reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes among youths without reducing their appeal among adults.</p>

                  <p>e-Cigarette vaping among youths and adults has increased in Great Britain. The design of e-cigarette packaging may appeal to youths. Regulations that reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to youths may deter adult smokers from trying e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In Great Britain in 2022, 8.3% of adults and 7.0% of youths aged 11 to 17 years reported current vaping.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Vaping products in Great Britain can legally be sold only to those aged 18 years or older.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Vaping can help some smokers to quit smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, there is concern about youths’ use of vaping products, particularly with the recent increase in the use of disposable vaping products among youths younger than 18 years in Great Britain.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>e-Cigarette marketing, including packaging, has been found to influence the appeal of vaping products to youth and adult smokers.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> e-Cigarette packaging varies substantially, with several brands featuring vibrant colors to promote products.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Such marketing techniques are the same as those previously used by tobacco companies; marketing via packaging is particularly prominent in jurisdictions where marketing via other forms, such as mass media, has been restricted.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Standardized (or “plain”) packaging for combustible tobacco cigarettes was introduced in Great Britain in May 2016, requiring cigarettes and rolling tobacco to be manufactured and sold in standardized Pantone 448 C olive-green packs with a matte finish and the brand name in standard font and no brand imagery or logos.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In Great Britain, e-cigarette regulations are less restrictive than tobacco restrictions and do not mandate standardized packaging. However, e-cigarette regulations include restrictions on promotion<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and require packaging to include nicotine content, hazard symbols, and a health warning about nicotine.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Standardized tobacco packaging is effective for reducing the appeal of tobacco cigarettes, particularly among young people.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, there is a lack of evidence on whether standardized e-cigarette packaging would influence the appeal of e-cigarettes and whether this influence would vary between youth and adult populations. This is an important issue in Great Britain, where the public policy position is that adult smokers’ use of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid should be encouraged but use among youths should be discouraged.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Research is therefore needed to evaluate the potential association of standardized packaging of e-cigarettes with interest in trying the product among both youths and adults who do or do not smoke. Using an experimental design, this survey study aimed to examine associations between standardized e-cigarette packaging and e-cigarette product appeal among samples of youths and adults in Great Britain.</p>

For the youth survey, informed consent was provided either by the parents of those aged 11 to 15 years or by individuals aged 16 to 18 years. For the adult survey, informed consent was provided by participants. Ethical approval for the analyses in this study was not required because this study involved secondary analysis of preexisting data, in line with King’s College London policy.

                  <p>The online 2021 ASH Smokefree Great Britain Youth Survey collected data from young people aged 11 to 18 years between March 25 and April 16, 2021. Participants were drawn from an existing online panel maintained by YouGov. Active sampling was used, which dynamically evaluates what surveys are available for a particular panel member based on their personal characteristics, and restrictions are put in place to ensure that only those who are selected from their panel of registered users are allowed to take part in the survey.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
                  <p>The experiment was conducted as part of the online ASH Smokefree Great Britain Youth Survey. A between-individuals experimental design was used to examine perceptions of e-cigarette packs that were digitally altered to remove brand imagery and color (<xref rid="zoi230084f1" ref-type="fig">Figure</xref>). Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 experimental conditions using simple randomization at a ratio of 1:1:1. Within each condition, participants viewed a set of the same 3 brands of e-cigarette starter kits (device and cartridges), 2 of which were pod devices and the third a tank device. The 3 conditions included images of fully branded packaging (control), images of white standardized e-cigarette packaging, and images of green standardized e-cigarette packaging (<xref rid="zoi230084f1" ref-type="fig">Figure</xref>).</p>

                <p>A significantly smaller percentage of youths aged 16 to 18 years reported no interest in trying any of the products compared with youths aged 11 to 15 years. A significantly smaller percentage of youths who currently vaped or had ever vaped reported no interest in trying any of the products compared with youths who had never vaped. The percentage reporting no interest in trying any of the products was higher among youths who had never smoked than those who had ever or were currently smoking; however, these comparisons were not significant (<xref rid="zoi230084t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Because a substantial proportion of youths reported that they did not know which of the displayed vaping products people their age would be interested in trying, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. A multinomial regression model was run in which “Don’t know” was treated as a separate category in the outcome variable. When “Don’t know” was a separate category, youths were more likely to report no interest among people their age in trying products in either green (292 of 815 [35.8%]) or white (264 of 826 [32.0%]) standardized packs compared with branded packs (238 of 828 [28.7%]) (eTable 5 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Youths were also more likely to report that they did not know which product people their age would be most interested in when products were shown in either green (251 of 815 [30.8%]) or white (250 of 826 [30.3%]) standardized packs compared with branded packs (231 of 828 [27.9%]).</p>
                <p>Interactions were explored between vaping status and packaging condition (eFigure 1 and eTable 6 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Contrasts of packaging conditions by vaping status indicated that youths who had never vaped were more likely to report no interest in trying e-cigarette products in green packaging (275 of 699 [39.3%]; AOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.69; <italic>P</italic> = .01) compared with branded packaging (224 of 688 [32.6%]). There were no significant differences when contrasting packaging conditions within ever vapers and current vapers (eTable 6 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Interactions were also explored between smoking status and packaging condition (eFigure 2 and eTable 6 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Contrasts of packaging conditions by smoking status indicated that youths who had never smoked were more likely to report no interest in trying e-cigarette products in green packaging (271 of 676 [40.1%]; AOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.75; <italic>P</italic> = .006) compared with branded packaging (216 of 662 [32.6%]). There were no significant differences when contrasting packaging conditions within ever smokers and current smokers (eTable 6 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>

                <p><xref rid="zoi230084t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the associations between reporting no interest in trying any of the products shown and packaging conditions among adults. There were no significant differences in reporting no interest among adults who were shown products in standardized white packaging (3532 of 4006 [88.2%]; AOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89-1.23; <italic>P</italic> = .59) compared with branded packaging (3526 of 4000 [88.1%]). However, adults were significantly less likely to report no interest in trying products shown in green packaging (3505 of 4040 [86.8%]; AOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73-0.99; <italic>P</italic> = .046) compared with branded packaging (3626 of 4006 [88.1%]). Adults were also significantly less likely to report no interest in trying products in green packaging (3505 of 4040 [86.8%]) compared with products in white packaging (3532 of 4006 [88.2%]; AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95; <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>

                <p>The percentage of adults reporting no interest was higher among all older age groups compared with respondents aged 18 to 29 years and was lower among current vapers than never vapers and ever vapers, and among current smokers and former smokers than never smokers (<xref rid="zoi230084t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>With respect to the sensitivity analyses, when “Don’t know” was included as its own category in multinomial regression, adults were more likely to report no interest in trying products in white packaging compared with branded packaging. Adults were also more likely to report that they did not know which product they were most interested in trying when products were shown in green or white packaging compared with branded packaging (eTable 8 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Interactions were explored within vaping status and packaging condition (eFigure 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>) and within smoking status and packaging condition (eFigure 4 and eTable 8 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in interest in trying any of the products when contrasting packaging conditions by vaping status or by smoking status (eTable 8 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230084-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Findings differed between youths and adults in the associations between e-cigarette packaging and interest in trying e-cigarette products. Compared with fully branded packaging, green standardized e-cigarette packaging with no brand imagery was associated with decreased interest in trying the vaping products shown among youths but not adults. However, there was no significant difference in interest in trying e-cigarettes in white standardized packaging with no brand imagery compared with branded packaging among either youths or adults.</p>
              <p>For youths, our overall findings are consistent with previous studies that found that green standardized packaging of tobacco cigarettes reduces their appeal.<sup><xref rid="zoi230084r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230084r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Compared with branded packaging, white standardized packaging was also associated with lower appeal among youths when sensitivity analyses accounted for “Don’t know” responses. Furthermore, a greater proportion of youths who had never smoked or never vaped perceived no interest among people their age in trying any of the e-cigarette products shown in green standardized packaging compared with the branded packaging condition. Therefore, green standardized packaging may deter the use of e-cigarettes among youths who do not already vape or smoke. However, there were too few ever and current vaping youths and ever and current smoking youths to reliably examine the associations of standardized packaging among these groups.</p>
              <p>Among adults, the level of no interest in trying any of the e-cigarette products shown was similar across branded, green standardized, and white standardized packaging; however, no interest in trying the products was significantly lower among those exposed to green standardized packaging than branded or standardized white packaging, and sensitivity analyses suggested this was due to an increase in “Don’t know” responses for green standardized packaging. Interest by product packaging also did not differ by vaping and smoking status among adults; thus, our research suggests that removing branded elements from packaging would most likely not impact adult smokers’ interest in trying vaping products. Future research should examine the association of standardized packaging with perceptions of vaping, specifically perceptions of vaping as effective smoking cessation.</p>

                <title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
                <p>This study has some limitations. First, there were differences between the youth and adult surveys in the wording of the items assessing outcomes, as well as vaping and smoking status. The ASH Youth Survey measure asked respondents about interest among people their age; therefore, responses did not represent participants’ own interest in trying the products shown, but rather their perception of peer interest. However, the ASH Adult Survey measure asked about respondents’ own interest in trying the products shown, meaning that questions for youths and adults were measuring slightly different concepts. Hence, it was not appropriate to directly test for differences between the youth and adult responses. Second, our samples were limited to Great Britain, so findings cannot be generalized to other countries, particularly those with different regulations on e-cigarette and cigarette packaging.</p>
                <p>This study also has some strengths, including analysis of the associations between standardized e-cigarette packaging and interest. Findings therefore offer valuable and timely evidence that can be used to inform the development of e-cigarette packaging regulations.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The findings of this survey study suggest that reducing brand imagery through standardized e-cigarette packaging is associated with decreased appeal of e-cigarette products among youths, specifically never smokers and never vapers, without reducing its appeal among adult smokers. Overall, our findings lend support for reducing brand imagery on e-cigarette products in Great Britain.</p>
