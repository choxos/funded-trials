                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The first-line recommended treatment for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) is a supervised exercise programme (SEP), which includes a minimum of 2-hours of exercise per week over a 12-week period. However, provision, uptake and adherence rates for these SEP programmes are poor, with time constraints cited as a common participant barrier. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is more time-efficient and therefore has the potential to overcome this barrier. However, evidence is lacking for the role of HIIT in those with IC. This proof-of-concept study aims to consider the safety, feasibility, tolerability and acceptability of a HIIT programme for patients with IC.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This multicentre, single-group, prospective, interventional feasibility study will recruit 40 patients with IC, who will complete 6 weeks of HIIT, 3 times a week. HIIT will involve a supervised programme of 10×1 min high-intensity cycling intervals at 85%–90% peak power output (PPO), interspaced with 10×1 min low intensity intervals at 20%–25% PPO. PPO will be determined from a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and it is intended that patients will achieve ≥85% of maximum heart rate from CPET, by the end of the second HIIT interval. Primary outcome measures are safety (occurrence of adverse events directly related to the study), programme feasibility (including participant eligibility, recruitment and completion rates) and HIIT tolerability (ability to achieve and maintain the required intensity). Secondary outcomes include patient acceptability, walking distance, CPET cardiorespiratory fitness measures and quality of life outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Ethical approval was obtained via a local National Health Service research ethics committee (Bradford Leeds – 18/YH/0112) and recruitment began in August 2019 and will be completed in October 2020. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences and are expected to inform a future pilot randomised controlled trial of HIIT versus usual-care SEPs.</p>

              <p>Symptomatic PAD typically presents as intermittent claudication (IC), defined as a reproducible ambulatory leg pain, in the calf and/or thigh and/or buttocks, caused by an oxygen supply–demand imbalance, relieved by rest.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> As such, IC negatively impacts on walking ability, functional capacity, quality of life (QoL) and daily activities, while also leading to a markedly increased mortality risk.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–11</xref> The recommended treatment strategy for IC is non-invasive and includes pharmacological risk factor management and exercise therapy, via a supervised exercise programme (SEP).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> SEPs should consist of a minimum of 2-hours of exercise per week for a 12-week period, with patients encouraged to exercise to the point of maximal pain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> SEPs are supported by high-quality evidence for their clinical and cost-effectiveness,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> with evidence also suggesting that SEPs are equal to primary stenting for symptomatic improvement, which is maintained for a year after programme completion.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the irrefutable evidence for the benefit of SEPs, just 39% of UK vascular centres provide access to one,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and for those that do, uptake and completion rates are suboptimal. One review demonstrated that only 25% of screened patients are recruited to a programme,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> with time cited as the most common barrier for participation.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Furthermore, the current recommendations for SEPs appear to adopt a ‘one size fits all’ approach which is not based on any objective measure of functional capacity, potentially limiting physiological and symptomatic benefits. One alternative that is both time-efficient and prescribed based on the gold-standard measure of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT, therefore, has the potential to overcome the previously cited programme-related drawbacks of traditional SEP. HIIT has demonstrated similar or superior benefits, when compared with traditionally prescribed exercise, in patients with coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, hypertension, obesity and metabolic syndrome characteristics.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–24</xref> HIIT has been highlighted as a potentially preferred treatment option in those with IC, though the evidence in this population is much more limited.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Initial systematic review evidence has indicated that HIIT has the potential to provide clinical and symptomatic benefits, though there was significant heterogeneity between published studies in terms of HIIT modality, frequency, intensity and duration.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The authors recommended that future appropriately designed studies consider shorter-term and low-volume HIIT programmes for patients with IC.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the aim of this multicentre proof-of-concept study is to consider the safety, tolerability, feasibility and acceptability of a short-term, low-volume HIIT programme in those with IC.</p>

Those who exhibit exercise-induced ischaemia or an abnormal haemodynamic response to volitional exhaustion will be withdrawn from the study and referred back to the vascular consultant/required specialty as appropriate. Given CPET is not part of routine care, all patients will sign informed consent prior to undergoing it. Measurements will be taken before starting the programme (baseline/week 0), immediately after completing the programme (week 6), then 12 weeks later (week 18). A further follow-up will be conducted 4 weeks (week 10) after programme completion at the Hull site only.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>This study will adapt a pragmatic and flexible HIIT protocol, based on a similar protocol currently being investigated in those with coronary artery disease.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Patients will attend three HIIT sessions per week for a period of 6 weeks, totalling 18 sessions. If participants miss sessions, the intervention period can be extended for up to two additional weeks to allow these sessions to be completed. Those not completing 18 sessions over the extended 8-week period will be deemed to have satisfactorily completed the intervention as long as they have undertaken &gt;80% of the HIIT sessions (ie, ≥15 out of 18 sessions). All patients completing the allotted 6–8 weeks for the intervention (regardless of whether they have completed ≥or &lt;15 sessions) will be followed up. Those selecting to discontinue the intervention prematurely will be withdrawn, but the information collected up to their withdrawal will be retained and may still be used.</p>
                <p>The intervention will be performed using a cycle ergometer (Wattbike Trainer, Wattbike, Nottingham, UK), with exercise prescription based on the peak workload achieved during the cycle CPET at baseline. Variations from high to low intensity cycling will be achieved by altering the cycle cadence (rpm). Although walking is often the recommended mode of exercise for those with IC and a treadmill based HIIT programme has been previously considered,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> a cycle was chosen for the current investigation for a number of reasons. First, the use of a treadmill may preclude patients from reaching their prescribed HIIT training zones due to limiting claudication pain. Stationary cycling may also reduce the risk of falls, given the balance limitation often experienced by patients with IC.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, it has been demonstrated that the limiting symptoms during treadmill walking are often experienced in the leg, predominantly the calf, whereas the limiting symptoms during cycling are much more varied.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Finally, it has also been noted that cycle testing is better tolerated than treadmill testing in those with IC, which is important considering that the HIIT training zone requires the patient to exercise intermittently to near-peak exertion levels.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
</p>
                <p>Our HIIT work to rest ratio will be 1:1 (1 min high-intensity work interspaced with 1 min of low-intensity work), with patients completing 10 intervals for an overall exercise session time of 20 min. If required, a titrated introduction to the HIIT programme will be used with fewer exercise intervals being completed in the first 2 weeks. Patients will also be allowed to complete less than 10 intervals for longer than the first 2 weeks if required but will be encouraged to complete 10 as soon as possible thereafter. HIIT workloads will be set at 85%–90% of the peak power output achieved during the baseline CPET. Application of this workload aims to achieve 85%–100% peak heart rate (HRpeak) from CPET by the end of the second interval. Our personal experience with cardiac patients has demonstrated that patients may exceed their HRpeak (from baseline CPET) during HIIT sessions. This is also likely to be the case for those with IC, especially those who are unable to achieve a maximal effort CPET. We will adopt a pragmatic approach to this by allowing it to occur without adjusting workload but will monitor on a case-by-case basis and reduce cycling intensity when it is deemed appropriate. We will also record these occurrences to allow appropriate reporting. All sessions will be preceded and followed by a 10 min warm-up and cool-down as is standard practice for exercise rehabilitation for older adults with chronic disease.</p>

                  <p><bold>Safety</bold> will be assessed by determining the occurrence of any adverse or serious adverse events related to the intervention or study procedures. These events will be recorded in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) decision tree for adverse event reporting and where applicable events will be reported to the sponsor and/or research ethics committee.</p>
                  <p><bold>Feasibility</bold> will be assessed by considering eligibility (<italic>n</italic> = eligible/screened), recruitment (<italic>n</italic> = recruited/eligible) and adherence (<italic>n</italic> = completed/recruited). As such, the number of patients screened, recruited, commencing and completing (either satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily) the HIIT programme will be monitored at each site.</p>
                  <p><bold>Tolerability</bold> will be assessed by considering reasons for withdrawal (ie, if they are related to the intervention) and identifying the number of patients able to reach and maintain the required intensity (ie, ≥85% HRMax by the end of the second interval) for the full 10 intervals. Tolerability will also assess whether patients can complete the full 10 intervals by the end of the second week.</p>

                  <p>Group 1: Patients who are eligible for the study but decide not to participate (non-consenters). The interviews will explore reasons why patients chose not to participate in the study and whether study material could be amended to be more appealing. As these patients have declined participation in the study, they will sign an interview specific consent form.</p>
                  <p>Group 2: Those who agree to participate in, and complete, the exercise programme (completers). The interviews will explore patient’s experiences of the HIIT programme, how acceptable they found it, whether they enjoyed it and whether they would be willing to undertake it again. They will also be asked to provide information related to potential barriers to participation in the programme and study, and any changes they may feel are required.</p>
                  <p>Group 3: Those who agree to participate but discontinued after at least one session (withdrawals). Patients will be asked about their reasons for discontinuation and what, if anything, could have been modified to prevent withdrawal from the study.</p>
                  <p>An interview topic guide with a predetermined set of open questions will be used but the interviews will be flexible to allow the interviewer to ask further probing questions based on patient responses, and for patients to raise issues not explicitly covered by the topic guide. All interviews will be audio recorded using a Dictaphone, transcribed verbatim and anonymised.</p>

For those unable to walk on the treadmill at 2.0 mp/hour the speed will be reduced, but this speed will remain consistent at all follow-up visits to ensure standardisation. Patients will indicate when they begin to feel IC pain, which will be recorded as pain-free walking distance and the patient will continue until the pain is too severe and they need to stop, which will be recorded as maximal walking distance. Patients able to walk for 15 min will be excluded.</p>

                <p>The background patient and public involvement (PPI) work for this study was supported by a grant from the NIHR Research Design Service Yorkshire and the Humber. Consequently, two focus group sessions, each involving five patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IC and experience of undertaking a standard SEP, were conducted which informed the design of this study. In addition, this PPI group is committed to continuous contribution during the research study, with the chair of the PPI group invited to attend all trial steering committee meetings. We also aim to hold 3–4 PPI meetings over the course of the study to aid with addressing potential recruitment or retention issues and aid with dissemination of the study findings.</p>

              <p>On completion, study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international scientific meetings. In addition, with our PPI group, we will disseminate findings to the public, which will include lay summaries to participants and vascular charities such as the Circulation Foundation (Registered Charity Number: 1102769). The expected impact for this study is the development of a new time-efficient exercise programme for patients with IC, which is more acceptable, thus improving uptake and adherence. Should this study support the feasibility of HIIT for patients with IC, we aim to undertake a multicentre, pilot randomised controlled trial comparing HIIT to standard SEPs, which can inform a definitive trial, which has potential to impact on international guidelines.</p>
