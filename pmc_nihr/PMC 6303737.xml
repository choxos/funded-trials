                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Behavioural and mental disorders have become a public health crisis and by 2020 may surpass physical illness as a major cause of disability. Early prevention is key. Two Incredible Years (IY) parent programmes that aim to enhance child well-being and development, IY Infant and IY Toddler, will be delivered and evaluated in a proportionate universal intervention model called Enhancing Social-Emotional Health and Wellbeing in the Early Years (E-SEE) Steps. The main research question is: Does E-SEE Steps enhance child social emotional well-being at 20 months when compared with services as usual?</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>E-SEE Steps will be delivered in community settings by Early Years Children’s Services and/or Public Health staff across local authorities. Parents of children aged 8 weeks or less, identified by health visitors, children’s centre staff or self-referral, are eligible for participation in the trial. The randomisation allocation ratio is 5:1 (intervention to control). All intervention parents will receive an Incredible Years Infant book (universal level), and may be offered the Infant and/or Toddler group-based programme/s—based on parent depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire or child social emotional well-being scores on the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional, Second Edition (ASQ:SE-2). Control group parents will receive services as usual. A process and economic evaluation are included. The primary outcome for the study is social emotional well-being, assessed at 20 months, using the ASQ:SE-2. Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses will be conducted. Clustering and hierarchical effects will be accounted for using linear mixed models.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Behavioural and mental disorders have become a public health crisis and by 2020 may surpass physical illness as a major cause of disability. Early intervention and prevention of mental health and behavioural issues are more effective, and less costly, than late interventions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Child mental health issues are associated with significant costs to the individual and society and are associated with both short-term and long-term negative outcomes (eg, failure to thrive, school difficulties, drug/alcohol problems, juvenile delinquency, aggressive behaviour, adult mental health issues, ineffective relationship building, criminal activity), as well as becoming a young parent with the possibility of intergenerational transmission.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> There are clear benefits to parents, children and their families of reducing the potential for such difficulties to emerge, by improving the home environment, parenting skills, positive parent–child interactions and understanding of child development and safety issues.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5</xref></p>
              <p>Recent UK policy and guidance highlight the importance of improving health and well-being in children, with an emphasis on a whole family approach including fathers and grandparents in an integrated proportionate approach.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance further suggests that the social and emotional well-being of vulnerable young children should be tackled through home visiting, early education and childcare.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Several Cochrane reviews have highlighted the effectiveness of group-based parent programmes to promote child and parent well-being (3 years+),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and a review of programmes for 0–3-year-olds calls for more research with younger age groups.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Investment in evidence-based, early years intervention has the potential for long-term effects which will benefit wider society with attendant long-term cost benefits.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Although there is significant policy interest and increasing research in this area, the evidence gap identified by NICE still exists. For example, the recent ‘Building Blocks’ Trial in England investigated a nurse-led intensive home visitation programme—called the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11—</xref>to evaluate the impact on infant and maternal outcomes up to 24 months after birth. The results showed that the FNP provided no additional short-term benefits with respect to the primary outcomes assessed in the trial.</p>
              <p>The Incredible Years (IY) parent programmes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.incredibleyears.com">www.incredibleyears.com</ext-link>) are manualised parent education and training interventions which include group-based components and parent and facilitator books and materials. IY is informed primarily by social learning theory and designed to enhance the social and emotional well-being of children aged 0–12 years. There is growing evidence of the cost-effectiveness of the IY parent programmes,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> as well as concomitant reductions in health, social and education service utilisation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> The IY Infant (IY-I) and IY Toddler (IY-T) versions, for 0–1 and 1–3-year-olds, respectively, build on decades of development and research evidence of the IY (3 years+) programmes, but have not yet been rigorously evaluated in a UK, targeted, community-based trial. IY has the capacity to be delivered in a proportionate universalism model of varying doses according to need, and this study will be the first to evaluate such an approach in the form of our Enhancing Social-Emotional Health and Wellbeing in the Early Years (E-SEE) Steps model.</p>
              <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>The study comprises two phases including: (1) a pilot trial; and (2) a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
                <p>The pilot phase informed the main trial design and trial procedures including: (1) recruitment; (2) retention; (3) fidelity of intervention delivery; (4) model of delivery; (5) differentiation of outcome; and (6) outcome and cost-effectiveness measures. This protocol relates to the main trial only.</p>
                <p>The main, definitive RCT is designed to: (1) establish the effectiveness of the IY programmes on clinical outcomes; (2) assess cost-effectiveness; and (3) evaluate the processes around service delivery.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the main objectives and key questions of the trial are as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Does E-SEE Steps enhance child social emotional well-being at 20 months of age when compared with services as usual?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is IY, and the proposed delivery model, cost-effective in enhancing child social emotional well-being at 20 months when compared with services as usual?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Can IY can be delivered as a proportionate universalism model, and what are the organisational, or systems-level, barriers and facilitators to delivering in this way, with fidelity?</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The E-SEE Steps model includes two IY programmes—IY-I and IY-T for parents of children aged 0–1 and 1–3 years of age, respectively. Both programmes are delivered in a universal proportionate framework, to match varying parent–infant needs at different time points. All intervention parents will receive an IY-I book (universal level). Intervention parents may then be offered the IY-I (10 weeks, 2 hours/week) and/or IY-T (12 weeks, 2 hours/week) group-based programme—based on a predefined threshold on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and/or the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional, Second Edition (ASQ:SE-2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> depicts the proportionate universal approach of E-SEE Steps.</p>

                <p>Delivery of IY-I and IY-T will take place in local community settings such as children’s centres, with group sizes of up to 10 parents for IY-I and 14 parents for IY-T. Sessions will be delivered by two cofacilitators—a health professional (eg, health visitor, infant mental health practitioner, speech and language therapist) and/or early years children’s services’ (or local authority commissioned) staff (eg, children centre worker or family support worker). Staff will be trained by accredited IY trainers. All intervention participants will have access to services as usual.</p>

                <p>Parents (primary caregivers who have the main parenting responsibility) of children aged 8 weeks or less will be identified by health staff, such as health visitors, or children’s centre staff, or via self-referral. A range of briefing events and information resources will be made available to staff in advance of the identification period. Parent contact details will be forwarded, with consent, to the research team who will arrange a home visit to provide further information on the study and assess eligibility status, and trained researchers will obtain written, informed consent (please see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1 SP2">supplementary files 1 and 2</xref> for the information sheet and consent form). Consenting parents can invite a co-parent who shares parenting responsibilities into the trial, so that we can explore the impact of co-parents on child well-being.

Assuming an SD value of 18 on the ASQ:SE-2 at follow-up 3, the correlation between BL and follow-up 3 scores is 0.26 and between pairs of measurements after BL is 0.40, the design effect of 1.25 for the IY arm, two-sided 5% significance level and 90% power, we would require the study to have retained at follow-up 3441 in IY and 92 in SAU. Allowing for 12% overall attrition, 606 should be randomised with an allocation ratio of 5:1—to ensure sufficient parents (an expected total of 48) are eligible and able to attend IY groups.</p>

                <p>Participants will be informed that their personal data will be pseudonymised and related forms and questionnaires will be identified using a participant study number only. All hard copy data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in accordance with data protection requirements for the retention of research data and study team institutional data management policies. Confidentiality would only be broken if required for safeguarding a vulnerable child or adult, with any action in accordance with the study site policies and procedures.</p>
                <p>The ethical implications of obtaining data that may identify a participant as depressed, having suicidal thoughts and subject to domestic violence or potential child protection issues require appropriate safeguarding procedures to prevent any potential harm. Research site policies also require the reporting of potential child protection issues. Thus, we will implement the following safeguards:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Debriefing procedures</p></list-item><list-item><p>Providing information about sources of treatment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Special provisions for participants reporting severe depression, suicidal thoughts or domestic violence, and potential child protection issues</p></list-item><list-item><p>Procedures for notifying adverse events.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p>The trial will follow appropriate Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and also project-specific SOPs developed collaboratively with participating sites, the research team and the Parent Advisory Committee (PAC). A data management plan details data storage and security standards and procedures.</p>
                <p>Patient and public involvement is expected at all stages of the study. We will have PAC in each study site, comprising parents with similar demographics to the intended participants. PAC will advise and support both the study team and oversight committees about outcome tools, SOPs recruitment, retention and dissemination of results.</p>
                <p>TSC (including a lay member), Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and TMG have oversight of the trial. DMEC is independent and comprises an expert in the parenting field, statistician and health economist. Procedures are in place to notify the trial team about any adverse events identified during the course of the study, which will be reported to the oversight committees and regulatory/funding bodies as required. Sheffield CTRU conduct monitoring of trial conduct in line with an SOP.</p>

Dissemination methods include: a project website; regular newsletters; social media; a parent case-study DVD and infographics; national and international conferences, seminars and workshops; peer-reviewed publications; and other articles of professional interest.
