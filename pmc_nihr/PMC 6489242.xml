                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common source of ill health; 11% of UK adults reported CRS symptoms in a worldwide population study. Guidelines are conflicting regarding whether antibiotics should be included in primary medical management, reflecting the lack of evidence in systematic reviews. Insufficient evidence to inform the role of surgery contributes to a fivefold variation in UK intervention rates. The objective of this trial is to establish the comparative effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) or a prolonged course of antibiotics (clarithromycin) in adult patients with CRS in terms of symptomatic improvement and costs to the National Health Service compared with standard medical care (intranasal medication) at 6 months.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A three-arm parallel-group trial will be conducted with patients who remain symptomatic after receiving appropriate medical therapy (either in primary or secondary care). They will be randomised to receive: (1) intranasal medication plus ESS, (2) intranasal medication plus clarithromycin (250 mg) or (3) intranasal medication plus a placebo. Intranasal medication (current standard medical care) is defined as a spray or drops of intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigations. The primary outcome measure is the SNOT-22 questionnaire, which assesses disease-specific health-related quality of life. The study sample size is 600. Principal analyses will be according to the randomised groups irrespective of compliance. The trial will be conducted in at least 16 secondary or tertiary care centres with an internal pilot at six sites for 6 months.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The potential cardiovascular side effects of macrolide antibiotics have been recently highlighted. The effectiveness of antibiotics will be established through this trial, which may help to reduce unnecessary usage and potential morbidity. If ESS is shown to be clinically effective and cost-effective, the trial may encourage earlier intervention. In contrast, if it is shown to be ineffective, then there should be a significant reduction in surgery rates. The trial results will feed into the other components of the MACRO research programme to establish best practice for the management of adults with CRS and design the ideal patient pathway across primary and secondary care.</p>

                  <title>The problem being addressed</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common source of ill health; 11% of UK adults reported CRS symptoms in a worldwide population study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Symptoms, including nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain, anosmia and sleep disturbance, have a major impact on quality of life (QoL), reportedly greater in several domains of the SF-36 than angina or chronic respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Acute exacerbations, inadequate symptom control and respiratory disease exacerbation are common. Complications are rare but may include visual impairment and intracranial infection. Longitudinal primary-care electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a nationally representative subset of primary-care data across consenting general practices, show that 1% of UK adults receive treatment for CRS from their general practitioner (GP) each year, with a median of four GP visits. They receive multiple medications, with 91% receiving an antibiotic prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Secondary-care electronic health records for 2012/13 from Hospital Episode Statistics, England’s national administrative billing dataset for hospitals, show that approximately 40,000 sinus operations were performed in England and Wales, in addition to an estimated 120,000 outpatient consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A worldwide study demonstrated that one in three CRS patients in primary care have poorly controlled symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The socio-economic cost of CRS is significant, with 57% of patients reporting absenteeism and 28% experiencing associated anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. US businesses report CRS as one of the top 10 illnesses that cause absence from work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Need and rationale for research in this area</title>
                  <p id="Par6">The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS 2012) includes treatment guidelines and a research strategy for CRS, emphasising where limited evidence restricts care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Key elements of this strategy are addressed herein, including the paucity of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for rhinosinusitis. In the UK, there are no specific national treatment guidelines and adherence to EPOS 2012 is variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A recent ENT-UK commissioning guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] acknowledges the lack of high-quality trials and although it does not recommend routine antibiotic use for CRS in primary care, GPs often prescribe repeated courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which may cause resistance. There is growing interest in the immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide antibiotics in treating chronic airway inflammatory disease, with low-dose long-term macrolides being prescribed for their immune response and not primarily as anti-bacterial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Longer-term antibiotic use in secondary care has a low-grade recommendation, reflecting conflicting evidence from two RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], resulting in a call for further trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par7">First-line therapy is often delivered in primary care, and consists of initial treatment with intranasal corticosteroids, short courses of antibiotics or saline rinses. At least one in three CRS patients attending ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinics are considered to have failed this initial treatment, which is known as appropriate medical therapy (AMT), and are considered for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Insufficient evidence to define the role of surgery contributes to a fivefold variation in intervention rates across England, as determined by the clinical commissioning group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The duration of symptoms before surgery varies from under 1 to over 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. If surgery is less effective than AMT, patients may be exposed to unnecessary risks and morbidity. If surgery is more effective, current delays reflect suboptimal patient care. Such uncertainty resulted in the inclusion of ESS in the Database of Treatment Uncertainties (DUETS) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par8">As the EPOS 2012 guidelines recommend AMT prior to surgery, any trial must ensure patients have failed to respond to an adequate attempt at treatment using AMT. Intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, for which there are strong recommendations for use based on high-quality level 1 evidence, should be included in AMT. Guidelines are conflicting regarding whether antibiotics should be included in primary medical management, reflecting the lack of evidence noted above. Our trial uses a pragmatic approach in which eligibility for surgery is based on a shared decision between the principal investigator (PI) and the patient, after initial treatment with AMT, in keeping with current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Past and current research</title>
                  <p id="Par9">Cochrane reviews have recently been completed covering the treatment options being assessed in this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. They support the use of intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigations as standard treatment but express the need for more trials with antibiotics. A systematic review of ESS commissioned by the Human Tissue Authority identified the need for high-quality studies comparing surgery with medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Updated reviews of the literature and trial registries have not identified new studies. One potentially relevant trial reported by DUETS was never started. Two 2014 Cochrane systematic reviews of medical and surgical management concluded that further studies are urgently needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There is little ongoing research that overlaps with the MACRO programme. Two relevant antibiotic trials are currently recruiting. A trial aiming to determine the optimum duration of longer-term antibiotics in patients with CRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] compared the effectiveness of 3 with 6 weeks of azithromycin but did not include a placebo arm. A commercially sponsored study compared azithromycin with a placebo in patients with persistent symptoms after ESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], but for many patients the aim was to avoid primary surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therefore, a trial to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics compared with ESS is essential. Finally, an RCT comparing ESS with topical medical therapy versus topical medical therapy alone for a subgroup with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) is underway in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Importance of the research</title>
                  <p id="Par10">Despite the burden of CRS, UK health-economic evaluations are lacking. An American model demonstrates a high economic burden to patients, health-care systems and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In 2011, CRS cost the US health-care system $8.6 billion with significant direct and indirect costs. Antibiotic resistance is considered one of the most significant threats to patient safety in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Evaluating the effectiveness of antibiotics and promoting appropriate usage is integral to the UK 5-year antimicrobial resistance strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Given the high prevalence of CRS and the variability in prescribing antibiotics, this may represent a public health danger through selective pressure on bacteria and antibiotic resistance. In addition, the potential cardiovascular side effects of macrolide antibiotics have recently been highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The effectiveness of antibiotics must be urgently established to reduce unnecessary use and potential morbidity. International guidelines suggest that patients should receive the ‘maximum medical therapy’, which usually includes nasal (and possibly oral) steroids, antibiotic treatment and regular nasal douching, prior to surgical intervention. However, the use and duration of antibiotic use is very variable. In total, 91% of CRS patients currently receive an antibiotic prescription prior to referral. Recently, some clinical commissioning groups have insisted on a 3-month trial of macrolide antibiotics prior to secondary-care referral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; however, evidence to support this recommendation is lacking.</p>
                  <p id="Par11">There is both wide variation in surgical practice and very high rates of revision surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. There is a risk that patients may undergo surgery and its attendant complications without due reason. In contrast, recent changes to commissioning that restrict access to sinus surgery may deny beneficial treatment to patients. The risk is that limited evidence for effectiveness is assumed to indicate non-effectiveness, leading to the decommissioning of an effective treatment by clinical commissioning groups, with some already deviating widely from NICE commissioning guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is essential to assess rigorously the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgery to enable robust decision-making from patient, health service and societal perspectives. In non-randomised studies, surgery achieves significant improvements in health-related QoL and reductions in ongoing health-care utilisation. Pre- and post-trial health economic modelling will ensure the trial design reflects current pathways. If ESS is clinically effective and cost-effective, the trial may encourage earlier intervention. In contrast, if it is shown to be ineffective, there should be significant reductions in surgery rates.</p>
                  <p id="Par12">The MACRO trial forms part of a larger programme of work, the overarching aims of which are (1) to address the major deficiencies in the evidence base for CRS management, (2) to establish best practice for the management of adults with CRS and (3) to design the ideal patient pathway across primary and secondary care.</p>

Subject to additional funding, it is proposed to continue the trial follow-up for a further 40–60 months after the initial 52 months’ trial duration, to enable the completion of long-term follow-up for all participants who have given their consent (up to 5 years).</p>

Recruiting participants from 17 centres (therefore, with 17 ESS surgeons) is considered a realistic assumption for the following sample size calculations. The sample size is justified based upon achieving at least 80% statistical power at the two-sided 5% significance level. No adjustment for multiple comparisons has been made, as each of the treatment comparisons are distinct. The minimum clinically important difference has been estimated to be about 8.9 points based upon an anchor study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A 10-point difference in SNOT-22 (0.5 standard deviations (SD), Cohen’s effect size assuming an SD of 20) is often considered a medium-sized effect size and an important difference for this type of outcome. A previous study suggests that a larger effect for surgery against an alternative treatment is plausible, as large as 13.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Using target differences of and 8.9 and 10 (and SD of 20) would require and 107 and 90 per group (331 and 270 overall) to achieve 90% statistical power at the two-sided 5% significance level. Offsetting this is the possibility of clustering within the surgical arm, which affects pairwise comparisons involving surgery, and the need to perform a subgroup analysis for CRSwNPs versus CRSsNPs participants. Allowing for clustering (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 and 17 clusters of equal size) in the surgical group would lead to 102 per group (306 overall) for a target difference of 10 points for 90% power. For this trial size and using a target difference of 8.9 but an otherwise identical calculation, there would be 80% power. To enable secondary analyses of treatment interactions by subgroups with or without polyps, the overall sample size was inflated to 600 (after allowing for 10% missing data). This size of study would allow us to detect a difference of 8.9 and 10 (SD of 20) to be detected in all CRS patients with &gt;90% power after adjusting for clustering for the main comparisons involving the ESS group; this is the case even when allowing for the impact of potential variable cluster sizes (cluster size variance of 49). A study of 600 would also likely provide around 50% and 80% power for testing the treatment interaction by subgroup (CRSwNPs versus CRSsNPs) for a target difference of 10 and 13.8, respectively, after allowing for clustering in the surgical arm and an equivalent variation in cluster sizes.</p>

                  <p id="Par129">During the internal recruitment pilot phase, potential trial participants will be invited to take part in an embedded qualitative study (MACRO Conversation Study), which is designed to evaluate and optimise trial recruitment. All potential participants will receive a separate participant study information sheet (PIS) for the MACRO Conversation Study whilst waiting in the outpatient department (prior to being seen in the clinic).</p>

                  <p id="Par130">Posters and flyers will be placed in outpatient departments with information about the MACRO trial. All potential trial participants will be seen in an outpatient clinic by the PI or Co-I and by the RN or RP, where the aforementioned routine screening assessments will be carried out and the MACRO trial will be verbally introduced by the PI or Co-I and RN or RP. The participant will be informed that in addition to the routine screening assessments, a trial-specific ECG scan (to exclude contraindications to clarithromycin) will be undertaken as well as a pregnancy test (urine test) if the potential participant is of childbearing potential. This information will be included in the main trial consent form.</p>
                  <p id="Par131">If interested in the trial, the patient will be provided with a copy of the MACRO PIS to take home and review. The PIS will detail the exact nature of the study, what it will involve for the patient, the implications and constraints of the protocol, the known side effects and any risks involved in taking part. It will be clearly stated that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give a reason for their withdrawal. In this event, the choice of treatment will be decided by the patient and their clinical team.</p>
                  <p id="Par132">The RN or RP should update the screening log and place a MACRO sticker on the notes, to help identify the patient when they return to the clinic. All patients will be given sufficient time (a minimum of 48 h) to consider the trial and to decide if they would like to take part. Screening logs must be kept up-to-date and completed fully at all times. They are sent to the MACRO trial office for a monthly review.</p>
                  <p id="Par133">If the nasal endoscopy and SNOT-22 questionnaire confirm that the patient is a potential MACRO participant but the patient has not received AMT as deemed by the PI or Co-I, the MACRO trial can still be introduced and the participant will be given a copy of the PIS to take home. If, following AMT, symptom control has not been achieved and further treatment is deemed necessary, the patient will be seen in the clinic once more and the MACRO trial discussed in depth.</p>

The participant’s identifiable information will be recorded on the randomisation form and will be uploaded to a separate encrypted database at the University of Oxford.

                  <p id="Par136">Blinding of participants and medical staff will be maintained for the comparison of clarithromycin by using a placebo identical in appearance to the antibiotic, although the MACRO trial office can reveal the treatment allocation in case of clinical need. Participants and medical staff will not be blinded to receiving surgery. At the end of each trial participant’s follow-up period of 6 months, the participant will return to normal NHS care. Those who remain symptomatic at this point will receive further treatment as defined by their ENT clinician, which may include being offered steroids, antibiotics or ESS, depending on which arm of the trial they were in. Patients who were allocated to either the placebo or clarithromycin will not be told of their allocation at the end of their 6-month trial period, except in an emergency.</p>
                  <p id="Par137">If there is a need to treat a patient in an emergency following a serious adverse reaction (SAR), the treating PI or medical doctor can break the code using the randomisation system to see if the patient was on the active drug. Under these exceptional circumstances, the PI or a member of the site team can unblind the participant using the clinical trial unit’s in-house RRAMP system. If unblinding is required for any other reasons apart from an emergency, site staff must submit a request (through RRAMP) and the request will be reviewed. If appropriate, it will be approved by a member of the central MACRO trial office. Where a SAR is not an emergency to treat but is deemed to be a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), then the clinical trial unit will break the code for reporting purposes without necessarily involving the PI. If on breaking the code it is found that the patient was actually taking the placebo, the event will not be classed as a SUSAR.</p>

A summary of the planned analyses is presented here. The primary analysis will be according to the randomised allocation, irrespective of subsequent treatment compliance, and conducted at the two-sided 5% significance level with 95% confidence intervals. No adjustment for multiple comparisons is planned, as the comparisons relate to distinct clinical decisions (use or non-use of an antibiotic and surgery versus medical management of one form). Baseline data and participant flow information will be summarised without a formal analysis. The primary outcome will be analysed using linear regression adjusted for baseline SNOT-22 and also for the presence or not of polyps at baseline. Clustering by surgeon will also be accounted for where relevant using an appropriate method (e.g. the cluster robust option in Stata). Secondary outcomes will be analysed similarly using generalised linear models.</p>

For fatal and life-threatening SUSARs, this will be done no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor or delegate is first made aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information will be reported within 8 calendar days of the initial report. All other SUSARs will be reported within 15 calendar days. PIs will be informed of all SUSARs for the relevant IMP for all studies using the same IMP with the same sponsor, whether or not the event occurred in the current trial. Line listings will be sent to sites every 3 months and any new SUSARs will be discussed at each TMG meeting.</p>

An overdose is defined as three or more tablets of the IMP or placebo in 24 h for 1 day or longer. If an overdose has taken place, the patient will suspend medication for at least 48 h, and resume the previous dose as soon as possible afterwards, at the discretion of the PI. If an AE occurs and it is deemed to be more severe than expected (see recording of adverse events above), the site must complete an AE CRF. If an SAE has not occurred, the patient may continue in the trial.</p>
                    <p id="Par194">If the event satisfies the definition of a SAR, the site must also complete an SAE form and the SAE reporting procedure should be followed. The trials office will notify the sponsor that an overdose associated with a SAE has occurred.</p>

The RN or RP will answer any initial questions about the trial over the phone, and also invite the patient to return to the clinic to discuss their possible participation in the MACRO trial in more depth. The medical notes must record when and what version of the PIS was given to the participant.</p>
                  <p id="Par197">The follow-up outpatient clinic appointment can by conducted by the PI, Co-I, RN or RP.

                  <p id="Par204">A trained RN or RP, the local PI, the Co-I or another appropriately qualified member of the research team will obtain informed consent. The person taking informed consent will be trained on good clinical practice and will be suitably qualified and experienced. They will have been delegated this duty by the chief investigator or PI, which will be recorded on the staff signature and delegation log. The investigator or designee will explain to the patient that they are under no obligation to enter the trial and that they can withdraw at any time during the trial without providing a reason. No clinical trial procedures will be conducted prior to the participant giving consent by signing the informed consent form. Consent will not denote enrolment into the trial.</p>

These will be targeted at both specialist and generalist groups, facilitated by the roles held by the members of our collaboration in relevant professional societies and guideline-producing bodies. However, beyond informal and specialist publications, we also plan to use wider communication channels to allow larger-scale dissemination to the general public. When our public and patient involvement panel has facilitated a patient-friendly and comprehensible summary of the study findings, these will be provided to all study participants by mail and to the wider public via a study website. We will maximise non-professional dissemination through a number of multimedia outlets, including targeted mailshots, press releases to medical and general journalists, health information websites and communications media, evidence-based interest groups, conference presentations, social media, patient interest groups and medical charities, such as Fifth Sense and Asthma UK. We anticipate the results may lead to the production of new guidelines, which will be made available through websites such as those of ENT-UK and the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par209">The MACRO trial is part of the MACRO programme funded by the National Institute of Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research. The overarching programme is run by a programme management group. As listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1, the trial is managed by the TMG with independent oversight from the PSC and the DSMC. Day-to-day trial administration is the responsibility of the trial manager in liaison with the chief investigators. The trial manager is supported by colleagues at SITU, which is part of the clinical trials unit of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, OCTRU (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1). The sites for the trial were selected based on volume of cases and prior engagement of the PIs in the research group at the British Rhinological Society, and also to achieve a mix of teaching hospitals and district general hospitals over a wide geographical area.</p>
              <p id="Par210">The effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment CRS will be established through the trial, which may help to reduce unnecessary usage and potential morbidity. If ESS is shown to be clinically effective and cost-effective, the trial may encourage earlier intervention. In contrast, if it is shown to be ineffective, then there should be a significant reduction in surgery rates. The trial results will feed into the other components of the MACRO research programme to establish best practice for the management of adults with CRS and design the ideal patient pathway across primary and secondary care.</p>
