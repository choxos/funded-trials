                  <p id="Par2">Patients with PsA who were biologic-naÃ¯ve (SPIRIT-P1, NCT01695239) or had prior inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (SPIRIT-P2, NCT02349295) were randomized to receive 80-mg ixekizumab every four weeks after receiving 160-mg ixekizumab at baseline. Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity were evaluated in this post-hoc analysis in three subgroups: (1) ixekizumab monotherapy, (2) ixekizumab and methotrexate (MTX), (3) ixekizumab and any csDMARD (including MTX). Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation for continuous variables and modified non-responder imputation for categorical variables.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Efficacy was similar across the three subgroupsÂ with 59.1%, 67.0%, and 66.1% of ixekizumab-treated patients achieving 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology scale score at week 156. Radiographic progression of structural joint damage (SPIRIT-P1 only) was similarly inhibited across the three subgroups with several outliers. No new safety signals were reported, and 91.0%, 84.1%, and 83.2% in the three subgroups reportedââ¥â1 treatment-emergent adverse event. At week 156, 15.9%, 13.1%, and 11.0% in the three subgroups had antidrug antibodies; most had low titer status.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory, progressive, destructive disease that results in deformities, impaired physical function, and decreased quality of life [<xref rid="CR1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with PsA. bDMARDs are often prescribed in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs); however, there is little evidence to support guidance on when to use biologic monotherapy versus concomitant treatment with csDMARDs. Although no differences in efficacy have been observed between patients treated with biologic drugs with or without methotrexate (MTX), specifically, or any concomitant csDMARD in randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], registry studies have shown that long-term differences in effectiveness via drug survival may be observed with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2015 Treatment Recommendations for Psoriatic Arthritis notes limited data available on combining therapies in PsA and that the use of concomitant MTX with bDMARDs does not appear to improve clinical symptoms beyond bDMARD monotherapy; however, results from registry studies have demonstrated greater drug survival when certain bDMARDs, particularly infliximab, are used with concomitant MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The 2018 American College of Rheumatology(ACR)/National Psoriasis Foundation Guideline for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis recommends bDMARD monotherapy over the use of concomitant MTX, noting that concomitant MTX may be advisable if the patient has severe psoriasis, a partial response to current MTX, or uveitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Concomitant MTX may also be suitable for patients receiving TNFi, particularly infliximab and adalimumab, to lessen immunogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The 2019 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelineâs stance on concomitant MTX aligns with the above recommendations from ACR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite limited and conflicting evidence, MTX is the most common first-line treatment for PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Ixekizumab, a specific inhibitor of the IL-17A cytokine, is approved in adults for the treatment of active PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 24-week studies, ixekizumab demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and with background concomitant csDMARDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similar results were observed in a 52-week SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 study when ixekizumab was used as monotherapy or when added to concomitant MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a head-to-head study of ixekizumab versus adalimumab, ixekizumab had consistent efficacy regardless of concomitant MTX while ADA efficacy numerically increased with concomitant MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The aim of this integrated analysis was to evaluate the long-term clinical efficacy, inhibition of radiographically assessed progression of structural damage, safety, and immunogenicity of ixekizumab through threeÂ years (156Â weeks) in patients with active PsA enrolled in SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 according to concomitant csDMARD received in the following subgroups: (1) ixekizumab monotherapy (no concomitant MTX or other csDMARDs), (2) ixekizumab and MTX, (3) ixekizumab and any csDMARD (including MTX).</p>

In SPIRIT-P1, patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo (data not reported here), adalimumab 40Â mg once every twoÂ weeks (Q2W) (data not reported here), ixekizumab 80Â mg Q2W (data not reported here), or ixekizumab 80Â mg once every fourÂ weeks (Q4W) for 24Â weeks. After week 24, patients receiving ixekizumab remained on their originally assigned dose, and those receiving placebo or adalimumab were re-randomized 1:1 to receive ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W through week 156. In SPIRIT-P2, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo (data not reported here), ixekizumab 80Â mg Q2W (data not reported here), or ixekizumab 80Â mg Q4W for 24Â weeks. In both studies at week 16, patients who failed to meet predefined criteria for change in tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) from baseline were classified as inadequate responders (&lt;â20% improvement from baseline in TJC and SJC) and were administered rescue therapy through week 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Patients who failed to demonstrate aââ¥â20% improvement from baseline in both tender joint and swollen joint counts at week 32 or thereafter were discontinued from the studies. Changes in concomitant medications were not allowed from weeks 0 through 24 with the exception of inadequate responders who were administered rescue therapy or patients who changed medication due to safety reasons; changes were allowed after week 24 through week 156. Additional details on the study designs have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p id="Par8">Patients eligible for SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 were 18Â years of age or older with an established diagnosis of PsA for at least 6Â months, met Classification for Psoriatic Arthritis criteria, had active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, and had active PsA as defined by the presence of at least 3/68 tender and 3/66 swollen joints. bDMARD-naÃ¯ve patients in SPIRIT-P1 were stratified by csDMARD experience into naÃ¯ve, past-use, and current-use groups. Patients in SPIRIT-P2 were bDMARD-experienced, were previously treated withââ¥â1 csDMARD, and had an inadequate response (â¥â12Â weeks on therapy) or intolerance to 1 or 2 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors. Patients must have been on a stable dose of a csDMARD for at least 8Â weeks prior to baseline and were not permitted to use more than 1 csDMARD upon study entry. In SPIRIT-P1, radiographs were taken of both hands and feet at screening and were reviewed centrally (by 2 primary readers and an adjudicator when necessary) for evidence of erosive bony changes. As part of the inclusion criteria, patients were required to have at least 1 PsA-related joint erosion on hand or foot radiographs or a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of at least 6Â mg/L to be enrolled into SPIRIT-P1.</p>
                <p id="Par9">The maximum allowed doses of concomitant csDMARDs were 25Â mg/week for MTX, 400Â mg/day for hydroxychloroquine, 20Â mg/day for leflunomide, and 3Â g/day for sulfasalazine. Simultaneous use of MTX and leflunomide was prohibited for safety reasons. During the double-blind treatment period from weeks 0 to 24, modifying the dose of a concomitant csDMARD and/or the introduction of a new csDMARD was not allowed except for safety reasons or rescue therapy. Lowering or stopping doses of csDMARDs during the double-blind treatment period was allowed if the investigator believed any adverse events or laboratory abnormalities could be attributable to the concomitant csDMARD. During the extension and long-term extension periods from weeks 24 to 52 and weeks 52 to 156, respectively, adjustment of csDMARDs (dose change, introduction, or withdrawal) was allowed, though more than one adjustment of csDMARD at a time within a period of 12Â weeks was discouraged. Any changes in concomitant csDMARDs administered were recorded. Additional patient-related details, including blinding, randomization, and other eligibility criteria, have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par10">The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab Q4W were evaluated in the following subgroups of patients with active PsA according to the concomitant csDMARD they received: (1) ixekizumab monotherapy (no concomitant MTX or other csDMARDs), (2) ixekizumab and MTX, (3) ixekizumab and any csDMARD (MTX, MTX sodium, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, ciclosporin, hydroxychloroquine, orÂ hydroxychloroquine sulfate), through 156Â weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Patients in the ixekizumab and MTX subgroup had uninterrupted MTX use (no more than 14Â days without using MTX) but were allowed to switch MTX medications and doses. Patients in the ixekizumab and any csDMARD group could have taken concomitant MTX; that is, the ixekizumab and MTX subgroup is a subset of the ixekizumab and any csDMARD subgroup.Â Categorical outcomes measured include the proportions of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses; low disease activity (LDA) as indicated by a scoreââ¤â14 on the Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA), which is measured by the sum of patient global and pain visual analogue scales (cm), swollen joint count (SJC) of 66 joints, tender joint count (TJC) of 68 joints, and CRP level (mg/dl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; minimal disease activity (MDA), which is achieved ifÂ â¥â5 of the following 7 criteria are met: TJCââ¤â1, SJCââ¤â1, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)ââ¤â1 or body surface area (BSA)ââ¤â3%, patients assessment of pain visual analogue scale (VAS)ââ¤â15, patientâs global assessment of disease activity VASââ¤â20, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)ââ¤â0.5, tender entheseal pointsââ¤â1; PASI 75/90/100 responses; Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)Â (0) response; and HAQ-DI improvement from baselineââ¥â0.35 response. Continuous outcomes measured included changes from baseline in NAPSI score and the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) mental and physical functioning domains. For patients in SPIRIT-P1, hand and foot radiographs performed at screening and weeks 52, 108, and 156 were used to evaluate radiographic progression over 3Â years. Scoring of radiographs was performed by 2 independent readers, blinded to chronology and clinical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Structural progression in peripheral joints was measured using the Bone Erosion Score (ES), Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, and the van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS), with higher scores indicating greater damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The initial radiographs obtained at screening served as the baseline radiographs for this analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Safety was evaluated using the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (total, mild, moderate, and severe), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, and AEs of special interest, which were prespecified. Immunogenicity was evaluated by assessing the number of patients who were positive for treatment-emergent (TE) ADA. Of these patients, neutralizing antibody (Nab) status was also assessed.</p>

Categorical variables were reported as percentages, and modified non-responder imputation was used to impute missing data. Continuous variables were reported with multiple imputation (MI) used to impute missing data. Radiographic analyses were conducted in patients enrolled in SPIRIT-P1 who received at least 1 dose of the study drug in the long-term extension period starting at week 24. Linear extrapolation was used to impute missing radiographic progression data if patients had baseline and at least one post-baseline value at week 52, 108, or 156. Cumulative probability plots were presented for radiographic progression through 156Â weeks. Safety and immunogenicity were summarized using descriptive statistics. The safety analysis population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and who were initially randomized to ixekizumab Q4W at week 0.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par20">The analyses reported here show that ixekizumab improves signs and symptoms of PsA, including manifestations of psoriasis, and quality of life in patients with active PsA up to 156Â weeks, whether used as monotherapy or with concomitant MTX or other csDMARDs. These results confirm and extend previous 24- and 52-week analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], showing consistent long-term efficacy of ixekizumab with or without concomitant therapy with MTX or other csDMARDs.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We assessed the radiographic progression of structural joint damage by the mean change from baseline to weeks 52, 108, and 156 in ES, JSN, and mTSS. For the majority of patients (~â85%), the changes from baseline were similar across the three treatment groups through 156Â weeks (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Suppl. Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, and Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is important to keep in mind that there were outliers who could have influenced the scores. Three patients receiving ixekizumab monotherapy had outlying ES, JSN, and mTSS scores at 156 weeks compared to the mean; these patients also had higher-than-average ES, JSN, and mTSS scores (all 3 with baseline mTSS scoresâ&gt;â40) as well as TJC and SJC at baseline. Previously described low rates of radiographic progression persisted with up to threeÂ years of ixekizumab treatment regardless of the addition of background MTX or csDMARD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">The overall safety profile presented here is consistent with previously published ixekizumab safety analyses in patients with PsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. All three ixekizumab treatment subgroups had similar safety findings. Similar frequencies of patients in the three subgroups had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Even though this post hoc analysis was not powered to evaluate differences in safety between the groups, numerical differences in frequencies of infections and injection site reactions were present, with patients receiving ixekizumab monotherapy reporting higher rates of these adverse events than those receiving ixekizumab and MTX (only) or ixekizumab and csDMARD (any). Because the concomitant treatment subgroups were not randomized, these differences in frequencies of infections and injection site reactions could be due to bias as those at high risk of infections may stop csDMARD use. Additionally, larger studies may be needed to evaluate the frequencies of these TEAEs in these subgroups of patients.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Immunogenicity against biologics is generally understood to be mitigated by treatment with concomitant immunosuppressants, such as MTX and other csDMARDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; however, concomitant MTX for the sole purpose of preventing or lessening immunogenicity is not currently recommended in psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. While patients receiving ixekizumab monotherapy did have numerically higher ADA compared to those receiving ixekizumab and MTX and ixekizumab and any csDMARD, these differences were very small and not thought to be of clinical consequence. Previous 52-week results from SPIRIT-H2H, a study of ixekizumab versus adalimumab, are consistent with the findings from the present 156-week analysis of bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-experienced patients with PsA enrolled in SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, showing that treatment with ixekizumab demonstrated consistent efficacy with and without concomitant csDMARDs, including MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">This post hoc analysis was limited as it used RCT data and did not address data from patients in the real world. Because this analysis evaluated efficacy and safety through 3Â years, it is potentially biased towards data from patients who remained in the study long term. Subgroup sample sizes were also small. In addition, there were no placebo arms during the long-term extension periods of SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2. Radiographic progression of structural joint damage was only assessed in SPIRIT-P1 (enrolling bDMARD-naÃ¯ve patients) and not in SPIRIT-P2 (enrolling TNFi-experienced patients), restricting the applicability of these results to bDMARD-naÃ¯ve patients only. In addition, radiographic progression of structural joint damage was only assessed to week 24, limiting our ability to confirm the week 52 results from this study. Safety results were limited by small numbers of patients in the treatment groups, which could have impacted the mean scores for the safety assessments. Safety results were also limited by the possibility of bias by indication, as those at high risk of infections may stop csDMARD use.</p>
              <p id="Par25">This analysisâs strengths include a long treatment duration through 156Â weeks as well as the inclusion of data from two clinical trials evaluating both bDMARD-naÃ¯ve and TNFi-experienced patient populations (with the exception of the radiographic progression analyses, which were only performed on data from bDMARD-naÃ¯ve patients). In addition, this analysis evaluated immunogenicity, including detecting the presence or absence of Nab, to ixekizumab treatment with or without concomitant MTX or csDMARDs in the post-baseline period through 156Â weeks.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In conclusion, this post hoc analysis supports that ixekizumab can offer similar efficacy and safety profiles whether it is used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX or other csDMARDs. More dedicated studies are needed to understand the radiographic progression findings. The safety profile for ixekizumab is similar to what has been previously reported with no new safety signals. The proportions of patients who had ADAs and Nab in the post-baseline period through 156Â weeks were small and similar in patients receiving ixekizumab with or without concomitant MTX or csDMARDs. These data suggest that there are no additional clinical or radiographic benefits to concomitant MTX or other csDMARD use in this post hoc analysis, supporting the use of ixekizumab monotherapy.</p>
