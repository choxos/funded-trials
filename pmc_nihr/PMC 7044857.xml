                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Myeloma, a blood cancer originating from plasma cells, is the most common indication for autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Patients with myeloma undergoing autologous SCT (ASCT) experience treatment-related morbidity and reduction in function and well-being for many months post-treatment. Interventions targeting physical functioning delivered prior to and during SCT have shown promising results in mixed haematological populations and may offer a non-pharmacological solution to physically optimising and preparing patients for SCT. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a physiotherapist-led exercise intervention as an integral part of the myeloma ASCT pathway at a UK tertiary centre.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>PERCEPT is a single-site, pilot randomised controlled trial of an exercise intervention embedded within the myeloma ASCT pathway, compared with usual care. The primary study end points will be feasibility measures of study and intervention delivery including recruitment rates, acceptability of intervention, study completion rate and any adverse events. Secondary end points will evaluate differences between the exercise intervention group and the usual care control group in cancer-related fatigue, quality of life, functional capacity (6âmin walk test; handheld dynamometry; a timed sit-to-stand test) and objective and self-reported physical activity. Outcomes will be assessed at four time points, approximately 6â8 weeks prior to SCT, on/around day of SCT, on discharge from SCT hospital admission and 12 weeks post-discharge. The exercise intervention comprises of partly supervised physiotherapist-led aerobic and resistance exercise including behaviour change techniques to promote change in exercise behaviour. The primary outcomes from the trial will be summarised as percentages or mean values with 95% CIs. Group differences for secondary outcomes at each time point will be analysed using appropriate statistical models.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma, is an incurable blood cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow and accounts for 10% of all haematological cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The incidence is approximately 22 cases per 100â000 people in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although incurable, improved understanding of disease mechanisms and advances in treatments means that survival in myeloma is increasing at the fastest rate among all cancer types.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Median-estimated survival time for myeloma has quadrupled over the last four decades and 5-year survival is now around 47%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Myeloma patients are treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) if eligible (based on age and performance status).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Autologous SCT (ASCT) involves harvesting the individualâs own stem cells and re-infusing them after high-dose chemotherapy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> ASCT has been shown in multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to prolong progression-free survival, and in some studies overall survival in myeloma.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 7</xref> In the UK, the total numbers of ASCTs carried out each year have been increasing by 5% each year.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Data from the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplant register shows that myeloma is the most common indication for ASCT in the UK, with 1411 procedures taking place in 2016.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However ASCT has a number of side effects,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> including repeated infections, nausea, anorexia and fatigue and patients can suffer a reduction in their functionality and well-being for 6 to 12 months post-transplantation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There is a need to develop supportive interventions for patients undergoing ASCT aimed at optimising patient fitness before and during ASCT in order to mitigate or minimise the negative effects of treatment on physical and psychological outcomes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Prehabilitation and rehabilitation, targeting physical function and fitness, have been suggested as an integral component of myeloma treatment pathways in guidance for managing the consequences of the disease and its treatment; however, further research is required to better understand the potential impact of prehabilitation/rehabilitation before and after treatment for myeloma.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Given the prevalence of myeloma-related bone destruction in this population, it is also vital to develop and test tailored exercise interventions that are safe and effective at enhancing physical capacity in the presence of disease-related skeletal deformity and pain, common symptoms that limit patients with myeloma being physically active during and after treatment.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>There is emerging evidence that exercise during or after SCT may be beneficial. However, existing studies have generally been small, with methodological limitations, particularly the heterogeneity of the interventions and mixed haematological cancer populations studied.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Two systematic reviews, of 8 and 11 RCTs, respectively, have shown that exercise is safe and feasible for people being treated for different types of blood cancer during hospital admission and that the best results are seen when exercise is introduced before or during treatment, when compared with usual care. The majority of the studies included in these reviews were carried out with patients undergoing allogeneic SCT or mixed samples of both allogeneic SCT and ASCT recipients using varied interventions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> There is acknowledged variation in symptoms and consequences of treatment experienced by patients with different bloods cancers, and between undergoing allogeneic SCT and ASCT.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 18</xref> Studies among allogeneic SCT recipients highlight the intensive nature of the medical intervention and its associated symptom burden and consequences, most notably graft versus host disease (GvHD) and an increased risk of treatment-associated mortality.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In contrast, with autologous transplantation the mortality is considerably lower and there is no risk of GvHD, with its attendant risk of infections and short-term and long-term morbidity.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These variations in clinical features support the need to study rehabilitation interventions in uniform blood cancer patient populations.</p>
              <p>Only two small trials have explored the use of a pre-transplant exercise in a myeloma only population undergoing ASCT, with mixed results.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20â22</xref> In the first study, a feasibility study of 24 participants showed a significant increase in lean muscle mass in the exercise group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The second study of 166 patients reported a decline in aerobic capacity and increased fatigue in both the experimental and control group, with no difference between groups after SCT. This study, reported in two papers, was also testing the effect of prophylactic epotin alfa therapy, a medical product that raises haemoglobin levels, alongside exercise and was therefore not solely assessing the efficacy of the prescribed exercise.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Additional limitations to these studies include provision of an unsupervised home-based exercise intervention and that the control groups were also advised to walk 20âmin/ day,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> which may have diluted the effect size. These studies, however, have demonstrated that it is safe for myeloma patients to exercise while undergoing ASCT.</p>
              <p>Limited published literature exists regarding physical activity (PA) or exercise interventions in patients undergoing SCT originating in the UK. A single-arm pilot study of a physiotherapist-led, tailored, exercise intervention delivered to myeloma survivors post-treatment conducted at the authorsâ centre demonstrated that exercise was associated with improvements in quality of life (QOL), cancer-related fatigue and muscle strength, and it was extremely well received by patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A single-arm study to test feasibility of delivering exercise during ASCT among people with myeloma in a centre in Sheffield has completed recruitment but the results are yet to be published.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>This primary aim of this pilot, single-centre, RCT is to investigate the feasibility of a physiotherapist-led exercise intervention as an integral part of the ASCT pathway for patients with myeloma. It is hypothesised that this intervention, delivered before and during ASCT treatment for myeloma, will be feasible in terms of recruitment rate and willingness of the participants to be randomised, intervention adherence, compliance to the exercise prescription and attrition due to the intervention.</p>
                <p>Primary objectives of the pilot study are to measure eligibility and recruitment rates from potential participants screened on referral to myeloma outpatient clinics for consideration for ASCT; acceptability of the intervention, including adherence to exercise sessions and deviations from exercise protocol; study completion rate and any adverse events.</p>
                <p>Secondary objectives are to collect preliminary data on the intended primary/secondary outcomes of a future fully powered RCT to obtain mean and SD estimates to inform a sample size calculation. These outcomes include: cancer-related fatigue; QOL; levels of PA and sedentary time; functional capacity and muscle strength; hospital length of stay, rates of readmission and health service utilisation and if the trial/exercise intervention is delivered as intended.</p>
                <p>Exploratory objectives are to investigate any effect on immune parameters (including immunoglobulins, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells).</p>

                <p>The intervention will involve a partly supervised exercise intervention, incorporating behaviour change techniques (BCTs), delivered by a physiotherapist and individually tailored to the ability of each participant. The intervention will involve aerobic and resistance exercise during three phases of the ASCT pathway:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Phase 1 (6â8 weeks before hospital admission for ASCT): Participants will receive one exercise session per week, supervised by a physiotherapist, at a UCLH gym. Participants will be requested to complete two further sessions per week independently.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Phase 2 (during hospital admission): Participants will be offered supervised exercise sessions with a physiotherapist in the hospital setting three times per week.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Phase 3 (12 weeks after hospital discharge): Participants will be asked to continue exercising independently three times per week and will receive a weekly phone call from a physiotherapist for support and guidance.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Supervised aerobic exercise will comprise of treadmill walking or stationary cycling. Participants will be encouraged to use walking as their aerobic exercise activity, or a stationary bike or elliptical trainer if they have access to one, for independent exercise sessions. In phase 1, prior to transplant admission, aerobic exercise intensity will be targeted between 60% and 80% of heart rate (HR) reserve (or Karvonen formula), in which target HR = [(max HR â resting HR) Ã % intensity]+restingâHR, where maximum HR=220 â age.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Duration will be started at 15âmin and progressed by 5âmin/week to achieve a minimum of 30âmin by week 3â4. This will be further progressed to 40âmin by week 5. Target HR will be monitored using HR belts and participants will also use a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The participants will be given a scale in their exercise log book, instructed in its use and advised to work to levels of exertion as determined under supervision. Participants will be encouraged to reach the target duration in one bout but in the presence of discomfort or wish to change exercise machine/method then participants will be required to complete the target duration in bouts of 15âmin or more.</p>
                <p>Resistance exercises will be prescribed to target all major muscle groups (depending on individual health and contraindications). Resistance training will be performed using body weight, progressed with weights or using elastic resistance bands of various strengths. These bands will be supplied to participants at the start of the study to allow convenient independent resistance training. Starting resistance and repetitions of the exercises will be informed by a 10-repetition maximum assessment carried out by the physiotherapist during the first session. Individually tailoring and gradual progression in resistance training will be prescribed as deemed appropriate at each exercise session by the physiotherapist according to published principles.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Participants will be provided with exercise log books and asked to record what exercise they do in the books, as well as document how they feel after exercising and any reasons for not carrying out the exercise as prescribed.</p>
                <p>In phase 2, when participants are admitted to hospital for their ASCT, they will be offered supervised exercise with the physiotherapist three times per week in the ambulatory care or hospital ward setting (depending on each participantâs clinical location), which they can decline if they wish to do so. It is anticipated that participants will be symptomatic from the effects of their ASCT, which may include nausea, gastrointestinal complaints and fatigue. They may also experience bleeding and infection as a result of thrombocytopenia and low white cell counts. Therefore the exercise intervention will be highly individualised and tailored according to participantâs capacity to carry out the exercises. Aerobic exercise will be carried out, as able, on a stationary bike in bouts of 10âmin, up to a total duration of 30âmin. HR will be monitored throughout and participants will be guided to exercise at a RPE (determined by RPE scale) they are comfortable with. Any exercise undertaken, declined or not possible due to clinical indication will be recorded by the physiotherapist in the participantsâ log book.</p>
                <p>In phase 3, when the participants have been discharged from hospital they will be advised by the physiotherapist to continue the independent exercise programme, tailored to their fitness on discharge, until they are 12 weeks post-ASCT. During these 12 weeks, they will be contacted once per week via telephone by the physiotherapist to provide support and guidance with continuing to exercise regularly during their recovery and to assist them in progressing their exercise programme. The participants will be encouraged to meet recommended guidance for levels of PA<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and requested to record any exercise undertaken in their log books.</p>
                <p>Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that BCTs from exercise interventions that are associated with improved adherence to exercise by cancer survivors include âgoal setting (behaviour)â, setting âgraded tasksâ, and âinstruction of how to perform behaviourâ<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> practice and self-monitoring and encouraging participants to attempt to generalise exercise behaviours learnt in supervised exercise environments to other, non-supervised contexts.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> According to the BCT Taxonomy v1, strategies to promote adherence to the intervention and promote change in exercise behaviour in the current intervention have been coded.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> See <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for incorporated BCTs and examples of how they have been included in the intervention.

Participants who specifically ask the research team for exercise advice will be signposted to generic PA advice offered for people undergoing cancer treatment on the Macmillan Cancer support website<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> or from the information and support service within UCLH.</p>
                <p>During hospital admission, patients undergoing SCT are routinely screened by a hospital physiotherapist and receive input for any functional or mobility-related deficits that may prevent or delay hospital discharge. All patients within the study who require physiotherapy or occupational therapy during their hospital admission will receive input as indicated. The indication for and details of input required will be obtained from participantsâ hospital records and recorded in the study file for enrolled participants who require additional therapy input. Control group participants will not be asked to monitor their activity or receive log books.</p>

                <title>Outcome assessment</title>
                <p>The primary end points of this pilot study will be study feasibility. A target recruitment rate of &gt;50% of potential participants screened as eligible and approached for this study will be a primary indication of feasibility. Feasibility of delivering the intervention protocol will be assessed by evaluating adherence to the intervention and acceptability of receiving the intervention (including deviations from exercise protocol). Attrition due to the intervention, loss to follow-up and adverse events will also be assessed.</p>
                <p>A number of secondary end points will also evaluate any between group differences and determine intended primary and secondary end points for a fully powered trial. Fatigue will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-F) questionnaire.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> QOL will be measured with two complementary instruments: the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 and myeloma-specific module QLQMY20)<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) scale questionnaire.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The EORTC QLQ C-30 has a focus on physical and functioning dimensions of QOL whereas FACT-BMT can assess impact of treatment and side effects on QOL. Comparison analysis indicates that both instruments should be used together rather than in place of each other when assessing QOL in patients undergoing SCT.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref>
</p>
                <p>Functional capacity will be assessed with a 6âmin walk test (6MWT), handheld dynamometry and a timed sit-to-stand test. PA and sedentary time will be recorded over 5â7 days using an ActivPAL accelerometer (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, UK). Additional measures of self-reported PA behaviour will be captured using the self-complete short form International Physical Activity Questionnaire<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> All these measures will be recorded at baseline and three time points during the ASCT pathway. At the final time point, an adapted Client Service Receipt Inventory questionnaire will be used to assess health and social care usage in the time following hospital discharge.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>

Data on the acceptability of the randomisation through its effect on dropout rates, completion rates of the outcome assessments and reported use and satisfaction with the intervention materials will also be analysed descriptively. Group differences in fatigue, QOL, functional capacity, PA and sedentary time, self-efficacy at each time point will be analysed using linear regression for continuous factors (eg, fatigue) and frequency tables, Ï<sup>2</sup> tests and logistic regression for categorical factors. Gender and age will be included within the models as covariates. Repeated measures analyses (eg, mixed models) will be used to analyse the baseline and follow-up scores of all measures together. Assessments for each outcome will be made to determine whether the data are normally distributed. For outcomes that are not, even after appropriate transformations, non-parametric methods will be used for data analyses at specific time points.</p>

The framework will be revised to ensure that the codes accurately reflect the data and any discrepancies will be resolved via discussion. The final codes will be applied to the data and incorporated into appropriate themes/subthemes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The study described in this protocol will evaluate the feasibility of carrying out an exercise intervention among people with myeloma before, during and after ASCT at a UK centre. There is no standardised or accepted approach to using lead time before SCT to prepare and physically optimise patients and the importance of carrying out research of this kind is particularly pertinent in this population for whom SCT currently offers the best possibility of longer progression-free survival, yet carries the risk of considerable morbidity.</p>
              <p>The strengths of this study include the use of a pragmatic intervention using BCTs and designed to integrate into the existing ASCT treatment pathway at our centre and the use of a partly supervised exercise intervention among myeloma patients preparing for transplant. This study is also the first of its kind in the UK to incorporate a control arm. If the feasibility criteria for trial is met and this single-site, pilot trial is deemed to be successful, it is anticipated to be an easily replicable trial design for future evaluation as a fully powered multicentre trial. Recent guidance for prehabilitation in cancer advocates for a multimodal intervention, comprising of exercise, nutrition and psychological/behaviour change assessment and support.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> There is no nutritional assessment or dietary intervention included in this study which may be considered a limitation of this exercise-focused intervention. It is expected that this pilot study will be acceptable and feasible as an important step in developing the field of exercise prehabilitation and rehabilitation within haematological cancer treatment in the UK. Dissemination of study results is expected in early 2021.</p>
