                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide and most patients present with extensive disease. One-year survival is improving but remains low (37%) despite novel systemic anti-cancer treatments forming the current standard of care. Although new therapies improve survival, most patients have residual disease after treatment, and little is known on how best to manage it. Therefore, residual disease management varies across the UK, with some patients receiving only maintenance systemic anti-cancer treatment while others receive local consolidative treatment (LCT), alongside maintenance systemic anti-cancer treatment. LCT can be a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and/or ablation to remove all remaining cancer within the lung and throughout the body. This is intensive, expensive and impacts quality of life, but we do not know if it results in better survival, nor the extent of impact on quality of life and what the cost might be for healthcare providers. The RAMON study (RAdical Management Of Advanced Non-small cell lung cancer) will evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LCT versus no LCT after first-line systemic treatment for advanced lung cancer.</p>

                  <p>RAMON is a pragmatic open multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial. We aim to recruit 244 patients aged 18 years and over with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer from 40 UK NHS hospitals. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive LCT alongside maintenance treatment, or maintenance treatment alone. LCT will be tailored to each patient’s specific disease sites. Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. The primary outcome is overall survival from randomisation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide and the majority (57%) of patients in the UK present with advanced disease (defined as stage IIIB or IV). One-year survival is improving but remains low at 37%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>A number of phase 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on the prospect of radically (ie, with the intent of improving survival) treating patients with advanced lung cancer and oligometastatic disease (defined as less than five sites<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) at presentation with systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) followed by radiotherapy to all remaining sites, a pathway known as local consolidative treatment (LCT). Two trials reported improvements with radiotherapy as LCT for overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref></p>
              <p>For a minority of patients with oligometastatic disease at presentation, further RCTs are underway evaluating radiotherapy alone as LCT, with the SARON trial (NCT02417662)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> in the UK, and the ROLE (NCT01796288) and CORE (NCT02759783)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> trials internationally. Based on published data, the inclusion criteria are widening from (arbitrarily defined) oligometastatic disease to extensive (polymetastatic) disease at presentation; the SABR-COMET-10 trial (NCT03721341)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> is investigating radiotherapy as LCT for patients with up to 10 sites of disease. However, there are no trials for the majority of patients who present with extensive disease that becomes oligometastatic disease (ie, all residual sites amenable to radical treatment) after SACT (more recently defined as ‘induced’ oligometastatic<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> disease).</p>
              <p>In the UK, LCT is multimodal including radiotherapy, surgery and local ablation, tailored to each patient’s specific disease site. A multimodality approach has the advantage of reducing total radiation dosage. Inclusion of surgery has additional advantages of providing tissue (to evaluate treatment response), refine staging (eg, lymph node status) and may achieve complete cancer clearance in a single episode of care. To date, only one trial has included surgery as an option alongside radiotherapy for LCT.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The trial was stopped early for efficacy after 49 patients had been enrolled.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>LCT is intensive, impacts health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and is expensive but most importantly it is not known if it results in a better outcome for patients. Current trials are not addressing the question of the clinical and cost effectiveness of multimodality LCT in patients with the more common presentation of extensive disease, reduced to LCT eligible disease (defined as all disease sites amenable to radical treatment) after highly efficacious contemporary SACT such as immunotherapy and molecular targeted agents.</p>
              <p>The RAMON study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of multimodality LCT in patients with advanced lung cancer, rendered LCT eligible metastatic disease, after contemporary standard-of-care SACT in comparison to symptom management treatment alone.</p>
              <p>The trial will evaluate the acceptability, effectiveness and cost effectiveness of LCT versus no LCT after first-line systemic treatment for advanced lung cancer. Recruiting centres will be supported with an integrated QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> and patients will be followed up at various time points over a 2-year period.</p>

The PIL and the process of obtaining informed consent will describe the uncertainty about the benefits of LCT versus no LCT in terms of quality and quantity of life. Patient-reported outcomes will be susceptible to bias although we believe that expectations about the alternative care pathways are likely to wane with follow-up.</p>

                <p>For participants randomised into LCT, the treatment duration is the time required to treat each disease site.

Transcripts will be labelled with a study-assigned participant number, edited to ensure anonymity of respondents and stored securely adhering to the University of Bristol’s data storage policies. Where trial related information is documented in the medical records, these records will be identified by a label bearing the name and duration of the trial.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The study hypothesis is that LCT in addition to maintenance SACT improves overall survival by an absolute 20% at 2 years compared with maintenance SACT alone. The minimum clinically important difference, namely an absolute survival improvement of the order of 20% at 2 years, was chosen by the study’s patient and public involvement (PPI) group and agreed by the Trial Management Group (TMG).</p>
                <p>The target sample size of 244 participants, 122 per group, is sufficient to detect an 18% improvement in survival (HR 0.55) with 90% power and a 15% improvement in survival (HR 0.6) with 80% power at 5% statistical significance, both of which are lower than the target 20%. These estimates assume that 2 year survival in patients with advanced lung cancer eligible for immunotherapy is 52%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> They are also consistent with the target effect size of the phase 2 trial reported by Gomez <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The possibility that survival could be worse with LCT was discussed and therefore a two-tailed test was agreed.</p>
                <p>This sample size allows for 5% crossover. Allowance for drop-out has not been included as participant consent will be sought for study centres to determine the survival status for all participants, including any who choose to withdraw from active follow-up, at the end of the study, using summary care records.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses will follow Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines and will be directed by a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Primary analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Analyses will be adjusted for stratification factors (eg, initial SACT and whether solitary brain metastases were treated prior to randomisation) and hospital site where possible.</p>
                <p>Survival and progression-free-survival will be compared using survival methods (eg, Cox regression or restricted mean survival time to 2 years if the hazards are non-proportional). Patient-reported HRQoL (EORCT QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13 and EQ-5D-5L) will be compared using a mixed regression model adjusting for baseline scores. Changes in treatment effect with time will be assessed by adding a time x treatment interaction to the model and comparing models using a likelihood ratio test. For EQ-5D-5L, a score of zero will be imputed after death; for other HRQoL outcomes, death will be accounted for by modelling survival and HRQoL jointly. Model fit will be assessed using standard methods and transformations and/or alternative models will be explored if appropriate. Treatment effects will be reported with 95% CIs. Safety outcomes will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria and will be described by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class and preferred term. The proportion of patients experiencing one or more serious adverse events will be compared using a generalised linear model.</p>
                <p>Three subgroup analyses of the primary outcome are planned: (1) by initial SACT (molecular targeted treatment, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy), (2) by the number of secondary disease sites, and (3) by the location site of residual disease (brain, visceral, bone, other). Subgroups will be compared by adding a treatment × subgroup interaction to the survival model. To account for non-adherence with the intervention, secondary instrumental variable analyses for the primary outcome will be performed.</p>
                <p>Physical and mental health scores collected via the app used in the AQUA lung substudy will be compared with those from the RAMON questionnaire booklet using Bland and Altman plots to estimate limits of agreement. Correlation will be used to compare QLQ-C30 physical functioning and pedometry data collected via the app, and the Kappa statistic will be used to compare agreement between not selecting optional items in the app and reporting zero values in the RAMON questionnaires.</p>
                <p>For the economic evaluation, unit costs will be derived from nationally published sources and attached to resource use data, and the total costs per participant calculated. Responses to the EQ-5D-5L will be assigned valuations according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance at the time of analysis and combined with survival to calculate QALYs gained per participant. Missing resource use and EQ-5D-5L data will be handled using multiple imputation methods.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> From average costs and QALYs associated with each group, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be derived, producing the incremental cost per QALY gained with LCT compared with conventional care. If there are differences in mortality between groups, then costs and outcomes will be extrapolated to a longer time horizon. Results will be expressed in terms of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, which indicates the likelihood that LCT is cost-effective for different levels of willingness to pay for health gain, to help decision-makers assess whether LCT is likely to represent value for money.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Patients have been involved from the inception of the RAMON study. The RAMON funding application was developed in collaboration with the thoracic surgery RESearch cOLlaborative patient and public involVEment group (RESOLVE PPI GROUP) of patients and carers who have undergone surgery for lung cancer, based at Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. The RESOLVE PPI group advised on trial design, recruitment pathway and choice of the primary outcome. They also defined the minimally important difference in survival to support LCT as a treatment and reviewed the plain English summary of the study.</p>
                <p>During the set-up phase of the study, the Bristol Trials Centre Patient Advisory Group (PAG) was consulted to review patient documents as the RESOLVE group did not have a meeting scheduled for a number of months. The PAG gave no major comments and fed back that documents were clear and understandable.</p>
                <p>There is an active PPI coapplicant involved in the study who attended planning meetings and helped to draft the study applications. This coapplicant is also a member of the TMG and is consulted on any changes to patient-facing documents, as well as attending regular meetings with other members of the TMG. The RAMON study TSC also includes PPI member(s).</p>

                <title>Changes to the protocol since REC/HRA approval</title>
                <p>Following REC and HRA initial approvals, the only major change to the protocol was an update to the eligibility criteria to allow inclusion of patients who have received radical treatment to solitary brain metastases as this is standard of care for this patient population. There is no evidence base to justify excluding these patients and it was agreed by the TMG and hospital site teams that exclusion criteria as previously written (lung cancer treatment naïve prior to initial study SACT) did not reflect usual care in UK hospitals; therefore, patients who have received this standard of care treatment should be considered for the study.</p>
                <p>The current approved protocol version is v5.0 (20 September 2023). A full study protocol is available in the <xref rid="SP1 SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>.</p>
