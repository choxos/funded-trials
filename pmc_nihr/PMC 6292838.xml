                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Many health promotion campaigns and interventions focussing on improving health-related behaviours have been based on targeting response efficacy. This is based on the assumption that response efficacy is an important modifiable determinant of behaviour change. This study aimed to quantify the association between response efficacy and objective and subjective measures of physical activity and diet.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A total of 953 participants were assessed for response efficacy at baseline and 12 weeks following randomisation to interventions to increase physical activity and improve diet. Subjective measures were collected via a self-report questionnaire that included two questions used to derive the Cambridge Index of physical activity and questions about daily or weekly fruit and vegetable, whole grain, meat and fish intake, based on the dietary guidelines to lower cardiovascular risk. Objective measures were quantified using accelerometers and plasma carotenoids.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The mean change in response efficacy for physical activity was +0.5 (standard deviation [SD] 2.0) and for diet was +0.5 (SD 2.1).There were no clinically or statistically significant associations between baseline or change in response efficacy and objective and subjective measures of physical activity or objective measures of diet. There was a small statistically significant association between baseline response efficacy and change in self-reported wholegrain consumption, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Response efficacy is not a fundamental determinant of diet and physical activity and should not be the main focus of interventions targeting these behaviours.</p>

              <p id="p0025">Premature morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases are significant public health problems.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Numerous observational studies have demonstrated the extent to which modifiable behavioural risk factors, such as physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet, contribute to the aetiology of many non-communicable diseases,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with dietary risks accounting for 10.8% of all causes of disability-adjusted life years in England and physical activity approximately 3%.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0030">A number of models have been developed to clarify the determinants of health-related behaviours and inform development of interventions. These include the Health Belief Model,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Protection Motivation Theory<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the Extended Parallel Process Model.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> One component common to many of these models is response efficacy: the belief that an intervention or action is effective against a perceived health threat<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or that changing a behavioural risk factor increases or decreases the risk of developing a disease, for example, increasing physical activity or improving diet reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Although response efficacy is only one behavioural construct in determining behaviour, understanding the independent role of response efficacy is important when designing public health interventions. There is a large body of evidence reporting an association between response efficacy and intention to change behaviour.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the findings are more mixed for associations between response efficacy and behaviour change with some studies reporting a positive association,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> while others do not.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Many of these existing studies include small samples of selected populations, such as young women or undergraduate students,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and all use self-report measures of behaviour. To our knowledge, there are no studies that report the association between response efficacy and objective measures of behaviour change.</p>
              <p id="p0035">The Information and Risk Modification (INFORM) trial is a randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of providing phenotypic and genetic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk scores alongside a web-based lifestyle intervention on health-related behaviours, emotional well-being and other CHD-related risk factors.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> In addition to subjective measures of behaviour change, it included objective measures of physical activity and diet. In this study, we aimed to quantify the association between response efficacy and change in response efficacy with change in both objectively and subjectively measured physical activity and diet.</p>

                  <p id="p0075">We measured response efficacy at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks after randomisation) using six questions: three relating to physical activity and three relating to diet. Participants were asked how strongly they agreed with the following statements, ‘If I were to be active at a moderate intensity for at least 30 min per day on at least five days a week, I would reduce my risk of having coronary heart disease’, ‘Being physically active is effective in preventing coronary heart disease’, ‘If I am physically active, I am less likely to have coronary heart disease’, ‘If I were to consume five servings of fruit and vegetables each day, I would reduce my risk of having coronary heart disease’, ‘Eating a healthy diet is effective in preventing coronary heart disease’ and ‘If I eat a healthy diet, I am less likely to have coronary heart disease’. Questions were based on Sanderson et al.'s study, which reported a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and were similar to those used in other published studies measuring response efficacy.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Responses were on a five-point scale: ‘strongly disagree’; ‘disagree’; ‘not sure’; ‘agree’ and ‘strongly agree’. Responses for physical activity and diet were analysed separately. The scores for each of the three questions were combined to make the range of possible scores for physical activity or diet response efficacy 3–15. Change in response efficacy was calculated by subtracting the response efficacy at baseline from response efficacy at follow-up.</p>

                  <p id="p0080">Physical activity was measured over 7 days at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks after randomisation) using the wrist-worn Axivity AX3 3-Axis Logging Accelerometer® posted to participants with accompanying instructions. In total, 183 participants had undergone measurement using this device as part of the INTERVAL trial in which case these data were used as baseline measurements for the INFORM trial. Average accelerations (expressed in relative gravity, milligravity [mg]) were measured over the 7-day observation period. Participants were advised that the accelerometer should be worn throughout the day and night, including during washing and bathing, and they should continue their normal activities. We excluded participants who wore the accelerometer for less than 24 h at baseline or follow-up. Change in physical activity was calculated by subtracting the baseline accelerations from the follow-up accelerations.</p>

Individuals with a sedentary occupation were categorised as inactive if they reported zero hours of activity per week, moderately inactive if they reported up to 3.5-h activity per week, moderately active if they reported &gt;3.5 and ≤ 7 h of activity and active if they reported &gt;7 h of activity; individuals with a standing occupation were categorised as moderately inactive if they reported zero hours of activity per week and moderately active or active if they reported ≤3.5 h or &gt;3.5 and ≤ 7 h of activity, respectively; individuals doing manual work were categorised as moderately active if they reported zero hours of activity and active if they reported any activity and those doing heavy manual work were all categorised as active. For this analysis, these categories were treated as if the distance between categories was equal. The change in self-reported physical activity was calculated by subtracting the Cambridge Index at baseline from follow-up.</p>

Change in the Cambridge Index and change in consumption of fruit and vegetables, whole grain, meat and fish were categorised into three categories: ‘decrease’; ‘no change’ and ‘increase’.

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p id="p0155">It is difficult to directly compare the baseline response efficacy or change in response efficacy found in this study with the published literature as there is no universal method of measurement. Of the studies that had used a similar scale,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> most had mean baseline response efficacy scores higher than in this study (ranging from 4.05 to 4.66 for individual questions), and none reported changes in response efficacy.</p>
                <p id="p0160">The finding in this study of no association between response efficacy or change in response efficacy and subjectively or objectively measured physical activity is contrary to the systematic review by Bui et al. in which response efficacy was positively correlated with self-reported intention and behaviour.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, in that review, the authors only included studies that investigated the association between the components of the Protection Motivation Theory and subjectively measured specific aspects of physical activity, for example strength and balance training, workplace-based activity and vigorous physical activity sessions. This discrepancy may, therefore, be explained by the more general questions used in that study around habitual rather than specific behaviour and the additional use of objective measures that are more robust than the measures of intention. Thirteen of the 18 studies that measured response efficacy and were included in the review by Bui et al. also included selected groups, such as university psychology students or predominantly female study groups.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A further explanation for the limited number of studies reporting no association between response efficacy and behaviour may be publication bias.</p>
                <p id="p0165">We are aware of only one previous study that investigated the association between response efficacy and dietary outcomes.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> That study used self-reported measures of a low-fat diet and path analysis of the Protection Motivation Theory and found positive associations between response efficacy and reported low-fat diet. We did not measure the consumption of low-fat food in our study but instead found a small significant association between response efficacy and reported wholegrain consumption and no associations for other aspects of self-reported diet or carotenoid levels.</p>

              <sec id="sec4.3">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="p0170">The main strengths of this study are the large population size and objective measures used to assess the change in behaviour which minimises the risk of bias and improves precision. The participants in this cohort also had a wider age range and more equal sex distribution compared with previous studies that recruited university students or mainly female participants.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This makes the findings more generalisable to the population. However, the study population was drawn from a convenience sample of blood donors, who are likely to be healthier (owing to the extensive exclusion criteria for donating blood) and potentially more interested in their own health than the general population. Although the levels of physical activity were similar to other population-based studies using the same type of accelerometer,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> the mean levels of serum carotenoids for participants in the INFORM study were slightly higher than those in other studies.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It is, therefore, possible that there may have been a ‘ceiling’ to how much healthier their lifestyle could become, constraining the likelihood of further changes in diet and physical activity during this study. The lack of association between response efficacy and behaviour change may, therefore, be due to a lack of change in physical activity and diet across the whole study cohort.</p>
                <p id="p0175">The use of objective measures of outcomes reduced recall bias and response bias, and the use of accelerometers continuously in a free-living situation increased the number of measurements and reduced the risk of random error. However, not all types of movement can be captured. Carotenoids have a strong correlation with fruit and vegetable intake, so are a good objective measure of these aspects of diet<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> but not, for example, the consumption of whole grains. Our finding of an association with wholegrain consumption could also be the result of multiple hypotheses testing so should be interpreted with caution.</p>
                <p id="p0180">There is also no ‘gold standard’ measurement for the latent variable response, making any measurement scale difficult to validate. However, the questions used in this study have been used previously,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the impact of response bias was minimised by using the same questionnaire at baseline and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="p0185">By focussing on response efficacy alone, we have also only investigated one aspect in a complex system of determinants of behaviour change and cannot exclude an interaction between response efficacy and other behaviour change constructs. Given the lack of evidence in this area on response efficacy alone, however, this study provides an important contribution to the literature on the independent role of response efficacy in changing behaviour.</p>

                <title>Implications for practice, policy and research</title>
                <p id="p0190">There is a growing burden of preventable chronic conditions associated with unhealthy diets and inactivity. The development of effective strategies to influence these behavioural determinants at the individual and collective level is, therefore, a priority for policymakers. We have shown that response efficacy and change in response efficacy alone are not associated with change in behaviour. Consequently, interventions that seek to influence the behaviour solely by targeting response efficacy are unlikely to be effective. Perhaps, instead interventions might target other behaviour change components. For example, there is a substantial body of evidence of associations between self-efficacy and change in behaviour using both subjective and objective measures of behaviour change.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Alternatively, interventions based on frameworks incorporating multiple elements targeting multiple behaviour change techniques, such as the Behaviour Change Wheel developed by Michie et al.,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> may be more effective than those targeting individual variables from specific psychological models. There is also good evidence that habitual behaviours such as diet and physical activity are subject to powerful environmental influence rather than the result of a conscious cognitive decision-making process.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Consequently, there is growing interest in the potential for alterations to the environment, from the size of wine glasses to the introduction of cycle lanes, to positively influence health behaviours. Other collective approaches that have proved effective include taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages in Mexico.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Such population-based approaches to shifting the distribution of behaviours may be effective when used alone, as demonstrated in North Karelia,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> or in conjunction with individual-based approaches, such as in the Västerbotten Intervention Programme that incorporated individual cardiovascular risk assessment and population-wide strategies.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0195">Whether a population or individual-based approach for behaviour change is evaluated, research using sample populations that are due to be targeted by interventions is much needed. In addition, this research should incorporate precise objective measures, which is lacking in the current evidence.</p>
                <p id="p0200">In summary, we have identified no association between response efficacy and change in health behaviours and suggest that targeting response efficacy alone is unlikely to achieve behaviour change.</p>

<funding-source id="gs1">NHS Blood and Transplant</funding-source>, the sponsor of the INTERVAL trial, assisted with the involvement of blood donors in INFORM. The web-based lifestyle intervention for CHD prevention is based on one that was originally developed for the Heart to Health study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hpdp.unc.edu/research/" id="intref0010">http://hpdp.unc.edu/research/</ext-link>projects/heart-to-health/). In addition, some materials were originally developed by Leicester Diabetes Centre (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leicesterdiabetescentre.org.uk/" id="intref0015">http://www.leicesterdiabetescentre.org.uk/</ext-link>). Affymetrix (Santa Clara, US) provided genotyping. The MRC Epidemiology Unit Physical Activity Team provided expertise. UK Biocentre (Stockport, UK) provided laboratory support. Vitas (Oslo, Norway) conducted assays. The authors would like to thank patient and public involvement representatives—Kathryn Lawrence and Chris Girling for reviewing study documents. Finally, they would like to thank to all participants who agreed to take part in qualitative part of INFORM trial.</p>
