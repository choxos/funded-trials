                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Heart failure affects 26 million people globally, approximately 900 thousand people in the UK, and is increasing in incidence. Appropriate management of medicines for heart failure at the time of hospital discharge reduces readmissions, improves quality of life and increases survival. The Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at Transitions (ISCOMAT) trial tests the effectiveness of the Medicines at Transition Intervention (MaTI), which aims to enhance self-care and increase community pharmacy involvement in the medicines management of heart failure patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>ISCOMAT is a parallel-group cluster randomised controlled trial, randomising 42 National Health Service trusts with cardiology wards in England on a 1:1 basis to implement the MaTI or treatment as usual. Around 2100 patients over the age of 18 admitted to hospital with heart failure with at least moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction within the last 5 years, and planned discharge to the geographical area of the cluster will be recruited. The MaTI consists of training for staff, a toolkit for participants, transfer of discharge information to community pharmacies and a medicines reconciliation/review. Treatment as usual is determined by local policy and practices. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure-related hospitalisation at 12 months postregistration obtained from national electronic health records. The key secondary outcome is continued prescription of guideline-indicated therapies at 12 months measured via patient-reported data and Hospital Episode Statistics. The trial contains a parallel mixed-methods process evaluation and an embedded health economics study.</p>

</p>
              <p>Heart failure may be managed through a combination of pharmacological treatments at titrated doses including ACE inhibitors (ACEi), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), mineralocorticoid/aldosterone receptor antagonists (MRA), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors and diuretics as well as implanted devices.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Medicines optimisation reduces hospitalisation, improves quality of life and increases survival rates.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, this requires the coordinated input of several healthcare professionals, following hospitalisation, which may be subject to variation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Medicines management at care transitions is problematic in healthcare systems internationally.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Estimated readmissions rate within 3 months of discharge for patients with heart failure are as high as 50%,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> indicating a need to achieve improvements in the continuity of care at the time of transfer to the community.</p>
              <p>The Medicines at Transitions Intervention (MaTI) was designed to improve the use of prescribed medicines when patients with heart failure are discharged from hospital. It was developed through qualitative research and co-design with patients and healthcare staff.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10</xref> Intervention feasibility was tested in three healthcare areas with 31 participants in northern England in 2017.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Following the feasibility study, the intervention was refined before progressing to the main trial.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Following Medical Research Council guidance for the design and evaluation of complex interventions,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we report the protocol of the Improving the Safety and Continuity Of Medicines management at Transitions (ISCOMAT) trial, a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the MaTI among heart failure patients.</p>

                <p>ISCOMAT is a parallel-group cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to recruit 2100 participants hospitalised with heart failure from 42 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England (approximately 50 participants per site) over a 12-month recruitment period. Clusters are defined as a distinct geographical area and consist of the NHS trust with a cardiology ward(s) and/or a Coronary Care Unit (defined as a ward with nursing staff with specific cardiac nursing expertise) together with associated community pharmacies within the Clinical Commissioning Group boundaries in that geographical area (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Clusters randomised to the intervention were asked to identify key members of the clinical team involved in medicines management (eg, ward nurses, hospital pharmacists, primary care heart failure nurses) to complete intervention training online and in-person. The intervention team aimed to train around 5–7 staff members in each hospital site to enable the site coordinator and nominated staff to brief others about the MaTI. The online training was developed with the Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education (<ext-link xlink:href="www.cppe.ac.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.cppe.ac.uk</ext-link>) to enable staff to gain an understanding of the MaTI. Face-to-face training explained the background to MaTI (importance, purpose, design, outcomes) and went through the supporting materials/guides designed to aid facilitation of delivery. Approximately 1 month was allowed in each cluster for training and embedding the MaTI into routine practice prior to study recruitment commencing. Each cluster identified one member of staff to adopt the ‘site coordinator’ role, responsible for ensuring the intervention was implemented according to the guidance and training provided. The number and role of hospital staff trained in each cluster was dependent on the structure of cardiology/pharmacy services and available staff. After 3–4 weeks, further follow-up visits were arranged to ensure adherence to the protocol.</p>
                <p>Staff delivery of the intervention on an individual level was communicated to intervention team regularly to support ongoing implementation of the intervention. Additional support and training were available when required.</p>

                <p>A complier average causal effect analysis approach to estimate the treatment effect for the primary outcome among compliant clusters will be considered depending on levels of adherence to the intervention as intended. Definitions of adherence and predefined thresholds will be outlined in the SAP and made without reference to the effectiveness data.</p>
                <p>No formal interim analyses were planned. Blinded interim reports were presented to the TSC containing descriptive information. This included data on recruitment, follow-up, adherence, safety and data quality. These were presented by randomised arm if specifically requested as such, with treatments masked. As participants were recruited following cluster randomisation, monitoring of baseline characteristics by arm are presented to assess postrandomisation selection bias. A single final analysis is planned when all follow-up data has been entered onto trial database, and the database is cleaned and locked.</p>
                <p>In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the primary outcome is quality-adjusted life-years compared with costs from an NHS and PSS perspective. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will look at the incremental cost per all-cause deaths prevented and re-hospitalisation prevented. Resource use associated with ‘TAU’ and the intervention will be collected through the health resource use questionnaire administered to patients. Prescription and hospitalisation data will be collected from the data linkage outputs and supported where necessary by the patient health resource use questionnaire at 3 and 12 months. Unit costs for health service resources will be obtained from national sources (eg, Personal Social Services Research Unit British National Formulary for medicines). The intervention cost will include any enhancement of existing medicines management components and any ‘new’ components of the MaTI (eg, the staff training module or necessary enhancements to existing community pharmacy medicines services). We will assess uncertainty using a within trial probabilistic sensitivity analysis undertaken using Monte Carlo simulation with results presented as incremental cost-effectiveness rations and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p>

                <p>Sites had been brought on gradually in waves across a 2-year site setup period. Sites also closed at various points throughout this period due to reaching or exceeding site-specific targets sample sizes or due to changes in capacity to deliver the intervention. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had needed to extend recruitment for a minimum of 1 year in order to try and achieve target sample size. A full report on the recruitment rate and generalisability of results will be available in the trial results paper that will be published on completion of trial analysis.</p>
                <p>The COVID-19 adversely affected routine NHS services, and there was a decline in admissions with cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Following national NIHR guidance, sponsor decision and TSC review, the ISCOMAT trial was paused in March 2020 and formally closed to recruitment in July 2020. Uncertainty about the post-COVID landscape raised concerns for intervention relevance and deliverability, future research capacity and participant willingness to be involved in research, number of admissions and organisation of heart failure services in sites, plus external policy changes, such as MURs. Additional concerns included the effect of site withdrawals following a restart on the trial design and increased post-COVID death rates on our findings. The decision to close the trial was supported by statistical review that concluded that closing recruitment would not have a significant impact on the statistical power or analysis of the primary and key secondary outcomes, given on the proportion of the target sample size recruited to date. Furthermore, this design maximising routine data sources helped to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on trial analysis plans.</p>
