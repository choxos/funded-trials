                <p id="Par1">Samuraciclib is a selective oral CDK7-inhibitor. A multi-modular, open-label Phase I study to evaluate safety and tolerability of samuraciclib in patients with advanced malignancies was designed (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03363893). Here we report results from dose escalation and 2 expansion cohorts: Module 1A dose escalation with paired biopsy cohort in advanced solid tumor patients, Module 1B-1 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) monotherapy expansion, and Module 2A fulvestrant combination in HR+/HER2âˆ’ breast cancer patients post-CDK4/6-inhibitor. Core study primary endpoints are safety and tolerability, and secondary endpoints are pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) activity, and anti-tumor activity. Common adverse events are low grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Maximum tolerated dose isÂ 360â€‰mg once daily. PK demonstrates dose proportionality (120 mg-480 mg), a half-life of approximately 75â€‰hours, and no fulvestrant interaction. In dose escalation, one partial response (PR) is identified with disease control rate of 53% (19/36) and reduction of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, a substrate of CDK7, in circulating lymphocytes and tumor tissue. In TNBC expansion, one PR (duration 337 days) and clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks (CBR) of 20.0% (4/20)Â is achieved. In combination with fulvestrant, 3 patients achieve PR with CBR 36.0% (9/25); in patients without detectable TP53-mutation CBR is 47.4% (9/19). In this study, samuraciclib exhibits tolerable safetyÂ and PK is supportive of once-daily oral administration. Clinical activity in TNBC and HR+/HER2-breast cancer post-CDK4/6-inhibitor settings warrants further evaluation.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are rational targets for cancer therapy due to their important roles in cell division and transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. CDK7 plays a key role in regulation of the cell cycle as the CDK activating kinase (CAK) responsible for phosphorylating cell cycle CDKs, which promotes association with their cognate cyclin and/or enhances kinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. CDK7 is also required for transcriptional control by (1) initiating transcription initiation by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II and (2) regulating enhancer activities by phosphorylating many transcription factors such as nuclear hormone receptor, including estrogen and androgen receptors, leading to their activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, in breast and prostate cancer and is implicated in resistance to endocrine therapies. CDK7 is over-expressed in several cancers and its expression is associated with poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of many cancers to selective inhibitors of CDK7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Samuraciclib (ICEC0942; CT7001) is a potent small molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive inhibitor of CDK7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Pre-clinical studies have shown that CDK7 inhibitors, including samuraciclib, are effective in both hormone receptor positive (HR+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In HR+ breast cancer, samuraciclib is effective both alone, and when combined with hormonal therapy, in breast cancer models, and that CDK7 inhibition would be effective even after resistance develops to CDK4/6 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, in HR+ breast cancer, preclinical data indicate that CDK7 inhibition activates the p53 pathway in TP53 WT cancer cell lines, inducing apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In TNBC, several studies have confirmed the initial observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> of sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> with encouraging activity with samuraciclib observed in vivo, including in patient-derived xenograft models of TNBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with samuraciclib showed good oral bioavailability in mice, rats and dogs.</p>
              <p id="Par5">This modular Phase I study was designed to establish the optimal dose of samuraciclib when used as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer treatments. The results from dose escalation and 2 expansion cohorts in breast cancer are presented here. Module 1A was a first-in-human dose escalation study to assess initial safety, tolerability and the PK profile of samuraciclib and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Module 1 Part B, Part 1 in TNBC (Module 1B-1), was designed to refine the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic profiles of samuraciclib monotherapy (360â€‰mg once daily [OD]) in patients who had received prior systemic therapy for advanced TNBC. Module 2A explored the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of 2 dose levels of samuraciclib (240â€‰mg OD and 360â€‰mg OD) in combination with fulvestrant in HR+/HER2âˆ’ advanced breast cancer patients who had previously received CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In this work, samuraciclib has an acceptable safety profile and initial evidence of efficacy is demonstrated as a selective inhibitor of CDK7. Samuraciclib has the potential to address the significant medical need of patients whose disease has progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and will be investigated further in future studies.</p>

                <p id="Par15">In the dose escalation phase of Module 1A, the severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) increased with dose (Supplementary TablesÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In Module 1A, discontinuations were most frequent in the highest (non-tolerated) dose cohort of 480â€‰mg OD. At the monotherapy doses considered clinically active (240â€‰mg OD and 360â€‰mg OD), only 4% (1/24) discontinued treatment due to a related AE (nausea). In Module 1B-1, 1/23 (4.3%) discontinued samuraciclib due to 2 related AEs of diarrhea and recurrent nausea (both Grade 1). In combination with fulvestrant, 7/31 patients (23%) across both dose levels discontinued due to related gastrointestinal AEs (all Grade 2 or 3) and 5 discontinued due to unrelated AEs (1 each of COVID infection [Grade 4], brain metastases [Grade 3], diaphragmatic hernia [Grade 3], anxiety [Grade 3] and hypercalcemia from bone metastases [Grade 2]). The discontinuations were similar in the 2 dose groups.</p>

None of the deaths were considered related to samuraciclib treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) (not including deaths) were reported in 27 patients, with 6 considered related to study treatment (2 diarrhea [1 at 180â€‰mg BID dose and 1 at 240â€‰mg OD dose], 1 thrombocytopenia [180â€‰mg BID dose], 1 liver injury in a patient with documented liver metastases [240â€‰mg OD dose], and 1 esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease [180â€‰mg BID dose] and one patient with 4 events - anemia, diarrhea, dyspnea at rest, and thrombocytopenia [360â€‰mg OD dose]).

                <p id="Par17">One observation from hematological analysis in Module 1A was a reduction in platelet counts during therapy, with an approximate 20% drop in platelet counts being seen. This appeared over the first 15 days on study and then plateaued for the duration of treatment (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). In the majority of patients, platelet counts remained within the normal range, were not associated with bleeding events, and resolved when treatment ended. Thrombocytopenia was reported as Grade â‰¥3 in 2 patients. One patient, receiving samuraciclib 180â€‰mg BID, experienced a Grade 4 event that required transfusion with 1 unit of platelets. The patient had a pre-existing Grade 1 thrombocytopenia prior to dosing. A second patient receiving samuraciclib 360â€‰mg OD experienced Grade 3 thrombocytopenia. For both patients the events were resolving to Grade 1 by 11 days and 23 days, respectively, after samuraciclib dosing ended.

              <p id="Par27">The results from both modules demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and evidence of clinical activity for samuraciclib in a variety of advanced solid malignancies, in particular patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC and HR+/HER2âˆ’ breast cancer. Common drug-related AEs were gastrointestinal events (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), a profile similar to reports in conference abstract form for another CDK7 inhibitor in clinical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Gastrointestinal effects were generally low grade, reversible and ameliorated by standard anti-nausea and anti-diarrhea therapies. Future studies will monitor the gastrointestinal profile and will investigate the benefits of routine anti-emetic prophylaxis. In the longer term, a switch from the current dosing formulation of multiple instant-release capsules to a single tablet formulation is planned, a change anticipated to further enhance tolerability.</p>

A mild drop in platelets was seen across the cohorts and is likely to be an on-target consequence of CDK7 inhibition given that increased activity of CDK7 in megakaryocytes has been associated with their maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Neither neutropenia nor alopecia were observed even at the highest dose of samuraciclib.</p>
              <p id="Par29">PK analysis showed that samuraciclib is orally available, with exposure being dose-proportional and time independent. The relatively long half-life supports OD dosing. No clinical PK interactions have been found to date.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In Module 1A, initial evidence of anti-tumor activity was demonstrated by a DCR of 52.8%, predominantly consisting of SD across a range of cancer types, with a notable benefit seen in CRPC. CRPC was predicted to be sensitive to samuraciclib due, potentially, to activation of androgen receptors by CDK7, which has been shown to occur in preclinical studies, in an analogous fashion to the reduction of estrogen receptor (ER) activity by CDK7 inhibitors in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Previous pre-clinical studies using THZ1 (which inhibits CDK12 and CDK13 as well as CDK7) have predicted benefit in other cancer types in which enhanced transcription is a major feature of the cancer phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, giving scope for samuraciclib use in a wide range of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In the Module 1B-1 TNBC expansion, evidence of anti-tumor activity was demonstrated by a CBR of 20.0%, including 1 PR. Previous preclinical studies have suggested that enriching the TNBC patient population for SOX9, which interacts with FOXC1 to activate MYC may result in an improved DCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Other studies have shown a potential role for combining CDK7 inhibition with BH3 mimetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and inhibitors of TGFbeta/Activin which is responsible for up-regulating ABCG2 and potentially ABCB1 transporter, responsible for resistance to CDK7 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although treatment of TNBC has recently improved with the introduction of PARP inhibitors and immunomodulators, these treatments are only temporarily effective and there may be a role for combining inhibitors of transcription such as CDK7 inhibitors by analogy with the suggested combinations of PARP inhibitors with CDK12 inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. It is possible that, since we rarely encountered hematological adverse effects, samuraciclib could be added to cytotoxic chemotherapy or other treatments for TNBC in the future.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) such as fulvestrant have limited activity after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors when given as a single agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The results from Module 2A suggest the combination of fulvestrant with samuraciclib may provide clinically meaningful activity, with a median PFS of 3.7 months in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, double that expected for fulvestrant alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In a pre-planned exploratory analysis, PFS was 7.4 months in univariate analysis in patients with no TP53 mutation detected in ctDNA at baseline. Previous studies have shown that approximately 70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer do not have TP53 mutations disclosed by ctDNA analysis. The impact of lack of TP53 mutation on PFS in Module 2A was greater than that observed previously for fulvestrant alone or in combination with palbociclib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which argues against this being a purely prognostic finding and supports an interaction between samuraciclib treatment and TP53 status. Indeed, non-clinical data with BS181, an analog of samuraciclib, indicated that its activity was in part dependent on TP53 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Our ongoing work indicates that CDK7 inhibition can enhance the transcriptional activity of TP53, as measured by TP53 regulated gene expression, and that this is particularly evident in HR+ breast cancer cell lines. Consequently, the predictive potential of TP53 status for samuraciclib in combination with SERD therapy will be prospectively evaluated in multivariate analyses in the future. The potential benefit in patients with absence of liver metastases at the time of progression on CDK4/6i inhibitor therapy will also be evaluated prospectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. No significant relationship between ESR1 mutations in ctDNA and response to samuraciclib was seen, therefore ESR1 mutation-positive patients could also potentially benefit from samuraciclib therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par33">If TP53 status is borne out to be a predictive biomarker in future trials, the potential to achieve this magnitude of benefit is important due to the paucity of effective targeted treatments after resistance to endocrine therapy plus CDK4/6 inhibition. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus regarding standard of care for the treatment of women with advanced HR+/HER2âˆ’ breast cancer whose disease progresses on CDK4/6 inhibition. While patients are frequently switched to cytotoxic agents such as paclitaxel and capecitabine, if combination endocrine treatment is continued options include the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib. A non-randomized retrospective study of everolimus reported a median duration of treatment of 3.6 months, plus tolerability issues such as stomatitis and pneumonitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Alpelisib is limited to patients with a PIK3CA mutation (approximately 40% of patients) and in a single arm post CDK4/6 inhibitor cohort achieved a median PFS of 7.3 months, but many patients need anti-diabetic medication due to hyperglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The potential benefit of combined fulvestrant and samuraciclib is therefore important in its own right, but also because new oral SERDs are currently in clinical trials and may be more effective partner therapies than fulvestrant. The efficacy signal of samuraciclib therefore may be further increased in combination with the emerging therapeutic class of oral SERDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The PK and PD of the 2 doses of 240â€‰mg and 360â€‰mg were reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) and a starting dose of 360â€‰mg OD appeared to be the most promising dose level to start treatment based on PK and PD data. However, this is based on the understanding that a dose reduction to 240â€‰mg could be considered if the 360â€‰mg dose is not tolerated. In line with current best practice (Project OPTIMUS, FDA) further data to evaluate both the 240â€‰mg and 360â€‰mg doses are being collected in new Phase 2 trials.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Overall, the data show an acceptable safety profile and initial evidence of activity for samuraciclib as a selective inhibitor of CDK7. Limitations of this dataset are that the studies were uncontrolled, non-randomized, single arm evaluations in a relatively small number of patients (TNBC cohort). Thus, in summary, samuraciclib has the potential to address the significant medical need of patients whose disease has progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors and this will be investigated further in future studies. A number of co-administration studies with both fulvestrant and new oral SERDs are now being initiated. Additionally, further studies are warranted to evaluate which other cancer types and combination strategies are most promising for samuraciclib therapy.</p>
