                  <p>The Improving the Wellbeing of people with Opioid Treated CHronic Pain (I-WOTCH) randomised controlled trial uses a multicomponent self-management intervention to help people taper their opioid use. This approach is not widely used and its efficacy is unknown. A process evaluation alongside the trial will help to assess how the intervention was delivered, looking at the dose of intervention received and the fidelity of the delivery. We will explore how the intervention may have brought about change through the experiences of the participants receiving and the staff delivering the intervention and whether there were contextual factors involved.</p>

                  <p>A mixed methods process evaluation will assess how the processes of the I-WOTCH intervention fared and whether these affected the outcomes. We will collect quantitative data, for example, group attendance analysed with statistical methods. Qualitative data, for example, from interviews and feedback forms will be analysed using framework analysis. We will use a ‘following a thread’ and a mixed methods matrix for the final integrated analysis.</p>

                <p>The I-WOTCH study is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a patient-centred, multicomponent self-management intervention targeting withdrawal of strong opioids among those living with chronic non-malignant pain. Primary outcomes are activities of daily living measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference Short Form 8A and opioid dose reduction measured as a morphine daily dose equivalent at 12 months’ follow-up. Details of this are included in the I-WOTCH RCT protocol paper.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Trial participants are identified from general practice records, using electronic searches and approached by letter. They are randomised into the control group, who receive the ‘My Opioid Manager’ self-help guide and a relaxation compact disc or in addition to the intervention group who are invited to attend 3 days of group activities, two one-to-one sessions with a clinical facilitator (usually a nurse) after day 2 and up to two follow- up telephone calls between day 3 and the last one-to-one session. I-WOTCH is a multisite trial requiring standardisation of training and delivery. The intervention is complex and multicomponent, including educational and behavioural change components. Any changes in medication are discussed with participants. All prescriptions continue to be issued by the participants’ general practitioners. Outcomes will be assessed at four time points: baseline and 4, 8 and 12 months. The I-WOTCH protocol paper gives greater detail about the study.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

                <title>Preliminary work</title>
                <p>We did a formative process evaluation as part of an intervention pilot study which found that the randomisation and the control arm seemed acceptable and the paperwork was not reported to be burdensome. There were no reported cases of resentful demoralisation or complaints about the randomisation process.</p>
                <p>The delivery of groups and intervention attendance showed that group delivery was feasible, though numbers were lower than expected. Strategies were put in place to improve this in the main study. Once people attended day 1, attendance was good for the remaining group days and one-to-one sessions. Those who could not attend the first group session (most often due to work commitments or poor health) were offered a different future group. A member of the process evaluation team (VPN) observed one pilot group and reported good group engagement and facilitation of group content. Discussions were well received by the participants attending. Feedback from participants was positive about the course, the most useful aspects being the gaining of new knowledge about opioids and pain within a supportive environment. The participants also said that they found the components of the course, which helped them change their thoughts and attitudes to their pain useful. Things that they would change about the group sessions centred on practical considerations such as the comfort of seating and better sound equipment. This feasibility work helped us to develop our logic model and specific components of the main trial process evaluation, such as our interview topic guides and fidelity paperwork to assess adherence and competence.</p>

                <p>We are doing a mixed methods process evaluation based on UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance to better understand how the intervention works.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Key foci of evaluation, as described by Steckler and Linnan, are context, (contextual factors that may affect the implementation), fidelity (whether the intervention was delivered as designed), dose delivered (the amount of intervention delivered), dose received (the amount of intervention received by the participants) and reach (who the participants are and where they come from).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> We will assess fidelity, ascertaining whether the trial processes were conducted as per protocol so minimising possible type III errors, for example, when the outcomes of a study do not take into account an inadequate implementation of an intervention.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We will identify any delivery that deviates from the original design because these may be important when interpreting the trial results. We will also investigate (1) how the contexts (eg, different sites) of implementation affected delivery, (2) how implementation of the intervention was managed and (3) whether the hypothesised change mechanisms operated as expected. These data can inform replication, development and integration of interventions within routine practice so assisting researchers, commissioners and practitioners.</p>
                <p>The process evaluation team (KS, VPN and CA), who has expertise in mixed methods approaches to complex health interventions, will work independently of the main trial team during the data collection phase to avoid contamination of trial processes. Findings from the process evaluation may provide insights that could enhance interpretation of the trial results.</p>

              <p>The aims of the I-WOTCH intervention are to improve participants’ quality of life and to reduce their use of opioid drugs. We have developed a logic model specific to this intervention guided by intervention mapping principles<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). We have also considered items from a checklist of key features of any group intervention that need to be reported to ensure replication enabling us to identify a series of characteristics to investigate.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The intervention includes educational, psychological and behavioural components designed to effect change. Thus, the change mechanisms can be conceptualised in terms of the information, motivation and behaviour skills model developed by Fisher and Fisher,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> hypothesising that the intervention will (1) provide useful new information concerning the effects of opioids, (2) motivate participants to reduce their reliance on opioids and (3) provide them with new skills to facilitate non-opioid pain control (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Interviews</title>
                  <p>We will interview up to 20 intervention participants and 20 who were allocated to the control arm. These will be purposively sampled to ensure a range of age, gender, location and opioid reduction experience across the two trial arms. They will be interviewed after their final follow-up (at 12 months) to minimise possible effects of the interview on the trial findings. The interviews will be semistructured and held in a convenient local venue to the participant.</p>
                  <p>Participants will have agreed to be contacted about a possible interview on their initial trial consent form, and after receiving the 12-month follow-up questionnaires, our sample will be sent a patient information leaflet inviting them to take part in a face-to-face interview about their experiences of being part of the study. After a week, a researcher will contact them by phone to answer any questions and, if agreeable, book an appointment. A separate informed consent process will be completed at the beginning of each interview.</p>
                  <p>We will interview up to 20 trained intervention staff across different geographical areas. These include clinical facilitators (usually a nurse) whose role is to facilitate groups, see participants for their one-to-one appointments and give them telephone support as required. We will also interview the other group facilitators, either a lay person with experience of opioid use and tapering or an allied health practitioner with an interest in chronic pain conditions. Approach will be by an invitation letter with an information leaflet, and consent will be taken before the interview. Interviews will be semistructured using a topic guide and will take place after the interventions have been completed.</p>
                  <p>All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim when all identifiable data have been removed. They will then be checked for accuracy by the interview researcher. Audio recordings will be held in a digitally secure environment with restricted access.</p>
                  <p>We will analyse the interviews using both thematic analysis and framework analysis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Transcripts will be analysed using the six steps outlined by Braun and Clarke.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> After thorough familiarisation with the data through listening to all recordings, and reading and rereading the transcripts, five interviews will be analysed by coding themes related to the research questions. The emerging lower-level codes will then be grouped into higher level themes related to the research questions. All transcripts will then be coded using the hierarchical coding framework, paying attention to any new themes and deviant cases. We will review data related to each code and theme, check and recode, if necessary, and define themes. Throughout the analysis, the analysis team will make reflective analytic memos and hold regular discussion meetings. We will use NVivo qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty) to organise the data.</p>

                  <p>The I-WOTCH main study protocol originally had a target of 468 participants (234 of whom will be allocated to the intervention) and anticipated running 24 groups. To ensure a random sample of groups for the fidelity study, a statistician using a random number generator will identify three day 1 sessions, three day 2 sessions and three day 3 sessions from early, middle and late stages of the study. This will ensure we listen to approximately 10% of group sessions across the duration of the study. It was not possible to listen to all the sessions due to pragmatic reasons of time and cost. Through extensive discussions with the team who developed the intervention, we decided to prespecify those sessions that were considered by the team to be key to promoting behaviour change and contain either educational or discussion items. Other sessions that are more practical in nature (eg, origami for distraction or relaxation) will be difficult to assess from an audio recording as the aim was to promote distraction and discussion or to experience a relaxation technique. These will be checked to see if they took place as a minimum requirement of the intervention but will not be rated for facilitator adherence and competence (see <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p>

                  <p>To assess the fidelity of the intervention, we will assess two aspects of intervention delivery: adherence to the intervention manual and competency of the facilitators. A member of the process evaluation team (VPN) will listen to the relevant recordings and score adherence and competence using a specially devised checklist based on components specified in the manual items and training protocol for intervention facilitators (see, eg, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2 SP3">online supplementary appendices 2 and 3</xref>).</p>
                  <p>We will also rate one of the first or second one-to-one nurse consultations per group (n=24). We will double rate 10% of these sampled group and one-to-one sessions by a second member of the team (KS) to assess inter-rater reliability and to ensure rigour. Percentage scores will be given for adherence and competence per session, and the findings will be analysed using standard statistical methods (see the Mixed methods analysis section).</p>

                <p>We will administer self-report questions within the I-WOTCH RCT questionnaires (at baseline and 4, 8 and 12 months) to track possible change mechanisms. Specifically, we will assess participants’ (1) motivation to reduce opioid use before and after the intervention, (2) expectations of success in opioid reduction, (3) confidence (or self-efficacy<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) in relation to opioid reduction prior to receiving the intervention and (4) perceived intervention efficacy before and after participation (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>).
