                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The FORWARD (FGF-18 Osteoarthritis Randomized Trial with Administration of Repeated Doses) trial assessed efficacy and safety of the potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) sprifermin in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Here, we report 5-year efficacy and safety results.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Patients were randomised to intra-articular sprifermin 100 µg or 30 µg every 6 months (q6mo) or 12 months, or placebo, for 18 months. The primary analysis was at year 2, with follow-up at years 3, 4 and 5. Additional post hoc exploratory analyses were conducted in patients with baseline minimum radiographic joint space width 1.5–3.5 mm and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain 40–90, a subgroup at risk (SAR) of progression.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>378 (69%) patients completed the 5-year follow-up. A significant dose-response in total femorotibial joint cartilage thickness with sprifermin (trend test, p&lt;0.001) and a 0.05 mm mean difference with sprifermin 100 µg q6mo versus placebo (95% CI 0.00 to 0.10; p=0.015) were sustained to year 5. WOMAC pain scores improved ~50% from baseline in all groups. No patient in the 100 µg q6mo group had replacement of the treated knee. 96%–98% of patients receiving sprifermin and 98% placebo reported adverse events, most were mild or moderate and deemed unrelated to treatment. Adverse event-related study withdrawals were &lt;10%. Differentiation in WOMAC pain between sprifermin 100 µg q6mo and placebo in the SAR (n=161) at year 3 was maintained to year 5 (−10.08; 95% CI −25.68 to 5.53).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>In the longest DMOAD trial reported to date, sprifermin maintained long-term structural modification of articular cartilage over 3.5 years post-treatment. Potential translation to clinical benefit was observed in the SAR.</p>

                    <p>Sprifermin is a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug that was shown to increase articular cartilage thickness compared with placebo in patients with knee osteoarthritis at the primary endpoint (year 2) of the FORWARD trial and was well tolerated.

              <p>Current therapies for osteoarthritis (OA) focus on reducing pain, improving physical function and patient’s quality of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> There is an urgent need for disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) that improve symptoms and inhibit structural disease progression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Many DMOAD trials have had limited success or yielded negative results, with the heterogeneous nature of OA and insufficient trial follow-up times being potential contributors.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Preservation of cartilage integrity is widely considered a highly important goal for a DMOAD.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sprifermin is a recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 18 that has cartilage regenerative properties and is under investigation as a potential DMOAD for knee OA.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> No measurable systemic effects or safety concerns were associated with sprifermin in phase I and Ib studies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref>
</p>
              <p>FORWARD (FGF-18 Osteoarthritis Randomized Trial with Administration of Repeated Doses) was a 5-year, randomised clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of sprifermin among 549 patients with symptomatic radiographic knee OA.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> FORWARD was designed with total femorotibial joint (TFTJ) cartilage thickness change as the primary structural endpoint at year 2, and change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores over the same period was a secondary endpoint. Follow-up continued up to year 5. The 2-year and 3-year data were reported recently: dose-dependent modification of TFTJ cartilage thickness with sprifermin was demonstrated at years 2 and 3, and a mean difference of 0.05 mm in TFTJ cartilage thickness between the highest sprifermin dose (100 µg every 6 months (q6mo); 0.03 mm gain) and placebo (0.02 mm loss) was observed.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> WOMAC total scores improved by around 50% in all cohorts but did not differ significantly between sprifermin and placebo.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>Previous studies have revealed that including patients with at least moderate pain at baseline enables greater differentiation of a pain response to treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In addition, inclusion of patients with advanced disease (eg, low radiographic joint space width (JSW)) may enhance the ability to observe disease progression<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and detect translation of structural modification to clinical benefit.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Exploratory post hoc analyses were therefore conducted in a so-called ‘subgroup at risk’ (SAR) of patients in FORWARD, with narrower medial or lateral minimum JSW (mJSW) and higher WOMAC pain than the overall study population at baseline (n=161).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> SAR placebo-treated patients had more rapid structural progression compared with the overall study population, whereas net TFTJ cartilage modification with sprifermin versus placebo was similar.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Importantly, in the SAR, differentiation in WOMAC pain score change between placebo and the highest sprifermin dose was observed at year 3.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p>
              <p>Here, we report the long-term structural and symptomatic efficacy and safety of sprifermin in the overall FORWARD study population and SAR up to year 5, that is 3.5 (for the q6mo groups) or 4 years (for the q12mo groups) after the last sprifermin treatment.</p>

                <p>FORWARD was a randomised, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo-controlled trial. The study design was reported previously.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Patients at 10 centres in seven countries were randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to receive intra-articular sprifermin 100 or 30 µg q6mo, 100 or 30 µg q12mo or placebo. Sprifermin was administered in cycles consisting of three injections over three consecutive weeks, q6mo (0, 6, 12, 18 months) or q12mo (0 and 12 months, with placebo at months 6 and 18) over an 18-month period (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S1</xref>).</p>

                <p>FORWARD consisted of a primary 2-year analysis period, with an extended 3-year observation period. The primary endpoint was change in TFTJ cartilage thickness in the target knee at year 2, based on quantitative MRI (qMRI, see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental materials</xref>). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in WOMAC scores (0–100, where 0 represents no symptoms), mJSW in the medial and lateral compartments assessed by fixed-flexion radiography, cartilage thickness in medial and lateral femorotibial compartments (MFTC and LFTC) by qMRI, and the incidence and nature of adverse events (AEs) over 2 years. WOMAC assessments, which referenced the last 48 hours, were performed after a pain medication washout of at least 5 half-lives.</p>
                <p>Exploratory follow-up for all efficacy and safety endpoints was performed at years 3, 4 and 5. A change in WOMAC pain by ≥10 (of 100) was described as a clinically relevant pain improvement to be perceived by an individual.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The incidence of knee replacements (KRs) in the treated knee was a key exploratory endpoint, added post hoc to the year 5 analyses.</p>
                <p>The SAR included all patients with baseline medial or lateral mJSW of 1.5–3.5 mm and a WOMAC pain score of 40–90. Post hoc exploratory analyses were conducted in the SAR, including structural (qMRI-based cartilage thickness and radiographic mJSW), symptomatic (WOMAC scores) and safety endpoints up to year 5.</p>

              <p>DMOADs that not only alleviate symptoms but also modify structure are an important and unmet clinical need for knee OA. Sufficient follow-up in DMOAD trials may be necessary to demonstrate that the structural benefit of a DMOAD is maintained and that structure modification eventually translates into clinical benefit. FORWARD is the longest DMOAD study reported to date. The results of the current analyses show that the efficacy of sprifermin, as measured by both the dose-effect and the mean difference versus placebo in TFTJ cartilage thickness at year 2, was maintained up to year 5, that is, for at least 3.5 years post-active treatment. These findings suggest that intra-articular sprifermin has a sustained effect on articular cartilage modification in patients with knee OA, with no detectable systemic exposure or new safety signals observed up to Year 5.</p>
              <p>Evaluation of the type of cartilage gained with sprifermin by biopsy was not possible in FORWARD due to ethical considerations. Preclinical studies in rat models of OA indicated that sprifermin induces the proliferation of hyaline cartilage-producing articular chondrocytes, hyaline extracellular matrix synthesis and cartilage repair.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10 11</xref> Importantly, the cartilage gained with sprifermin treatment up to year 2 did not decline at a faster rate after the end of treatment than the natural cartilage in the placebo group, indicating robust quality and mechanical properties with similar resilience to natural cartilage.</p>
              <p>Statistically significant cartilage modification was observed in the LFTC with sprifermin and while the 0.05 mm net increase in MFTC thickness with sprifermin versus placebo was maintained to year 5, it was not statistically significant. Since the majority of patients in the study had medial disease, less weight load in the lateral compartment (off-loading the joint) may have allowed for a more pronounced effect by sprifermin in the LFTC. Importantly, the medial compartment responded to sprifermin despite continuous weight load.</p>
              <p>A large decrease in WOMAC pain of approximately 50% was observed in all groups, including placebo, and maintained up to year 5. These observations suggest that the contextual effect of intra-articular injection that is known to impact WOMAC outcome in knee OA trials<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> is maintained over long periods. This is in line with a meta-analysis of 32 randomised trials that showed intra-articular saline injections to significantly improve short-term and long-term knee pain.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There was high variation in WOMAC pain and no statistical differentiation between the highest sprifermin dose and placebo was observed in the ITT cohort at year 5 or previous timepoints. FORWARD was designed to assess structural modification, not symptoms, and as such pain medication was not modified or restricted throughout the study. This may have contributed to the lack of symptomatic differentiation between sprifermin and placebo.</p>
              <p>Post hoc analyses identified a subgroup of patients with narrower mJSW (&lt;3.5 mm) and non-acceptable OA-related knee pain (&gt;40) at baseline: the SAR.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Interestingly, net structural improvement in cartilage thickness relative to placebo was similar in the SAR and overall study population, although the SAR encountered more rapid cartilage loss compared with the latter. This is an important finding, as it is often presumed that DMOADs would be ineffective in patients with more severe disease at baseline and in those with faster structural progression. The current results, however, demonstrate that structural modification by sprifermin is at least as strong in more severe OA as in milder OA.</p>
              <p>The overall study population was relatively heterogeneous due to the inclusion criteria allowing a population with diverse levels of baseline pain and structural status. A shift in pain reporting between screening (WOMAC sub-question A1) and baseline (sub-questions A1–A5) was observed, and a relatively high proportion of patients (32%) had a baseline WOMAC pain score of &lt;40. Such heterogeneous cohorts may be less likely to differentiate DMOAD responses on pain from placebo due to a floor effect that contributes to lower average scores across the study population.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Patients were selected with different amounts of cartilage thickness at baseline in order to maximise the likelihood of observing structural changes. As a result, many patients (38%) had a baseline medial mJSW of &gt;4.0 mm that approached the JSW of healthy individuals. It is likely that more time is required for these patients to show translation of structural improvement to symptomatic benefit versus placebo.</p>
              <p>Importantly, and in contrast with the full ITT cohort, the potential clinically meaningful improvements in pain with the highest sprifermin dose versus placebo observed at year 3 were sustained to year 5 in the SAR. The pain benefit of sprifermin in this subgroup required 2–3 years to become clinically relevant, in line with the hypothesis that this occurs subsequent to structural modification of cartilage thickness. These results are plausible, as patients with less mJSW, lower cartilage thickness and more pain at baseline are more likely to symptomatically benefit from cartilage structural modification than those with only mild disease. The findings also show that relatively long observation intervals may be required to demonstrate the translation of structural modification into symptomatic benefit.</p>
              <p>The limitations of this study include that the year 5 analyses were exploratory, and the SAR was identified post hoc and included a modest proportion of patients. Conclusions regarding sprifermin’s symptomatic effects are limited by the lack of control/modification of analgesic medication during the study (as per protocol) and the enrolment of patients with limited pain at baseline. No techniques were applied to identify valid pain reporters or limit the placebo effect on pain. Rescue medications and changes in physical activity were not analysed, which could have helped put into context the lack of separation in symptomatic endpoints between the sprifermin and placebo groups. Finally, MRI reading approaches regarding blinding to the sequence of image acquisition differed between time points, although differences between sprifermin-treated and placebo-treated patients at each time point were unaffected by this.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, these findings suggest potential long-lasting cartilage structural modification with sprifermin treatment among patients with knee OA. Symptomatic improvements with sprifermin versus placebo were observed in an SAR of structural and symptomatic progression. The FORWARD trial had the longest follow-up time for DMOAD efficacy using quantitative imaging and provides an exemplar for the feasibility of long-term OA trials. Enrichment of patient populations with higher likelihood of structural and symptomatic progression may increase the chance of successful DMOAD development.</p>
