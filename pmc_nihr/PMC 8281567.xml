                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy and treatment in the early stages can prevent disability. However, local nerve damage can lead to injury and consequently recurring and disfiguring ulcers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the treatment of leprosy ulcers using an autologous blood product; leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) to promote healing.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a single-centre study in the Anandaban Hospital, The Leprosy Mission Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal. Consenting patients (n=130) will be individually randomised in a single-blinded, controlled trial. Participants will be 18 years of age or older, admitted to the hospital with a clean, dry and infection-free chronic foot ulcer between 2 and 20 cm<sup>2</sup> in size. If the ulcer is infected, it will be treated before enrolment into the study. The intervention involves the application of leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) matrix on the ulcer beds during twice-weekly dressing changes. Controls receive usual care in the form of saline dressings only during their twice-weekly dressing changes. Primary outcomes are the rate of healing assessed using standardised photographs by observers blind to allocated treatment, and time to complete re-epithelialization. Follow-up is at 6 months from randomisation.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This research will provide valuable information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of L-PRF in the treatment of leprosy ulcers. An additional benefit is the evaluation of the effects of treatment on quality of life for people living with leprosy ulcers. The results will improve our understanding of the scalability of this treatment across low-income countries for ulcer healing in leprosy and potentially other conditions such as diabetic ulcers.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par33">Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that causes neuritis with loss of sensation. Neuropathy is caused primarily by inflammatory episodes called ‘reactions’, which can occur in 30–50% of leprosy cases in response to live <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> or residual antigens persisting for years in skin and nerve tissues after curative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Neuritis can develop and recur at any time before, during or even years after leprosy treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The combination of loss of sensation and deformities leads to the presentation of ulcers, often with the first presentation within 4–5 years of leprosy diagnosis, and then an increased lifetime risk of recurrent ulcers, which can lead to deformity and permanent disability.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Nepal, with over 3200 new cases of leprosy annually, is one of 23 priority countries for the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global national leprosy programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The prevalence rate of leprosy is rising, though this may be due to improved reporting and active case finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy, Nepalese people may hide early symptoms due to stigma based on cultural perceptions that leprosy is a punishment for former life transgressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, there are often delays in presentation of leprosy, which can lead to the development of complex ulcers requiring long hospital stays. Furthermore, weight bearing and physical activity are often adversely associated with healing rates of plantar ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] but resting to prevent or heal an ulcer is impractical for many affected people who need to work to earn their living.</p>
                <p id="Par35">People afflicted with recurrent ulcers suffer severe consequences in terms of loss of function, loss of earnings, stigma, and often severe mental distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This protocol concerns the evaluation of a promising intervention to promote the healing of leprosy ulcers, and so improve wellbeing and quality of life for people living with leprosy. Findings would also be relevant to other ulcerative conditions, particularly diabetes, where ulcers can similarly result from peripheral nerve damage.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Leprosy ulcers heal slowly, because they are large and/or deep when they present and possibly because the skin is less moist due to damage to autonomic nerves. Slow healing leads to an extended stay in hospital, which has implications for the patients, their family members and for hospitals. Current methods of topical treatment include applications of zinc tape, wax therapy, human amniotic membrane gel, topical phenytoin, saline gel, or emerging cellular therapies such as platelet-rich plasma gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, results from intervention studies are ambiguous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and recent Cochrane reviews have called for higher quality research on ulcer treatment and prevention in leprosy, specifically advocating for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), ‘blinding’ of outcome measurement and appropriate sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a cellular therapy with the potential to improve the healing of chronic wounds and avoid limb loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A Cochrane review suggested that it may be beneficial for diabetic patients, although the effect size was modest and the trials were not of high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A trial of PRP to promote tendon healing did not find evidence that it was effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A ‘second generation’ of the treatment, leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF), shows promise, albeit with inconclusive formal research evidence. Results from one longitudinal study in Chile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] showed potential with a reduction in the size of wounds and closure of some chronic ulcers. However, patients acted as their own controls and so the cause of the recovery cannot be attributed to any particular aspect of the care. A trial of L-PRF in neuropathic diabetic ulcers also demonstrated positive results although the analysis was not by intention to treat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Irrespective of these inconclusive or null findings, this therapy is currently used in low and middle income (LMIC) countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], including Anandaban Hospital, The Leprosy Mission Nepal. The use of the therapy here suggests that the treatment would be scalable if proven effective; however, reliable evidence from a randomised trial is needed to support its continued or expanded use given that it is more costly than conventional therapy.</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par70">The intervention uses the participant’s own blood to prepare strips of leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin matrix (L-PRF) to be applied to the ulcer bed. The process is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] but briefly, up to 80ml of participants’ blood will be collected twice per week at the time of dressing change. The blood will be centrifuged to obtain the fibrin matrix gel, which will be compressed and applied to the ulcer bed and then covered with a Vaseline gauge dressing. Blood collection from participants, centrifugation procedure and application of L-PRF will be done in a minor operating room following aseptic technique. All participants (including those in the control group) will be given iron and folic acid tablets. Both control and intervention groups will receive routine twice-weekly dressing changes by trained nurses or paramedics until their ulcers are healed (complete re-epithelization) up to a maximum of 70 days. Any missed dressing change sessions will be noted but not treated as a deviation from the protocol.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">In the event that a participant has more than one ulcer, the largest ulcer will be selected as the index ulcer for analysis purposes before randomisation. However, all of the participant’s ulcers will receive the same treatment. Thus, if the participant is in the intervention group they will receive L-PRF treatment on all of their ulcers. Eligible patients will be offered entry in the trial at the point where their clinician judges them suitable for treatment, i.e., when the lesion is clear of any debris or infection.</p>

                  <title>Activity measurement</title>
                  <p id="Par72">All participants will be invited to wear a pedometer (Model: Mi Smart Band 5, Model: XMSH10HM) on the ankle of their non-affected limb (or non-index case affected limb) which they will wear from the first dressing change until 42 days (the point where cross-over may occur) or discharge, whichever comes first. This will act as a proxy measure of weight bearing and enable us to monitor activity across intervention and control groups and thereby evaluate whether the level of activity is similar across groups.</p>

If any change influences the participant’s eligibility to continue in the trial, the local Principal Investigator will be informed and a decision to continue with the intervention will be made in the participant’s best interest.

An allocation table will be generated remotely by the trial statistician at The University of Birmingham to allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio at the level of the individual over the course of the trial. A random number generator will be used to generate a random sequence of the numbers between 1 to N inclusive. A permuted block randomisation method will be used by randomly selecting blocks of size 2, 4, 6 or 8 in order to maintain balance between the numbers allocated to each of the two groups. The generated table will be uploaded into the REDCap software to be used for participant enrolment. Access to the allocation table will be restricted. When a participant’s details are submitted, the trial arm and a unique study number will be assigned and revealed to the local clinician so that the randomised group that the participant is assigned to cannot be altered.</p>

So that the measurements are not all relegated to the end of the study, they will be made in batches of ten participants reaching completion of their baseline treatments (at complete re-epithelization or 70 days from randomisation). A proportion (20%) of all ulcer photographs will be measured by both observers to test inter-rater reliability. These photographs will be selected at random.

We will analyse this model using a linear mixed-effects model with participant-level random effects and both with and without adjustment for participant characteristics. Given there are multiple primary outcomes (two outcomes, with and without adjustment, for three types of ulcer assessment), we will adjust reported p values for multiple testing using a stepdown method, which provides an efficient means of controlling the family-wise error rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

The distance of the camera from the ulcer surface is controlled by triangulation of three laser lights. The images taken by the camera in the tablet are calibrated digitally by reference to a measurement ruler in the frame. The areas (cm<sup>2</sup>) are then generated within the different software packages. We will measure, agreement between the methods of measurement:

This analysis will also reflect other characteristics of participants that are potentially prognostic and predictive of the efficacy of L-PRF. The analysis will provide a careful assessment of how the cost-effectiveness of L-PRF varies according to its local acquisition cost, as well as other parameters that could vary between localities. Full uncertainty analysis will be undertaken to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to support local funding of L-PRF at a given acquisition cost or whether additional evidence generation is necessary and worthwhile.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par130">This protocol describes an individually randomised control trial to evaluate a treatment using autologous blood products L-PRF, to promote ulcer healing in leprosy. Despite the promising anecdotal evidence regarding this treatment, high-quality, empirical data are currently unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par131">Most of the evidence on ulcer healing, including the Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], is based on proportion of ulcers healed (completely epithelialized) by 42 days. This is sub-optimal because complete epithelialisation is a clinical decision that is also used to decide on discharge. This provides an opportunity for observer (outcome) bias. For this reason, we will measure rate of healing. These measures are all made centrally (in Birmingham) by two observers who are ‘blind’ to intervention status.</p>
              <p id="Par132">Activity measurements are not a primary outcome measure in our study. However, by collecting step-count daily and over the course of the inpatient stay over the periods specified above, we can exclude activity as a confounding factor in any differences found in ulcer healing rates between intervention and control groups.</p>
              <p id="Par133">We are also planning to do a range of nested studies. Given sufficient time and resources, we hope to video tape a subset of dressing changes (five intervention and two controls selected at random in Birmingham) as a means of photograph supervision and for additional quality control. We will also develop a more detailed health economics protocol. Finally, we will develop follow on studies based on the results of the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par134">We are using three methods to measure the rate of ulcer healing and time to complete re-epithelialisation. Readers might wonder at such an extensive set of methods and consider this ‘overkill’. Our rationale for using these multiple ulcer measurement methods is two-fold. First, it is crucially important in our judgement to create a situation where results cannot be explained away by measurement error (for all that measurement error is more of a threat to precision than to accuracy). Second, we wish to contribute to the methodological literature on ulcer measurement. As investigators we hope that the results will be consistently null or positive (or even negative). However, we realise that we may end up with results that toggle around the conventional statistical threshold , say, according to ulcer measurement method or whether or not adjustment had been carried out for any discrepancy in ulcer size at base-line. In that case, we will simply report the different results and allow the reader to make an interpretation. We will not (miss) use statistical tests as decision rules.</p>
              <p id="Par135">By using a randomised control method, alongside standardised blindly assessed photographs, and information on activity, this research will provide robust evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of L-PRF in the treatment of leprosy ulcers. Data collection and ulcer assessment follows a ‘closed-loop’ such that the photograph and image can follow only one pathway from camera to completed measurement. An additional benefit is the evaluation of the effects of treatment on quality of life for people living with the effects of leprosy. The findings will also be relevant to other ulcerative conditions, particularly diabetes, where ulcers similarly result from peripheral nerve damage. The results will improve our understanding of the scalability of this treatment across low-income countries for ulcer healing in leprosy and other similar conditions.</p>

              <p>We acknowledge the contribution of other members of the NIHR RIGHT TABLE trial team including Melita Harris, Peter Chilton, Thomas Lingard, Lisa Holden and Neil Winkles, as well as the patient focus groups who were involved in the conception and development of this research project. We also acknowledge Dr. Sushil Koirala and Professor Nelson Pinto for their contribution for the initial development of L-PRF protocol at Anandaban Hospital. We thank Dr. Paul Saunderson, Chair of the trial steering committee, for drawing our attention to possible post randomization bias if, contrary to the protocol, ward staff became aware of a patient’s group allocation and altered advice on weight bearing as a result.</p>
