                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Depressive episodes are common after first-episode psychosis (FEP), affecting more than 40% of people, adding to individual burden, poor outcomes, and healthcare costs. If the risks of developing depression were lower, this could have a beneficial effect on morbidity and mortality, as well as improving outcomes. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a common first-line medication for the treatment of depression in adults. It has been shown to be safe when co-prescribed with antipsychotic medication, and there is evidence that it is an effective treatment for depression in established schizophrenia. We present a protocol for a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial called ADEPP that aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of sertraline in preventing depression after FEP.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The recruitment target is 452 participants between the ages of 18 and 65¬†years who are within 12¬†months of treatment initiation for FEP. Having provided informed consent, participants will be randomised to receive either 50¬†mg of sertraline daily or matched placebo for 6¬†months, in addition to treatment as usual. The primary outcome measure will be a comparison of the number of new cases of depression between the treatment and placebo arms over the 6-month intervention phase. Secondary outcomes include suicidal behaviour, anxiety, rates of relapse, functional outcome, quality of life, and resource use.</p>

                  <title>Psychosis and depression</title>
                  <p id="Par29">Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, can be highly disabling. They usually emerge in adolescence or early adulthood and are characterised by the onset of positive symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions and disordered thinking, and negative symptoms, such as poor motivation. There are over 12,000 new cases of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in England annually, with significant increases seen since COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The burden on the individual, their family and society is large, with a cost to the UK economy of more than ¬£11 billion per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Beyond the impact of the positive and negative symptoms of FEP, around 40% of people experience a moderate or severe depressive episode following FEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Studies show that positive symptoms respond to current treatment for many, but despite a reduction in symptoms, a decline in functioning, usually attributed to the persistence of negative symptoms, is still common. This suggests that current treatment regimens are limited in their ability to improve outcomes. Our hypothesis is that depression, in addition to negative symptoms, in the early stages of psychosis, contributes to functional decline and is a key area of unmet need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par30">Considerable evidence suggests that depression in FEP has long-term adverse consequences for social and occupational recovery, quality of life, and risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Follow-up studies have found that fewer than 40% of patients with FEP achieve full recovery, and up to 70% remain out of employment, education, and training, even with existing, intensive interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A number of longitudinal studies of FEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with a mean follow-up of 3¬†years, demonstrated a clear and significant association between depression and both poor functional outcomes and reduced quality of life following FEP. Additionally, depression after FEP has a long-term impact on the likelihood of suicidal behaviour, with the effect lasting up to 7¬†years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Depression is the most significant risk factor for suicidal behaviour and completed suicide in FEP, with over a third of patients attempting suicide and completed suicide being most common in the earlier stages of the illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par31">Furthermore, a number of studies have found that depression and anxiety often precede a psychotic relapse, suggesting that these ‚Äòco-morbidities‚Äô may precipitate the development of positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One possible implication is that targeted treatment for depression could play a role in preventing psychotic relapse. For example, symptoms of depression, such as poor motivation and social withdrawal, might be expected to reduce engagement with focused interventions addressing recovery and relapse prevention after FEP.</p>
                  <p id="Par32">Thus, treatment targeted at the prevention of depression after FEP could be an important strategy, with a beneficial impact on functional recovery, risk of suicide and quality of life, as well as secondary benefits related to the prevention of psychotic relapse. Given the potential positive impact on patients, carers, families, the NHS, and society, this prevention strategy, if successful, is likely to be a cost-effective intervention.</p>

                <sec id="Sec5">
                  <title>Past research</title>
                  <p id="Par33">Recent observational studies have evidenced the frequency and importance of depression following FEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is substantial meta-analytic evidence that antidepressants are well-tolerated when prescribed in combination with continuing antipsychotic medication; Helfer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reviewed the co-prescription of antidepressants with antipsychotic medications, for any clinical indication, in 3068 participants with schizophrenia and showed an overall beneficial effect with a low risk of adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A 2017 systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] identified 15 studies that reported the effect of antidepressant medication specifically for the treatment of a depressive episode in schizophrenia; eight studies investigated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with the majority of these showing effectiveness and an overall number needed to treat (NNT) of 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, in moderate or severe depressive disorders without psychosis, a recent large-scale meta-analysis has demonstrated the clear effectiveness of antidepressant medication, with sertraline, agomelatine, amitriptyline, and escitalopram being the medications considered to be the most effective and best tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par34">Regarding other treatments for depression in psychosis, cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has been the subject of much research in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, this body of evidence has primarily focused on its effectiveness for positive symptoms or the prevention of transition from high-risk status to psychosis. The secondary evidence for the effect of CBTp on depression in psychosis is mixed, with a small effect size at best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Prevention of depression using antidepressant medication is an established strategy in other branches of medicine for groups at high risk of depression, with low-dose antidepressant medication used to reduce the incidence of depression post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], after a cardiovascular event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], with liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], in post-partum women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and after traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. SSRIs are the most frequently studied medication in these groups, with a reported reduction in the incidence of depression ranging from 20 to 50%.</p>
                  <p id="Par35">In summary, the evidence base upon which clinicians and patients can make a choice about additional treatments in FEP remains limited. Whilst some evidence exists for the use of antidepressants to treat depression in people with schizophrenia, as well as those with other illnesses at equally high risk of developing depression, no previous study has specifically focused on preventing depression after FEP, despite this being a period with very high rates of depression associated with poor outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, relapse, quality of life, and poor functional recovery.</p>

                <p id="Par36">The use of an SSRI antidepressant alongside usual antipsychotic medication will be an effective and cost-effect intervention for preventing depression post-FEP. The rationale is that preventative treatment will reduce the risk of an individual developing depression and thus prevent additional morbidity, ultimately improving recovery, function, and quality of life and potentially reducing resource use.</p>

All participants and their research teams will be unblinded following the 6-month outcome assessment or, if they develop depression, the primary endpoint, prior to this. Those participants recruited within the first 24¬†months of recruitment will undergo an additional 12-month follow-up visit (unblinded and observational).

                <p id="Par61">It will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) or delegate at each trial site to obtain informed consent for each participant prior to performing any trial-related procedure. Any delegation of this duty will be captured on the Site Delegation Log. PIs or delegate(s) will ensure that they adequately explain to the participant the study aims, the trial intervention, and the anticipated benefits and potential hazards of taking part in the trial. There is a two-stage information provision and consent process: patients will be given a copy of the Screening Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and sufficient time to consider the trial and discuss it with friends and family. If the participant expresses an interest in participating in the trial, they will be asked to return for a screening visit, where they will be asked to sign and date the latest version of the Screening Informed Consent Form (ICF) before any trial screening assessments are carried out. If eligibility is confirmed, the same process is then repeated with the main trial PIS and ICF.</p>

                <p id="Par62">We will also request optional consent to allow linkage to patient data available in NHS routine clinical datasets, including primary care data (e.g. Clinical Practice Research Datalink, The Health Improvement Network, QResearch) and secondary care data (Hospital Episode Statistics) through NHS Digital and other central UK NHS bodies. The participant will consent to the Trial Office sending their name, address, date of birth, and NHS number to the relevant national registry and then for the national registry to link this to their data and send the information back to the Trial Office. The consent will also allow access to other new central UK NHS databases that will appear in the future. This will allow us (subject to receipt of additional funding via another grant application) to assess longer-term impact and health service usage data without needing further contact with the trial participants. Blood samples (9¬†ml) will be taken at 4¬†weeks for analysis to check concordance with trial medication. These blood samples will not be analysed until the trial intervention is complete for all participants to remove the risk of unblinding. If the participant consents to it, additional research blood samples (18¬†ml) will be taken and stored at the same time to be included in later genomic and biomarker studies.</p>

It has a better safety profile in combination with antipsychotic medication compared with other effective SSRIs such as citalopram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. There is some evidence that women with chronic depression respond more favourably than men to sertraline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Concomitant treatment with irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is specifically contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use of Sertraline in patients taking pimozide is contra-indicated. Any participants that become pregnant between the start of protocol-defined treatment and 30¬†days after the last dose will be recorded on a ‚Äònotification of pregnancy‚Äô form and followed up to the end of the pregnancy as per the applicable BCTU standard operating procedures. The participant‚Äôs GP would be notified that the participant is pregnant and taking part in the ADEPP trial and, therefore, potentially taking sertraline.

                <p id="Par103">Participants will be individually randomised on a 1:1 basis between sertraline and placebo via a secure online randomisation system based at Birmingham Clinical Trial Unit (BCTU). Randomisation will be provided by a secure online randomisation system at Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU) (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://trials.bham.ac.uk/adepp">https://trials.bham.ac.uk/adepp</ext-link>). Randomisation will be minimised to ensure equal distribution of the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication in this population (olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and quetiapine) and sex. Randomisation Notepads will be provided to investigators to collate the necessary information for minimisation prior to randomisation. All questions and data items on the Randomisation Notepad must be answered before randomisation can be completed and a Trial Number is given. If data items are missing, randomisation will be suspended but can be resumed once the information is available. A ‚Äòrandom element‚Äô will be included in the randomisation algorithm to help reduce predictability and ensure concealment. This is a method used in the algorithm whereby each participant has a probability (unspecified here) of receiving the opposite treatment to the one they would have otherwise received under minimisation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par139">Adding sertraline to any standard treatment regimen for FEP has the potential to prevent the development of depression, a common co-morbidity, after the onset of FEP. By doing so, it is possible that there will be a reduction in the illness burden of FEP with longer-term benefits, including a reduction in the risk of anxiety, suicidal behaviour, and relapse. Thus, this medication strategy has the potential to produce a significant improvement in the level of functioning and quality of life for FEP patients, both within the first 12¬†months and beyond. If proven to be effective, this could be a very cost-effective strategy for improving outcomes for those with FEP in both the short and long-term, having a positive impact on many individuals as well as reducing the cost of care and other implications for society.</p>
