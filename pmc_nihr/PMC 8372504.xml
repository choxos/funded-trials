                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>People living with HIV are at an increased risk of fatal outcome when admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 compared with HIV-negative individuals. We aimed to assess safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV and HIV-negative individuals in South Africa.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1B/2A trial (COV005), people with HIV and HIV-negative participants aged 18–65 years were enrolled at seven South African locations and were randomly allocated (1:1) with full allocation concealment to receive a prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses given 28 days apart. Eligibility criteria for people with HIV included being on antiretroviral therapy for at least 3 months, with a plasma HIV viral load of less than 1000 copies per mL. In this interim analysis, safety and reactogenicity was assessed in all individuals who received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCov 19 between enrolment and Jan 15, 2021. Primary immunogenicity analyses included participants who received two doses of trial intervention and were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04444674, and the Pan African Clinicals Trials Registry, PACTR202006922165132.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between June 24 and Nov 12, 2020, 104 people with HIV and 70 HIV-negative individuals were enrolled. 102 people with HIV (52 vaccine; 50 placebo) and 56 HIV-negative participants (28 vaccine; 28 placebo) received the priming dose, 100 people with HIV (51 vaccine; 49 placebo) and 46 HIV-negative participants (24 vaccine; 22 placebo) received two doses (priming and booster). In participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, there were 164 adverse events in those with HIV (86 vaccine; 78 placebo) and 237 in HIV-negative participants (95 vaccine; 142 placebo). Of seven serious adverse events, one severe fever in a HIV-negative participant was definitely related to trial intervention and one severely elevated alanine aminotranferase in a participant with HIV was unlikely related; five others were deemed unrelated. One person with HIV died (unlikely related). People with HIV and HIV-negative participants showed vaccine-induced serum IgG responses against wild-type Wuhan-1 Asp614Gly (also known as D614G). For participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antigens at baseline, full-length spike geometric mean concentration (GMC) at day 28 was 163·7 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL (95% CI 89·9–298·1) for people with HIV (n=36) and 112·3 BAU/mL (61·7–204·4) for HIV-negative participants (n=23), with a rising day 42 GMC booster response in both groups. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive people with HIV demonstrated higher antibody responses after each vaccine dose than did people with HIV who were seronegative at baseline. High-level binding antibody cross-reactivity for the full-length spike and receptor-binding domain of the beta variant (B.1.351) was seen regardless of HIV status. In people with HIV who developed high titre responses, predominantly those who were receptor-binding domain seropositive at enrolment, neutralising activity against beta was retained.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was well tolerated, showing favourable safety and immunogenicity in people with HIV, including heightened immunogenicity in SARS-CoV-2 baseline-seropositive participants. People with HIV showed cross-reactive binding antibodies to the beta variant and Asp614Gly wild-type, and high responders retained neutralisation against beta.</p>

              <p id="para10">Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being deployed globally to prevent COVID-19. Included among the first-generation COVID-19 vaccines authorised for emergency use is ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), a non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine that expresses the full-length spike (FLS) glycoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in clinical trials have been demonstrated,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and immunogenicity studies have shown that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces antibody responses specific to the spike protein, and to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein 28 days after the first dose in all adults.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">The SARS-CoV-2 spike genome has accumulated mutations resulting in the emergence of variants, including the beta (B.1.351) lineage first identified in South Africa.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> There are few published reports on the safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and other COVID-19 vaccines in people with HIV, and even fewer reports specific to people living in Africa.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Compared with HIV-negative individuals, people with HIV are at greater risk for infectious diseases, such as influenza, including during antiretroviral therapy (ART),<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and are at higher risk of a fatal outcome when admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in people with HIV include more advanced stage of HIV/AIDS, the HIV-1 infection not being virally suppressed, and CD4 counts below 500 cells per μL.</p>
              <p id="para30">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that people with HIV can choose to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but might have reduced immune responses to the vaccine,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> whereas WHO recommends that people with HIV should be immunised with COVID-19 vaccines.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although there are an estimated 38 million people with HIV globally, there is limited knowledge on the safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in this population.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This disparity is particularly pertinent to sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 80% of the global population of people with HIV live, including 7·5 million in South Africa.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>

                    <p id="para80">We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published between Jan 1, 2019, and June 29, 2021, with no language restrictions, using the terms “Safety” AND “COVID-19” AND “vaccine” AND “HIV”. Our search returned one peer-reviewed study that explored safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV in the UK, findings of which deemed the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic in people with HIV that are well controlled on antiretroviral therapy. We did not find any reports that evaluated safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in this population in Africa.</p>

                    <p id="para100">This interim analysis of the COV005 study provides novel evidence of the safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in people with and without HIV in South Africa. Because people with HIV are at greater risk for infectious diseases and are at higher risk of a fatal outcome when admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 than are the general population, our results provide reassurance of protection following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in this population. Furthermore, our results show that high neutralising antibody titres in people with HIV who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were associated with a preserved ability to neutralise the beta (B.1.351) variant of concern, though at reduced titres; which was not evident in vaccinees without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This finding is of particular value in areas with high burdens of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

                      <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>

                    <p id="para120">These interim findings are vital for informing the clinical management of people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that priming by natural infection with the ancestral virus Asp614Gly wild-type before vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 could lead to heightened neutralising antibody titres with relative preservation of activity against the beta variant compared with those who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative when receiving the first vaccine dose.</p>

All participants were required to test seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen.

                <p id="para160">The original protocol (version 1.0) included a nasal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of randomisation, irrespective of symptomatology, and blood samples taken for serology analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After 24 participants were enrolled in group 1, seven (29%) participants had positive PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 on nasal swabs collected on the day of randomisation. The protocol was, therefore, amended to include screening for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR within 96 h of randomisation, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was added as an exclusion criterion, implemented before enrolment of people with HIV began.</p>
                <p id="para170">For group 1, the sample size was increased from 50 to 70 to replace individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at randomisation during the initial phase of enrolment.

Singleplex bead-based immunoassays were developed on the Luminex platform to quantitatively measure serum IgG binding to FLS and RBD. We developed an in-house reference serum by pooling convalescent serum from adults with COVID-19. This interim reference serum was calibrated against a research reagent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (code 20/130 supplied by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Herts, UK). This research reagent for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used for the development and evaluation of serological assays for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

In people with HIV, the coprimary endpoint was cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, as assessed by quantification of serum antibody (IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 FLS protein, RBD, and virus neutralising antibody assays against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus, stratified by SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at enrolment.

Primary immunogenicity analyses included participants who received two doses of trial intervention and were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, with further analyses done in those who were RBD seropositive at baseline. Immunogenicity analyses were restricted to individuals who were not SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, with seropositive individuals included up until the time of infection at any time between day 0 and day 42. Summary statistics for demographic and clinical characteristics are reported as medians (IQR) for quantitative measurements and as counts and proportions for categorical variables. Antibody concentrations or titres are summarised as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and geometric mean titres (GMTs), respectively. We calculated 95% CIs for GMCs or GMTs by back transforming the 95% CI for log antibody concentrations or titres. We used a normal approximation method to calculate 95% CIs for proportions.</p>

For a serious event with a 0·01 rate of occurrence, the probability that zero participants will experience this event is 0·778 in each group. For the primary immunogenicity endpoint, a sample size of 25 per group would have 80% power to detect a 48% difference in response rates between two groups, if the true response rate in the unvaccinated group was 10%.

These events were less common among HIV-negative participants than in people with HIV and, in both groups, were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity, with moderate symptoms reported more often in the first 2 days after vaccination. Among both HIV-negative participants and people with HIV, there were no increases in reported local reactions after receiving the booster dose. Headache, joint and muscle pain, and weakness were the most commonly reported systemic reactions, occurring in almost a quarter of participants in the first 2 days after the priming dose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Symptoms were mild or moderate in intensity over the first 48 h in all vaccinees. Fever, rigors, and sweating, lasting up to 7 days, were less commonly reported in HIV-negative participants than in people with HIV. There were 237 adverse events in HIV-negative participants (142 placebo; 95 vaccine) compared with 164 adverse events in people with HIV (78 placebo; 86 vaccine). The most common adverse event was general system disorders not elsewhere classified in both treatment groups in HIV-negative participants and people with HIV (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 20–23</xref>).

Immunised participants showed a strong, vaccine-induced serum IgG response against FLS and RBD, regardless of HIV status, which increased with the booster dose (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>A). 28 days after the priming dose, the median FLS IgG GMC was 163·7 BAU/mL (95% CI 89·9–298·1) for people with HIV (n=36) and 112·3 BAU/mL (61·7–204·4) for HIV-negative participants (n=23).

The same analysis was not possible for the HIV-negative group because only three participants were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; although six HIV-negative participants tested seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, three were excluded because they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at the time of randomisation. At day 28, both FLS and RBD IgG concentrations increased substantially from baseline after the first dose, with modest increases seen by day 42 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 28–29</xref>). The IgG GMCs after the priming dose of ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 in people with HIV who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive at enrolment were 18·0–29·7-times higher after the priming dose and 6·5–6·8-times higher after the booster dose in people with HIV who were SARS-CoV-2 naive at baseline (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 28–29</xref>).

Of the 25 HIV-negative, SARS-CoV-2 baseline-seronegative participants, two mounted neutralising responses at day 0, with GMT neutralisation activity of inhibitory dilution 50% (ID<sub>50</sub>) 31·2 (95% CI 1·9–526·6), and 13 (59%) of 22 participants mounted neutralising responses of ID<sub>50</sub> 135·0 (54·5–334·2) by day 28.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para430">Results of this interim phase 1B/2A analysis, show that two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were well tolerated, with similar FLS-binding and RBD-binding IgG and SARS-CoV-2 neutralising response patterns in people with HIV and HIV-negative SARS-CoV-2-naive participants after priming and booster doses of the vaccine. Our findings are similar to previously reported immunogenicity of this vaccine across all adult age groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para440">Antibody responses to FLS and RBD viral proteins induced by each dose were also seen in people with HIV who had previously been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Notably, previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 in people with HIV was associated with robust immune responses after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with GMCs exceeding by 6·49–6·84 times those seen post-booster dose in vaccine recipients who were seronegative at enrolment, as similarly reported for mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in HIV-negative participants.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para450">In our trial, development of neutralising titres against the Asp614Gly wild-type strain after priming and booster doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 correlated with antibody responses to FLS and RBD viral antigens in HIV-negative participants and in people with HIV. Taken together, these findings suggest that vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 might consolidate the immune response and drive long-term immune memory, providing a protective benefit to this population against the ancestral strain, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Neutralising antibodies have been implicated as correlates of protection from COVID-19 in preclinical challenge studies<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and, in a previous clinical trial, neutralising antibodies developed against the Asp614Gly wild-type strain in more than 99% of participants after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with higher levels in boosted than in non-boosted groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, to date, no correlates of protection have been defined from clinical COVID-19 vaccine studies.</p>
              <p id="para460">The majority of adverse events reported in people with HIV and HIV-negative participants were mild or moderate in intensity, which is consistent with the reported safety profile of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Reactogenicity, which we assessed 7 days after the priming and booster doses of vaccine, was lower in HIV-negative participants than in people with HIV, with symptoms that were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. In both populations, fewer adverse events were reported after the booster dose than after the priming dose and no clinically important worsening was seen in haematology or chemistry panels compared with placebo.</p>
              <p id="para470">People with HIV have a greater risk for fatal outcome upon COVID-19-related admission to hospital<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> with higher associations in people of Black ethnicity than in non-Black individuals.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In South Africa, HIV infection has also been associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19, irrespective of HIV-1 viral load and immunosuppression.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para480">Conducting vaccine trials in Africa is vital to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines will be effective in this setting, particularly given the burden of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and the emergence of variants such as the beta variant.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In the overall analysis of the present phase 1B/2A trial, published elsewhere,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> the two-dose regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 did not show protection against non-hospitalised mild to moderate COVID-19 after infection with the beta variant in young HIV-negative adults in South Africa. In those participants, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced strong neutralising antibodies 28 days after the first dose, which increased after booster dose was given 21–35 days later, yet neutralising activity was reduced or undetected against the beta variant.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Although efficacy against severe disease caused by beta could not be assessed, in a preclinical study in hamsters, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 protected against pneumonia when animals were challenged with beta, which is consistent with protection against severe disease but not mild disease restricted to the upper respiratory tract.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">In this interim analysis, we show that, in people with HIV and HIV-negative vaccinees, vaccine-elicited binding antibodies to FLS show high level cross-reactivity for the beta variant. These results are similar to previously published results from convalescent donor plasma.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Binding antibodies might contribute to Fc effector functions, which have been implicated in preventing severe disease in convalescent donors. Whether this effect is also true of cross-reactive vaccine-elicited binding antibodies remains to be determined.</p>
              <p id="para500">Furthermore, in those vaccinated people with HIV who developed neutralising responses to Asp614Gly wild-type, neutralisation against the beta variant was retained in 50% of vaccinated participants, 80% of whom were RBD IgG seropositive at baseline, and in whom ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced high neutralising antibody titres against the original Asp614Gly wild-type strain. These observations suggest that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination in settings with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the ancestral virus could result in some protection, even against mild to moderate COVID-19 caused by the beta variant.</p>
              <p id="para510">Our study has some limitations. First, the small sample size of HIV-negative participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive, which precluded comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 seropositive participants in both groups. Second, experiments on cell-mediated immune responses in participants have not yet been completed. Previous studies have shown that spike-specific T-cell responses are induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in vaccine recipients from 7 days after the priming dose.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Third, owing to the phase 1B/2A design of this trial, a relatively risk-averse group of people with HIV receiving ART and who were virally suppressed with CD4 counts of more than 500 cells per μL were included, limiting its generalisability to the overall population of people with HIV. Finally, ART can interfere with the performance of neutralisation assays, which explains the relatively low number of people with HIV whose sera provided neutralising antibody data in this trial.</p>
              <p id="para520">Given the prevalence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, further trials in people with HIV and in South Africa, which include analyses of cellular responses, are warranted, as are additional studies to correlate vaccine-induced immunogenicity with COVID-19 protection. However, the findings from this interim analysis of administration of a COVID-19 vaccine specific to people with HIV, and specific to Africa, show favourable safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Our findings also suggest that previous exposure to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus, Asp614Gly wild-type, in people with HIV might result in a heightened immune response, including some preservation of neutralising antibody activity against the beta variant.</p>
