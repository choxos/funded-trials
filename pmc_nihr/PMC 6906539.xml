              <abstract>
                <p>Extending previous research, we applied latent profile analysis in a sample of
adults with a history of recurrent depression to identify subgroups with
distinct response profiles on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and
understand how these relate to psychological functioning. The sample was
randomly divided into two subsamples to first examine the optimal number of
latent profiles (test sample; <italic>n</italic> = 343) and then validate the
identified solution (validation sample; <italic>n</italic> = 340). In both test
and validation samples, a four-profile solution was revealed where two profiles
mapped broadly onto those previously identified in nonclinical samples: “high
mindfulness” and “nonjudgmentally aware.” Two additional subgroups, “moderate
mindfulness” and “very low mindfulness,” were observed. “High mindfulness” was
associated with the most adaptive psychological functioning and “very low
mindfulness” with the least adaptive. In most people with recurrent depression,
mindfulness skills are expressed evenly across different domains. However, in a
small minority a meaningful and replicable uneven profile indicating
nonjudgmental awareness is observable. Current findings require replication and
future research should examine the extent to which profiles change from periods
of wellness to illness in people with recurrent depression and how profiles are
influenced by exposure to mindfulness-based intervention.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Mindfulness can be conceptualized as an innate psychological capacity which arises from
the intentional direction of attention to present moment experience in a curious,
nonjudgmental, and accepting way. A number of definitions exist but most share
similarities in their descriptions of the “what” and the “how” of mindfulness as a
dispositional characteristic (<xref rid="bibr4-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer,
in press</xref>). To enhance understanding of the nature of mindfulness, its
expression in different individuals, and its consequences for psychological health, it
is critical that it can be operationalized and measured reliably. The Five Facet
Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is currently one of the most comprehensive and widely
used measures of dispositional mindfulness (<xref rid="bibr26-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Quaglia, Braun, Freeman, McDaniel, &amp; Brown,
2016</xref>). Derived from a factor analysis of items from a number of existing
mindfulness scales, the FFMQ has five facets intended to capture the key aspects of
mindfulness as a dispositional variable, labelled observing, describing, acting with
awareness, nonreactivity, and nonjudging (<xref rid="bibr6-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr5-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney,
2006</xref>).</p>
            <p>Interestingly, both early validation work and later research has shown that while the
describing, acting with awareness, nonreactivity, and nonjudging subscales consistently
load on to a higher order mindfulness factor, the observing facet functions differently
in different populations. Specifically, in samples of nonmediators the observing
subscale does not consistently correlate positively and significantly with other
mindfulness facets (e.g., <xref rid="bibr5-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer et
al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Brown, Bravo,
Roos, &amp; Pearson, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez, Wood, Stein, &amp; Rossi, 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr17-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2016</xref>) or load
on to the higher order mindfulness factor (<xref rid="bibr6-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2008</xref>), whereas in samples with
meditation experience the expected relations between observing and the other facets of
mindfulness are typically seen (e.g., <xref rid="bibr17-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
            <p>Although many studies treat mindfulness as a unidimensional construct, these findings
draw attention to the importance of considering both how the psychological skills that
together comprise the overarching construct of mindfulness develop, relate to, and
interact with one another and how they act independently and collectively to promote
positive psychological states. These issues can be considered either by examining the
predictive value of the various FFMQ facets and their interactions in relation to
external indicators of psychological functioning, or by examining the way in which
different facets of mindfulness present themselves within individuals.</p>
            <p>Taking the former approach, <xref rid="bibr14-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Eisenlohr-Moul, Walsh, Charnigo, Lynam, and Baer (2012)</xref> examined the
relationship between facets of dispositional mindfulness and alcohol and tobacco use in
students. Results showed that increased observing was associated with reduced alcohol
use when levels of nonreactivity were 1 standard deviation above the mean, but were
associated with increased alcohol use when levels of nonreactivity were 1 standard
deviation below the mean. Similar findings were also observed for tobacco use. Likewise,
a study of treatment seeking adults with <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders–Fourth edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) anxiety and/or
depressive disorders showed that nonreactivity was a significant moderator of the
association between observing and depression symptoms (but not anxiety symptoms), such
that only individuals with very low levels of nonreactivity showed a positive
relationship between observing and depressive symptoms (<xref rid="bibr13-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Desrosiers, Vine, Curtiss, &amp; Klemanski,
2014</xref>). In the same study, individuals with lower levels of nonreactivity and
higher levels of observing also showed more rumination and worry and less reappraisal.
Finally, <xref rid="bibr30-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Tomfohr, Pung, Mills, and
Edwards (2012)</xref> showed that in healthy young adults, in regression analyses
predicting levels of the inflammatory marker (Interleukin-6), there was a significant
interaction between observing and nonreactivity facets of the FFMQ. Specifically, in
individuals with nonreactivity scores 1 standard deviation above the mean, there was a
significant association between observing and lower Interleukin-6, which was attenuated
in individuals with nonreactivity scores 1 standard deviation below the mean, and no
longer significant in individuals 2 standard deviations below the mean. Together, the
above findings illustrate the potential importance of considering the interactions
between mindfulness facets for psychological health and well-being and suggest that
focusing either on the relationship between overall dispositional mindfulness score, or
isolated individual facets, and measures of psychological health may mask important,
more nuanced associations. However, the relative importance of looking at facet scores
versus total scores on the FFMQ rests in part on the degree to which subgroups,
characterized by high scores on some facets of the FFMQ alongside low scores on others,
actually exist in populations of interest.</p>
            <p>Likewise, it might be expected that such uneven profiles on the FFMQ would be observed
alongside more flat profiles. For example, mindfulness skills training programs are
often based on the premise that in cultivating the overall capacity of mindful
awareness, acquisition of particular early skills (such as stabilization of attention)
provides an important foundation for later skill development (e.g., the capacity to
relate to difficult emotional states in a nonreactive way, e.g., mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy [MBCT]; <xref rid="bibr28-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Segal,
Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2013</xref>). Thus, while different aspects of mindfulness
are regarded as mutually reinforcing, during mindfulness training, capacities assessed
by some facets of the FFMQ might be expected to increase prior to others. It is also
possible that in people who have never received mindfulness training, different
mindfulness capacities may develop asynchronously and/or be manifest to different
degrees as a result of particular neurodevelopmental or temperamental factors, or
because the presence of particular psychological disorders disrupts some capacities
(e.g., attentional control) while leaving others (e.g., the capacity to recognize and
label emotions) intact. In either case, uneven profiles might be observed for some
people, in some contexts, or at some times.</p>
            <p>Recently, initial steps to explore the issue of response profiles on the FFMQ have been
taken. Using latent profile analysis (LPA), <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson, Lawless, Brown, and Bravo (2015)</xref> and
<xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo, Boothe, and Pearson
(2016)</xref> explored subgroups characterized by different profiles on the five
facets of the FFMQ in college student samples. <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al. (2015)</xref> identified four
subgroups, which they termed the “high mindfulness” group, “low mindfulness” group,
“judgmentally observing” group, and “nonjudgmentally aware” group. The judgmentally
observing group (characterized by very low scores on nonjudging and acting with
awareness subscales, moderate scores on the describing subscale, and relatively high
scores on the observing subscale) and the low mindfulness group (characterized by
relatively low scores on all FFMQ subscales) showed the poorest psychological
well-being, while the high mindfulness group (relatively high scores on all FFMQ
subscales) and the nonjudgmentally aware group (relatively low scores on observing and
high scores on nonjudging and acting with awareness facets) showed the greatest
well-being.</p>
            <p><xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al. (2016)</xref>
subsequently confirmed the presence of the same four subgroups in a second college
student sample composed of those with and without any meditation experience.
Interestingly, the proportion of students falling into each group differed between the
nonmeditator (NM) and meditator (M) groups: “high mindfulness” group (NM = 17.34%; M =
27.94%), “low mindfulness” group (NM = 54.85%; M = 59.72%), “judgmentally observing”
group (NM = 12.87%; M = 5.50%), and “nonjudgmentally aware” group (NM = 14.94%; M =
6.84%), but the four-class solution remained the most parsimonious both across the whole
sample and in the two subgroups. These results suggest that a majority of individuals
have a relatively flat profile of mindfulness skills across the five facets of the FFMQ,
but that a significant minority (just under a third of those without meditation
experience) do show uneven profiles, with latent profiles membership appearing to be
meaningfully related to mental well-being.</p>
            <p>The above findings raise the question of whether the same four latent profiles would be
observed in samples with a clinical history, at risk of psychological distress and
dysfunction, and if so, whether the low mindfulness and judgmentally observing profiles,
identified as associated with poorer psychological well-being in college students, would
be more prevalent in such groups. This knowledge would have important implications both
for clinical research and assessment—in particular, concerning the utility of
quantifying level of dispositional mindfulness based on a single sum-score, and clinical
practice—for example, informing the extent to which programs for skill acquisition might
be personalized to an individual’s baseline profile of strengths and weaknesses in
mindfulness, where uneven profiles are observed. In addition, if individuals in at-risk
samples are found to frequently display uneven profiles this would have implications for
our understanding of the underlying construct of mindfulness and its expression.</p>
            <p>In this article, we explored latent profiles on the FFMQ in individuals at risk of
depressive relapse using baseline data from participants enrolled in two clinical trials
of MBCT for prevention of depressive relapse that shared common inclusion criteria
(<xref rid="bibr18-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken et al., 2015</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr31-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">J. M. G. Williams, Crane, et
al., 2014</xref>). In both trials, data were gathered from participants at the point
of entry to the study, prior to any exposure to a mindfulness-based intervention. In
both samples, participants were eligible if they had experienced three or more prior
episodes of depression, were currently in remission or partial remission from
depression, and were not receiving regular ongoing psychotherapy. Comorbid disorders
rendering individuals ineligible for participation were almost identical across the two
trials and both had populations with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In both
cases, participants were recruited through self-referral and primary care database
searches, with one requiring maintenance antidepressant medication at entry and one
leaving this unrestricted.</p>
            <p>We pooled data across these trials and the overall sample was then randomly divided into
two subsamples to first examine the optimal number of latent profiles (test sample) and
then validate the identified profile solution (validation sample). It was decided a
priori that the test sample would be the larger of the two subsamples. We were
interested in exploring: (a) whether the same latent profiles would be observed and
replicated in an at-risk sample with a history of recurrent depression as in the
previous studies with college students and (b) how constructs linked to mindfulness
(self-compassion, residual depressive symptoms) and clinical history would relate to
each of the latent profiles observed. We hypothesized that profiles characterized by low
levels of mindfulness across the different facets would be more evident in our sample
than the college student samples studied previously, due to the clinical history of our
participants. However, we additionally hypothesized that where the profiles observed in
our sample were similar to those identified in previous research, relationships with
external indicators of psychological functioning would be comparable.</p>

                <p>The sample consisted of participants from two trials that examined the
effectiveness of MBCT compared with control conditions at reducing relapse to
depression in people with recurrent major depressive disorder in remission
(Preventing depressive relapse in NHS settings through MBCT [PREVENT] trial;
<xref rid="bibr18-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken et al.,
2015</xref>; and Staying Well After Depression [SWAD] trial; <xref rid="bibr31-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">J. M. G. Williams, Crane, et
al., 2014</xref>). Both PREVENT and SWAD were multicenter trials, with
PREVENT recruiting from general practices in rural and urban settings in the
United Kingdom and SWAD recruiting from the community, primary care, and mental
health clinics in the regions of Oxford, England, and Bangor, North Wales.
Inclusion criteria for both trials were (a) a diagnosis of recurrent major
depressive disorder in full or partial remission according to the
<italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref rid="bibr2-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>), (b) three or more previous
depressive episodes, and (c) being 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria from
both trials were having (a) a current major depressive episode; (b) a comorbid
diagnosis of current substance misuse, organic brain damage, current or past
psychosis, current or past bipolar disorder, persistent antisocial behavior, or
persistent self-harm requiring clinical management or therapy; and (c) formal
concurrent psychotherapy.</p>
                <p>In this article, we used data from baseline measurement, prior to any exposure to
MBCT. Participants were included unless they had missing data for composite
scores on all five facets. A total of 683 participants fit the criteria (97.85%
of the total number of participants randomized to PREVENT and SWAD); 410
participants from the PREVENT trial and 273 participants from the SWAD trial.
This overall sample was randomly divided into the test sample
(<italic>n</italic> = 343) and validation sample (<italic>n</italic> = 340)
using the random sampling function in SPSS.</p>
                <p>The test sample comprised 252 women (73.5%) and 91 men (26.5%). The mean age was
46.74 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.03; range = 18-79 years) and most of the
sample was White (97.1%). In terms of educational qualifications, 16 (4.7%) had
no qualifications, 64 (18.7%) had some General Certificate of Secondary
Education/O Levels, 95 (27.7%) had some A Levels or comparable vocational
qualifications, 74 (21.6%) had a bachelor’s degree, 29 (8.5%) had a master’s
degree, and 54 (15.7%) had a doctoral degree or professional qualification. Four
participants had other qualifications and data on education were missing for
seven. The validation sample consisted of 258 women (75.9%) and 82 men (24.1%).
Mean age was 47.36 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.03; range = 18-74 years).
Most of the sample was White (97.9%). Eleven (3.2%) had no qualifications, 60
(17.6%) had some General Certificate of Secondary Education/O Levels, 119
(35.0%) had some A Levels or comparable vocational qualifications, 68 (20.0%)
had a bachelor’s degree, 31 (9.1%) had a master’s degree, and 37 (10.9%) had a
doctoral degree or professional qualification. Four participants had other
qualifications and data on education were missing for 10.</p>

of dispositional mindfulness in everyday life across five facets: observing,
describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity. Items are
rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never or very
rarely true</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very often or always true</italic>).
Sample items from each facet include “I notice the smells and aromas of
things” (observing), “I’m good at finding words to describe my feelings”
(describing), “I find myself doing things without paying attention” (acting
with awareness, negatively phrased), “I disapprove of myself when I have
illogical ideas” (nonjudging, negatively phrased), and “When I have
distressing thoughts or images, I am able just to notice them without
reacting” (nonreactivity). Following <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al. (2015)</xref>, facet scores
were computed by calculating the means of relevant item scores, rather than
summing item scores. Mean scores on FFMQ facets did not significantly differ

severity of depressive symptomatology. Each item relates to a symptom of
depression, and provides four response options, each describing an
increasingly severe presentation of the symptom. Each item is scored on a
4-point scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 3
(<italic>extreme form of each symptom</italic>). Items are summed to
give a single total score, which ranges from 0 to 63; a score of 0 to 13 is
considered to reflect minimal depression, 14 to 19 mild depression, 20 to 29
moderate depression, and 30 to 63 severe depression. Mean total scores for

maintain parsimony, latent profile models containing one to a maximum of seven
profiles were fit to the data. To determine the optimal number of latent
profiles in our test and validation samples, each model was assessed using the
following fit indices: the Akaike information criterion (AIC; <xref rid="bibr1-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Akaike, 1974</xref>), Bayesian
information criterion (BIC; <xref rid="bibr27-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz, 1978</xref>), sample-size-adjusted BIC (sBIC; <xref rid="bibr33-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Yang, 2006</xref>),
bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (BLRT; <xref rid="bibr20-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">McLachlan &amp; Peel, 2000</xref>), and
Lo–Mendell–Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT; <xref rid="bibr19-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Lo, Mendell, &amp; Rubin, 2001</xref>). Both
the BLRT and LMR-LRT evaluate whether a <italic>k</italic> profile model fits
significantly better compared with a <italic>k</italic>-1 profile model. Smaller
AIC, BIC, and sBIC values indicate better model fit. Of the likelihood-based
tests, the BLRT was found to be the better indicator of the appropriate number
of profiles and of the information criterion indices, the BIC has been found to
be a superior indicator (<xref rid="bibr24-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Nylund, Asparouhov, &amp; Muthén, 2007</xref>). In addition to using fit
indices to determine the optimal profile solution for the test and validation
samples, we examined probabilities of group classification based on the most
likely profile membership (posterior classification probabilities) for competing
models. Posterior classification probabilities range from 0 to 1, with higher
diagonal values (in a matrix of probabilities for the most likely latent profile
membership by latent profile) indicating greater confidence for the model.
Following <xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al.
(2016)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al. (2015)</xref> and to facilitate the labelling of emerging
profiles, facet means were standardized so that positive values are greater than
the mean and negative values are below the mean.</p>
                <p>On determining the optimal number of latent groups in both test and validation
samples, mean facet scores within profiles across the two samples were compared
using independent <italic>t</italic> tests and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> effect
sizes, to examine any differences between profile solutions across the samples.
The relationships between profiles and constructs related to mindfulness (SCS
and subscales, depressive symptoms, and clinical history variables) were also
examined for each sample. This was achieved by using the auxiliary variable
function in M<italic>plus</italic> (the “Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars” method, or
the “BCH” method; <xref rid="bibr9-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bolck,
Croon, &amp; Hagenaars, 2004</xref>), which tests the equality of the means
of mindfulness-related variables across the latent profiles (mean differences
across profiles) using Wald chi-square tests. This function allows the
relationships between profiles and other auxiliary variables to be explored
without directly including these variables in the model, which could distort the
model in the sense that it would not solely be defined by the latent profile
variables (i.e., FFMQ facets). The BCH method is the most robust approach and
the recommended method for examining relationships between profiles and
continuous variables (<xref rid="bibr3-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Asparouhov &amp; Muthén, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr7-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bakk &amp; Vermunt, 2016</xref>).</p>

the fit indices for the latent profile models containing one to seven
profiles fit to data from the test sample. The BLRT results were significant
for the four-profile versus three-profile comparison and the six-profile
versus five-profile comparison, but nonsignificant for the five-profile
versus four-profile comparison and the seven-profile versus six-profile
comparison. This indicates preference for the four-profile and six-profile
solutions. The BIC value was smallest for the four-profile model. The
LMR-LRT showed that a four-profile model fit significantly better than a
three-profile model and a two-profile model fit significantly better than a
one-profile solution. The sBIC and AIC values were smallest for the
seven-profile model, but continue to decrease past this model. On the whole,
and given that the BIC and BLRT have been found to be superior indicators of
the number of profiles compared with other information criterion indices and
likelihood-based tests (<xref rid="bibr24-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>), the four-profile model appeared to be the

the fit indices for the latent profile models containing one to seven
profiles fit to data from the validation sample. The BIC value was smallest
for the four-profile model. The BLRT showed that a five-profile model fit
significantly better than a four-profile model, but a six-profile model did
not fit significantly better than a five-profile model. The LMR-LRT showed
that a two-profile model fit significantly better than a one-profile
solution, and all other comparisons were nonsignificant. The sBIC and AIC
values were smallest for the seven-profile model, but continue to decrease
past the seven-profile model. On the whole, given that the BIC and BLRT have
been found to be superior indicators of the number of profiles (<xref rid="bibr24-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Nylund et al.,
2007</xref>), the four-profile or five-profile model appeared to be the
optimal solution for the current sample. Inspection of the posterior
classification probabilities showed that they were greater for the
four-profile model (.74 and above) compared with the five-profile model (.61
and above). Taken together, we decided to settle for the four-profile
solution in the validation sample.</p>

higher mean score on the mindfulness subscale compared with all other

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Previous research studies in nonclinical populations have identified four FFMQ latent
profiles: high mindfulness, low mindfulness, judgmentally observing, and
nonjudgmentally aware groups. These profiles appear to relate in meaningful ways to
measures of psychological well-being and be observed in those with and without
meditation experience (<xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et
al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et
al., 2015</xref>). We examined whether the same latent profiles were observed in
a sample comprising people with a history of recurrent depression (<xref rid="bibr18-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Kuyken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">J. M. G. Williams, Crane, et al.,
2014</xref>). LPA in test and validation samples revealed that two of the four
response profiles identified broadly mapped on to those found in the previous
nonclinical samples. These groups were labelled “high mindfulness” (9.33% of the
test sample, 15% of the validation sample) and “nonjudgmentally aware” (4.96% of the
test sample, 8.53% of the validation sample) groups. In addition, a further two
subgroups, “moderate mindfulness” (56.27% of the test sample, 60% of the validation
sample), and “very low mindfulness” (29.45% of the test sample, 16.47% of the
validation sample) were observed. Two previously identified profiles, “judgmentally
observing” and “low mindfulness” (<xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>) were not observed in
either the test or validation sample.</p>
              <p>We found largely similar profile associations with mindfulness-related constructs
across test and validation samples. In both samples, the “high mindfulness” group
was found to be the most adaptive in terms of depression and self-compassion and the
“very low mindfulness” group was found to be the least adaptive. In the test sample,
the “nonjudgmentally aware” group did not significantly differ compared with the
“high mindfulness” group in terms of depression and almost all the self-compassion
outcomes, supporting previous findings highlighting these two profiles as the most
adaptive (<xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al.,
2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al.,
2015</xref>). In the validation sample, the “nonjudgmentally aware” group was
less comparable with the “high mindfulness” group; they significantly differed on
all outcomes except for two self-compassion outcomes (self-judgment and isolation).
The greater difference between these two profiles in the validation sample could be
attributed to the finding that mean acting with awareness in the “nonjudgmentally
aware” profile was significantly smaller in the validation sample compared with the
test sample.</p>
              <p>Another point to note is that no associations were observed between latent profile
membership and either age of onset of depression, or number of previous episodes of
depression. These findings suggest that, within a sample of individuals with a
history of highly recurrent major depression, group membership was not associated
with severity of clinical course, as indexed by these variables. However, it remains
to be seen whether associations would be observed between group membership and
subsequent clinical course in individuals with a first onset of depression, or
within a more heterogeneous sample with lower overall risk of relapse.</p>
              <p>These findings highlight several issues. First, in participants with a history of
recurrent depression, few individuals in both test and validation samples (less than
10%) had uneven profiles on the FFMQ, characterized by relatively high scores on
some facets and low scores on others, yet the uneven profile identified within this
smaller group (i.e., “nonjudgmentally aware”) replicated previous research. This
pattern of findings is generally in line with the view of mindfulness as a coherent
higher order construct and, at the same time, indicates that facet profiles can
offer meaningful differentiations. As might be expected given the clinical history
of our participants, the majority fell into the very low and moderate mindfulness
groups. For those working clinically using mindfulness-based interventions, these
findings are reassuring. They suggest that gauging participants’ mindfulness skills
at entry to treatment using an overall score on the FFMQ is likely to provide a
valid assessment of mindfulness skills in most cases. Additionally, they suggest
that although individuals have different starting points, interventions designed to
enhance mindfulness skills can reasonably adopt a progressive approach in which
skills are targeted and developed in a way that makes most theoretical sense, rather
than instructors being unduly concerned that individuals will have markedly
different profiles that might suggest the need for a variety of different approaches
to integrate areas of strength and weakness.</p>
              <p>Second, in this sample, all of whom had a history of recurrent depression, a small
number of individuals (9.33% of the test sample, 15% of the validation sample) had
relatively high levels of mindfulness across all facets. Given that a significant
relationship is typically observed between indicators of psychological well-being
and levels of dispositional mindfulness (<xref rid="bibr5-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2006</xref>), the significance of this
subgroup is unclear. These individuals, while identified as being at high risk of
recurrence of depression based on their clinical history, nevertheless reported
fewer concurrent residual symptoms of depression and higher levels of
self-compassion. If it is assumed that dispositional mindfulness is stable and
trait-like, one possibility is that these participants reflect a subgroup whose
depression has a distinct etiology, or in whom previous treatments or experiences
have led, over time, to the development of greater levels of dispositional
mindfulness, and perhaps also lower levels of ongoing vulnerability. On the other
hand, if it is assumed that, at least in individuals who have not engaged in
mindfulness practices, the capacity to relate to experience mindfully is quite
fluid, it is equally possible that these participants have simply been assessed at a
time of more complete remission, with lower levels of residual depressive symptoms
(and concurring processing biases), and as such have a greater capacity for
mindfulness. It would be instructive in future research to examine whether the high
levels of dispositional mindfulness observed in such subgroups do in fact translate
into better long-term outcome in the absence of clinical intervention. Given the
relatively small proportion of individuals with recurrent depression who display
this profile any such study would likely depend on the deliberate selection and
inclusion of participants with these characteristics to ensure sufficient power.
Equally, examining latent profiles in participants assessed during an episode of
major depression, alongside the change in latent profiles as individuals move from
wellness to illness, or from illness to recovery, has the potential to provide
important information on the role of mindfulness in this disorder.</p>
              <sec id="section24-1073191117715114">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>There are a number of limitations that should be considered in the interpretation
of the results. First, previous research using LPA to explore subgroups defined
on the basis of scores on the FFMQ has focused on college student samples (<xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2016</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al.,
2015</xref>) and the current study identified a four-profile solution in
participants with a history of depression that shared some commonalities with
the profiles identified in college students, but also had distinct features.
However, we cannot conclude that the configuration of profiles identified in
this study is specific to individuals with depression. For example, these
profiles might also be observed in other clinical groups, or indeed other more
demographically heterogeneous samples. Our sample was also disproportionately
female and White, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings, and
differed from <xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al.
(2016)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al.’s (2015)</xref> samples in ways other than clinical history
and nationality (e.g., age, education level), which may have contributed to
differences between current and previous findings.</p>
                <p>Second, we used a broad range of fit indices to determine the better fitting
model in each sample and on the whole, concluded that the four-profile model
appeared to be the optimal solution in both test and validation samples.
However, fit indices did not consistently favor this model. For example, in the
validation sample, the LMR-LRT favored the two-profile model, the BLRT favored
the five-profile model, and the sBIC and AIC indicated preference for a model
containing more than seven profiles. This could be attributed to variation in
the performance ability of fit indices and we settled on the four-profile
solution in both samples based on research demonstrating that the BIC
outperformed other information criterion indices (<xref rid="bibr24-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Nylund et al., 2007</xref>) and superior
classification probabilities in the four-profile solution compared with
competing solutions. Nevertheless, the current findings require replication.
Slight differences between test and validation samples in profile indicators
(e.g., significantly higher acting with awareness in the “nonjudgmentally aware”
profile for the test sample compared with the validation sample) and
relationships between profiles and mindfulness-related variables (e.g.,
“nonjudgmentally aware” group being similarly as adaptive as the “high
mindfulness” group in the test sample, but not in the validation sample) also
underscore the need for current findings to be replicated.</p>
                <p>Third, the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes conclusions regarding
the temporal ordering of the relationships between profiles and
mindfulness-related variables (residual depressive symptoms and
self-compassion). A longitudinal design (e.g., examining transitions in profile
membership over the course of a mindfulness-based intervention) would provide a
stronger test of whether profiles (and changes in profile membership) causally
account for differences across psychological variables (and changes in these
variables over the course of intervention).</p>
                <p>Fourth, while there is some overlap between our profiles and those of <xref rid="bibr25-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al. (2015)</xref>
and <xref rid="bibr10-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al.
(2016)</xref>, this article does not explore whether the FFMQ functions in
the same way in this U.K. sample with a clinical history as in the North
American college student samples reported in these two previous articles. For
example, we have not explored differential item functioning or measure
invariance. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the measure is
functioning slightly differently in the current sample, contributing to
differences in latent profiles observed.</p>
                <p>Finally, we were limited in this study by the small number of psychological
variables that were shared across the two constituent trials from which the data
derived. Similarly, the fact that the “nonjudgmentally aware” profile comprised
small proportions of the samples meant that it was not possible to meaningfully
explore the relationship between this profile and a broader range of
psychological variables in each separate trial population independently. As a
result, future research examining the relationship between the identified
profiles and a broader range of outcomes to further validate and distinguish
profiles would be very welcome, in particular, in relation to the profile that
appears to reflect a pattern of co-occurring psychological characteristics which
would not be readily captured by the use of the FFMQ as a continuous
measure.</p>

              <sec id="section25-1073191117715114">
                <title>Future Directions</title>
                <p>As noted earlier, previous studies of interactions between FFMQ facets have shown
that relationships with external indicators of psychological functioning vary
with relative scale elevations on the FFMQ, particularly for the observing and
nonreactivity facets (e.g., <xref rid="bibr13-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Desrosiers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Eisenlohr-Moul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-1073191117715114" ref-type="bibr">Tomfohr et al., 2012</xref>).
These findings suggest that the study of participants with uneven profiles might
contribute to understanding the relationship between mindfulness and other
variables, and the initial LPA studies with student samples seem to confirm
this. In contrast, the FFMQ latent profiles we identified in our clinical sample
appear to be relatively flat for most participants, suggesting that relatively
few individuals have very high levels of one facet (e.g., observing) and
simultaneously very low levels of another facet (e.g., nonjudgment,
nonreactivity): profiles that would seem, on the basis of these previous
studies, to be those that might be particularly informative for understanding
nuanced associations between dispositional mindfulness and outcomes of interest.
However, our findings do not rule out the possibility that variations in a
particular facet might be more predictive of a maladaptive outcome when
occurring in the context of some latent profiles rather than others. For
example, hypothetically, variations in nonreactivity might be more predictive of
relationship functioning for those in the “very low mindfulness” latent profile,
than for those in the “high mindfulness” latent profile—despite the fact that
levels of relationship functioning may be greater, overall, in the “high
mindfulness” group. Examining such associations is a question for further work
and has the potential to provide interesting insights into the way in which
particular mindfulness skills support adaptive functioning in different broader
dispositional contexts.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Research exploring the potential utility of LPA as a tool to investigate the nature
and correlates of mindfulness skills is in its early stages. On the basis of the
findings of the current study, it remains unclear to what extent LPA adds
significantly to the understanding of mindfulness in individuals with recurrent
depression that might be obtained from the treatment of mindfulness, as assessed by
the FFMQ, as a single higher order construct. However, this study extends previous
finding to a population not previously studied with LPA. In addition, the study
identified an interesting subgroup of participants who, despite having a clinical
history of severe recurrent depression, nevertheless reported high levels of
mindfulness. Longitudinal research is required to investigate whether the FFMQ
profiles identified here change with treatment or as participants shift between
depressive episodes and periods of wellness, and what the implications of high
levels of dispositional mindfulness might be for the longer term outcomes of
participants with a history of severe recurrent depression.</p>
