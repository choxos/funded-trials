                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is offered to all patients with a psychosis diagnosis. However, only a minority of psychosis patients in England and Wales are offered CBT. This is attributable, in part, to the resource-intensive nature of CBT. One response to this problem has been the development of CBT in brief formats that are targeted at a single symptom and are deliverable by briefly trained therapists. We have developed Guided self-help CBT (the GiVE intervention) as a brief form of CBT for distressing voices and reported evidence for the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) when the intervention was delivered by briefly trained therapists (assistant psychologists). This study will investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the GiVE intervention when delivered by assistant psychologists following a brief training.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel group, superiority RCT comparing the GiVE intervention (delivered by assistant psychologists) and treatment as usual to treatment as usual alone, recruiting across three sites, using 1:1 allocation and blind post-treatment and follow-up assessments. A nested qualitative study will develop a model for implementation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">If the GiVE intervention is found to be effective when delivered by assistant psychologists, this intervention could significantly contribute to increasing access to evidence-based psychological interventions for psychosis patients. Furthermore, implementation across secondary care services within the UK’s National Health Service may pave the way for other symptom-specific and less resource-intensive CBT-informed interventions for psychosis patients to be developed and evaluated.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par28">Approximately 300,000 people in England and Wales have a diagnosis of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The symptoms of psychosis such as paranoid delusions and hearing voices (hereafter referred to as distressing voices) cause significant distress and disability and contribute to an increased risk of physical health problems and early mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and suicide rates up to twelve times greater than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The overall annual societal cost of psychosis in England has been estimated at £11.8 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has robust evidence for clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to promote the recovery of psychosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, implementation in the UK is extremely poor, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] with only 26% of psychosis patients being offered CBTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One reason for this lack of access is limited resources, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as CBTp is resource-intensive in relation to its duration (minimum of 16 sessions recommended by NICE) and delivery (by highly trained therapists—who are trained over a 2–3-year period).</p>
                <p id="Par30">NICE recommend research into two issues that could potentially reduce the resources required to deliver CBTp to psychosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Firstly, the duration of CBTp—how many sessions are required to generate sufficient benefit (research recommendation 9.4.11.1)? Our meta-analysis of 10 controlled studies indicated that CBTp delivered over less than the recommended 16 sessions is effective in reducing psychosis symptoms when delivered by highly trained therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This focus upon brief forms of CBTp has recently been taken forward through the development of single-symptom therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] which target only one specific psychotic symptom, with some promising early results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Secondly, the ability of “briefly trained” practitioners to deliver CBTp—can CBTp be delivered by a more cost-effective alternative workforce (i.e., not highly trained therapists) (research recommendation 9.4.11.2)? Evidence suggests that frontline practitioners with case management responsibilities can struggle to fulfil this role as outcomes from trials have been inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and there are competing demands upon their time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Psychology graduates, however, are well-positioned to undertake such a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] as there is a large number of psychology graduates in the UK; their degree provides them with training in psychological models of emotion and behaviour; they can be readily employed in assistant psychologist (AP) roles at lower cost than highly trained therapists; and they do not have case management responsibilities.</p>
                <p id="Par31">We have packaged CBTp in a brief and structured form that is targeted at the specific psychotic symptom of distressing voices. We collaborated with people with lived experience of psychosis and/or distressing voices to turn our self-help CBT book (Overcoming Distressing Voices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) into a workbook (An Introduction to Self-help for Distressing Voices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) and created the Guided self-help CBT intervention for distressing VoicEs (the GiVE intervention). We initially evaluated the GiVE intervention when delivered by highly trained therapists, as this allowed the evaluation to focus exclusively upon CBT packaged in this form, rather than any interaction between the GiVE intervention and delivery by briefly trained therapists. The findings from a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of GiVE compared to usual care (<italic>N</italic> = 28) were encouraging with high levels of retention, and a very large between-group effect for the predetermined primary outcome of negative voice-impact (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our next step was to evaluate the GiVE intervention when delivered by a cost-effective and widely available workforce of APs. We conducted a three-arm, multi-site feasibility RCT comparing the GiVE intervention (delivered by APs over 8 sessions) to a Supportive Counselling intervention (delivered by the same APs over 8 sessions—the active control intervention) and to treatment-as-usual (TAU). The progression criteria were met and suggested that clinicians were willing to refer psychosis patients to the trial, that patients could be retained within the trial at post-treatment and that the APs could adhere to therapy and supervision protocols. A signal of efficacy favouring the GiVE intervention in comparison to both the Supportive Counselling intervention (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.77) and TAU (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.49) was evident at post-treatment (16 weeks after randomisation) for the candidate primary outcome (voice-related distress) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The lessons learnt from the feasibility RCT have informed the design of the current study.</p>
                <p id="Par32">If the GiVE intervention is found to be clinically and cost-effective in the current study when delivered by APs, it could substantially increase the number of psychosis patients that are able to access and engage with the principles of CBT, which will generate benefits for psychosis patients and the NHS.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par33">The long-term aim of this research is to increase access to CBTp for psychosis patients; this will be achieved by evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a brief and targeted CBT-informed intervention that can be delivered by a less costly and widely available workforce of APs following a brief training in the delivery of the intervention and ongoing supervision. CBT-informed interventions offered to psychosis patients in less resource-intensive forms as part of an evidence-based intervention pathway will generate benefits for (1) individual patients (reduced distress and enhanced recovery); (2) service-level patient benefit (increased access to evidence-based psychological therapies); and (3) economic benefits to the NHS (in terms of the reduced use of high-cost mental health services).</p>
                <p id="Par34">The proposed study will evaluate the following hypothesis: In comparison to usual care, is the GiVE intervention effective at treating distressing voices when delivered to psychosis patients by briefly trained APs?</p>

                  <title>Guided self-help intervention for voices (GiVE)</title>
                  <p id="Par54">The intervention is described in our published workbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and will consist of 10 one-hour sessions of the GiVE intervention over a 16-week period, delivered by APs in NHS clinics, participants’ own homes or other community locations as preferred and appropriate. Where participants express a preference for the intervention to be delivered remotely (by videocall or phone), this preference will be honoured. GiVE is a psychological intervention that targets the mechanisms that have been empirically found to maintain voice-related distress—negative beliefs about voices, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] negative beliefs about self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and negative relating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. After the introductory sessions (including a focus upon coping), the intervention will cover three core modules: (1) beliefs about the self, (2) beliefs about voices and (3) relationships. Modules (1) and (2) draw upon psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural strategies to help participants to re-evaluate the accuracy of their negative or unhelpful beliefs related to the self and voices. Module (3) additionally involves work on how to relate to others and voices more assertively.</p>
                  <p id="Par55">A participant will have received sufficient ‘exposure’ to the intervention if they have attended a minimum of 6 of the 10 sessions.</p>
                  <p id="Par56">Participants will be provided with a copy of the workbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and companion self-help book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and will be ‘guided’ through the structured content of the workbook by an AP—with encouragement to complete between-session exercises in the workbook and to read relevant chapters of the self-help book. Participants will also have the opportunity to access the ‘CHOICES’ mobile phone application. The ‘CHOICES’ app was developed by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to support the learning of patients within its clinical services. The app has been revised for use in this trial and aims to support the continued use of strategies that have been learnt through the GiVE intervention. If participants have a smart/ iPhone and are familiar with accessing mobile phone apps, the AP will provide them with a guide to access the CHOICES app. The research team will have no access to the data entered by participants into the app.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">Consistent with the previous recommendations from Experts-by-Experience (EBEs), we will recruit APs who have some experience of working as an AP with patients with complex needs. The APs will receive a brief 3-day training in the delivery of the GiVE intervention facilitated by the Chief Investigator. The training will include 1 introductory day (covering the experience of distressing voices and CBT principles) and 2 days on the GiVE intervention (covering the content of the workbook) and will be delivered to all APs at the same time.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Two APs will offer the GiVE intervention at each site. The APs will be offered weekly clinical supervision by the Site Leads, including both 1:1 supervision at site and group supervision at both site and remotely across sites. Participants in the GiVE arm will continue to receive treatment as usual (described below) throughout their participation in the study.</p>

                <p id="Par60">The intervention may be discontinued if the participant requests this or if the AP judges, in consultation with the wider supervisory team, that the intervention is associated with a significant worsening of mental health. In this case, an adverse event form would also be completed. It will be made clear to each participant that, should they find any aspect of the research distressing, including the intervention, and/or no longer wish to continue, they will be able to withdraw without this impacting on their usual clinical care in any way.</p>

                <p id="Par61">Therapeutic drift will be minimised by the structure and detail of the workbook and close supervision of the APs by the Site Leads. Adherence to the workbook will be assessed through APs completing a session checklist at the conclusion of each session. All therapy sessions will be audio-recorded (with the participant’s consent—which will be verbally re-affirmed at the beginning of each therapy session) and a random 10% sample rated for adherence and competence by an independent CBT expert. These recordings will be rated for adherence using the session checklist. In addition to providing an independent assessment of the AP’s delivery of the session content, cross-referencing of the self-report and independently rated checklists will offer insights about the ability of APs to monitor their own performance. Session recordings will also be rated for competence using a version of the Cognitive Therapy Scale-Revised (CTS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] that has been adapted for use within the training of ‘lower-intensity’ therapists within the NHS Talking Therapies services within Sussex.</p>

                <p id="Par117">To estimate the power for a design with clustering in one arm only, we used the following parameters: 6 therapists each with a caseload of 8 participants completing follow-up assessments, an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], an equally sized group (for maximum efficiency) of 6 × 8 = 48 unclustered participants for the treatment as usual arm (ICC = 0), a 5% significance level, adjusted variance from Step 1, i.e. 0.663, a medium effect size of Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.5.

                <p id="Par119">Participants will be recruited through referrals from the Care Coordinators (CC) of psychosis patients (or other appropriate members of the clinical team) in the three sites. CCs will be given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and referral forms when first approached about the study by an RA. CCs will be asked to share the PIS during face-to-face and remote consultations with any patients who are potentially eligible for the study. If a patient shows an interest in the study and gives their verbal agreement to be contacted by an RA, the CC will be asked to facilitate the completion of a referral form. Once a referral has been received by the research team, the potential participant will be contacted by the RA to discuss the study further and arrange a consent and eligibility meeting. The potential participant will have a copy of the PIS at least 24 h before the consent and eligibility meeting, so they will have time to read the information, discuss it with friends and family, and formulate any questions they may have.</p>
                <p id="Par120">The consent and eligibility meeting will be completed face-to-face, unless a patient expresses a preference for a remote meeting. At this meeting, potential participants will read through the PIS with the RA to ensure they have understood the study and can ask questions. Potential participants will be invited to consent to take part in the study by reading and signing three copies of the consent form: one for the research study to be filed in the study file, one for the participant to keep and one for the participant’s care team to be emailed to the Care Coordinator and uploaded to the electronic health records. If the meeting is conducted remotely, the patient will consent verbally, and three copies of the consent form will be completed and distributed by the RA.</p>
                <p id="Par121">Eligibility data will be entered into an online platform (called REDCap) during the meeting and be accessible by the Brighton &amp; Sussex Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). Patients will be offered reimbursement of £20 for attending the consent and eligibility meeting and travel expenses will be made available.</p>
                <p id="Par122">An additional recruitment strategy at the Sussex site will involve the use of the Everyone Counts scheme. SPFT has the Everyone Counts scheme in place for consent to contact patients about research opportunities directly. The Everyone Counts scheme is viewed as being a task in the public interest and as such has been approved by the SPFT Trust Board after consultation with the Information Governance Lead. Members of the Research &amp; Development Department will contact potentially eligible patients to discuss the study and invite them to take part. The report of potential participants is only accessible to a limited number of authorised individuals in the R&amp;D Department. Interested patients will be able to contact either the R&amp;D Department or the research team directly and enquire about the study. They will be invited to discuss the study with their CC who can then complete a referral form. The research team could support potential participants to discuss the study with their CC if this is needed.</p>
                <p id="Par123">An additional strategy will be used in PCFT, whereby individuals who have participated in other trials within the Trust and have given consent to be contacted about future studies may be contacted.</p>

To test the success of blinding, the RA who assesses each participant will be asked to guess the allocation group for the participant at the end of the final assessment.

                  <title>Development of the model for future implementation</title>
                  <p id="Par156">The development of an implementation model will use a Normalisation Process Theory framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and build on the key findings from the process evaluation conducted within the feasibility RCT. Specifically, referring clinicians proposed that the GiVE intervention should be embedded into routine service, and be clearly positioned as a CBT-informed intervention, delivered in close collaboration with both CCs (who could further consolidate and support learning after the completion of the GiVE intervention) and highly trained therapists (who could offer subsequent CBTp, where needed). With this in mind, the development of the implementation model will involve two components. Initially, over a six-month period, a series of stakeholder group consultations will be conducted with policy makers, clinicians and highly trained therapists. We will aim to recruit 8–15 stakeholders including at least 2 each of policy makers, CC referrers and expert therapists. Policy makers will be recruited from the national advisory groups involved in developing new psychological therapy roles. CCs and expert therapy leads will be recruited from study sites. Participants will meet either in person or online. Participants will be invited to take part in an interview where they will review the model and consider approaches to implementation in terms of: coherence with current provision; cognitive participation; collective action; and reflexive monitoring. Interviews will be facilitated by either one (individual) or two (small-group) researchers and guided by a topic-guide based on NPT theory. They will be audio-recorded and recordings saved in a manner that is consistent with study and Trust protocols. Audio recordings will be transferred as soon as possible to secure NHS or University servers. Once transcribed, audio-recorded interviews will be deleted. Data will be analysed thematically using a thematic framework analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par157">Analysis of the transcripts from the consultations will produce a list of potential components of the model and considerations for implementation. A subsequent Delphi consultation, conducted over three months, will be implemented with these same consultants to reach consensus, especially where there were differences of opinion on the core components of the model derived from the qualitative findings, on which there is a group consensus. An online questionnaire format will elicit ratings of the feasibility and importance, and qualitative feedback on key components of the model. A second round will share key learning from the first round to encourage consensus on the final model. The model will be written-up during the final three months of the proposed study.</p>

                  <p id="Par158">A qualitative evaluation will aim to identify barriers and facilitators that may exist for participants when making use of the self-help resources that comprise the GiVE intervention, namely the CHOICES app, the self-help book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the workbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An increasing number of psychological interventions for symptoms of psychosis are making use of ‘Therapeutic Resources’ (equipment that facilitates a psychological intervention partially or wholly independent of contact from a therapist). The CHOICES app, the self-help book and workbook are examples of Therapeutic Resources (TR). It is therefore important to know what might help and hinder engagement in using TR such as those within the GiVE intervention. Enablers and barriers to engagement with TR have been identified in other trials (digital TR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]), and also within the GiVE series of trials (paper-based TR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]). However, there has been no attempt to explore the experiences of participants when they are offered a suite of both digital and paper-based TRs. This leaves important gaps in knowledge when considering the training and supervision of therapists who are delivering interventions that make use of TR as a core part of the intervention, and the implementation of guided self-help interventions in a psychosis population.</p>
                  <p id="Par159">This evaluation will aim to explore the experiences via an opportunity sample of 15 participants who: 1) are allocated to the GiVE intervention arm of the trial; 2) have given consent to be contacted for further research when initially consenting to participate within the trial; and 3) have completed the 28-week assessment. Eligible participants will be identified by the TM and invited to participate in the evaluation by an RA. Eligible participants expressing interest will be contacted by a researcher to obtain informed consent to be part of the qualitative evaluation.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par170">CBTp is an evidence-based psychological therapy recommended for psychosis patients within the UK. However, only a minority of patients are offered CBTp. Limited resources have been cited as a prominent reason for this lack of access, leading to calls for shorter forms of CBTp to be developed that can be delivered by briefly trained therapists.</p>
              <p id="Par171">We have responded to this call by developing a brief and targeted form of CBTp for distressing voices – Guided, self-help intervention for voices (‘GiVE’). Findings from a feasibility RCT suggested that evaluation of the GiVE intervention is feasible when the intervention is delivered by briefly trained therapists (in the form of APs). The current study will offer evidence concerning the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the GiVE intervention when delivered to psychosis patients by APs.</p>
              <p id="Par172">CBTp offered in less resource-intensive forms has the potential to generate benefits for: 1) individual patients (reduced distress and enhanced recovery and enhanced quality of life); 2) service-level patient benefit (increased access to evidence-based psychological therapies); and 3) economic benefits to the NHS (in terms of the reduced use of mental health inpatient services).</p>
