                <p id="Par1">Methotrexate (MTX) is a common first-line treatment for new-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, MTX is ineffective for 30â40% of patients and there is no way to know which patients might benefit. Here, we built statistical models based on serum lipid levels measured at two time-points (pre-treatment and following 4Â weeks on-drug) to investigate if MTX response (by 6Â months) could be predicted. Patients about to commence MTX treatment for the first time were selected from the Rheumatoid Arthritis Medication Study (RAMS). Patients were categorised as good or non-responders following 6Â months on-drug using EULAR response criteria. Serum lipids were measured using ultraâperformance liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry and supervised machine learning methods (including regularized regression, support vector machine and random forest) were used to predict EULAR response. Models including lipid levels were compared to models including clinical covariates alone. The best performing classifier including lipid levels (assessed at 4Â weeks) was constructed using regularized regression (ROC AUC 0.61âÂ±â0.02). However, the clinical covariate based model outperformed the classifier including lipid levels when either pre- or on-treatment time-points were investigated (ROC AUC 0.68âÂ±â0.02). Pre- or early-treatment serum lipid profiles are unlikely to inform classification of MTX response by 6Â months with performance adequate for use in RA clinical management.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Without early and effective treatment rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to irreversible joint damage and poor long-term outcomes, including work disability and risk of premature mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The treatment pathway for RA starts with synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (scDMARDs), including methotrexate (MTX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. If disease symptoms are not controlled effectively by MTX, patients are then escalated to more expensive biologic drugs or targeted small molecule inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, regardless of the class of treatment, each drug comes with a significant non-response rate and it is currently not possible to predict which patient will benefit from treatment with a particular drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Although MTX has been licensed for use in RA for more than two decades, few demographic and clinical associations with MTX response have been established. A positive rheumatoid factor titre, high health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score, a high number of tender joints and higher depression and anxiety before starting on MTX are predictive of non-response after 6Â months on drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, these factors do not predict MTX non-response perfectly and it is likely that other disease- or patient-related factors also influence treatment outcome. For example, the application of genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to RA has expanded our understanding of important pathophysiological processes underpinning disease development, progression and response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Metabolomics and lipidomics are emergent approaches for studying pathophysiology and patient stratification in RA. Such profiling of biofluids from RA patients has the potential to identify disease processes that underpin important clinical outcomes. For example, serum lipids have been reported to correlate with response to TNFi in RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, metabolomics studies of MTX response in RA have so far been limited to fewer than 40 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and, to our knowledge, no lipidomic specific study applying machine learning algorithms to predict MTX treatment response in RA exists in the literature. The aim of this study was thus to determine if future MTX response can be predicted from ultra-performance liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) derived serum lipidomic data by applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods, under robust nested cross-validation.</p>

                <p id="Par5">In total, 100 patients were recruited from the Rheumatoid Arthritis Medication Study (RAMS) cohort, a multi-centre 1-year prospective observational study investigating predictors of response to MTX in UK patients with RA. To be eligible for RAMS patients must be over the age of 18Â years and have a physician diagnosis of RA or undifferentiated polyarthritis. Since 2009, patients who are about to start MTX for the first time are asked to provide demographic, clinical and psychological data as well as blood samples to permit DNA, RNA and serum-based biomarker studies. Once collected and processed, serum samples were stored in barcode-labelled tubes at â 80Â Â°C and recorded on a fully integrated laboratory management system. Serum was collected from patients at the baseline (pre-treatment) visit and following 4Â weeks on treatment. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Central Manchester NHS Research Ethics Committee (reference 08/H1008/25), all patients provided written informed consent and all methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.</p>

The baseline clinical assessment included collection of patient demographics and a 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> was measured. Dose of MTX and MTX start date was also recorded. Patients complete a questionnaire including the HAQ. Similar patient-centred data were collected at 6Â months following initiation of MTX therapy. The DAS28 was calculated again at 6Â months and established EULAR response criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> were applied to categorize patients into good (nâ=â50) or non-responders (nâ=â50).</p>

                <title>Lipid profiling</title>
                <p id="Par7">Serum samples were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry (UPLCâMS) following previously described sample preparation, analytical, and quality control (QC) procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Each set of sample analyses were performed in an order designed to be orthogonal to clinical and demographic data of potential significance with respect to the study design and outcome. Serum samples were prepared as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> for the separation of lipophilic analytes (e.g., complex and neutral lipids) by reversed-phase chromatography (lipid RPC). For quality control and pre-processing, a pooled QC sample was prepared by combining equal parts (25 Î¼L) of each study sample. In brief, 50âÎ¼L aliquots were taken from each sample and the pooled QC and diluted 1:1 v/v with ultrapure water. Protein was removed by addition of organic solvent (diluted sample/isopropanol in 1:4 v/v ratio) and a mixture of method-specific authentic chemical standards were added at the protein precipitation step in order to monitor and evaluate data quality during and after the acquisition respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Serum analyses were performed on ACQUITY UPLC instruments (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) coupled to Xevo G2âS Q-TOF mass spectrometers (Waters Corp., Manchester, UK) via a Zâspray electrospray ionisation (ESI) source operating in both positive and negative ion modes to generate lipid positive (lipid RPC+) and negative (lipid RPCâ) datasets. Lipid separation was conducted using a 2.1âÃâ100Â mm BEH C8 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) (further details on the UPLC method and MS parameters can be found in Izzi-Engbeaya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). Pooled QC samples were acquired at 10 study sample intervals during sample analyses. An additional set of QC sample dilutions was created from the pooled QC (10âÃâ100%, 5âÃâ80%, 3âÃâ60%, 3âÃâ40%, 5âÃâ20%, 10âÃâ1%) and analysed at the start and end of each set of sample analyses for assessment of analyte response.</p>

                  <p id="Par14">Machine learning models were built to classify MTX response at 6Â months using serum lipid profiles at pre-treatment, following 4Â weeks on drug and by taking the difference in serum lipid levels between the 4-week and pre-treatment sample. Models including metabolite levels were compared to models including the following clinical parameters: MTX start dose, steroid use at inclusion, BMI, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, CRP levels, patientsâ assessment of their overall wellbeing, sex, age-at-inclusion, age-at-onset, disease duration, HAQ score and pre-treatment smoking habits. For each contrast, we employed three state-of-the-art machine learning methods: random forest, a kernel-based approach (i.e. radial kernel support vector machine) and regularized logistic regression, a strategy that uses a loss function designed to drop the features that are not predictive. Each model was run under a fivefold nested cross-validation scheme (where hyper-parameters were computed in each of the strata using an inner fivefold cross validation loop, with the default <italic>tuneGrid</italic> parameters in the <italic>caret</italic> library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and a <italic>tuneLength</italic> of 100) to give accurate estimates of predicted performance. Model performance is reported using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; the average ROC area under the curve (AUC) is reported along with the standard errors of the mean (Â±âSE). All ROC AUCs reported throughout were calculated using the out-of-sample cross-validation folds.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par18">In this study, one of the largest lipidomic studies of MTX response in RA to date, we applied advanced statistical methods to serum lipidomic profiling data generated at pre-treatment and following 4Â weeks on drug in patients receiving MTX for their RA. By assessing the various methods used, we conclude that serum lipid levels present at pre-treatment or during early treatment are unlikely to be useful for classifying future response to MTX in the setting of routine clinical care. None of the metabolites tested were associated with MTX response when tested individually or when considered together by taking a machine learning approach.</p>
              <p id="Par19">To our knowledge, the previous largest metabolomics study of MTX response included 38 patients (25 good-responders and 13 non-responders)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In that small study, on-treatment serum levels of 11 metabolites were found to co-vary with MTX response, measured at the same time-point (24Â weeks). Larger and more recent metabolomics study, which included a targeted lipidomic approach, have focussed on TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) treatment response in RA. For example, Cuppen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> investigated pre-treatment serum metabolites as potential predictors of TNFi response in 105 RA patients (55 good-responders and 50 non-responders at 6-months). In that study, four metabolites, selected from 139 analysed, improved classification of response (average ROC-AUC 0.84), compared to models including clinical data only (average ROC-AUC 0.72). A study by Tatar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> analysed pre-treatment plasma samples from 140 RA patients (100 good-responders and 40 non-responders at 6-months). In our lipid-focussed study we were able to extract peaks for one of the 11 serum metabolites in the study by Wang (cholesterol); two of the four metabolites found to improve classification of response to TNFi in the Cuppen et al. study (sn1-LPC 18:3/0:0 and sn1-LPC 15:0/0:0), and two metabolites detected in the study by Tatar et al. (C24H52NO6P and C18H34O2). None of these metabolites were associated with MTX response in the current study (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Although these findings require replication in independent samples, the fact that these were not found to improve classification of response to MTX in our study implies either a context (i.e. assessment of a later time-point is needed e.g. 24-weeks) or drug specific (i.e. TNFi rather than MTX) utility.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The strengths of the current study include a large sample size (nâ=â100), robust acquisition of lipidomic data at two time-points (pre-treatment and also during early treatment), rigorous internal model validation by nested cross-validation, a focus on a single drug and profiling of a large number of features (nâ=â3,366). A limitation to the current study is that modest differences in MTX start dose were observed between responder groups at baseline. However, MTX start dose, along with other important clinical features, was adjusted for in the regression analysis to minimise any potential effects. We do not think modest differences in start dose resulted in altered lipid profiles. If this were the case we would have observed differences when classifying response using models that were built using lipid levels as input. A further limitation is random sampling. Serum samples were taken as part of routine clinical care; therefore, trough sampling was not possible and patients were not asked to fast prior to sample collection. A further limitation was that the on-treatment sampling time-point was arbitrarily decided. As discussed above, serum metabolites have been observed to co-vary with MTX response when later time-points are assessed (i.e. 24-weeks)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It could be that a later time-point may have revealed greater differences than the 4-week sample assessed here. However, the sampling strategy in the current study is in keeping with that performed as part of routine clinical care and the 4-week time-point was chosen because early classification of likely response to MTX was a study aim. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that better performance may have been achieved if samples were taken at a different time or preprandial following overnight fast. Alternatively, it could be that the lipidome is simply not substantially altered during early MTX therapy for RA. A more broad-scale metabolomics approach might be necessary to improve prediction performance, or a different approach, for example targeting proteomic biomarkers, may be warranted.</p>
