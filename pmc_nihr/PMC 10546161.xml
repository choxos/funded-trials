                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) affects around 150 000 people in the UK of whom around 50% require treatment with biologics. The most used biologics for PsA target tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-17A (IL-17A). About 50% of patients respond to each, but it is not currently possible to predict response for individual patients, necessitating sequential treatment steps. A recent proof of concept study in PsA suggested that using peripheral immunophenotype to choose therapy could improve time to treatment response.</p>
                  <p>This study will test the hypothesis, within an open-label parallel-group biomarker-stratified multicentre randomised controlled trial, which the baseline proportion of CD4+T cells with an activated type 17 immunophenotype (Th17 levels) predicts response to IL-17A or TNF inhibitors in PsA. Additional analyses will identify if the model can be refined by combining additional clinical and immunophenotypic factors. Statistical modelling will be used to predict the likely effectiveness of these approaches compared with standard care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Patients with PsA eligible to start their first biologic as part of standard care are recruited and baseline blood tests are taken for immunophenotyping. Participants are stratified equally by Th17 levels and randomised 1:1 to receive either TNF (adalimumab) or IL-17A (secukinumab) inhibitors. The primary analysis will establish the interaction between baseline immunophenotype and treatment on the primary outcome (achievement of minimal disease activity criteria at week 24). In secondary analysis, modelling will identify if this prediction model can be optimised further by incorporating clinical phenotypes and additional immunophenotyping techniques.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval for the study was granted by the North West Preston Research Ethics Committee (ref 21/NW/0016). Dissemination will be via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications, aiming to impact on treatment guidelines.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in ~15% of people with psoriasis, affecting around 150 000 people in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Two-thirds of people with PsA suffer joint damage with associated disability<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> similar to levels reported for rheumatoid arthritis.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> PsA is associated with reduced life expectancy<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and average direct healthcare costs of £2400 per patient with indirect costs of &gt;£8000 annually.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>The current treatment of PsA follows an empiric ‘step up’ ‘trial-and-error’ approach using different conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) followed by biologic DMARDs if patients do not respond.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> Approximately 50% of patients with PsA will require biologic therapy<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> with four key mode of action drugs available. The most commonly used biologic treatments for PsA target one of two main immunological pathways: tumour necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL) 17. Arthritis response rates to both drugs are similar, with 60%–70% of patients achieving at least a partial response. In clinical practice, biologic therapies need to be used for a minimum of 12–16 weeks before response can be evaluated,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> with assessment of achievement of treatment target later.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> For many patients this means protracted administration of a therapy that may never work, in addition to financial and clinical National Health Service (NHS) costs.</p>
              <p>Two head-to-head parallel-group randomised studies comparing TNF and IL-17A inhibitors in PsA have been performed showing no significant differences in peripheral arthritis outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Currently, clinicians select therapies based on a limited clinical phenotype, such as differentiation in skin psoriasis, comorbidities, personal experience and cost. Despite similar responses at a group level, we know that some people who fail to respond to a first biologic will have a good response when they switch to a drug with a different mechanism of action,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> suggesting that disease immunopathogenesis varies between individuals. However, treatment in these studies was randomly allocated, with only one previous study in PsA with any precision medicine element.</p>
              <p>This study in Japan evaluated the use of baseline CD4+T cell immunophenotype characteristics to inform selection of biologic therapy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> They defined four groups based on predetermined cut-offs for high and low levels of Th1 and Th17 cells, based on quartiles in healthy controls. Sixty-four patients with patients starting biologic therapy were randomly divided into a standard care group (IL-12/23, IL-17A or TNF inhibitors) and a precision medicine group (n=26) in which the choice of therapy was based on the peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis. The precision medicine group had significantly higher rates of ACR20 response and low disease activity, although other measures, including psoriasis responses, were not significantly different. The study was not powered to compare the treatment groups and did not include a prespecified primary outcome. However, the results are promising, and the study urgently requires confirmation.</p>
              <p>A more rational approach to treatment selection has the potential to make a substantial contribution to patient care by increasing the chance of identifying the biologically rational treatment for the patient. Thus, the primary aim of the Optimising Psoriatic arthritis Therapy with Immunological Methods to Increase Standard EvaluationOPTIMISE) study is to identify a peripheral immunophenotype that can predict response to biological therapy in PsA and facilitate a stratified approach to treatment.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>Our primary objective is to establish the interaction between baseline immunophenotype (proportion of CD4+T cells with an activated Th17 cell profile) and treatment (IL-17A or TNF inhibitor therapy) on the proportion of PsA patients achieving the minimal disease activity (MDA) criteria at week 24 (primary outcome).</p>
                <p>Our secondary objectives will compare responses to both medications dependent on intracellular IL-17 levels and immune-subset transcriptomic signatures to see if additional immunological markers can predict response to either drug. Treatment response from a patient’s perspective is assessed through patient-reported outcome measures. We will also explore changes in the immunological markers with treatment and assess if these correlate with clinical response. These objectives are all summarised in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>Prior to randomisation, we record the therapy that was planned by the physician if they had not been recruited to the trial.</p>
                <p>Eligible and consented patients are randomised centrally by clinical trial unit staff using the bespoke computerised trial unit-specific randomisation system. Patients are randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either TNF (adalimumab) or IL-17A (secukinumab) inhibitor. The randomisation uses a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation across the treatment groups, stratified by activated Th17 proportion (≤/&gt; 1.58%), psoriasis severity (psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) &lt; or ≥10) and study centre. The minimisation algorithm will include a probabilistic element and a small number of participants randomised by simple randomisation at the start of the trial to seed the algorithm to ensure the unpredictability of treatment allocation. There is no blinding of therapy allocation for patients or clinicians, so no allocation code or code-breaking procedure is required; however, the baseline immunophenotype data will be blinded from all participants and clinical study site personnel, while laboratory staff will be blinded to the allocated therapy. Unblinding should not be required during the study as it will not have clinical relevance to treatment decisions.</p>

              <sec id="s2-4">
                <title>Interventions, patient follow-up, visits and trial procedures</title>
                <p>Following consent, patients undergo a baseline clinical assessment and blood is taken for immunophenotyping. Fresh peripheral blood samples (50 mL) are couriered to one of the three laboratory hub sites (Oxford, Glasgow, London) for processing within 6 hours and are then cryopreserved for mechanistic cellular work (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) or whole-blood RNA sequencing). Our preliminary analysis shows that peripheral Th17 surface and intracellular signatures at 6 hours are comparable to freshly isolated samples. The measurement of the biomarker will be processed simultaneously with local processing of standard clinical safety screening for biological therapies (eg, hepatitis/TB screening), avoiding delay to patients’ treatment.</p>
                <p>Analysis will be performed on cryopreserved samples rather than fresh samples to allow standardisation across centres, avoid delays to samples arriving late in the day and avoid issues with temporary unavailability of essential laboratory machinery such as flow cytometers. In the primary laboratory analysis, the samples will undergo 10 colour flow cytometry. In the first instance, activated Th17 frequencies will be identified based on CCR6+ and CXCR3− expression on CD3+CD4+CD8 T cells and coexpression of known T cell activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR, as described in the Miyagawa study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The proportion of activated Th17 cells will be included in the randomisation process to ensure equal stratification across the treatment arms.</p>
                <p>The TNF inhibitor used in the study is adalimumab (any brand, including biosimilars) and is given at the usual licensed dose of 40 mg by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, with no loading doses. The IL-17A inhibitor used is secukinumab, brand name Cosentyx, and is given at the usual licensed dose, which varies based on the level of baseline skin psoriasis. The usual recommended dose as a first-line biologic in PsA is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by a monthly maintenance dose. For patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection at the same timepoints. This study, therefore, follows routine practice and the current label by using the appropriate dose of secukinumab based on the baseline psoriasis disease activity, with the cut-off for moderate to severe psoriasis as ≥10% body surface area. Dose escalation from 150 mg to 300 mg in the case of a partial response to treatment as per the licence is permitted. Both drugs are provided from usual NHS stock and are self-administered by the patients following standard initial training, as per usual clinical practice.</p>
                <p>The study involvement for each participant is 24 weeks plus the screening period (typically 4–8 weeks). Drug treatment is started at baseline and continued for the 24 weeks with study assessments at baseline, week 12 (for those on adalimumab) or week 16 (for those on secukinumab) and 24 weeks (for both) in keeping with current clinical practice and NICE guidance. Patients recruited at the hub sites are also asked to attend at week 4 for a research blood sample to be taken. After the 24-week study treatment period, participants who have responded well to treatment can continue on treatment following the end of the study period or switch to another treatment in line with usual NHS practice. Any patient discontinuing treatment for clinical reasons will be encouraged to attend for study visits and any treatment changes will be documented.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>This study has been powered to test for a biomarker–treatment interaction in response as defined by achievement of the MDA criteria at 24 weeks. Based on randomised controlled trial (RCT) and registry data for both drugs,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> we expect similar non-biomarker stratified MDA response rates in each treatment arm in the RCT and estimate the MDA response rate overall to be~50%.</p>
                <p>Initially, the analysis planned to detect a biomarker-treatment relative interaction effect of 0.2, with &gt;90% power and 5% type I error, using a difference in the MDA-response rate according to whether the proportion of activated Th17 cells is either high or low. This infers that we assume that the proportion of MDA responders (the trial primary outcome) is 60% and 40% for participants with low/high Th17 treated with TNF inhibitors, and 40% and 60% for participants with low/high Th17 are treated with IL-17A inhibitors This resulted in an original sample size of 424 participants.</p>
                <p>However, this analysis would have converted the Th17 levels recorded in the trial into a dichotomous variable split around the median, creating two subgroups: ‘high Th17’ and ‘low Th17’. Applying such a dichotomy causes information loss and reduces available power. Therefore, during recruitment, an amendment was proposed and approved to use the proportion of activated Th17 cells in the analysis as a continuous outcome, while assuming the same relative interaction effect of 0.2, type I error rate of 0.05 and 90% power. This resulted in a reduction in the required sample size to 240 participants without a loss of power. This assumes a ‘main effect’ of treatment response (the difference in response between treatment arms distincts from the interaction effect) of 0.2, and no direct correlation between Th17 level and response after including the interaction effect.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis plan</title>
                <p>A detailed statistical analysis plan will be drafted early in the trial and will be finalised and preregistered prior to any primary outcome analysis. All analyses will be on an intention to treat basis, that is according to group a patient is randomised to, irrespective of compliance with treatment allocation. A per-protocol population will be defined, and the primary outcome is reanalysed on this population.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome will be assessed via logistic regression adjusted for activated Th17 level as a continuous indicator, treatment and an interaction between the two; the stratification factors of study centre and psoriasis severity will also be included. A random effect will be included to account for any heterogeneity in the response due to recruitment centre, with the other variables being incorporated as fixed effects. The primary focus is on the interaction between biomarker and treatment; the p value for this interaction will be reported and considered significant if it falls below 0.05. Mean response rate by treatment and by the four groups defined by treatment and biomarker (high/low) will be reported along with 95% CIs.</p>
                <p>It is assumed that there is no difference between randomised group difference in MDA response at 24 weeks. To test this, response rates for the randomised groups will be reported. An OR, and its 95% CI, will come from the same model as used in the primary analysis but without the treatment/biomarker interaction (Th17 biomarker will be included as continuous variable).</p>
                <p>The secondary outcome of MDA at the 12 (adalimumab)/16 (secukinumab) week time point will be analysed using the same model as defined for the primary outcome but with MDA at the secondary time point as the response. All other secondary outcomes analysed as part of this trial are continuous and will be analysed using the same model but adjusting for the appropriate variables in each analysis. All continuous outcomes at 24 weeks will be analysed using a mixed effects linear regression model. The model will include study centre as a random effect, baseline PASI (continuous), Th17 proportions (continuous), baseline measures of the outcome being analysed and randomised treatment as fixed effects. A treatment by biomarker interaction will be included in the model to formally test the interaction between treatment and biomarker.</p>
                <p>The appropriateness of the assumption of approximate normality of the residuals for the analysis models will be assessed graphically.</p>
                <p>Missing data will be minimised by careful data management. Missing data will be described with reasons given where available. Missing data analysis will be performed on the primary analysis only. It is intended that analysis will be on complete cases, but the nature and pattern of missingness will be carefully considered and documented, in particular, as to whether the missing data can be treated as missing at random. If it is plausible that the data are missing not at random, a search for factors not included in the primary analysis model that explains missingness will be performed and if variables are found, multiple-imputation will be used, using the primary analysis model but including these variables. If no variables are identified, multiple imputation will not be performed.</p>
                <p>Additional hypothesis generating analyses will be undertaken to investigate alternative potential models for predicting response to different classes of biologic. Analysis methods for exploratory, lab-based or machine learning outcomes will not be defined in this paper as these are not performed as part of the compilation of the final statistical report.</p>

                <title>Monitoring</title>
                <p>The study is managed by a trial management committee including the Chief Investigator (CI), laboratory lead and Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU) staff. An independent trial steering committee and data safety and monitoring committee oversee the OPTIMISE study. They are independent of the study sponsor and full charters are available on request from OCTRU. OCTRU will audit the study once in its lifetime and also perform a detailed review prior to issuing green light in line with OCTRU standard operating procedures (SOPs). These audits are independent from the investigators but not independent from the Sponsor.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>The lack of data informing the choice of biologics is frustrating for clinicians and for patients who want to know in advance which therapy would be best for them. This was reflected in the recent PsA James Lind Priority Setting Partnership where the question ‘What is the best strategy for managing patients with psoriatic arthritis including non-drug and drug treatments?’ was ranked highest in the top 10 unmet needs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Patient research partners from the British PsA Consortium assisted with the design of the study, including research question, timing of follow-up visits (to minimise burden for participants) and selection of outcome measures. Four patient partners living with PsA sit on the trial steering committee overseeing the trial throughout and helping with dissemination of the future results.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>The OPTIMISE trial is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. Approval from the Health Research Authority and the North West—Preston Research Ethics Committee with reference 21/NW/00016. Collection of personal data is minimised within the study, with identifiable data being held securely in order to maintain confidentiality before, during and after the trial.</p>
                <p>The deliverables from this project will include peer-reviewed publications describing the clinical and mechanistic results of the study and a predictive panel that could predict response to IL-17 and/or TNF inhibitor therapy in PsA. This panel will be used to develop a more feasible and scalable companion diagnostic for clinical practice. This could be tested in further large-scale studies in the next step towards routine implementation of precision medicine in PsA. Health economic data from our study will assist in the planning of future cost-effectiveness trials. A biobank repository of remaining biological samples will allow future mechanistic and precision medicine biomarker work with additional funding. Data may be shared with other research groups on reasonable request following the completion of the primary analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The OPTIMISE study is the first powered randomised, controlled trial investigating a precision medicine approach to biologic selection in PsA. Although treatment is open label, blinding to the immunophenotyping data will minimise any bias in the study. This work has the potential to increase the likelihood of a significant response and good outcome and reducing delay and risks of potentially ineffective therapies. The study has been designed with broad eligibility criteria to increase generalisability to clinical practice and reflect patients currently treated with these drugs in the UK. Detailed immunophenotyping will maximise the chance of identifying key predictive markers of response. Although immunophenotyping requires considerable cell processing and this would not be feasible in the same fashion within clinical laboratories, we believe that these markers can be further developed into practical tests that could be used in hospitals for routine clinical use. Further confirmatory studies outlined above would be required, there is great potential for this work to impact on UK NICE guidance for the use of biologics in PsA in the UK, particularly if this approach demonstrates health economic benefits. This would provide clear efficiency savings to both patients and the NHS as 3–6-month courses of ineffective therapies would be avoided.</p>
