                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acne is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases worldwide and can have significant psychosocial impact and cause permanent scarring. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, has antiandrogenic properties, potentially reducing sebum production and hyperkeratinisation in acne-prone follicles. Dermatologists have prescribed spironolactone for acne in women for over 30 years, but robust clinical study data are lacking. This study seeks to evaluate whether spironolactone is clinically effective and cost-effective in treating acne in women.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Women (≥18 years) with persistent facial acne requiring systemic therapy are randomised to receive one tablet per day of 50 mg spironolactone or a matched placebo until week 6, increasing to up to two tablets per day (total of 100 mg spironolactone or matched placebo) until week 24, along with usual topical therapy if desired. Study treatment stops at week 24; participants are informed of their treatment allocation and enter an unblinded observational follow-up period for up to 6 months (up to week 52 after baseline). Primary outcome is the Acne-specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) symptom subscale score at week 12. Secondary outcomes include Acne-QoL total and subscales; participant acne self-assessment recorded on a 6-point Likert scale at 6, 12, 24 weeks and up to 52 weeks; Investigator’s Global Assessment at weeks 6 and 12; cost and cost effectiveness are assessed over 24 weeks. Aiming to detect a group difference of 2 points on the Acne-QoL symptom subscale (SD 5.8, effect size 0.35), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, gives a sample size of 398 participants.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Acne vulgaris (from hereon referred to as acne) is the eighth most common disease worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and typically starts in adolescence with 15%–20% of people affected showing moderate or severe acne, often persisting into adulthood.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Facial scarring occurs in approximately 20% of people, but the main impact is social, with levels of psychological disability equivalent to those seen in conditions such as asthma and diabetes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Incidence of acne in adult women is considerable and growing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref></p>
              <p>First-line treatment for acne is topical treatments either alone or combination preparations, containing retinoids, benzoyl peroxide and/or antibiotics.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, non-adherence to topical treatments is common, possibly because of the need to be used consistently for up to 8 weeks, and adverse reactions, such as stinging or redness, are common.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> People therefore commonly seek second-line therapies, such as oral antibiotics, ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (co-cyprindiol) or combined oral contraceptives.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the UK, oral isotretinoin can be used under the supervision of a dermatologist for indications including severe, cystic, nodular or recalcitrant acne. Oral isotretinoin is highly effective, but is not suitable for all patients and is teratogenic,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> therefore needing careful pregnancy prevention management.</p>
              <p>A third of people who consult with acne are prescribed long courses of oral antibiotics.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11</xref> However, acne is a disease of sebogenesis, and antibiotics have no effect on sebum production.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Furthermore, rising rates of antibiotic resistance mean non-antibiotic alternatives are needed.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is widely used in the UK for indications including hypertension<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and has been used off-licence for women with acne for ≥30 years due to its antiandrogenic properties. US guidelines suggest a role in the management of female acne.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Spironolactone is not used to treat acne in men because of its feminising side effects.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of spironolactone for treating acne, and the need for evidence from randomised controlled trials in this patient group is acknowledged.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>When considering spironolactone as a potential alternative systemic therapy for acne, one study reported treatment success in women who had previously failed isotretinoin,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and a second study comparing the frequency with which participants switched drug treatment within 1 year of initiation demonstrated no significant difference between those taking spironolactone and those taking oral antibiotics for their acne,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> implying they are equally tolerated by users. A further database study has shown that spironolactone may have superior drug usage survival compared with oral antibiotics for women with acne, giving a suggestion of greater perceived effectiveness and tolerability.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>A James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), identified the need to establish the best way to manage acne in women who may or may not have underlying hormonal abnormalities.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This informed an NIHR commissioned call (16/13 persistent acne in adult women) for proposals to answer the research question ‘What is the effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of moderate-severe persistent acne in adult women?’</p>
              <p>This study aimed to answer whether spironolactone, in addition to standard topical therapy is able to improve acne-related quality of life in adult women with moderate–severe persistent facial acne compared to placebo plus standard topical therapy.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>The study is a phase III, multicentre, double-blind, randomised superiority study, to investigate clinical and cost-effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of moderate or severe persistent facial acne in adult women compared with placebo, in addition to standard topical treatment. The design is pragmatic in order to have strong external validity and to inform real-world decision making for women with acne and their health professionals. Pragmatic design includes broad eligibility and recruitment strategies, a primary outcome that is relevant to participants, low intensity follow-up and an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. ‘Moderate to severe acne’, in the context of this study, is defined as acne that warrants treatment with oral antibiotics, as judged by the potential participant and study clinician.</p>
                <p>Baseline and follow-up appointments are carried out by UK hospital dermatology centres in order to facilitate blood tests at baseline and clinical assessments. Participants continue on the allocated treatment (spironolactone or placebo) in combination with their usual topical treatment (if desired) for a total duration of 24 weeks with assessments at weeks 6 and 12. Primary outcome is assessed at week 12 with the patient-reported Acne-specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> From week 12, participants in both groups may receive ‘usual care’ from their usual clinical team, including oral treatments (oral antibiotics and hormonal treatments), and from week 24, participants may receive isotretinoin, if the participant and study clinician feel the need for rescue treatment. Trial participants receive shopping vouchers at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks (total £40). At week 24, participants stop taking their study treatment, are informed of their treatment group allocation and enter an unblinded observational follow-up period for up to 6 months (up to week 52 after baseline). During this observational final follow-up period, participants can ask their general practitioner (GP) to be prescribed spironolactone for their acne if they wish or pursue other acne treatments as part of usual care. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the patient pathway through the study with <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> summarising the study procedures.</p>

At or any time after the week 6 visit, the dose is escalated to two tablets per day (total 100 mg spironolactone or matched placebo) by the study clinician, providing the participant is tolerating any side effects (see <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>). Participants are instructed to take their total dose once per day in the morning to avoid diuresis later in the day/evening. All known adverse effects of spironolactone are detailed in the patient information sheet, and trial participants have the opportunity to discuss the trial with the site team and discuss any questions before consenting to enter the trial.</p>

                    <title>Rationale for the dosing regimen</title>
                  </caption>
                  <p>We conducted a survey of health professionals to inform the spironolactone dose regimen (unpublished). Responses were received from 41 dermatology consultants, 10 dermatology nurses and 3 dermatology Specialist Registrars.</p>
                  <p>Of these 54 dermatology health professionals, 22 prescribed spironolactone (9 rarely, 10 sometimes and 3 often). Most of those who responded stated that they would start at 50 mg and increase up to 100–150 mg, depending on response. Several noted that this would depend on the patient’s weight, with the starting dose lowered to 25 mg if needed and allowing the dosage to increase up to 200 mg. There was no consistency on the time frame for these increases with 4, 6, 12 and 6 months all being mentioned as review points.</p>
                  <p>A previous Health Technology Assessment study examining common treatments in the management of acne suggested that assessing efficacy at 6 weeks was ideal<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>—this informed the timing of follow-up assessments and dose escalation. US guidelines note that studies have been carried out using spironolactone doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> No specific dose is recommended, but it is noted that side effects are dose-related.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
                  <p>A recent hybrid systematic review of RCTs and case series identified some very low-quality evidence which showed that a daily dose of 200 mg was statistically significantly more effective than placebo versus inflamed lesions, but it also confirmed that this dose is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse side effects than lower doses.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                  <p>Hence, there would appear to be no merit in using these higher doses for managing acne. Data from the multiple case series suggested that any future RCT examining lower doses is likely to generate results that confirm the effectiveness and better safety profile of doses of ≤100 mg/day, which informed the dosage regimen.</p>
                  <p>For most licensed indications for spironolactone, the British National Formulary states a starting dose of 100 mg, titrated as required. Therefore, a starting dose of 50 mg in the Spironolactone for Adult Female Acne study seems conservative.</p>
                </boxed-text>
                <p>Participants may use their usual topical treatments throughout the study, but adherence to topicals is not actively promoted as this may mask differences between the randomised groups. Participants are discouraged from changing their topical treatments between baseline and week 12.</p>

                <title>Intervention adherence</title>
                <p>The hospital study team assesses participant adherence to treatment at each study visit using pill counts. In cases where only remote visits are possible, the participant informs the study team of the number of tablets remaining. However, no additional support or activity is undertaken to encourage daily pill taking, in keeping with the study’s pragmatic design.</p>

                <p>Clinically, the effectiveness of acne treatments is usually judged at 8–12 weeks, so the primary outcome in the study is assessed at week 12 with the Acne-QoL symptom subscale score.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> The Acne-QoL was developed and validated for use in a clinical study to assess the impact of therapy on quality of life among people with facial acne, and the primary outcome at week 12 is the symptom subscale score of the Acne-QoL, because the Acne-QoL was intended to be presented as four separate subscale scores. It was not designed or validated to have a total score; however, it has published a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 2 points for the subscales and range 0–30 for symptom subscale score.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> Other participant-reported outcome measures in acne do not have a published MCID available and have not been found to have advantages in terms of acceptability and validity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>

                <p>This study addresses a priority area identified as important to patients and health professionals by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for Acne.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We gained feedback from a virtual acne-specific patient panel, convened through ‘People in Research’ (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.peopleinresearch.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.peopleinresearch.org</ext-link>). A patient survey was carried out with the support of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network in order to inform the study design. Findings suggested that participants would find it difficult to abstain from using topical treatments for more than 12 weeks and that asking participants to take a placebo for 1 year would also be a barrier to recruitment.</p>
                <p>Two public contributors with experience of acne attend all Trial Management Group (TMG) meetings to ensure that decisions around the study design are informed by their perspective; study procedures are feasible for participants, and study materials are readable and include all the relevant information that participants would want. Public contributors influenced the trial design and delivery, for instance, by advocating use of social media advertising to improve recruitment, arguing against repeated measures in this patient group and that an upper age limit of 50 years was arbitrary and could appear discriminatory.</p>

                <p>The study will be reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and reviewed prior to the study database being locked.</p>
                <p>The modified ITT population consists of all participants who have consented and have been randomised to a treatment arm and have complete data for the outcome being analysed. Analyses will be performed according to the modified ITT principle using a linear regression model. All analyses will be carried out in the modified ITT population, with the level of missing data reported, unless otherwise stated. The frequency and pattern of missing data will be examined and a multiple imputation model will be used as a sensitivity analysis if appropriate.</p>
                <p>For the primary analyses, descriptive statistics will be obtained for the randomised groups to characterise recruited participants and assess baseline comparability. For the primary outcome, a linear regression model will be used to analyse Acne-QoL symptom subscale at week 12, adjusting for baseline variables (including baseline Acne-QoL symptom subscale score, use of topical treatments, use of hormonal contraception/ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (co-cyprindiol) and randomisation stratification variables (centre, baseline severity (IGA &lt;3 vs 3 or more)). A full list of covariates and model specification will be set out in the SAP. A 95% CI for the least squares mean difference between arms in Acne-QoL symptom subscale at week 12 will be calculated.</p>
                <p>The same analysis methods will be used to summarise Acne-QoL symptom subscale at other time points (weeks 6, 24 and up to week 52 after baseline) and for the other Acne-QoL subscales (self-perception, role—emotional and role—social) and total score. IGA and participants’ comparison with baseline photo at weeks 6, 12 and 24 will be dichotomised as success or failure as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (with success for IGA and Participant’s Global Assessment defined as clear or almost clear (grade 0 or 1) and at least a two-grade improvement from baseline; this represents a clinically meaningful outcome). The dichotomised outcomes will be summarised by frequencies and percentages and compared by group using logistic regression, adjusting for baseline assessment, use of hormonal contraception/ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (co-cyprindiol), use of topical treatment and randomisation stratification factors.</p>
                <p>Adverse reactions of special interest and SAEs will be summarised by group with frequencies and percentages and compared with Pearson’s χ² tests. Logistic regression modelling will also be used to adjust for any important differences in topical treatment use by group. Subgroup analyses will investigate how the treatment effect differs by whether participants have symptoms consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome as recorded at the baseline visit. It is acknowledged the study is not powered for this subgroup analysis. The same analysis methods will be applied to the outcomes collected at up to 52 weeks; however, the interpretation of these results will be assessed with caution as participants will potentially have been off treatment for up to 6 months or have started a different acne treatment. All analyses will be carried out using Stata and/or SAS.</p>

              <p>This is the first adequately powered pragmatic, randomised trial investigating the effect of spironolactone on acne in adult women in comparison to a matched placebo. If found to be clinically effective and cost effective, use of spironolactone will likely become the new standard of care in addition to topical treatments potentially reducing antibiotic use for women requiring systemic therapy.</p>
              <p>Respondents to a survey of people with experience with acne reported that they would be unwilling to be recruited to a study where they remained blinded to the treatment allocation for 52 weeks, due to concerns about potential worsening of acne over this time. Therefore, the study was designed as blinded treatment phase of 24 weeks with an observational follow-up period for up to 6 months after. Use of acne treatments, such as oral isotretinoin or antibiotics, between week 24 and up to week 52 are carefully recorded as differences between groups and would be important in interpreting week 52 outcomes. Use of topical treatments is allowed in both groups during the 24-week treatment phase as (1) women with moderate–severe acne may be unwilling to be randomised to placebo alone, and (2) recruiting women with moderate–severe acne to a placebo-controlled study with no effective treatment for 12 weeks in the control arm may risk worsening of acne and possible scarring.</p>
              <p>Although others are seeking to evaluate the role of spironolactone in comparison with oral tetracyclines,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> this is the largest study to date to inform clinical practice over the effectiveness of spironolactone as an alternative treatment for acne in adult women.</p>

              <p>The authors thank the virtual patient panel (brought together by NIHR INVOLVE) for their advice on the study design. The study was developed with support from the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network (UK DCTN). The UK DCTN is grateful to the British Association of Dermatologists and the University of Nottingham for financial support of the Network. UK DCTN conducted surveys among patients with acne and health professionals managing acne to inform the study design, promoting the study and identifying and advising on potential hospital sites delivering the study. The authors also thank Wessex CRN for funding the initial social media advertising campaign; Jessica Boxall and Liz Allaway for management of the study social media accounts as well as running and coordinating the social media adverts; hospital dermatology centres recruiting for the study: Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham; Bristol Royal Infirmary Dermatology Centre, Bristol; University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff; General Hospital, Epsom; District Hospital, Harrogate; St Mary’s Hospital (Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust), London; Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham; General Hospital, Poole; St Mary’s General Hospital Dermatology Centre, Portsmouth; Swansea Bay University Health Board, Swansea; participant identification centres (PICs) for searching their patient lists and mail outs and clinical research networks for helping to identify potential PICs.</p>
