                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The mental wellbeing implications of a prostate cancer diagnosis are increasingly being realised. Significant mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety, along with related constructs such as fear of cancer recurrence, body image and masculine self-esteem issues are prevalent. However, less is understood about potential prognostic factors for these outcomes in prostate cancer patients. Therefore, this study aims to primarily explore potential treatment, patient and oncological factors associated with mental wellbeing outcomes in the initial prostate cancer follow-up period.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>MIND-P is a multi-institutional prospective cohort study recruiting newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients for 12-month follow up. It will aim to recruit a final sample of 300 participants undergoing one of four treatment options: active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, or hormone monotherapy. Questionnaire-based data collection consists of multiple validated mental, physical, and social wellbeing outcomes at baseline and 3-monthly intervals until study completion. Primary analysis will include evaluation of treatment undergone against multiple mental wellbeing outcomes. Secondary analysis will additionally explore multiple patient and oncological prognostic factors of potential importance, along with the cumulative incidence of these outcomes, symptom trajectory and their association with subsequent functional and social outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This cohort study aims to add to the existing limited literature evaluating significant prognostic factors for multiple mental wellbeing outcomes in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. This may be of potential use for guiding future prognosis research and of clinical use for identifying individuals potentially requiring additional surveillance or support during routine cancer follow up.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Prostate cancer represents a large global public health problem, accounting for almost 1.4 million new cases yearly and being the second most common cancer diagnosis in men [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This large incidence, combined with its increasing survival rates, means that not only are growing numbers being diagnosed, but more men are now living with and beyond their disease [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to this, there is a growing realisation that living longer, and surviving disease, does not always equate to living well. With this in mind survivorship care in cancer has become an increasingly acknowledged topic with large initiatives globally, including the National Cancer Survivorship Initiative (NCSI) in the United Kingdom and similar programmes across the United States such as from the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284727.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>When considering the impact of disease and treatment on prostate cancer patients long term wellbeing, the physical consequences, including urinary and sexual dysfunction, are well described [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, it is only more recently that the mental wellbeing impact of disease is becoming recognised [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mental health issues, particularly depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in this group affecting an estimated 17% of individuals and translating into high suicidal ideation and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, other issues outside of pure mental health symptoms appear to be important in these men. This includes fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) or progression which has previously been labelled as one of the most common unmet cancer needs [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Along with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Anxiety, FCR is a prevalent issue in patients with prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, issues surrounding masculinity, masculine-self-esteem and body image appear important in this population and represent constructs which assess the concept of self-worth representing the view of our body and mind and how it is perceived by others around us [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. All these issues are of undeniable significance in prostate cancer care, not only in their prevalence, but also on the impact they have on treatment choices, functional outcomes and even mortality [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284727.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, within much of the prostate cancer literature, physical outcomes after diagnosis and treatment remains the focus, despite not being the end-all of quality of life for patients [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This means that whilst it is clear mental wellbeing is an important factor, less appears to be understood about prognostic factors which are associated with poorer mental wellbeing. Beyond hormone therapy, which has been acknowledged as an important factor for outcomes such as depression, there is little consensus on other patient, oncological or treatment factors which are important in mental wellbeing outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is particularly true for outcomes that fall outside of pure mental health, such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, where evidence does exist, including prognostic factors such as younger age, treatments undergone and oncological stage, this evidence is limited to general cancer populations [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether these translate within the prostate cancer setting, particularly when considering the unique and broad experiences these men have post diagnosis.</p>
              <p>A better understanding of these factors is important, allowing for better counselling of patients, identification of those who require closer surveillance and better support to improve patient outcomes and gives targeted investigating causes for future research [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, having a good understanding of prognostic factors is vital when considering candidate predictors to use when developing subsequent multivariable prognostic models which may be subsequently used to risk stratify patients at the outset of follow up [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

              <title>Study aims</title>
              <p>With the current literature deficiencies and limited existing evidence on prognostic factors for mental wellbeing outcomes in prostate cancer, the proposed study is primarily aimed as an exploratory study to further define potential factors of interest [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, the primary aim of the study is to evaluate the association between prostate cancer patients undergoing different management options and subsequent mental wellbeing outcomes in the initial cancer follow-up stage. We hypothesise there to be significant differences between different management groups in view of their varying physical symptom loads and demands. More specifically, that those undergoing hormone monotherapy possess the poorest mental wellbeing outcomes, with those undergoing active surveillance the least.</p>
              <p>In addition to this, secondary aims include:</p>

                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>We hypothesise that several patient factors including age, previous mental health history and comorbidities will be significant prognostic factors for poorer mental wellbeing outcomes, based on existing literature in other cancer groups. Similarly, we hypothesise that oncological factors such as stage at presentation and time since diagnosis will be significantly associated with mental wellbeing. Specifically, for time since diagnosis/ symptom trajectory, we hypothesise a downward trend of symptom severity for symptoms such as depression, anxiety and FCR due to increasing time since original diagnosis and reduced uncertainty present post treatment, whilst an upwards trajectory for body image and masculinity symptoms is expected as treatment related side-effects begin to increase with time. Lastly, in view of the extensive literature linking mind and body outcomes in various urological conditions, we believe those with significant mental wellbeing symptoms will possess poorer functional outcomes at study conclusion.</p>

                  <p>Identification of potentially eligible individuals is conducted at one of the participating sites of the study. Suitable patients are screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria through local outpatient clinic lists or multi-disciplinary team meeting lists. Potential participants are subsequently asked if they are interested in participating and if they are happy to be contacted by the research team centrally. If interested, contact details are subsequently passed on and participants receive either paper or electronic study packs, depending on their preference. These contain an extensive participant information sheet along with either a physical, or a link for a consent form (<xref rid="pone.0284727.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Subsequently post receipt of the study pack a member of the research team contacts the individual via telephone to conduct a full informed consenting process using a consenting proforma. If individuals are subsequently happy to participate, they are asked to either complete the physical consent form and return this to the research team using a pre-paid envelope or complete the online consent form. A signed copy is subsequently returned to the individual. Individuals then complete their baseline questionnaires. The full process is summarised in <xref rid="pone.0284727.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. This hybrid and remote consenting process was chosen to ensure minimal contact with participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst allowing for access to those without the ability or desire to conduct this electronically</p>

              <p>This questionnaire-based study is conducted remotely, with no physical follow ups within a hospital site. Again, this design was selected to minimise patient risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruited individuals are asked to complete a series of online or postal questionnaires depending on participant preference (<xref rid="pone.0284727.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). Participants are requested to complete the same questionnaire containing a battery of validated mental, physical, and social wellbeing measures at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months (<xref rid="pone.0284727.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, at baseline participants are requested to complete some demographic information. Reminders are sent to participants at two- and four-weeks post questionnaire dates if not received within this time frame. Participants are then assumed to be no longer interested in participation and marked as lost to follow up if not returned thereafter. Clinical data extraction is also conducted by the research team to collect baseline disease characteristics and subsequent clinical outcomes. A full list of variables to be collected and analysed as exposure/independent variables are included in <xref rid="pone.0284727.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. End of study participation will be at 12 months upon completion of the final questionnaire.</p>

                <p>Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the study population and individual study outcomes. Important definitions to be utilised throughout the data analysis are the threshold set for significant mental wellbeing symptoms in each of the measures collected. For depressive or anxiety symptoms a score of 10 or greater on the PHQ-9 or GAD 7 scales will be used for depression and anxiety respectively, representing moderate symptoms and has been demonstrated to correlate well to depressive or anxiety disorders diagnoses [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284727.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For the FCR7 scale, a value of 17 or greater was selected, being representative of moderate fear of recurrence/progression as per the tool’s original development [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For the BIS, a cut of 10 or greater was selected as a previously demonstrated useful clinically relevant cut off point [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, no clear-cut offs exist for the PC-QOL masculine self-esteem subset specifically. However, previously the tool authors have utilised scores of less than 60 to signify a low score for other subsets of the scale, and hence this was selected for this study [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

Assuming a reasonable dropout rate of 25%, a requirement of 75 participants per cohort was set to give an overall target sample of 300 participants. During recruitment, individual treatment cohorts of these sizes will be targeted, with a gradual stop in recruitment across these different cohorts to gain sizes of groups as close to equal as possible. However, due to likely unequal dropout rates and some crossover to different treatment arms during follow up (e.g. those undergoing surveillance subsequently undergoing radical treatment) it is likely some disparity in cohort sizes will exist. These would subsequently require consideration within analysis and conclusions drawn from study results if any individual cohort contains fewer than the minimum sample size described above.</p>

                <p>Patient involvement was actively sought during the design of the study through its presentation at the South East London Consumer Research Panel for Cancer (SELCRP) at Guy’s Cancer centre, with a panel of 15 cancer patients. Feedback was sought on suitability and importance of research question, study design, consenting methods and patient burden of the study. Feedback received demonstrated the research question to be relevant and of high importance to the quality of life of cancer patients. The study burden was deemed small in view of minimal time requirement and ability to complete the questionnaires at home. Therefore, it was viewed patient involvement would overall benefit future cancer care. The telephone consenting method was an acceptable method for delivery of information, with virtual forms acceptable for those with access. The primary concern for study methodology, included accessibility and inclusivity of all patients for the remote study design. This was subsequently addressed by ensuring the availability of different methods of completion of the follow up questionnaires, either via postal or email links. Additionally, participants and the public will form part of the dissemination strategy. Participants will be informed of the study results on publication of results, with findings openly available on the study website and disseminated through social media.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>MIND-P is a prospective cohort study that aims to primarily evaluate prognostic factors for mental wellbeing outcomes in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients in the initial follow-up period. With the current paucity of data available for prognostic factors in these outcomes within a prostate cancer population, this study will mainly serve as an exploratory study to further identify potential patient, oncological and treatment factors of interest. These findings will be of importance by identifying factors that should subsequently be specifically evaluated in further prospective studies within different settings to identify their individual prognostic value [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, these findings will be of use when considering future prognostic model research within the field, helping to identify candidate predictor variables and limit the number of variables which are evaluated within an individual model [<xref rid="pone.0284727.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Lastly, findings will be of use clinically. Not only may they highlight the prevalence of mental wellbeing issues in prostate cancer, but also could help identify individuals who may be at increased risk of developing issues, and thereby highlighting those who require additional monitoring or support.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study include its prospective longitudinal design with much of the existing literature evaluating these outcomes within cancer being largely cross-sectional. Additionally, unlike many studies, we are seeking to evaluate multiple relevant mental wellbeing outcomes, which were selected as important outcomes to prostate cancer patients through extensive background work. Thereby, this allows for a more holistic evaluation of mental wellbeing, rather than overly focused on pure mental health outcomes or specific individual constructs. However, as with any study potential limitations exist. Firstly, the observational methodology means that factors evaluated cannot be subsequently causally attributed to outcomes of interest. However, with the aim being to evaluate prognostic factors rather than causal evaluation this may not necessarily hinder study results. Additionally, whilst employing a multi-institutional design across multiple settings, findings for this study remain within the UK context and are limited to the recruited treatment groups with those undergoing chemotherapy or HIFU excluded. Lastly, the study is primarily powered for detecting differences between treatment cohorts meaning that findings for remaining patient and oncological factors should still be considered exploratory.</p>
              <p>Dissemination of subsequent study results is aimed across several platforms. Firstly, presentation at local, national, and international meetings across urological, oncological, and psychological settings is planned. Additionally, final findings will be published within a peer-reviewed urology or oncology journal. Findings will also subsequently be distributed through social media of authors and the study website to ensure as widespread dissemination as possible. Lastly, findings will be directly distributed to participants as per the study PPI plan.</p>
