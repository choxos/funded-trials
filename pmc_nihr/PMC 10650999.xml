              <abstract>
                <p>OptiBreech collaborative care is a multi-disciplinary care pathway for breech presentation at term, with continuity from a breech specialist midwife, including where chosen, for vaginal breech birth (VBB). Pilot randomised trial using unblinded 1:1 parallel group allocation to OptiBreech versus standard care, within a cohort. Participants were women with a breech-presenting fetus &gt; 33 weeks, at four sites in England, January–June 2022. A two-stage consent process was used. Participants consented to undergo random selection to be offered a ‘new care process’, with a choice to accept it, or not. Primary objectives were to identify recruitment, acceptance, and attrition rates. Randomisation procedures and potential primary outcomes for a substantive study were also feasibility-tested. 68 women were randomised between January–June 2022. The consent process was acceptable to participants, but randomisation was unacceptable to women who specifically sought OptiBreech care. Two women withdrew due to concerns about sharing personal information. More women planned a VBB when randomised to OptiBreech Care (23.5% vs 0, p = .002, 95% CI = 9.3%,37.8%). Women randomised to OptiBreech care had: lower rates of cephalic presentation at birth (38.2% vs 54.5%), higher rates of vaginal birth (32.4% vs 24.2%), lower rates of in-labour caesarean birth (20.6% vs 36.4%), lower rates of neonatal intensive care (5.9% vs 9.1%), and lower rates of severe neonatal morbidity (2.9% vs 9.1%). Randomisation was stopped on the advice of the steering committee before the planned sample of 104, as lack of access to VBB within standard care prohibited comparison of outcomes. Demand for VBB is sufficient for a cohort study, but comparison of outcomes by 1:1 randomisation is not feasible. OptiBreech care would be best evaluated using stepped wedge cluster randomisation.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>OptiBreech collaborative care is a specialist, multi-disciplinary pathway for women with a breech-presenting fetus at term, developed out of previous research and in collaboration with service users [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. OptiBreech care includes continuity from a breech specialist midwife and intrapartum care from professionals who have completed advanced training in physiological breech birth [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], wherever possible. Current United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) recommendations for management of breech presentation at term are to offer external cephalic version (ECV) to turn the baby head-down, and if this fails to offer a pre-labour caesarean birth (CB) [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although guidelines also support the choice of vaginal breech birth (VBB) [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], women find it difficult to access support for a planned VBB within current standard care, and this is in part due to very low overall clinical experience levels [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Little is known about the potential demand for planned VBB within a multi-disciplinary collaborative care model with skilled support in labour and what the outcomes might be if this were introduced nationally.</p>
              <p>The aim of this pilot trial was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised trial nested within a cohort study comparing OptiBreech collaborative care with standard care for women with a breech pregnancy at term. Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) work aimed to ensure the study’s design and interpretation were influenced by women who have lived experience of planning or attempting to plan a VBB because previous research indicated this population was least well served within current NHS standard care [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0294139.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This pilot trial used a randomised, parallel group design with 1:1 allocation, nested within an observational cohort study. Women in the observational cohort had all requested OptiBreech care. This design was chosen for two reasons. Firstly, it enabled identification of preliminary safety outcomes among a larger cohort of women planning a VBB with OptiBreech care, some of whom may not be eligible for or may not consent to randomisation. Secondly, we anticipated that the larger cohort may host multiple nested randomised trials in the future, to increase the efficiency of delivering trials within this population [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>The setting was four NHS Hospitals in England. Sites were chosen based on their recruitment rate and fidelity to protocol performance in the OptiBreech 1 observational study of planned VBBs [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
                <p>The study was funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR, 300582) and sponsored by King’s College London. Ethics approval was obtained from the West London &amp; GTAC Research Ethics Committee (21/LO/0808, 19 November 2021). The pilot trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN (14521381, 18 October 2021).</p>

                <title>PPIE</title>
                <p>Stakeholder involvement was facilitated through multiple public meetings, held in person and on-line during the research design stage [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two members of the Trial Steering Committee and one member of the research team were service users with lived experience of planning a VBB. Additional service users with lived experience of planning a VBB participated as members of the research team during qualitative work to refine the OptiBreech care pathway intervention [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and consensus work to identify and prioritise outcome measures [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
                <p>Service users influenced the design of the trial in multiple ways. They influenced the decision to begin the care pathway prior to 36 weeks. They emphasised the importance of providing earlier information and time to make decisions about care that would take place at 36 weeks. They carefully reviewed the consent process. Service user representatives advocated that all women who were randomised should still retain the option to accept or decline ECV, VBB or CB. This resulted in a pragmatic trial design suited to evaluating overall effectiveness of a care pathway, rather than the efficacy of one specific intervention over another. This also influenced the inclusion of the non-randomised cohort of women who were specifically requesting OptiBreech care. Service users were very keen that any results would not be used to remove choice and control, including the choice of planning a caesarean birth for women who preferred that.</p>
                <p>Finally, PPIE input influenced the sub-category analyses. Our PPIE group prioritised knowing how outcomes for VBB compared with those for cephalic birth, and this was included as a planned sub-group analysis. Later, service users advocated for an equity analysis due to growing awareness of increased risk of adverse outcomes among women of minoritised ethnicity and skin colour in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Demographic information has been reported in line with the latest NICE style guide [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

                <p>Consent process. Participants were recruited following a referral for counselling and/or care relating to breech presentation in the third trimester. An innovative and person-centred two-stage consent process was used, in which participants are only provided with information that is relevant to them [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. All participants received information about the cohort study, including what data would be collected and what would be required from them to participate. This also explained randomisation, but not the specific intervention (a collaborative care pathway) being tested. Potential participants were instead informed that they would be selected by chance to be offered a ‘new care process,’ which they could accept or decline. Participants randomised to OptiBreech care were offered collaborative care led by a specialist midwife. They were informed that this was a new, untested care pathway and that they could request standard obstetric care if they preferred. Participants randomised to standard care were given the RCOG <italic toggle="yes">Breech baby at the end of pregnancy patient information leaflet</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and scheduled for further counselling with their named obstetric consultant and an attempt at ECV if accepted.</p>
                <p>Each participant provided consent to participate via written or e-consent form. Demographic data on ethnicity and gender was self-reported at the same time.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>Eligible participants from the cohort were randomised to either standard care or OptiBreech care. The randomisation schedule was computer-generated using a dynamic allocation process through MedSciNet software. Minimisation factors included site, previous vaginal births (0 vs 1 or more), type of breech presentation (extended/frank vs any other or unknown), and gestation at enrolment (&lt;36 weeks, 36–38+6, 39+ weeks). Allocation was scheduled to be equal.</p>
                <p>Allocation occurred during the enrolment process within the MedSciNet e-Case Report Form (e-CRF) database and revealed to the person taking consent. Consent and randomisation were completed either by a Clinical Research Network midwife, the Principal Investigator (PI) or the Breech Lead Midwife/Obstetrician. Person-identifiable information, once entered into the database, was automatically moved onto a separate database. The database containing person-identifiable information was accessible only through a separate login and password, to protect participants’ confidentiality. Due to the nature of the care pathway intervention, it was not possible to blind participants nor maternity care professionals. The neonatal teams assessing neonatal outcomes were not informed whether women were enrolled on the trial. Analysis of data was not blinded at this feasibility stage.</p>

                <p>Participants in the standard care arm were offered ECV as a first-line intervention and/or referred to their named obstetric consultant’s antenatal clinic for further counselling regarding mode of birth if declined. Participants in the OptiBreech care arm were counselled by a member of the OptiBreech team and were offered the option of planning a VBB with OptiBreech support, attempting an ECV or planning a pre-labour CB from 39 weeks gestation.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The sample size of 104 women was calculated to enable estimation of a recruitment rate between 20–80%, with a 95% confidence interval, within ±10%. For a site with an average of 25 women it would be possible to estimate the same recruitment rate within ±18%.</p>
                <p>Primary outcomes were assessed by intention to treat according to randomisation arm. Participants who withdrew their data were excluded from analysis. For recruitment rates, mean and confidence intervals were calculated using a one-sample t-test. Site opening times were very unpredictable during the COVID-19 pandemic, and one site closed early. Therefore, recruitment figures were calculated according to the number of months each site was open. Secondary outcomes, safety and feasibility outcomes were assessed by intention to treat (randomisation arm and cohort).</p>
                <p>The OptiBreech care intervention was designed to enable women to choose the option of VBB, which women reported as being unavailable or inaccessible under standard care. Acceptance was measured as the rate of planning a VBB. This was measured following initial counselling and ‘at any point,’ including after failed/non-attempted ECV. The significance of the difference in percentage of participants planning a VBB was calculated using a Fisher exact test. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a two-sided z-test (Wald and with Agresti-Caffo adjustments). Although the feasibility pilot was not designed and not powered to detect significant differences in outcomes, the significance of this finding is reported because it was the basis of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) decision to stop randomisation early, during an unplanned interim analysis.</p>
                <p>Planned sub-group analysis was performed for the following groups, from the entire cohort: 1) those who planned a VBB at any point versus those who had not; 2) actual VBBs versus vaginal cephalic births; and 3) presentation on admission for labour/birth care. These subgroup analyses were chosen because 1) this is the comparison most often used in large observational cohort studies; 2) this comparison was prioritised by PPI group members; and 3) cephalic presentation at birth is evaluated as an outcome in Cochrane Reviews concerning the management of breech presentation at term. An unplanned sub-group analysis was performed for minoritised ethnicity (non-British and Black or Brown/mixed cohorts), as advocated by the PPI group.</p>
                <p>Data were analysed using SPSS Version 28. For the feasibility study, because of the small sample size and non-clinical primary outcomes, the ethics review approved the Trial Steering Committee to serve as the Data Monitoring Committee.</p>

                <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The unplanned interim analysis was prompted by the Department of Health and Social Care’s Research Reset programme, which began in March 2022 to clear a backlog of open clinical research studies following the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] As part of this process, the sponsor requested a review, and the TSC were asked to be involved in this.</p>

                <p>All women randomised to OptiBreech collaborative care accepted that care pathway, including care co-ordinated by a breech specialist midwife (100% acceptance). Patterns of service usage between the two models of care are reported in <xref rid="pone.0294139.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Compared to standard care, more women planned a VBB at some point within the OptiBreech care pathway (0/33 vs 8/34, 23.5%). This difference was statistically significant, z = -2.969, p(2-tailed) = 0.003, Wald 95% CI [9.3%,37.8%], Agresti-Caffo corrected 95% CI [7.0%,37.3%]. Although more women initially accepted an attempt at ECV within standard care, more actual attempts occurred as planned within the OptiBreech care pathway.</p>

                <p>Two women withdrew from the study. One was randomised and the other had consented to participate in the cohort study. Both were planning a VBB. Their concerns related to sharing personal information about themselves and their babies, and their data were not included in the analyses.

Of the four, one was attended by someone who had completed training but did not meet the proficiency criteria (4/7, 57%). The other three, including one breech presentation diagnosed late in labour, progressed quickly and completed before the OptiBreech team member arrived.</p>

Within the entire cohort, breech presentation on admission to labour/birth (n = 44), compared to cephalic presentation (n = 38), was associated with: lower levels of neonatal admission (2.3% versus 10.5%), lower levels of severe neonatal morbidity (2.3% vs 7.9%), fewer maternal admissions to HDU (4.5% vs 7.9%) and less severe maternal morbidity (13.6% vs 21.1%). There was no instance of Apgar &lt;7 at 5 minutes or perinatal mortality following recruitment. Severe neonatal morbidity included: NICU admission &gt;4 days (3), intubation/ventilation &gt;24 hours (1), and parental or tube feeding &gt;24 hours (1). Severe maternal morbidity included: EBL&gt;1500 mL (3), OASI (1), vertical incision or serious extension to transverse uterine incision (2), manual removal of placenta (1), wound infection requiring prolonged hospital stay / readmission / antibiotics (1), and sepsis (2).</p>

                <title>Substantive trial feasibility</title>
                <p>The pilot trial met two pre-specified green and one amber substantive trial feasibility criteria. The minimum effectiveness target was met, as the vaginal birth rate among women randomised to OptiBreech care was &gt;30% and greater than that among women randomised to standard care. The safety target was met, as there were no instances of Apgar &lt;7 at 5 minutes or death in either arm. The trial fell into the ‘amber’ criteria for progression to a substantive trial for the recruitment target. Sites were on target to achieve the pre-specified sample; however, the original overall target was not met due to the decision to stop randomisation. Women only planned a VBB within the OptiBreech care cohort or when randomised to OptiBreech care. The TSC concluded that the demand for VBB was sufficient for a large observational cohort study, but 1:1 randomisation does not appear a feasible way of evaluating the safety of VBB between standard care and OptiBreech care. Because this was clear at the interim analysis, further randomisation was not perceived to add additional value.</p>

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p>The results of the OptiBreech care feasibility pilot trial indicate that women were willing to participate, teams were able to recruit, and data required to evaluate short-term safety outcomes were complete. However, 1:1 randomisation is not the optimal design to compare outcomes for VBBs planned within OptiBreech collaborative care to those within standard care.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes were all positive, suggesting that OptiBreech care should be evaluated further, using a more appropriate trial design informed by this feasibility work. Care within the OptiBreech pathway enabled greater access to all three guidelines-recommended care options, compared to standard care. When randomised to OptiBreech care, more eligible women had an ECV as planned and more planned a pre-labour CB as their first option. Compared so standard care, more women randomised to OptiBreech care planned a VBB (23.5% vs 0, p = .003, 95% CI = .093,.378).</p>
                <p>Within this small feasibility sample, clinical outcomes were also better within the OptiBreech care pathway compared to standard care. Despite having lower rates of cephalic presentation at birth (38.2% vs 54.5%), women randomised to OptiBreech care had: higher rates of vaginal birth (32.4% vs 24.2%), lower rates of in-labour caesarean birth (20.6% vs 36.4%), lower rates of neonatal intensive care (5.9% vs 9.1%), and lower rates of severe neonatal morbidity (2.9% vs 9.1%). Within the entire cohort, breech presentation on admission to labour/birth (n = 44), compared to cephalic presentation (n = 38), was associated with: lower levels of neonatal admission (2.3% versus 10.5%), lower levels of severe neonatal morbidity (2.3% vs 7.9%), fewer maternal admissions to HDU (4.5% vs 7.9%) and less severe maternal morbidity (13.6% vs 21.1%).</p>
                <p>Recruitment to the cohort of women requesting OptiBreech collaborative care (.85/month, 95% CI .74–2.44) was in line with our previous implementation feasibility study of women planning a VBB (.90/month, 95% CI .64–1.16) [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This suggests that, within an NHS model of care where the option of VBB is both accessible and acceptable, approximately one woman per month will choose to plan a VBB. Previous research has indicated that approximately one in three women elect to plan a VBB when offered balanced and supportive counselling [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This was consistent with the demand observed within the OptiBreech care pathway, yet no women planned a VBB when randomised to standard care. Multiple systematic reviews have suggested women encounter barriers to accessing support for a VBB within standard care, and that this option is only acceptable if the birth is likely to be attended by supportive and appropriately trained professionals [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p>
                <p>This is also consistent with qualitative work involving women receiving OptiBreech care [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and feedback from our PPIE group. In the qualitative study, women reported numerous examples of coercive counselling to dissuade them from attempting a VBB [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Participants reported that they received detailed and balanced counselling from breech specialist midwives and obstetricians, and this enabled them to access and plan the birth they preferred, including the option of pre-labour CB. In this pilot trial, marginally more women also chose to plan a pre-labour CB following initial counselling within the OptiBreech care pathway.</p>
                <p>There is sufficient evidence to conclude that current standard care is unacceptable to women who wish to plan a VBB and that clinicians frequently lack sufficient training and/or equipoise [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The available evidence indicates that the OptiBreech care pathway is acceptable to women wishing to plan a VBB because it resolves many of the barriers inherent in standard care [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
                <p>While we can say with confidence that OptiBreech collaborative care does significantly increase access to the choice of a VBB, we do not yet know how introducing this care pathway at scale will affect clinical outcomes. To date, we have evidence from three small studies, including this pilot trial, each of which indicate an improvement in outcomes compared to standard care [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We therefore propose that clinical outcomes should be evaluated using a stepped wedge cluster trial design. Roll-out within a stepped wedge cluster trial would immediately improve access to all guideline-recommended care options while simultaneously evaluating the safety outcomes to support future informed decision-making.</p>
                <p>Due to the unpredictability of birth, it remains unfeasible to ensure that someone meeting full proficiency criteria [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. or advanced training [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] attends every breech birth. In our earlier implementation feasibility study, 35/39 (89.7%) of births were attended by someone who had completed full OptiBreech training [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, this reduced to 4/7 (57.1%), for an average of 39/46 (84.8%). This may improve as services continue to embed OptiBreech team care. However, women should be informed that this cannot be guaranteed, and outcomes should be monitored.</p>
                <p>Although the OptiBreech care pathway would be best evaluated with cluster-level randomisation, the randomisation procedures used in this pilot trial appeared feasible for use in trials to evaluate different interventions within the cohort with 1:1 randomisation. The mean gestation at recruitment was almost equivalent between arms and ideal for studies concerning management of breech presentation at term, at 35+6 and 35+5 in the randomised arms. Parity and type of breech presentation were also nearly equivalent. Other trials within the cohort, based on different questions, may be useful to refine the pathway to maximum clinical efficacy and economic efficiency. For example, complementary methods of encouraging babies to turn head-down remain popular with women and midwives, despite minimal evidence. OptiBreech sites each have dedicated clinics and referral pathways; the cohort study has tested consent procedures, randomisation methods and minimisation factors; and the ability to collect a complete dataset for key endpoints. Each of these create conditions for evaluating the effectiveness of these popular complementary therapies with maximum efficiency.</p>
                <p>The results of the OptiBreech feasibility work also suggest that a nested randomised trial of ECV versus non-ECV for women planning a vaginal birth could offer valuable information. The Cochrane Review on <italic toggle="yes">External cephalic version for breech presentation at term</italic> indicates that attempted ECV versus non-ECV reduces the risk of caesarean birth (RR 0.57, 0.4 to 0.82) [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This outcome is the reason ECV is currently recommended first-line management of breech presentation at term [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether this effect is due to risk inherent in VBB itself or due to unwillingness to attempt a VBB, from clinicians or women themselves. Pilot trial subgroup analyses confirmed a higher risk of caesarean birth when the fetus was breech compared to cephalic on admission for labour/birth care (88.6% vs 42.1%). However, in pregnancies where a VBB was planned versus those where no VBB was planned, there was little difference in caesarean birth rate (64.7% versus 66.7%). The context of support for women who wish to attempt a VBB may have a significant effect on overall caesarean birth rates.</p>
                <p>Current NICE antenatal guidelines also regard achieving cephalic presentation in labour as a critical outcome, [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and current evidence suggests that ECV over non-ECV improves the chances of cephalic presentation in labour (RR 1.83, 1.53 to 2.18) [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, both Cochrane and NICE report no difference in neonatal outcomes (neonatal admission and Apgar &lt;7 at 5 minutes) between ECV versus no-ECV [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the pilot trial’s subgroup analyses, neonatal outcomes were marginally better following pregnancies where a VBB had been planned at any point compared to no VBB planned, following actual VBBs compared to cephalic vaginal births, and following admission for labour/birth care in breech presentation compared to cephalic. If confirmed in a substantive trial, this would challenge the current focus on achieving cephalic presentation in labour [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], rather than achieving skilled care for breech-presenting babies.</p>
                <p>In our PPIE work and qualitative interviews with participants [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] women have raised concerns that the difficulty they experienced when trying to access support for a planned VBB would create inequities. Within our implementation feasibility study [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and this pilot trial, over a quarter of all women needed to transfer care to another hospital, and a small number even temporarily relocated their residence, to access support for a VBB. This is only possible for women with sufficient resources and support.</p>
                <p>Our subgroup equity analysis confirmed that the demographic participating in the OptiBreech trial is reflective of the multi-ethnic population in the UK. A marginally higher proportion of non-British, Black or Brown women chose to plan a VBB; this only occurred within the OptiBreech care arms of the study. The increased access provided by the OptiBreech pathway may particularly benefit groups that traditionally experience increased barriers to accessing health care. In this pilot study, these groups also experienced fewer adverse neonatal outcomes. We feel this is because the continuity provided within the OptiBreech collaborative care pathway provides relational continuity and person-centred care suited to participants’ individualised needs, in particular their need for breech expertise.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>During the 2021–2022 period in England, Hospital Episode Statistics recorded 457 spontaneous breech births and 38 instrumental breech extractions occurring after the 37<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. The implementation feasibility study [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and this pilot trial included a total of 46 VBBs occurring in England in the same period, representing 9.3% of the total sample of term breech births nationally (46/495). Together, the feasibility studies have reported the results of 99 planned VBBs within an OptiBreech collaborative care pathway, with only 1 case of serious neonatal morbidity (1.01%). This compares well with outcomes from the Term Breech Trial, which reported a 5.5% rate of serious neonatal morbidity or mortality for planned VBB in countries with a low perinatal mortality rate, using a similar composite outcome [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
                <p>This pilot trial is the first to compare an alternative care pathway with the current standard care pathway for management of breech birth at term. The design tests the effectiveness of the OptiBreech collaborative care model, rather than the efficacy of a specific intervention, such as ECV or planned CB. The pilot was designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential value of a substantive study, rather than detect a difference in clinical outcomes. Although it will not be possible to blind participants participating in a substantive trial, due to the similarity of mode of birth and adverse outcome rates, it should be possible to blind statisticians conducting the analysis to reduce the risk of bias.</p>
                <p>The methods used in OptiBreech training [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and delivery of the care pathway [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were developed using rigorous, evidence-based methods and prior evaluations [<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0294139.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They have been described clearly enough in the trial protocol and developmental research to enable replication if an improvement in outcomes for VBBs is confirmed in a future trial.</p>

                <p>OptiBreech collaborative care appears to provide the person-centred care and choices expected by women and recommended in guidelines. Early results indicate it may also improve outcomes for women and babies. However, a full evaluation will require a cluster trial in sites willing to provide collaborative care.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Walker,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jul 21 2023 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list><!-- <div> -->If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The primary objectives of this pilot feasibility clinical trial were to evaluate recruitment, acceptance and attrition rates for women randomized to a ‘new care process’. A statistically significantly higher proportion of women planned a VBB when randomized to OptiBreach Care. The trial terminated prematurely.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The primary objectives of this pilot feasibility clinical trial were to evaluate recruitment, acceptance and attrition rates for women randomized to a ‘new care process’. A statistically significantly higher proportion of women planned a VBB when randomized to OptiBreach Care. The trial terminated prematurely.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- A. Line 239: Indicate the statistical method used for the “two-sided test.”</p>
              <p>Thank you. We have now clarified that a chi-square test was used.</p>
              <p>B. Line 295: Indicate the statistical methods used for comparing proportions. For example, 0/33 compared to 8/24 with a p = 0.003.</p>
              <p>Thank you. This has been clarified with a detailed description. The denominator in the second proportion is 34 (consistent with original manuscript submission).</p>
              <p>Also remove the less than sign from the p-value.</p>
              <p>Removed.</p>
              <p>2- Table 4: State the type of summary statistic provided following the + signs.</p>
              <p>We have clarified in the table that this refers to weeks + days gestation.</p>
              <p>3- Lie 296: Indicate if the Agresti-Caffo CI is a 95% CI.</p>
              <p>95% added.</p>
              <p>4- Line 327: State the comparison group for women randomized to OptiBreech.</p>
              <p>Stated.</p>
              <p>5- Table 7: Define the abbreviation SD at its first occurrence.</p>
              <p>Defined in Table 6.</p>
              <p>6- Line 403: Clarify that the CI is associated with 23.5%.</p>
              <p>Done.</p>

              <p>This is a reasonable concern! However, the strategy is to demonstrate that this complex intervention is the result of over a decade’s worth of theoretical work and evaluation of its components. We have also become aware of some guidelines using our work, particularly the time interval recommendations in the Physiological Breech Birth Algorithm, without citation. We want to be clear about how the intervention has been developed and that we are not just testing ‘vaginal breech birth’ according to the individual provider’s preferences.</p>
              <p>Two of the citations are for the protocol registration and the data repository. K Walker is no relation and not part of the current research team.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, we will take this to heart and write an article that dissects the complex intervention. Then we will be able to refer succinctly to one summary publication in the future.</p>
