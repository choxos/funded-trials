                <p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold> From 2007 to 2010, we undertook a phase I dose and route finding study of a new malaria vaccine, a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) encoding the preerythrocytic insert multiple epitope thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP; n = 54 vaccinees) administered alone (n = 28) or with a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) ME-TRAP booster immunization 8 weeks later (n = 26). We observed an excellent safety profile. High levels of TRAP antigen–specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as detected by interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay and flow cytometry, were induced by intramuscular ChAd63 ME-TRAP immunization at doses of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles and above. Subsequent administration of MVA ME-TRAP boosted responses to exceptionally high levels, and responses were maintained for up to 30 months postvaccination.</p>

            <p>The induction of potent cellular immunity remains a central difficulty in vaccinology. Malaria is a disease widely regarded as an important potential target of improved T-cell–inducing vaccines. A method of immunoprophylaxis, such as a vaccine, would offer a valuable tool against both the morbidity and mortality caused by malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>]. Immunization of mice with irradiated sporozoites of murine <italic>Plasmodium</italic>
<italic>falciparum</italic> provides protection against later challenge with murine malaria, and by transferring the CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte clones specific to malaria surface antigens nonimmune mice can be protected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. High-level protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses can be induced by many vaccine types in small animals, but despite numerous attempts, there is no clear demonstration of the induction of very potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. In animal models, such high levels are often required to induce protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>].</p>
            <p>Of the vaccination approaches assessed for induction of cellular immunity in humans, adenoviral vectors and heterologous prime-boost approaches have shown the most promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>]. A series of phase I/IIa clinical studies at the University of Oxford have assessed prime-boost immunization strategies in healthy, malaria-naive adult human volunteers using plasmid DNA and the poxviruses modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and FP9 as vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. The most protective antigenic insert tested in these vectors was the T-cell multiple epitope string fused to the thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP), which was more protective than the circumsporozoite protein or a polyprotein insert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>]. TRAP is a surface protein from the sporozoite stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>]. Several immunization regimes using these vectors with the ME-TRAP insert led to statistically significant delays in time to patent parasitemia, reflecting 80%–92% reductions in liver-stage parasite numbers emerging from the liver after experimental malaria infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>]. However, these regimes induced predominantly CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, and although T-cell responses correlated with vaccine efficacy, these approaches failed to induce protective immunity in the majority of vaccinees, suggesting a need for more potent vectors such as adenoviruses.</p>
            <p>Adenoviral vectors suffered a setback with the failed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) STEP vaccine trial, which showed a lack of efficacy and a nonsignificant trend toward increased HIV-1 infection in vaccinees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>]. However, antigen-specific responses in that trial were only of the order of 300 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), probably in part explaining the lack of efficacy. Moreover, the possibility that antivector immunity might have contributed to the suggested safety concern in the STEP trial has led to renewed interest in the use of nonhuman adenoviral vectors for several diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>].</p>
            <p>Estimates suggest that, depending on the region, between 45% and 80 % of adults carry AdHu5 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>]. Simian adenoviruses are not known to cause pathological illness in humans, and the prevalence of antibodies to chimpanzee-origin adenoviruses is &lt;5% in humans residing in the United States. Prevalence in young children in Kenya, a target group for a malaria vaccine, is low, with only 4% of 1–6-year-old children in one study having high-titer nAb to chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63), compared with 23% having high-titer nAb to AdHu5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>]. When used in preclinical models, some simian adenoviruses showed similar levels of immunogenicity to the very potent human adenovirus AdHu5. In the preclinical <italic>P</italic><italic>.</italic><italic> berghei</italic> model, some simian adenoviruses were comparable to or appeared better than AdHu5 in terms of immunogenicity and protective efficacy; and in macaques, good T-cell immunogenicity was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>].</p>
            <p>Here, to our knowledge, we report the first-in-human clinical experience of a highly immunogenic nonhuman adenovirus vaccine vector.</p>

              <p>This was an open-label phase I dose and route finding study from October 2007 to May 2010 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of ChAd63 ME-TRAP alone, and in a prime-boost regimen with MVA ME-TRAP. Participant flow and study design is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and the vaccination regimens for each group are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jir850/-/DC1">Supplementary figure 1<italic>A</italic> and 1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>.</p>

              <p>The dose of ChAd63 ME-TRAP was first escalated from 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles (vp) by the intradermal route (groups 1–4, n = 8 per group), then from 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> to 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp by the intramuscular route (groups 5–7, n = 4–10 per group; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Within these groups, 4 volunteers received a single immunization with ChAd63 ME-TRAP (“A” subgroups, n = 28), and 4 received ChAd63 ME-TRAP followed by MVA ME-TRAP 8 weeks later (“B” subgroups, n = 20). In the highest-dose group (2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp, group 7), 2 volunteers were boosted with intradermal MVA ME-TRAP 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU; group 7B), and 4 volunteers were boosted with intramuscular MVA ME-TRAP 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU (group 7C).</p>
              <p>In addition, in May 2010, all volunteers in the prime-boost groups (n = 26) were invited to return for a late-boosting immunization with either ChAd63 ME-TRAP (5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp) or MVA ME-TRAP (2 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU) intramuscularly. In total, 11 of 26 eligible volunteers were screened for a third immunization and enrolled between June and July 2010. This group was termed group 8. Vaccine allocation was randomized 1:1, stratified by time interval since the last immunization (n = 5 ChAd63 ME-TRAP; n = 6 MVA ME-TRAP). Data for days 21–28 following reboost are presented.</p>

                <title>Manufacturing Yield and Genetic Stability of ChAd63 ME-TRAP</title>
                <p>The Clinical BioManufacturing Facility at the University of Oxford manufactured ChAd63 ME-TRAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>] with high yield, producing approximately 3.7 × 10<sup>14</sup> vp from a single-bulk cell culture preparation. This was the yield obtained following cell lysis, disaggregation, centrifugation, and filtration. From 2 bulk harvest lots, 12 840 doses of ChAd63 ME-TRAP, with 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp per vial, were produced.</p>
                <p>Genetic stability of ChAd63 ME-TRAP was tested by performing 8 passages of a batch of the virus in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and characterizing the resulting virus using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. No evidence of genetic instability was detected in either the passaged material or the clinical batch used in the clinical trial.</p>

                <p>There were no serious adverse events. The 417 adverse events considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to vaccination were reported up to and including 28 days post ChAd63 ME-TRAP (184 local and 233 systemic). Local adverse events included pain, redness, swelling, scaling, itching, and warmth. Systemic symptoms solicited using diary cards included fever, feverishness (the sensation of fever without measurable pyrexia), malaise, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, and nausea or vomiting. Over 90% of adverse events were mild in nature. A detailed breakdown of adverse events occurring postvaccination can be found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jir850/-/DC1">Supplementary figure 1<italic>G</italic>–<italic>K</italic></ext-link>.</p>
                <p>All subjects receiving ChAd63 ME-TRAP intradermally (groups 1–4) reported a local adverse event, most commonly redness (100%) and swelling (100%). Incidence of local adverse events was lower in those receiving intramuscular ChAd63 ME-TRAP (groups 5–7), with significantly fewer local adverse events reported per volunteer at comparable doses (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2<italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p>

                <p>The most common systemic adverse events occurring were fatigue (87% of volunteers), malaise (69%), and feverishness (54%). In total, 69% of systemic adverse events were reported in the first 48 hours postvaccination, and 64% resolved in this timeframe. The median number of systemic adverse events experienced by a volunteer increased with vaccine dose regardless of route of administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). In parallel, severity of reported systemic adverse events increased as the dose of ChAd63 ME-TRAP increased. There were 8 individual severe adverse events reported, 4 of which (feverishness, headache, malaise, and coryzal symptoms) occurred in the same volunteer who developed a coryzal illness 13 days postvaccination. Two other volunteers had 24 hours of symptoms immediately post vaccination (1 subject with coryzal symptoms and 1 with myalgia/arthralgia/feverishness).</p>
                <p>The safety profile of MVA ME-TRAP was very similar to that reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2<italic>D</italic></xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>]. The preceding dose of ChAd63 ME-TRAP did not affect the intensity or duration of adverse events post-MVA ME-TRAP (data not shown). A similar acceptable safety profile was observed after the reboosting immunizations.</p>
                <p>Immunization-related laboratory adverse events resolved in 4 of 54 volunteers following ChAd63 ME-TRAP (2 ALT elevations [&lt;1.5 × upper limit of normal], 1 eosinophilia, and grade 1 thrombocytopenia) and 1 of 26 volunteers following MVA ME-TRAP (grade 1 thrombocytopenia).</p>

                  <p>Responses to ME-TRAP were detected 14 days after priming vaccination with ChAd63, with median ELISPOT responses per dose group ranging from 61–915 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs (hence SFC/M) with priming doses between 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>B</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3<italic>D</italic></xref>). Boosting with MVA ME-TRAP significantly augmented the immunogenicity with individual responses as high as 2465 SFC/M (medians ranging from 764 to 2063 SFC/M for 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>–2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp) 7 days post-MVA ME-TRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>C</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3<italic>E</italic></xref>). Response to the vaccine insert could be detected in all volunteers at their final visits, with excellent preservation of the effector immune response in the prime-boost volunteers, with medians of 246–1294 SFC/M across the different groups 3 months post boosting vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p>
                  <p>Individual peak immune responses occurred either at 14 or 28 days post-ChAd63 ME-TRAP vaccination. Post priming vaccination, there was a trend toward higher responses at higher doses with a significant difference in ELISPOT response between 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp ChAd63 ME-TRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>F</italic></xref>; <italic>P</italic> = .005 Kruskal-Wallis test, medians ranging from 78.1–915 SFC/M). Post-MVA ME-TRAP immune responses were maximal at day 63 with a nonsignificant trend toward increasing responses as the priming dose increased.</p>
                  <p>To assess changes in the breadth of TRAP-specific T-cell responses by ELISPOT induced by both immunizations, the number of peptide pools (total of 6) in which responses per well were greater than a threshold of 100 SFC/M (after subtracting the background response) were summed for each individual, at every time point. Given the small number of samples for each dose group, data for all groups were pooled. A nonsignificant increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>G</italic></xref>) in the number of positive TRAP-specific peptide pools was observed following the first immunization (D14 mean, 1.0 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .4–1.6]), and this was significantly boosted by the second immunization (D63 mean, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.2–3.8] <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 compared with D14). This boosting effect of MVA ME-TRAP was maintained up to D140 (mean 1.4 [95% CI, .9–2.0] compared with D14, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
                  <p>Cultured ELISPOT assay (cELISPOT) responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>H</italic></xref>) were present in 7 of 8 volunteers examined at day 140 but did not correlate significantly with peak ex vivo immune response (Pearson correlation <italic>r</italic> = −0.68, <italic>P</italic> = .2). Notably, cELISPOT responses in group 4, with a median cELISPOT response of 6638 SFC/10<sup>6</sup> original PBMCs (interquartile range [IQR], 2901–9073) are double the highest value previously recorded with a regime of DNA and MVA ME-TRAP given multiple times, one of the most immunogenic and protective regimes we have previously trialed (median, 2900; IQR, 140–4160) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>].</p>
                  <p>TRAP-specific antibody responses were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all recipients of ChAd63, and were significantly boosted by MVA ME-TRAP (data not shown).</p>

Of the remaining subjects negative for nAb at day 0, &gt;90% seroconverted after vaccination. ChAd63 dose correlated with peak nAb titer (Spearman rank correlation <italic>r</italic> = 0.54, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; n = 50), but no relationship was observed between baseline nAb and peak ELISPOT response (excluding volunteers from group 1 with no baseline nAb; r = 0.031, <italic>P</italic> = .85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5<italic>C</italic></xref>, n = 42). In group 7, where any preexisting antibody titer was allowable, there was no evidence that higher baseline nAb titer reduced peak (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, <italic>P</italic> = .71, n = 6) or day 140 ELISPOT response (<italic>r</italic> = −0.51, <italic>P</italic> = .30, n = 6).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>ChAd63 ME-TRAP at doses between 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp has been used safely in this study and generates high levels of antigen-specific T cells which remain detectable for over 28 months post-MVA. Although other simian adenoviruses have shown promise in preclinical studies, this is the first report of the use of a nonhuman adenovirus as a vaccine vector in humans to our knowledge.</p>
              <p>Vectored vaccines have shown considerable promise as vaccine candidates due to their ease of generation, often low-cost manufacture, and their ability to induce significant cellular immunity. However, to date their development has been limited by several obstacles. Some viral vectors, even within the adenovirus family, are much more potent than others, and only a limited number of serotypes show good immunogenicity. Second, for several vectors, proprietary cell lines are required for large-scale manufacture, and these are not widely available. Other vectors have been found to show significant genetic instability when produced at large scale. Usage of HEK293 cells, or the alternative PER.C6 cell line, facilitates easy growth of ChAd63, thus providing a manufacturing process that can be easily scaled up for mass production. Several thousand doses of vaccine were produced in our manufacturing runs in a process that is now very efficient. Finally, certain viral vectors are limited by high levels of preexisting immunity in many human populations, whereas ChAd63 has limited preexisting immunity in European and African populations.</p>
              <p>In this trial, ChAd63 ME-TRAP has been shown to have a good safety profile despite relatively stringent adverse analysis (all adverse events occurring up to 28 days postvaccination deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related were analyzed). Rates and types of adverse events are comparable to ongoing trials using human adenovirus 5 as a vector. In a recent phase 1 trial of a human adenovirus 5 expressing glycoprotein (GP) from the Ebola virus species where 11 subjects received 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp of vaccine, 6 moderate or severe systemic adverse events were reported at this dose (6 of 29 total systemic adverse events) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>]. In comparison, we report 1 moderate or severe systemic adverse event occurring post-ChAd63 ME-TRAP at 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp (1 of 29 total systemic adverse events reported) making ChAd63 less reactogenic. Peiperl et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>] assess safety and maximal tolerated dose of an adenoviral vaccine vector in volunteers without prior immunity, using a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vaccine expressing HIV-1 Gag, Pol, and multiclade Env proteins. Here, 20 volunteers received 2 × 10<sup>11</sup> particle units of vaccine, and systemic adverse events were assessed for the 72 hours following vaccination. Fifteen volunteers report at least 1 moderate or severe systemic adverse event occurring postvaccination. In comparison, with ChAd63 ME-TRAP at the same dose, 10 volunteers were vaccinated and reported only 9 systemic adverse events postvaccination as moderate or severe.</p>
              <p>MVA ME-TRAP is a well-characterized vaccine in terms of immunogenicity and once again is used safely in this trial. It has now been administered to &gt;600 healthy volunteers in Oxford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>], The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>], and Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>] without any serious adverse events with volunteers receiving between 1 and 3 intradermal doses of vaccine (3–50 × 10<sup>7</sup> PFU per dose), at 3- to 4-week intervals.</p>
              <p>The prime-boost vaccination regimen with ChAd63 and MVA ME-TRAP generated unprecedented levels of effector T-cell responses, as measured by ex vivo IFN-γ ELISPOT in comparison to previous malaria vaccine trials with the same antigenic insert. Responses here were both higher and different in quality. In contrast to average responses (at the peak time point) of approximately 450 SFC/M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>], we now report average responses exceeding 2000 SFC/M. Second, by flow cytometry we observe that there are at least as many CD8<sup>+</sup> as CD4<sup>+</sup> gamma-interferon–secreting T cells induced at the peak time points, in contrast to previous prime-boost regimes using DNA and poxvirus-priming vectors, where predominantly CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were induced. This ability to induce both high-level CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> responses with simian adenovirus–MVA prime-boost regimes should broaden the potential utility of this approach.</p>
              <p>This simian adenovirus vector used alone without an MVA boost also compares very favorably in terms of immunogenicity with reports of HIV vaccine trials using the AdHu5 vector, although different inserts prevent a definitive comparison. Over 90% of our volunteers had detectable ELISPOT responses 4 weeks after the priming vaccination, and after 3 months, all subjects receiving adenovirus alone had a detectable immune response compared with recently reported HIV-1 vaccine trials using human adenovirus 5 expressing HIV <italic>gag</italic> (Ad5 <italic>gag</italic>), where after 3 doses of 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> vp Ad5 <italic>gag</italic> at week 8 only 53% of volunteers had a detectable response on ELISPOT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Neutralizing antibodies to ChAd63 were induced in all volunteers. But titers did not correlate with the level of vaccine-induced immune response to the malaria insert, as measured by ELISPOT, nor with the frequency or grade of adverse events (data not shown). As discussed above, ChAd63 nAb are rare in the general population but are clearly detectable prior to vaccination in some individuals. It is unclear whether this is caused by cross-reactivity to ChAd63 of antibodies induced by a closely related human adenovirus, or by a low prevalence of ChAd63 infections in humans. In group 7 where individuals with any titer of ChAd63 nAb were enrolled, there was no reduction in the vaccine-induced immune response in those with preexisting antibodies to the vector. Moreover, volunteers could be safely reboosted with either MVA ME-TRAP or ChAd63 ME-TRAP at 5–30 months after their first MVA immunization with no impairment of vaccine immunogenicity, suggesting that these viral vectors are suitable for repeated usage with such an interval.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>This phase I clinical trial has shown that simian adenoviruses are safe when used alone or with an MVA boost with no evidence of dose limiting toxicity. Importantly, the cellular immunity induced to a full-length antigen by this vaccination strategy appears significantly greater than with any previously reported immunization regime.</p>
