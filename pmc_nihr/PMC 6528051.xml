                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Mental health interventions delivered through digital technology have potential applications in promoting recovery and improving outcomes among people in the early stages of psychosis. Self-management approaches are recommended for the treatment of psychosis and could be delivered via applications (apps) installed on Smartphones to provide low-cost accessible support. We describe the protocol for a feasibility trial investigating a self-management Smartphone app intervention for adults using Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In this feasibility randomised controlled trial, 40 participants will be recruited from EIP services in London and Surrey. Twenty participants will be randomised to receive a supported self-management Smartphone app (My Journey 3) plus Treatment As Usual (TAU), while the other 20 participants will receive TAU only. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial of this intervention in EIP services. Participant data will be collected at baseline and at two follow-up assessments conducted 4 months and 12 months post-baseline. Analysed outcome measures will include relapse of psychosis (operationalised as admission to a hospital or community acute alternative), mental health and well-being, recovery, quality of life and psychopathology. Semi-structured interviews with participants and EIP service clinicians will additionally explore experiences of using My Journey 3 and participating in the trial and suggestions for improving the intervention.</p>

              <p>Psychosis is associated with significant costs at individual-level, family-level and society-level.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> The implementation of Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services across the UK has been associated with improved outcomes,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> however, substantial challenges remain. Long-term follow-up studies have shown that relapse rates in the early course of psychosis remain high.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore functional recovery is often not attained following treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Thus, there is a need to increase and sustain benefits from EIP services. An approach with demonstrated efficacy in improving functional recovery and reducing relapse in psychosis is supported self-management.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Self-management has been designed to empower people as active agents in their own recovery by enabling them to develop skills such as recognising and monitoring symptoms and early warning signs of relapse, identifying and avoiding stressors, and using effective coping strategies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Self-management is associated with significant benefits including reduced distress, improved medication adherence and reduced number of hospitalisations.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Relapse prevention work has long been proposed as a key element in EIP,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and establishing and working towards recovery goals is widely advocated in EIP services.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, well-evaluated tools and methods are currently not available to support widespread implementation of self-management approaches in EIP services.</p>
              <p>Over recent years there has been growing interest in the development of innovative technologies in healthcare due to their potential to improve accessibility, efficacy, quality and cost-effectiveness of treatment.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Due to rapid advancements in mobile phone technology, it is possible to deliver clinical interventions via applications (apps) installed on Smartphones (mobile phones with computational capacities). Smartphones are widely available in the UK with over 75% of adults owning one.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They are often carried on the person with high accessibility to the internet and are therefore a suitable device to provide time-unlimited interventions in almost any location.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

              <p>Recent evidence suggests that people with psychosis are adopting digital technology in a similar way to the general population,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> and that they are interested in using mental health interventions delivered via Smartphones.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> A systematic review has found that interventions delivered through apps or text messaging on Smartphones are acceptable and feasible for people with psychosis and may support recovery.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Smartphone apps based on self-management principles have shown promise in a wide range of long-term health conditions,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and are a potential way to deliver accessible low-cost support to adults with psychosis.</p>
              <p>Although emerging research suggests that Smartphone apps hold promise in delivering effective interventions to adults with psychosis, the evidence base is under-developed in comparison to more common mental disorders.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> To date only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a psychosocial Smartphone app used in EIP services has been published.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In this proof-of-concept trial, 36 adults accessing EIP services were randomised to use a cognitive-behavioural therapy informed Smartphone app (Actissist) that aims to encourage active self-management, or a symptom-monitoring app which was classed as the control condition. Actissist was found to be acceptable, feasible and safe for adults accessing EIP services. Although not powered to find an effect, the study suggests that Actissist may confer benefits to users’ outcomes over and above a passive symptom-monitoring app. Participants however only had access to the app for 12 weeks, were followed-up over a relatively short time frame (22 weeks) and significant mental health outcomes such as relapse were not measured. This work has been conducted in parallel with our study, and we anticipate both programmes of work will contribute to developing an evidence base as to whether Smartphone apps that promote self-management can improve outcomes in first-episode psychosis and reduce healthcare costs.</p>

                <p>The trial will take place in six EIP services across three National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trusts in England: Camden and Islington; East London; and Surrey and Borders Partnership. All participating EIP services provide care co-ordination to service users, access to a psychiatrist and psychiatric medication and psychosocial interventions, aiming to conform to the current UK model for EIP services.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> None of the participating EIP services offer Smartphone apps or any other digital interventions as part of routine care, nor are structured self-management tools consistently available in these teams.

                <p>An overview of the recruitment procedure is displayed in the flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Clinicians will identify EIP service users who appear potentially eligible for the trial. They will then make initial contact, explain the trial and ask if the potential participant is willing to be contacted by a researcher. If a potential participant is eligible and interested in taking part, a researcher will contact them to further explain the trial and to arrange a face-to-face meeting. At this meeting the researcher will provide the trial information sheet, confirm eligibility, invite any questions about participating and assess the service user’s capacity to provide informed consent. Written consent to participate will be obtained using a consent form (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">supplementary file 3</xref>) prior to undertaking the baseline assessment at the same meeting. Participants will be notified that they will be free to withdraw from the study at any time-point. Prior to study recruitment, researchers will undertake training in how to assess mental capacity and take informed consent.</p>

The allocation sequence will be concealed from the researcher, who will be blind when recruiting participants and conducting baseline assessments. An independent researcher will hold on to the allocation list and disclose participants’ allocation to the trial researcher after the completion of the baseline assessments. Participants will then be informed of their allocation by the trial researcher. Participants cannot be blinded to their group allocation given the nature of the trial intervention and control group. As a single researcher will carry out most of the data collection, it is not practical for the group allocation of participants to be concealed from the research team in this feasibility study.</p>

                  <title>Development</title>
                  <p>My Journey 3 has been developed through a series of iterations. The first version of My Journey was designed by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (led by Sarah Amani), after local EIP service users consulted about their care suggested there would be significant benefits from a Smartphone app that could be used for appointment and medication reminders, to track their mood and to share their recovery progress with EIP staff or carers. In 2011 a project group consisting of EIP service users, NHS clinicians, a pharmacist and an NHS manager was formed to drive the development of the My Journey app. The following year a prototype of My Journey was tested by 20 EIP service users to further inform development of the app. Since April 2013 this version of My Journey has been available for download from Google Play (the official app store for Android Smartphones).</p>
                  <p>The original version of My Journey contains generic advice on what to do if certain clinical difficulties arise, but does not allow personalised relapse prevention planning or recovery goal tracking. User feedback suggested that this was a limitation. In the current study we have collaborated with digital health experts, EIP service clinicians and adults with lived experience of psychosis to adapt existing paper-and-pen self-management intervention components—in routine use in NHS services—to be suitable for delivery in an app format.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> In creating the product specification of My Journey 3 we have incorporated these self-management components with functions from the original My Journey. Technical development of My Journey 3 has been led by MyOxygen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://myoxygen.uk/">https://myoxygen.uk/</ext-link>), a private app development company based in the UK.</p>
                  <p>Following the initial development of My Journey 3, it has been refined in response to two phases of preliminary testing. In the first phase six volunteer EIP services users participated in usability lab tests with My Journey 3 on their own Android Smartphone. Usability testing featured ‘think aloud’ tests where participants completed set tasks using My Journey 3 while providing a continuous commentary on their thoughts. This method was used to highlight design and usability issues and users’ immediate reactions to the app. Individual interviews were also conducted to explore participants’ perceptions of the ease of use of My Journey 3, concerns they might have and suggestions for improvements. My Journey 3 was modified to reflect the findings at this stage.</p>
                  <p>In the second phase a further six volunteer service users trialled My Journey 3 on their own Android Smartphone during a 1-month field study, with EIP service clinicians asked to support their clients’ use of the app during routine appointments. Following the field study, individual interviews were conducted with service user participants to explore how they used My Journey 3 and how it could be improved. Further interviews with EIP service clinicians explored their experience of supporting their client with My Journey 3. Based on these findings My Journey 3 was updated again prior to the feasibility trial.</p>

                  <p>My Journey 3 is a Smartphone app that has been designed to be used alongside EIP service care and with the support of clinicians.

                  <p>Three main components of My Journey 3 have been directly taken from the original app and updated. Information regarding psychosis, mental health and mental health services is provided in My Journey 3 through links to relevant NHS and voluntary sector websites and through videos of personal recovery stories. To facilitate symptom recognition and monitoring My Journey 3 also features a self-monitoring tool and symptom tracker where users can monitor 14 different symptoms and three lifestyle behaviours. Advice to help manage symptoms is provided after completing the symptom tracker, and a graphical summary of symptom severity over time is displayed. Users also have access to a pill tracker where they can log whether they have taken their psychiatric medication. The pill tracker features a daily alert at a pre-set time to remind users to input if they have taken their medication.</p>
                  <p>In designing My Journey 3 we have also drawn on evidenced-based self-management interventions to add structured intervention components focused on recovery planning and relapse prevention.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> These additions allow for users to interactively:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Identify strategies and coping resources that they find useful in maintaining well-being.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Set and track progress towards personal recovery goals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify personal early warning signs of relapse and strategies and coping mechanisms to put in place should they experience these.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Create a ‘relapse plan’, an action plan to follow in times of crisis in order to avoid or attenuate relapse.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                  <p>My Journey 3 has been designed to be used by EIP service users in collaboration with clinicians. Clinicians can input relevant information to sections such as the relapse prevention plans and, with training, can provide assistance with the app. It is also suitable for independent use: the developers’ aspiration is for the app to be initially used in collaboration with clinicians, but for it then to support users’ self-management following discharge from EIP services.</p>
                  <p>My Journey 3 features weekly discrete notifications that appear on the users’ Smartphone interface to encourage engagement with the app. Users also have the opportunity to set activity reminders that notify the user to engage in coping strategies and take part in pre-identified activities to promote well-being.</p>
                  <p>My Journey 3 also features a sharing functionality for users who wish to share their data with clinicians, family members, friends or other trusted third parties. This uses built-in sharing functionality of the user’s Smartphone, such as e-mail. Participants will have control of who they choose to share their data with at all times.</p>

                  <title>Delivery of the intervention</title>
                  <p>Each participant in the intervention group will take part in an individual training session with their supporting EIP service clinician and a researcher within 6 weeks of the initial consent meeting. During each training session participants will download My Journey 3 on to their Smartphone. The researcher will then give a demonstration of the app and its main functions. Participants will have the opportunity to practice using My Journey 3 and to ask questions. To facilitate use during the trial participants will be asked to input appropriate information in to the main functions of My Journey 3.</p>
                  <p>Participants will have access to My Journey 3 from the training session till the 12-month time-point. Participants in the intervention group will be free to withdraw from using My Journey 3, or decline the installation of it on to their Smartphone, without any impact on their study participation or their clinical care.</p>
                  <p>In line with evidence that clinician involvement increases user engagement with Smartphone apps,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> participants’ main contact for help with using My Journey 3 and the various intervention components will be their supporting EIP service clinician. Supporting EIP service clinicians will be encouraged by the researcher to discuss recovery goals and relapse prevention plans with study participants in routine appointments and then to assist participants in inputting them into My Journey 3. Clinicians will also be encouraged to regularly check with participants if they have been using My Journey 3 and if they need any further support with it. Clinician support will not be manualised. If supporting clinicians leave the participants’ EIP service the researcher will arrange a meeting to introduce any new clinicians that have clients using My Journey 3, to the intervention and how they can support service users that have access to the app. Researcher support with My Journey 3 will be limited to the initial installation and technical support as needed during the trial period.</p>
                  <p>The research team will have no responsibility for providing clinical care if any My Journey 3 data shared by a participant to a third party indicates a decline in their mental health. If any major concerns regarding participants’ well-being such as suicidality arise from My Journey 3 data shared by a participant to the researcher, this would be communicated to the EIP service or other appropriate mental health services. Third parties such as EIP service clinicians and carers will not be briefed by the research team on how to respond to such information but would be expected to act as appropriate in such event. Participants will be informed at the training session that any data that may suggest a decline in their mental state that they have shared with EIP service clinicians or carers may be acted on accordingly, but that My Journey 3 is not suitable for seeking urgent medical care while in crisis.</p>

                <p>No pre-specified criteria have been set for establishing the acceptability of My Journey 3 or the feasibility of trial procedures. The acceptability of My Journey 3 for EIP service users and clinicians will be determined from feedback given from the qualitative interviews and the level of participants’ My Journey 3 use indicated from the app usage data. Trial feasibility will be assessed from reviewing recruitment rates, drop-out rates and intervention enrolment and use during the trial period. These will be reviewed by the study team and discussed with stakeholders at a final dissemination event to decide on future steps to take.</p>

                  <p>To pilot the methods of analysis for a full-scale trial we will use an intention-to-treat approach using data from all randomised participants. The effect of My Journey 3 on relapse (the proposed primary outcome for a fully-powered RCT) during the 12-month trial period will be estimated using logistic regression. The effect of the intervention on continuous outcome measures (SIX, QPR, WEMWBS, DIALOG scale, PANSS and SES) will be estimated using linear regression adjusting for the baseline measure of the outcome in question. Results will be summarised using effect estimates and 95% CIs only. No interim analyses are planned.</p>
