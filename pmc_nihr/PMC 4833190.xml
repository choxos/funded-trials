                <p>Progesterone is a steroid hormone essential for the maintenance of human pregnancy, and its actions are thought to include promoting maternal immune tolerance of the semiallogenic fetus. We report that exposure of maternal T cells to progesterone at physiological doses induced a unique skewing of the cytokine production profile of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, with reductions not only in potentially deleterious IFN‐γ and TNF‐α production but also in IL‐10 and IL‐5. Conversely, production of IL‐4 was increased. Maternal T cells also became less polyfunctional, focussing cytokine production toward profiles including IL‐4. This was accompanied by reduced T‐cell proliferation. Using fetal and viral antigen‐specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell clones, we confirmed that this as a direct, nonantigen‐specific effect. Yet human T cells lacked conventional nuclear progesterone receptors, implicating a membrane progesterone receptor. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responded to progesterone in a dose‐dependent manner, with subtle effects at concentrations comparable to those in maternal blood, but profound effects at concentrations similar to those at the maternal–fetal interface. This characterization of how progesterone modulates T‐cell function is important in understanding the normal biology of pregnancy and informing the rational use of progesterone therapy in pregnancies at risk of fetal loss.</p>

              <p>During human pregnancy, the maternal immune system is faced with the challenge of establishing ongoing tolerance to the semiallogenic fetus, while retaining the ability to mount a robust cellular immune response to pathogens.</p>
              <p>Recognition of fetal antigens by the maternal immune system occurs at the decidual–trophoblast interface, and peripherally due to the shedding of fetal antigens into the maternal circulation <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. This leads to maternal immunological awareness of the developing fetus <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Indeed, a functional maternal CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell immune response to fetal antigens has been demonstrated during <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and after <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> human pregnancy. Despite pregnancy‐induced activation of maternal T cells <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, the fetus is protected by a network of immunoregulatory mechanisms. These mechanisms include the induction of conceptus‐specific induced TReg cells <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, chemokine gene silencing (that prevents the accumulation of activated T cells) <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, restricted presentation of fetal antigens <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, and skewing of maternal T‐cell cytokine production toward a more “tolerogenic profile” <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>.</p>
              <p>Progesterone (P4, Pregn‐4‐ene‐3,20‐dione) is a naturally occurring steroid hormone, produced by the placenta during human pregnancy. This hormone increases in concentration in maternal peripheral blood as pregnancy progresses, and is found in far higher concentrations in placental tissue (&lt;1 μM third trimester serum, 10 μM in placenta) <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. The essential role it plays in the maintenance of pregnancy is demonstrated as progesterone receptor (PR) antagonism with mifepristone (RU486) results in the cessation of pregnancy. Furthermore, progesterone is also used therapeutically in pregnancy to reduce the risk of preterm delivery <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> and improve outcomes in women with recurrent unexplained miscarriages <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, though these clinical uses remain the subject of ongoing clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety.</p>
              <p>Conventionally, progesterone's actions to maintain pregnancy have been thought related to myometrial quiescence <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> but it may also have immunomodulatory properties important in maternal tolerance of the fetus.</p>
              <p>The potential immunomodulatory effects of progesterone are varied <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> but specific effects on T‐cell function have been described. In murine models, it has been demonstrated that the nuclear PR is present in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and progesterone's action via this receptor reduces CD4<sup>+</sup> T‐cell effector activity, by transcriptional repression of the IFN‐γ gene <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. Progesterone has also been demonstrated to promote generation of murine induced TReg cells and this is mediated by nuclear PR interactions <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>.</p>
              <p>Progesterone induces a reduction in the peripheral blood Th1/Th2 ratio. Raghupathy et al. demonstrated progesterone‐induced modulation of cytokine production by mitogen‐stimulated PBMCs from women with unexplained RM and observed a significant reduction in IFN‐γ and TNF‐α together with increased production of IL‐4. However, the lymphocytes responsible for this effect were not determined and the immunological effects were not fully characterized <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>.</p>
              <p>Evidence is now accumulating that progesterone can also induce rapid, nongenomic responses in T cells <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> and that these are effects independent of glucocorticoid signaling <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> but the mechanisms behind these and the immunological consequences remain poorly defined. The classical PRs are nuclear (PR) with two isoforms A and B. However, in contrast to the mouse, most studies have not identified these receptors in human T cells [21]. More recently, attention has turned to two families of membrane PRs, belonging to the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family (also known as membrane progestin receptors (mPRs)) and the progesterone receptor membrane component (PGRMC) receptors), suggested as potential mediators of progesterone effects on T‐cell function. In humans, there are three members of the PAQR family (PAQR5, PAQR7, and PAQR8) and two members of the PGRMC family (PGRMC1 and PGRMC2) <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>.</p>
              <p>In this study, we have characterized in detail the dose‐dependent effects of progesterone on cytokine production of maternal and control CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, we have studied its effects on fetal (HY) antigen specific T‐cell clones, isolated from pregnancy, interacting with their cognate antigen and compared this to antiviral T‐cell controls. Multiparameter flow cytometry provides a far clearer understanding of the effects of progesterone on cytokine production, polyfunctionality, and proliferation of maternal CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These new insights have important consequences for our understanding of the biology of pregnancy.</p>

                <title>Progesterone modulates the pattern of T‐cell cytokine production in a dose‐dependent manner</title>
                <p>In order to determine the potential ability of progesterone to influence cytokine production by T cells, we initially stimulated T cells with mitogen for 48 h in the presence of varying concentrations of progesterone (0–100 μM). Cytokine production was measured in PBMCs isolated from maternal and control donors and the percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL‐5, and IL‐10 was determined using flow cytometry (Fig. <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Incubation with increasing concentrations of progesterone led to a reduction in the production of all four cytokines by both T‐cell subsets, with modest suppression observed at concentrations below 10 μM, and a dramatic and near complete attenuation of cytokine production at levels up to 100 μM. Remarkably, the percentage of cells expressing IL‐4 demonstrated the opposite pattern, with an increase in cells expressing this cytokine, also in a dose‐responsive pattern. The percentage of maternal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which expressed IL4, increased from a mean of 1.03–9% at the highest progesterone concentration. A similar pattern was observed in maternal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which produced IL‐17, was low and no clear influence of progesterone was observed.</p>

                <p>Using the Boolean gating strategy, we were also able to determine the composition of the cytokines produced by each of the T cells simultaneously. As we previously observed a clear increase in T cells producing IL‐4 following incubation with progesterone, we went on to examine the relative contribution of IL‐4 within the total polyfunctional cytokine production profile of cells following progesterone treatment. The percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing each combination of cytokines was determined and results were represented as a heat map (Fig. <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B) from both the maternal (upper) and control (lower) cohorts.

                <p>The heat map demonstrates a clear and consistent pattern between individuals in each group. For maternal CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, progesterone treatment induces an increased expression of cytokine combinations where IL‐4 is expressed in the absence of IFN‐γ.

                <p>It is also notable that the percentage of T cells expressing IFN‐γ alone increases for both maternal and control cells. This is because although the percentage of cells expressing IFN‐γ is reduced overall (Figs. <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the reduction in polyfunctionality (Fig. <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) means that those cells that are expressing IFN‐γ are doing so with a restricted numbers of other cytokines, hence this particular combination is becoming more prevalent with progesterone treatment.</p>

                <p>The percentage of cells within the CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell clones, which produced IFN‐γ after stimulation with antigen, was markedly downregulated by 10 μM progesterone, falling from a mean of 42.48% to a mean of 26.91% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (Fig. <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) .

Importantly, a similar effect was observed in response to fetal or viral antigen target. This demonstrates that progesterone‐induced suppression of IFN‐γ production following antigen‐specific stimulation is not induced solely against T‐cell clones that are primed during pregnancy.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study has characterized how progesterone, at concentrations similar to those found at the maternal–fetal interface, can directly induce a profound and unique influence on the functional response of T cells following stimulation. The hormone markedly alters the pattern of cytokine production by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, strongly biasing it toward an IL‐4 profile, and also suppresses cellular proliferation. This information reveals important insights into the immunobiology of pregnancy and is likely to be directly relevant to studies of the potential mechanisms by which progesterone therapy may serve to reduce fetal loss.</p>
              <p>The longstanding paradigm of immune responsiveness during pregnancy is that fetal tolerance is maintained through a shift in the pattern of cytokine production from a “Th1 type” profile toward more of a Th2 pattern <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. It is now recognized that this is an oversimplification of the interplay of individual cytokines during pregnancy, but it remains an important concept for the maintenance of successful pregnancy. Indeed, an abnormal skewing of maternal cytokine production toward a “Th1 type” profile is a recognized feature in pathological human pregnancies, including recurrent miscarriage and preterm labor <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Our findings that treatment with 10 μM progesterone resulted in a significant reduction in the production of the pro‐inflammatory Th1 cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and a corresponding increase in the percentage of cells expressing the classical Th2 cytokine IL‐4, most notably by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, are therefore important and in keeping with this being a mechanism by which progesterone may promote fetal tolerance. These results are also consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated a reduction in IFN‐γ and TNF‐α production, and increased levels of IL‐4, when PBMCs were treated with mitogen and progesterone <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. In this study, we have been able to comprehensively characterize these changes and determine their relative influence on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
              <p>However, limitations of the binary Th1/Th2 paradigm are now very well described. Additional T‐cell subsets are now recognized as important <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> and T‐cell cytokine function shows far more diversity and plasticity than this schema suggests (reviewed in <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>). Furthermore, the important physiological role of Th1‐type cytokines during events such as implantation and initiation of labor are well recognized <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Our findings are also consistent with this more subtle and complex understanding of T‐cell biology during pregnancy, as we found that the percentage of cells expressing IL‐5 and IL‐10, which would classically be described as Th2 cytokines, is significantly decreased following treatment with 10 μM progesterone.</p>
              <p>While IL‐10 was originally isolated from Th2 cells, it is now recognized to be produced by many cell types including Th1 cells <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, and placental trophoblast <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. It has a diverse range of effects including the regulation of immune responses to infection and protection of the host from tissue damage due to inflammation <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>. It has also been suggested to have a role in pregnancy in promoting fetal tolerance <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, although IL‐10 knockout mice continue to have successful pregnancies <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. IL‐10 has also been found to reduce clearance of infectious organisms from the placenta <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>. The cytokine therefore demonstrates functions that may be both potentially beneficial and deleterious to successful pregnancy outcome, and understanding why progesterone reduces IL‐10 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at concentrations present in the human placenta will require further investigation.</p>
              <p>The finding of progesterone increasing IL‐4 production by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is intriguing, with expression of this cytokine normally associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although there have been previous reports of a regulatory‐like CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell subset that expresses IL‐4 but little IFN‐γ <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. It is therefore possible that shifting the profile of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from those with a cytotoxic profile toward a less inflammatory IL‐4‐expressing subset may be important for fetal tolerance. It is also of note that maternal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from women during pregnancy were more sensitive to the action of progesterone. The mechanism behind this is uncertain but a distinct biological advantage could be envisaged from this.</p>
              <p>Our data demonstrates clearly a marked dose–response relationship in the immunological effects of progesterone. At lower concentrations of progesterone (1 μM), levels that are comparable to those seen within maternal serum during human pregnancy, the immunological effects were present but subtle. In contrast, when the concentration of progesterone was increased to 10 μM, which is equivalent to the level found within the decidua, the effects are much more profound, with a marked suppression of IFN‐γ and TNF‐α, but an increase in IL‐4 production. This dose–response effect may ensure that at lower progesterone concentrations within the peripheral immune system, the effects on T‐cell function are modest and permit maintenance of an active immune response to infection. However, at sites nearer to the fetus, the progesterone concentrations are capable of inducing profound changes in T‐cell cytokine secretion that can facilitate successful pregnancy. The measurement of peripheral progesterone concentrations or serum cytokine levels may therefore be rather uninformative in this context, and not representative of events at the fetal–maternal interface. Indeed, peripheral cytokine changes did not appear to correlate well with pregnancy outcome or the therapeutic use of the progesterone analog dydrogesterone when this was examined in a recent clinical trial <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>.</p>
              <p>Our work shows that progesterone treatment not only changes the profile of cytokine production by CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells but also reduces the number of cytokines simultaneously produced by these cells. In particular, progesterone was seen to reduce cytokine polyfunctionality while polarizing cytokine production in a dose‐dependent fashion toward combinations that include IL‐4 but exclude IFN‐γ. Polyfunctionality is regarded as an important marker of the quality of the T‐cell response, and has been correlated with the ability to provide protection from infection (reviewed in <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>). In particular, T cells expressing multiple Th1 cytokines such as IFN‐γ and TNF‐α have been shown to be beneficial in several studies of infectious disease <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. It is therefore again likely that the highly dose‐dependent effects of progesterone on polyfunctional cytokine production reflect the need to establish a progesterone concentration gradient between the periphery and the maternal–fetal interface. Interestingly, we found that maternal T cells, when compared to controls, also demonstrated a more marked focussing and skewing of the T‐cell response when treated with progesterone, though the mechanism behind this remains unknown.</p>
              <p>We were interested to study if the effect of progesterone on T‐cell function would be more apparent on cell clones that had been primed during natural pregnancy. We therefore isolated alloreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell clones from pregnant women that had specificity for paternal HY peptides expressed by the fetus. Incubation of these clones with progesterone did lead to an alteration in the profile of cytokine production in response to peptide stimulation, however, this was not different from the pattern that was observed with the use of T‐cell clones specific for viral peptide. These data indicate that physiological conditions present at the time of priming of an antigen‐specific T‐cell response may not play a dominant role in determining later susceptibility to the effect of exposure to progesterone. As such, the immunomodulatory effects of progesterone on T‐cell cytokine production in vivo will be mediated as a function of its concentration, rather than by the antigen specificity of the T cells concerned.</p>
              <p>One striking feature of our work is that it supports the growing appreciation of the considerable plasticity of human T cells <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>. Progesterone was able to markedly alter cytokine secretion from mature T cells, such as viral specific T‐cell clones, that naturally demonstrate a pattern of polarized cytokine production. This observation offers insights into understanding the plasticity of human T cells and has interesting implications for the use of progesterone as an agent to modulate antigen‐specific T‐cell function in vitro, and which may be of utility in the expanding field of T‐cell therapy.</p>
              <p>A number of studies have identified that progesterone may exert its effects on T cells through rapid and reversible blockade of voltage‐gated and calcium‐activated K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. We confirmed that the classical nuclear PRs are not expressed on either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, we were able to detect four of the five known mPRs. This suggests that the effects we have characterized are also likely to be mediated through mPRs and further work will be important in determining the underlying mechanisms and elucidating why T cells taken from pregnant women are more sensitive to some progesterone effects.</p>
              <p>Based on our findings, we suggest a model for the effects of progesterone on T cells during pregnancy, which are summarized schematically in Figure <xref rid="eji3420-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. We propose that progesterone induces a unique and profound skewing of the profile of cytokine production from CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is irrespective of antigenic specificity. This is characterized by not only a reduction in the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as IFN‐γ and TNF‐α, but also a substantial decrease in release of IL‐10 and IL‐5. The production of IL‐4 is increased, and cells become less polyfunctional with a focussing of cytokine production toward profiles that include IL‐4. These changes are associated with a coincident and marked reduction in the proliferation of cells following stimulation. As T cells respond to progesterone in a dose‐dependent manner, the progesterone concentration gradient between the maternal–fetal interface and the periphery allows maintenance of effective immune responses within peripheral tissues but provides a tolerogenic environment within the uterus.</p>

Conversely, production of IL‐4 was increased. Maternal T cells became less polyfunctional, with fewer cytokines produced but tending to include IL4. This was accompanied by reduced T‐cell proliferation. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responded to progesterone in a dose‐dependent manner, with only subtle effects at concentrations comparable to those in maternal peripheral blood (left) facilitating continued host defense. Thus, the tolerogenic effects are localized to the maternal–fetal interface where higher concentrations of progesterone are found (right).</p>

              <p>These findings have important implications for our understanding of the normal biology of pregnancy and the role of progesterone in maintaining fetal tolerance. Progesterone therapy is used widely as a means to try to support pregnancies that are at risk of fetal loss. Indeed, there is mounting evidence from clinical trials of the efficacy of progesterone in women with recurrent miscarriage or high risk of preterm delivery <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. Our findings provide further information on the biological rationale behind the use of progesterone as an immunomodulatory agent in the context of these problems, to counteract the observed abnormal skewing of the maternal T‐cell response toward a Th1 phenotype in these cohorts <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="eji3420-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Indeed, it is possible that patient stratification through measurement of immunological parameters may allow identification of those patients most likely to benefit from treatment, or facilitate the rational design of new therapeutic approaches.</p>
