                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) has been postulated to be involved in androgen, progesterone, and estrogen metabolism. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 inhibition has been proposed for treatment of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome. Clinical biomarkers of target engagement, which can greatly facilitate drug development, have not yet been described for AKR1C3 inhibitors. Here, we analyzed pharmacodynamic data from a phase 1 study with a new selective AKR1C3 inhibitor, BAY1128688, to identify response biomarkers and assess effects on ovarian function.</p>

                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>In a multiple-ascending-dose placebo-controlled study, 33 postmenopausal women received BAY1128688 (3, 30, or 90 mg once daily or 60 mg twice daily) or placebo for 14 days. Eighteen premenopausal women received 60 mg BAY1128688 once or twice daily for 28 days.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We measured 17 serum steroids by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, alongside analysis of pharmacokinetics, menstrual cyclicity, and safety parameters.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In both study populations, we observed substantial, dose-dependent increases in circulating concentrations of the inactive androgen metabolite androsterone and minor increases in circulating etiocholanolone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations. In premenopausal women, androsterone concentrations increased 2.95-fold on average (95% confidence interval: 0.35-3.55) during once- or twice-daily treatment. Note, no concomitant changes in serum 17β-estradiol and progesterone were observed, and menstrual cyclicity and ovarian function were not altered by the treatment.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Serum androsterone was identified as a robust response biomarker for AKR1C3 inhibitor treatment in women. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 inhibitor administration for 4 weeks did not affect ovarian function.</p>

              <p>This manuscript is the first to describe effects of AKR1C3 inhibition on steroidogenesis in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We identified circulating concentrations of the androgen metabolite androsterone as a key pharmacodynamic biomarker for AKR1C3 inhibition. This novel finding is expected to help clinical development of drugs targeting AKR1C3, which have been proposed to be of potential benefit to women with endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome. In addition, we show for the first time that AKR1C3 inhibition does not disrupt ovarian function in healthy premenopausal women as documented by unchanged circulating estrogens and progesterone and normal menstrual cycle dynamics, which we assessed by an innovative combined sparse-dense sampling approach around the luteinizing hormone peak.</p>

              <p>Endometriosis and PCOS each affect up to 10-15% of women of reproductive age. Treatment options, however, are currently limited. Thus, developing AKR1C3 inhibitors as therapies for these conditions would address urgent clinical needs. The development of such therapies would be greatly facilitated if response biomarkers indicative of effective in vivo AKR1C3 inhibition could be identified. One approach to detect target engagement biomarkers is the systematic investigation of the effects of AKR1C3 inhibition on steroid metabolism. A previous study in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer employing the AKR1C3 inhibitor ASP9521<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> provided only limited information regarding response biomarkers. In vivo effects of AKR1C3 inhibitors in women have not been reported yet, to our knowledge.</p>
              <p>Here, we report results of a phase 1 study with the novel selective AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women. BAY1128688, which is the result of a rational drug design approach starting from natural ligand, strongly inhibits human AKR1C3 activity (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1.4 nM; measured by quantification of coumberol formation from coumberone at a coumberone concentration of 0.3 <italic toggle="yes">µ</italic>mol/L [Km];<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="lvad063-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> details in Section S1.1) but shows no inhibition of AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C4 at concentrations up to 10 µM.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The development of BAY1128688 was terminated due to hepatotoxicity observed in a phase 2 study of BAY1128688.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The hepatotoxicity is assumed to be due to off-target effects of the drug.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, it is not precluding AKR1C3 as a target for the treatment of endometriosis as Rizner and Penning point out in the above-referenced review.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In the phase 1 study presented here, we carried out a detailed analysis of steroid biosynthesis and metabolism employing multisteroid profiling by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), alongside a detailed assessment of menstrual cycle parameters in the participating healthy premenopausal women.</p>

                    <p>Study design and procedures. (A) Blood samples for PK analyses of BAY1128688 and its metabolite BAY1107202 (M-7) in plasma were collected predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 192, 264, and 336 h of postdose in period 1 and—using the same sampling schedule until 192 h of postdose—on day 14 and following in period 2. Blood samples for PD analyses (steroid assay, eicosanoid assay, additional hormones, and prostaglandin metabolites within pathway) were taken at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after dosing on day 1 period 1 and on day 14 in period 2 and—following the same sampling schedule, also on day −1 before Period 1. Additionally, predose samples for PK and PD analyses were taken at predefined intervals in period 2. Safety monitoring included evaluation of AE reports, measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests. Independent of the three-step dose-escalation procedure (30 mg QD, 90 mg QD, and 60 mg BID), the PK of 3 mg BAY1128688 given in the form of three new 1 mg tablets was studied using the same protocol. (B) The pretreatment cycle started with the onset of menstrual bleeding and ended with the onset of the next menstrual bleeding. The treatment period started on day 4 after the onset of menstrual bleeding (cycle day 4). The duration of treatment was 28 days, irrespective of subsequent menstrual bleedings. Pretreatment cycle and treatment period could be separated by up to 2 menstrual cycles. Samples for PD analyses (steroid assay, eicosanoid assay, additional hormones, and prostaglandin metabolites within pathway, FSH, and LH) were taken at 3- to 4-day intervals on scheduled visits, on visits introduced through urinary E3G increases (high-fertility days), on the first days of menstrual bleeding before starting treatment and at the end of treatment. Samples for PK analyses of BAY1128688 and its metabolite BAY1107202 (M-7) in plasma were collected on any day between D15 and D28 of the treatment period, following the same sampling schedule as in part A of the study.

                <p>Part B, which focused on PD endpoints, was conducted in premenopausal women as an open-label, intraindividual-comparison multiple-dose study with two dose levels (60 mg BAY1128688 QD and 60 mg BAY1128688 BID over 28 days) and no placebo control (<xref rid="lvad063-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In both study parts, progression to the next higher dose level followed evaluation of safety and tolerability data collected at the previous level. Dosing in part B started after evaluation of the relevant safety and PK data collected in part A.</p>
                <p>Both part A and part B comprised four study periods each. In both parts, blood samples for PK, PD, and safety analyses were taken as specified in <xref rid="lvad063-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>.</p>
                <p>In part A, the screening and randomization period was followed by treatment period 1 with single-dose administration of the study medication, treatment period 2 with multiple-dose administration over 14 days, and finally follow-up.</p>
                <p>In part B, the screening period was followed by a pretreatment cycle, a 28-day treatment period, and follow-up. In the pretreatment cycle, hormonal changes over one menstrual cycle were evaluated, and evidence of ovulation was obtained. Treatment with BAY1128688 started on the fourth day of menstrual bleeding in the first or second menstrual cycle (after pretreatment) and was continued for 28 days in total. During both the pretreatment and the on-treatment menstrual cycle, ovarian activity was monitored by regular transvaginal ultrasound examinations and hormone measurements (<xref rid="lvad063-F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To detect the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak, the participants tested their urine LH levels every day using the abovementioned ClearBlue Fertility Monitor. Around the time of the LH peak, blood samples for hormone measurement were taken daily, otherwise only on every second or third day (combined sparse-dense sampling approach). The participants were also asked to document drug intake and any uterine bleedings and spotting in a diary, starting with the pretreatment cycle and ending with the follow-up visit.</p>

                <p>In our study, serum concentrations of the inactive androgen metabolite androsterone increased in a dose-dependent manner in <italic toggle="yes">post</italic>menopausal women receiving the novel AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 at dosages between 30 mg QD and 60 mg BID for 14 days, and they were also substantially increased in <italic toggle="yes">pre</italic>menopausal women receiving 60 mg BAY1128688 QD or BID for 28 days. No or less pronounced increases in serum androsterone were observed after single-dose administration. We also observed slight increases in the inactive androgen metabolite etiocholanolone and the active androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), both of which were much less pronounced than the increase in androsterone (<xref rid="lvad063-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p>

With repeated BID administration, accumulation was slightly more pronounced (R<sub>A</sub>AUC = 2.32). Linearity indices (R<sub>LIN</sub>) around 1 (0.94-1.28) indicate that the steady-state PK is predictable from single-dose data. The time courses of the mean C<sub>trough</sub> concentrations indicate that PK steady-state conditions were reached after about 4-8 days of treatment in all dose groups (data on file at Bayer AG).

                <p>In total, 41 of 51 participants (80%) were affected by TEAEs. All TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity and nonserious; and none of the AEs led to premature discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. The most common TEAEs in participants receiving BAY1128688 were (with decreasing total frequency) headache, nausea, increased serum bilirubin, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, and decreased appetite (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). In the majority of instances, these TEAEs were classified as study drug related (with the exception of nasopharyngitis). Headache, increased serum bilirubin, and decreased appetite were reported only for participants receiving BAY1128688. A detailed overview of all TEAEs is given in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>.</p>
                <p>Dose-dependent reversible increases from baseline in total serum bilirubin concentrations were mostly observed not only in postmenopausal participants (<xref rid="lvad063-F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) but also in one premenopausal participant who received 60 mg BAY1128688 once daily (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). However, at the highest dose of 60 mg BID increases in serum bilirubin were noted as AEs in five of seven (71%) postmenopausal women versus none of the premenopausal participants receiving the same dosage. Increases in mean and median total serum bilirubin were observed in postmenopausal women during 2 weeks of treatment at doses of 90 mg QD and 60 mg BID but not at 30 and 3 mg QD, with maximum median increases of 2.2-fold median baseline values with 90 mg QD over baseline at day 6 of treatment (individual maximum increase around 2.3-fold upper limit of normal [ULN] at day 6) and with maximum median increases of 2.8-fold median baseline values with 60 mg BID over baseline at day 6 of treatment (individual maximum increase around 1.2-fold ULN at day 13). The increases in serum bilirubin were modest in all participants, ie, below 1.50-fold above the ULN. Only in two participants, one postmenopausal woman (90 mg QD), whom the investigator knew to have a predisposition for elevated bilirubin levels, and one premenopausal woman (60 mg QD), a more pronounced increase was observed (up to 2.31-fold and 1.53-fold, respectively, above the ULN). Of note, no concomitant changes in liver enzymes (transaminases; alkaline phosphatase) were detected in any of the participants. Exploratory biomarkers did not show any early signs of kidney damage (Section S2.4).</p>

                <p>The two popPK/PD models were subsequently used for in silico clinical trial simulations to evaluate whether serum bilirubin concentrations would exceed the 2-fold of the ULN in postmenopausal or premenopausal, tubal-ligated women when given 60 mg of BAY1128688 QD or BID. The simulations revealed that 60 mg BID dosing in postmenopausal women would lead to bilirubin concentrations in which the 90% CI of the median would not exceed the 1.5·ULN. In premenopausal women, 60 mg QD dosing would lead to scenario in which the 90% CI of the maximum simulated concentration would stay below 2·ULN and the 90% CI of the simulated median would remain below the ULN (<xref rid="lvad063-F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). A 60 mg BID dosing regimen in these women would lead to a scenario in which the 90% CI of the maximum simulated concentration would always include both ULN and 2·ULN, whereas the 90% CI of the simulated median would remain below the ULN (<xref rid="lvad063-F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

              <p>This manuscript is the first to describe effects of AKR1C3 inhibition on a panel of steroids in women, which facilitated the identification of serum androsterone as a robust in vivo response biomarker in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We also show for the first time that AKR1C3 inhibition does not disrupt ovarian function in healthy premenopausal women as documented by unchanged circulating sex steroid concentrations and normal menstrual cycle dynamics, assessed by an innovative combined sparse-dense sampling approach around the LH peak.</p>
              <p>In our study, serum androsterone concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner in postmenopausal women receiving the novel AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 at dosages between 30 mg QD and 60 mg BID, and they were also substantially increased in premenopausal women receiving 60 mg BAY1128688 QD or BID for 28 days. A dose of 30 mg of BAY1128688 translates into exposures corresponding to in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> coverage for enzymatic activity of human AKR1C3. No or less pronounced increases were observed after single-dose administration and multiple-dose administration of 3 mg QD.</p>
              <p>In our study, circulating pretreatment concentrations of the inactive androgen metabolite androsterone (5α-androsterone) in participating premenopausal women were in the range previously observed in healthy premenopausal women by Ke et al.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>). The on-treatment values (60 mg BAY1128688 QD or BID) were also mostly within that range, but in single cases, they were considerably increased above that reference range (maximum: 6.36 nmol/L). Systemic effects of increased levels of androsterone in the range observed in our study are not to be expected as androsterone is a precursor steroid, which can be activated, but exerts only little, if any, androgenic activity itself.</p>
              <p>We also saw marked, although less robust, increases in the inactive androgen metabolite etiocholanolone (also known as 5β-androsterone) and the active androgen DHT. No marked changes were observed for the other steroids measured; testosterone appeared to slightly decrease during the treatment cycle.</p>
              <p>The observed increases in DHT concentrations can be regarded as minor from the clinical point of view. The circulating DHT concentrations determined in the participating premenopausal women prior to and during treatment were largely within the range reported by Shiraishi et al.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> for healthy premenopausal women (follicular phase) and the range reported by Mezzullo et al.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> for healthy pre- and menopausal women (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>).</p>
              <p><xref rid="lvad063-F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> provides a visual summary of the main findings of our study regarding the impact of AKR1C3 inhibition on in vivo androgen biosynthesis and metabolism. AKR1C3 has a critical role in androgen activation, converting androstenedione to testosterone, 5α-androstanedione to DHT and also 5α-androsterone to 5α-androstanediol. Accordingly, it is expected that these three conversions will be blocked by AKR1C3 inhibition. In our study, we observed a marked increase in androsterone, likely reflecting the conversion of androstenedione to 5α-androstanedione and eventually to androsterone in the presence of AKR1C3 inhibition (<xref rid="lvad063-F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The pronounced increase in androsterone contrasted with the comparably only minor increase in etiocholanolone, reflective of 5β-reduction of androstenedione. It is tempting to speculate that reduction in the activity of the androgen-activating enzyme AKR1C3 may prompt a counter-regulatory upregulation in the androgen-activating 5α-reductase activity conveyed by <italic toggle="yes">SRD5A1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SRD5A2</italic> genes. The same speculated change may also have contributed to the observed minor increase in DHT by slightly increasing conversion of testosterone to DHT. An upregulation of 5α-reductase type 1 activity would also increase steroid flow into the alternative pathway to DHT<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> through increased conversion of progesterone and 17-hydroxy-progesterone to their 5α-reduced metabolites (<xref rid="lvad063-F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>), which would result in a further increase in 5α-androsterone. However, our study is limited by the fact that the multisteroid profiling assay did not comprise intermediates of the alternative DHT pathway other than androsterone.</p>

              <p>Similarly, in this study, we did not measure the 11-oxygenated androgens, which have been proposed to play a major role in female androgen homeostasis<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="lvad063-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and androgen excess in women with PCOS.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The impact of AKR1C3 inhibition on the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway can be safely assumed to be much more pronounced than that on the classic androgen pathway, as Karl Storbeck's group has shown that AKR1C3 has a strong substrate preference for 11-ketoandrostenedione over androstenedione.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Of note, we did not observe any changes in systemic estrogens and progesterone with AKR1C3 inhibitor treatment. This may indicate that the potential role of AKR1C3 in progesterone metabolism and estrogen activation is only minor when investigated in vivo.</p>
              <p>Adding to this, we present substantial evidence that ovarian function and menstrual cyclicity were not affected by AKR1C3 inhibition. The Hoogland score,<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which was initially developed to evaluate inhibition of ovulation by hormonal contraceptives, was used to inform about the presence of ovulatory events in the ovary and confirmed ovulation for 14/18 participants in the treatment cycle (two participants not evaluable and two participants anovulatory). The hormonal fluctuations of E2, progesterone, LH, and FSH were in line with the expectations of normal ovulatory cycles<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> for 16/18 participants. It cannot be excluded that the absence of an ovulation in two participants during treatment (age 44 and 46 years; ovulatory in pretreatment cycle) could be related to AKR1C3 inhibition; however, anovulatory cycles are not uncommon. Prior et al.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> report an anovulation rate of 37% for clinically normal menstrual cycles in women from 20 to 49.9 years of age.</p>
              <p>The focus of this publication was on circulating PD biomarkers as they will be easier to evaluate in clinical studies than tissue-based biomarkers. Effects of AKR1C3 inhibition and resulting changes in local metabolic turnover of steroids (androgens, estrogen, or progesterone) in the endometrium and endometrial lesions<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B27" ref-type="bibr">27‐29</xref></sup> as well as other target tissues of interest, such as adipose tissue, remain a topic for future studies.</p>
              <p>An additional innovative aspect of this study was that burden on the study participants was minimized without loss of information. This was achieved by (1) using a multiplex LC-MS/MS assay minimizing blood volume requirements for steroid analyses and (2) through the combined sparse/dense sampling regimen for assessment of cyclic sex hormonal changes in premenopausal women. Participants monitored themselves for the occurrence of the LH peak by means of a urine fertility monitor with dense sampling selectively implemented around the time of the LH peak only.</p>
              <p>In this phase 1 study in healthy female participants, 2 or 4 weeks of treatment with the AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 was safe and well tolerated with no serious or severe AEs or AEs leading to termination of treatment. In particular, the observed increases in serum bilirubin were not accompanied by any increase in alanine or aspartate aminotransferase that would indicate hepatotoxicity.</p>
              <p>The findings observed in a phase 2 study with BAY128688 in premenopausal women with endometriosis (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03373422; Eudra CT number: 2017-000244-18)<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (increases in serum bilirubin and hepatotoxicity) are described elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Briefly, BAY1128688 was identified in vitro as inhibitor of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3 transporters, which facilitate uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocyte. Inhibition of OATPs might be causal for the increases in serum bilirubin observed in the present phase 1 study after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment; ie, these increases are assumed not to be caused by AKR1C3 inhibition but to represent an off-target activity. The hepatotoxicity observed in the phase 2 study after more than 8 weeks of treatment is also believed to be an off-target effect.</p>
              <p>The PK of the new AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 was comprehensively characterized in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women in this study. Overall, the PK of BAY1128688 appeared to be similar in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. No relevant change in the PK of BAY1128688 was observed between single- and multiple-dose administration, indicating the predictability of steady-state PK of BAY1128688 from single-dose PK data and the absence of time-dependent PKs. The developed popPK/PD model was used to explore potential BAY1128688 doses and dosing regimens and associated exposures with regard to anticipated bilirubin increases in serum. The observed data were supportive for further exploration of the investigated doses in future clinical trials in patients using both QD and BID administration.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we identified serum androsterone as a robust PD response biomarker for in vivo AKR1C3 inhibition in women. Such a biomarker can be expected to facilitate clinical development of AKR1C3 inhibiting drugs. We also documented that AKR1C3 inhibition did not interfere with physiological ovarian function in vivo.</p>
              <p>Future studies should explore the androgen metabolome even more comprehensively, particularly considering the 11-oxygenated androgens, and investigate how AKR1C3 inhibition impacts on androgen homeostasis in women with androgen excess, namely, PCOS. Recent studies have shown that increased AKR1C3 expression and activity in adipose tissue drives androgen production and subsequently insulin resistance and lipotoxicity.<sup><xref rid="lvad063-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="lvad063-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Therefore, AKR1C3 inhibition might represent a promising treatment approach in mitigating both androgen excess and metabolic dysfunction in women with a PCOS, a prevalent condition for which no specific treatment exists to date.</p>
