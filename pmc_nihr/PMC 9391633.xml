                  <p id="Par2">NOTACS is an adaptive, international, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, with a pre-planned interim sample size re-estimation (SSR). A minimum of 850 patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either HFNT or SOT. The primary outcome is days alive and at home in the first 90 days after the planned surgery (DAH90), with a number of secondary analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses also planned. The interim SSR will take place after a minimum of 300 patients have been followed up for 90 days and will allow for the sample size to increase up to a maximum of 1152 patients.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par37">High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has become increasingly used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients typically tolerate it better than standard alternatives such as continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, there is equipoise regarding its prophylactic use and effect on important patient-centred outcomes, hence the rationale for this trial. Recent systematic reviews in non-cardiac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and cardiothoracic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] surgery concluded that HFNT could reduce respiratory support and pulmonary complications, and could be safely administered.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The NOTACS (Nasal High-Flow Oxygen Therapy After Cardiac Surgery) trial will assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of HFNT on the outcomes of patients after cardiac surgery.</p>
              <p id="Par39">This paper outlines the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the NOTACS trial, which has been submitted for publication prior to the interim analysis to uphold scientific integrity. Further details of the study can be found in the published NOTACS protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The NOTACS SAP closely follows published guidelines for the content of SAPs in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par40">The primary objectives are to determine if prophylactic use of HFNT (for a minimum of 16 h after tracheal extubation) is clinically and cost-effectively superior in comparison with standard oxygen therapy (SOT) up to 90 days after surgery, for adult patients undergoing cardiac procedures with cardiopulmonary bypass who are at high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The primary objective around clinical efficacy will be evaluated by comparing DAH90 (days alive and at home in the first 90 days after the planned surgery) between the two treatment arms.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The secondary objectives are to determine if prophylactic use of HFNT is able to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par42">Reduce mortality, pulmonary complications, intensive care re-admission rate, length of hospital and intensive care stay.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Reduce incidence of major complications including sepsis, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction and stroke.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Reduce readmission to hospital rate.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Improve oxygenation as measured by the ROX Index.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Improve patient-centred outcomes as measured using the EQ-5D-5L.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Reduce patient level of assistance needed with activities of daily living as measured using BARTHEL questionnaire.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Improve quality of survival as measured using ED-5D-5L quality-adjusted life years.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Reduce health service and resource use.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Design and setting</title>
                <p id="Par50">The study is an adaptive, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with embedded cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of HFNT to SOT for a minimum of 16 h after tracheal extubation, in patients at high risk of respiratory complications following cardiac surgery. Eligibility criteria and further details of the study design and setting are provided in the published study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients will be recruited from the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The NOTACS study includes an interim sample size re-estimation (SSR) which is expected to take place in late 2022, when a minimum of 300 patients have been randomised and followed up for 90 days.</p>

                <title>Study protocol development and conduct</title>
                <p id="Par51">The NOTACTS trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN14092678) in May 2020. The trial is overseen by a Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p id="Par52">To reduce predictability, stratified random permuted blocks will be used to randomise patients, with block sizes of 4 or 6, stratified by centre. The allocation ratio of SOT to HFNT is 1:1.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Due to the nature of the intervention, clinical staff in ICU and on the wards cannot be blinded whilst the patient is receiving randomised therapy. However, a team of research staff at the central clinical trials unit will collect data on outcomes and these staff will be blinded. In addition, the decision to discharge patients from hospital, which affects the primary outcome, will be made by clinicians who are independent of the research team at each site, according to standard protocols. The interim analysis and SSR will be done by an independent unblinded statistician so that the trial statistician can remain blinded until the final analysis in order to preserve the type I error rate at 5%.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p id="Par70">Results from the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and information provided by collaborative hospitals were used to derive the required sample size for the NOTACS study. The sample size calculation relied on several nuisance parameters (standard deviation of DAH90 in the SOT arm; standard deviation of DAH90 in the HFNT arm; treatment switch rate from SOT to HFNT; treatment switch rate from HFNT to SOT; overall drop-out rate; overall death rate) that were provided from the single centre pilot study or collaborative hospitals and may differ between sites in the multicentre design. The sample size calculation was performed by simulation due to the non-standard distribution of the primary end-point. Due to uncertainty in the nuisance parameters used and the sensitivity of the sample size calculation to changes in the nuisance parameters, the NOTACS study includes an interim SSR, a type of adaptive design. This will provide protection against important deviations from the initial assumptions in the original sample size calculation and ensure that the study is not underpowered.</p>
                <p id="Par71">DAH90 typically has a left-skewed bi-modal distribution with a small spike at 0 due to in-hospital deaths. The required sample size was obtained by simulations (100,000 replicates) by first generating length of stay (LOS) using a lognormal distribution. Based on the information provided by collaborating hospitals, the parameters of the lognormal distributions in both arms were derived through a pooled weighted average. The variability was calibrated to SD =12.85 in the control arm and SD=3.20 in the treatment arm. The median LOS in the control arm was set to 8 days. We assumed a 3% death rate (based on pilot data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and registry data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]), and following the approach of Myles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] we treated any death within the 90-day follow-up period as scoring 90 for LOS regardless of when the death occurred. LOS was truncated at 90 days (the maximum for our follow-up period). Finally, DAH90 was computed as 90 minus LOS. The resulting data are bimodal with a spike at 0, as seen with observed data of this type.</p>
                <p id="Par72">A total sample size of 310 has 90% power to detect an increase of 2 days in the median DAH90 using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for the analysis. After adjustment for 12% crossover from standard oxygen to HFNT and 25% crossover from HFNT to standard oxygen as well as an extra 5% loss to follow-up (equally distributed among arms), the total sample size needed to detect a 2-day increase in DAH90 with 90% power with an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is 850 patients.</p>
                <p id="Par73">The minimum target sample size (based on initial assumptions) is 850 randomised participants. The final sample size target will be revisited after a minimum of 300 patients have been randomised and followed up to 90 days. The adaptive design will allow for a maximum sample size increase to 1152 patients. In the event that the interim analysis recommends a sample size less than 850, recruitment will continue to the original minimum target sample size of 850.</p>

              <sec id="Sec12">
                <title>Statistical principles</title>
                <p id="Par75">This SAP is based on version 3.0 (19 January 2022) of the trial protocol and version 0.43 (13th June 2022) of the trial SAP. The statistical analyses will be carried out using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Other major statistical software may be used where appropriate. Derived variables are described in the additional document. Data will be checked for outliers and unexpected distributions or data points will be queried. Consistency checks between two or more variables will also be performed. Where relevant, variables will be summarised by the treatment arm using the following descriptive statistics: for continuous variables, the non-missing sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, maximum and minimum; for categorical variables, the frequency and percentages (based on the non-missing sample size) of observed levels will be reported.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec13">
                <title>Handling of missing data</title>
                <p id="Par76">Withdrawal rates will be summarised by the treatment arm, and the timing of and reason for withdrawals will be reported. The proportion of missing data will be quantified by the treatment group for the variables included in the primary and secondary analyses. Based on the pilot study, the rate of missing data in DAH90 is expected to be low. Variables with &gt;25% missing data may not be used in statistical regression modelling.</p>
                <p id="Par77">The trial was powered on the basis of a 5% loss to follow-up rate. Provided there is no more than 5% missing data in DAH90 and no obvious cause for concern over the pattern of missing data then we will run complete-case analysis. If the missingness rate in DAH90 exceeds 5%, we will take further steps to investigate the type of missingness for the subset of variables included in the primary and secondary analyses. If the missing data is found not to be MCAR in any instance, we will assume the missing data is MAR and perform multiple imputation as a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis. Our approach to assessing missing data and implementing multiple imputation is detailed in the additional document.</p>
                <p id="Par78">For derived variables such as DAH, the presence of missing data in the variables used to calculate these from may be more difficult to identify. DAH relies on participant location diaries to capture all changes in participant location with accurate start and end dates for each change in location. There may be instances where data is missing from participant location diaries despite it appearing that the participant location diary has been completed in full, if for instances a participant fails to record a change of location. This is a potential limitation of the DAH end-point. Where it is clear that a patient diary is incomplete, they will be completed where possible by calling the patientâs GP surgery and using hospital discharge summaries.</p>

The safety population will be used to provide summary statistics on adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), which will be reported by the treatment arm assigned during randomisation (or by the treatment arm actually received if it is different to that assigned during randomisation).

                  <p id="Par82">The interim analysis population will include all patients who have been recruited at the time 300 patients have completed 90 days follow-up, including patients with partial data (e.g. anyone recruited after the 300th patient who has not yet completed their follow-up, and anyone recruited before the 300th patient who left the trial before completing follow up). If there is greater than 15% missing data for DAH90 (excluding missingness because of death, which is informative) and the interim analysis is delayed because of that, the interim analysis population may include more than 300 patients. The trial will recruit from the UK, Australia and New Zealand. It is expected that the majority of the patients recruited by the end of the trial will be from UK centres. To ensure that the results of the interim SSR reflect the expected proportions of UK, Australian and New Zealand recruits, we will seek to ensure that between 50 and 75% of the patients included in the interim analysis are recruited from the UK, with the remainder from Australia and New Zealand. This will ensure that even if differences exist between the countries, the effect will not disproportionately bias the interim SSR and therefore will not affect the power at the end of the trial. This requirement may impact on the timing of the interim analysis and may require that more than 300 patients have been randomised and followed up to 90 days to achieve the proportions stated.</p>

This definition is deemed appropriate on the basis that the death rate in the trial population is expected to be low (around 3%), most deaths are expected to occur within the initial hospital admission, the death rate is expected to be comparable between the two treatment arms, and it is not expected that the treatment will impact on the death rate.

Additional sites (including some international sites) have been added to the study in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on patient recruitment. As of 20 July 2022, 267 patients have been randomised. The interim analysis is expected to take place in circa December 2022, when 300 patients have completed follow-up. This SAP was submitted to the journal before the interim analysis in order to preserve scientific integrity under an adaptive design framework.</p>
