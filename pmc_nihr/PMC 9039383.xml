                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The benefits achieved during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) are known to be sustained for 6â12 months after the initial programme. Several maintenance trials have been conducted but were heterogeneous in terms of duration, frequency and labour cost. There is no consensus on one best strategy. SPACE FOR COPD (Self-management Programme of Activity, Coping and Education for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is a home-based self-management programme, which has been shown previously to be effective in primary and secondary care settings and is to be tested here as a maintenance programme. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the SPACE FOR COPD programme (manual and group sessions), on exercise tolerance and mental well-being, compared with usual care following PR in patients with COPD.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A prospective, multicentre, single-blinded randomised controlled trial requiring 116 participants with a clinical diagnosis of COPD who have finished PR within 4âweeks will be randomised 1:1 to either a usual care group or a SPACE FOR COPD programme group. The intervention comprises a home-based manual and 4, 2-hour group sessions adopting motivational interviewing techniques over 12âmonths. The primary outcome is endurance capacity measured by the Endurance Shuttle Walking Test at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are: maximal exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, mood, patient activation, physical activity, lung function and healthcare costs. The measures will be taken at baseline, 6 and 12âmonths. Patient interviews and staff focus groups will be conducted to explore barriers, facilitators and views about the intervention at the end of the study. A framework analysis will be used for the interpretation of qualitative data.</p>

              <p>Many interventions have been introduced to facilitate maintaining the benefits of PR beyond a 6â12 months period. Some of those studies revealed that maintenance interventions following PR is of benefit to COPD clients to maintain PR outcomes in the short term and long term (6â24 months).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref> However, the interventions were heterogeneous in terms of duration, setting and level of supervision following initial PR. In addition, patientsâ motivational and behaviour change strategies play a major role in maintenance but were examined in a limited numbers of the aforementioned maintenance interventions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â12</xref></p>
              <p>Behaviour change can be supported using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. MI is used to help coach people to make personal changes in their behaviour.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> MI has been shown to outperform traditional 'advice giving' in the treatment of a broad range of behavioural problems/diseases.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> To our knowledge, none of the previous maintenance interventions have used this technique per se. In COPD, MI coaching delivered on hospital discharge was shown to have a positive influence on readmissions and QoL compared with a control group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>Incorporating an exercise manual with group sessions underpinned by MI techniques has been tested in primary and secondary settings as a home PR alternative compared with usual care<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and traditional (centre-based) PR.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The studies revealed benefits in exercise performance, knowledge, anxiety and fatigue in which some of these outcomes were maintained 6âmonths after the initial delivery, when compared with usual care<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and non-inferior to PR.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> More recently, the programme has been delivered in groups to enhance peer support in COPD.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>Thus, for this trial, we propose a supervised maintenance package (Self-management Programme of Activity, Coping and Education FOR COPD, SPACE FOR COPD) with the aim of retaining the expected benefits of PR as well as increasing patientsâ motivation and to address the feelings of abandonment following traditional PR. We will particularly focus on exacerbation and mood management, as well as promoting regular exercise in our programme. By developing this post PR intervention, we aim to preserve physical and mental well-being, potentially reducing the likelihood of repeat PR attendance and hospital readmissions. In this trial, we hypothesise that patients will have improvements in PR outcomes such as exercise capacity and overall QoL that will be maintained in the intervention group for at least 1âyear. This also could be cost effective for the health service.</p>

                  <p>Participants will be recruited using a purposeful sampling technique: maximum variation sampling strategy. These interviews (n=10â20âor until data saturation) will be organised and completed by a qualitative researcher who has not been involved in delivering the intervention. Indicative interview schedules will be used and so may be refined following the first 4â5 interviews. The purpose of this qualitative work is to explore perceptions of SPACE FOR COPD as a maintenance strategy.</p>
                  <p>We will explore (Intervention) patientsâ experiences of SPACE FOR COPD, identifying barriers and facilitators to the maintenance of well-being facilitated by the programme and to examine whether the sense of abandonment is lessened. The interview schedule will be flexible enough to allow completely unanticipated issues to arise. The interviewer will have adequate experience and expertise to deal with difficult situations (eg, distress).</p>
                  <p>The patient interviews will take place at the point of trial completion (at 12âmonths or earlier if there is attrition). We are interested in the views of patients who do not complete the programme also. Interviews will take place either in hospital or in the patientâs home or via phone or video call for those unable to attend the research centre.</p>

We have one member from each recruiting site to ensure that local issues may be addressed. We know from previous projects how valuable our PPI colleagues can be in terms of helping to shape the research and troubleshooting any issues. For instance, our recent SPACE FOR COPD pragmatic study (delivering the SPACE FOR COPD programme to community groups) benefited from PPI feedback when designing the format and scheduling of the patient group sessions to ensure that the travel arrangements and times were not onerous for patients.</p>
                <p>For this project, PPI members have helped us to adapt the protocol in in terms of agreeing the participant inclusion criteria and how the SPACE FOR COPD maintenance programme should be delivered. The relationship between researchers and PPI members will be collaborative; the reason for this is to ensure that there is an ongoing partnership between the research team and the service users, where decisions about the research are shared. To help support members, we will coproduce all documentation to ensure they are written in lay language. We anticipate that the PPI members will be involved in developing and reviewing patient documents.</p>
