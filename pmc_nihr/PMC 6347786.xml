                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Hyperoxia following out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is associated with a poor outcome. Animal data suggest the first hour post resuscitation may be the most important. In the UK the first hour usually occurs in the prehospital environment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A prospective controlled trial, cluster randomised by paramedic, comparing titrated oxygen with 100% oxygen for the first hour after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following OHCA.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The trial was done in a single emergency medical services (EMS) system in the United Kingdom (UK) admitting patients to three emergency departments. This was a feasibility trial to determine whether EMS staff (UK paramedics) can be successfully recruited and deliver the intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">One hundred and fifty seven paramedics were approached and 46 (29%) were consented, randomised and trained. During the study period 624 patients received a resuscitation attempt. A study paramedic was in attendance at 73 (12%) of these active resuscitations. Thirty-five patients were recruited to the trial, 32 (91%) were transported to hospital and 13 (37%) survived to 90 days. The intervention was initiated in 27/35 (77%) of enrolled patients. A reliable oxygen saturation trace was obtained in 22/35 (69%) of patients. Data collection was complete in 33/35 (94%) of patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par5">It may be feasible to complete a randomised trial of titrated versus unrestricted oxygen in the first hour after ROSC following OHCA in the UK. However, the relatively few eligible patients and incomplete initiation of the allocated intervention are challenges to future research.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Survival rates following out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are disappointingly low: analysis of 70 studies documented survival to hospital discharge in just 7.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7–8.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Death on the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually caused by withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) because of perceived severe neurological injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par14">Although the delivery of oxygen to tissues is essential for human life, there is evidence that high oxygen concentrations after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can be harmful. This is probably due to the many reactive oxygen species that are created during reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Administration of high concentrations of oxygen has been shown to be harmful in stroke, myocardial infarction and in neonatal resuscitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Animal data indicate that avoidance of hyperoxia, particularly during the first hour after ROSC, reduces brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Large human registry studies have demonstrated that normoxia in the first 24 h following a cardiac arrest is associated with improved outcome compared with either hyperoxia or hypoxia, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] whilst animal data suggest that most benefit from the prevention of hyperoxia is gained during the first hour following ROSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One small clinical study that compared administration of 30% oxygen with 100% oxygen after OHCA showed lower neuron specific enolase (NSE – a marker of neurological injury) values in one subgroup of patients who were allocated to 30% oxygen and not cooled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">In most emergency medical services (EMS) systems, the first hour following ROSC will be prehospital. We therefore designed a trial to examine the feasibility of administering titrated oxygen versus 100% oxygen for the first hour following ROSC to see if paramedics are able to safely titrate oxygen and measure corresponding oxygen saturations.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Our aims were to assess the feasibility of completing a cluster-randomised clinical trial to determine if titrated oxygen therapy (target blood oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) 94–98%) for 1 h after ROSC improves outcome compared with the use of 100% oxygen during this hour.</p>

                <title>Setting and population</title>
                <p id="Par19">North Sector of the South Western Ambulance Service, in the cities of Bristol and Bath, a predominantly urban area in the United Kingdom (UK) with a population of 1 million. The ambulance service is delivered primarily by paramedics supported by a few voluntary doctors, but there is no 24 h cover by doctors. Paramedics were approached via ambulance service bulletins and personal letter and invited to participate. There were no additional requirements for the paramedics. Patients were enrolled if they were 18 years or older and had an OHCA that was not caused by trauma (trauma included drowning and hanging).</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par20">The unit of randomisation was the paramedic, and not the patient. Individual paramedics were allocated randomly to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. This cluster randomisation by paramedic was also used in a recently completed study of airway interventions in out of hospital cardiac arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">Randomisation was performed using a method with secure allocation concealment that cannot be changed once allocated. The allocation was stratified by prior experience (more or less than 4 years full-time equivalent experience as an operational “front line” paramedic), to ensure that the experience of attending staff was equally distributed between the two trial groups. The sequence of random allocations was generated by computer and concealed until a paramedic had been recruited. This randomization process was carried out independently by the Bristol Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit.</p>

              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Treatment protocol</title>
                <p id="Par22">Paramedics who agreed to take part attended a training session, and were then given the opportunity to consent to take part in the trial. The training was delivered by an experienced research paramedic and a doctor with experience of prehospital care and expertise in ventilation. The primary focus of the training was to explain the treatment algorithm and how to adhere to it. It also included research ethics, good clinical practice and completion of case record forms.</p>
                <p id="Par23">The treatment algorithm for the titrated oxygen arm is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Paramedics were advised to consider titration of oxygen every 2 min. If there was no reliable saturation trace, or oxygen saturations fell below 94% study paramedics increased oxygen delivery in a stepwise approach as detailed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Titrated Oxygen Protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12873_2018_214_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p>
                <p id="Par24">Paramedics in the 100% oxygen arm used 100% oxygen throughout the first hour following ROSC. All other elements of routine care were provided as usual.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Patients received the allocated treatment for one hour following ROSC. If the patient was admitted to the emergency department during the first hour the allocated treatment was continued by emergency department staff.

                <p id="Par52">In the intervention arm, paramedics were able to titrate the inspired oxygen concentration in 72% of eligible patients. These findings improve on a previous study to examine pre-hospital oxygen titration, which analysed data from 17 patients in New Zealand and concluded that safe delivery of titrated oxygen therapy in the pre-hospital period was not feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p>
                <p id="Par53">Similar trials include a small pre-hospital feasibility study of 28 cardiac arrest patients who were allocated randomly to one of two groups immediately after ROSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Group A received 30% oxygen and group B received 100% oxygen. The study concluded that patients who received 30% oxygen had acceptable oxygen saturations (although the inspired oxygen concentration had to be increased in 5 of the 14 patients in the 30% group to maintain an SpO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 95%). The study demonstrated feasibility, however a larger trial did not follow.</p>
                <p id="Par54">A second randomised trial conducted in Australia documented widely scattered blood oxygen saturation values that were downloaded from pulse oximeter monitors; consequently, the study was discontinued early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Following the completion of our trial a further feasibility study has been published, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showing that a titrated oxygen strategy is possible. Arterial blood oxygen desaturations were more common in the titrated group, however the findings were used to support the case for a large randomised controlled trial. Our findings also suggest that oxygen saturation can be difficult to measure in the prehospital environment, and that arterial blood oxygen desaturations occur, though patient characteristics, paramedic training, organisation of emergency medical systems and distances travelled all differ between the UK and Australia.</p>

              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Limitations of the trial</title>
                <p id="Par55">We relied on paramedic reporting of pulse oximeter oxygen saturation readings and successful oxygen titration, rather than objective measures, since at the time of the trial automated recording of oxygen saturations was not available in our EMS. Also, we did not provide a standardised definition of ‘reliable’ pulse oximetry readings, and so there is likely to have been some variability in interpretation.</p>
                <p id="Par56">We used a cluster-randomised design by paramedic, which meant that the individuals delivering the intervention and reporting some of the outcomes were not blinded. Paramedics were not selected, but volunteered, and this may reduce the generalizability of our findings when applied to all paramedics. Poor recruitment of volunteer paramedics remains an issue for future trials. However, we required only a few individuals and so did not maximise our recruitment strategy; the same ambulance service recently recruited many more paramedics for a considerably larger randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our opinion, individual patient randomisation and paramedic blinding are not practical within UK EMS systems during time critical interventions such as cardiac arrest, and cluster randomisation is the only feasible approach.</p>

              <sec id="Sec20">
                <title>Future trials</title>
                <p id="Par57">We have collected relevant data, however the required sample size for any future study will depend on the chosen primary outcome. The relatively few eligible patients, along with incomplete initiation of the intervention and some missing data elements, makes a highly clinically relevant outcome such as mortality very challenging to achieve. A more realistic approach might be to evaluate serum NSE values as a measure of neurological injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Accurate SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement and automatic recording is also crucial to further trials in this area.</p>
                <p id="Par58">The inability to blind paramedics to the intervention is also a limitation. Future studies would benefit from a more objective and reliable method of measuring tissue and brain oxygenation, although this can be difficult in a prehospital environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par59">We have shown that it may be feasible to complete a randomised trial of titrated versus unrestricted oxygen in the first hour after ROSC following OHCA in the UK. However, the relatively few eligible patients and incomplete initiation of the allocated intervention are challenges to future research. More feasibility work is required to explore the best way of addressing this important research question.</p>
