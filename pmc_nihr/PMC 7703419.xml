                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The latest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) epidemiology survey in China estimated that there were 99 million potential COPD patients in the country, the majority of whom are undiagnosed. Screening for COPD in primary care settings is of vital importance for China, but it is not known which strategy would be the most suitable for adoption in primary care. Studies have been conducted to test the accuracy of questionnaires, expiratory peak flow meters and microspirometers to screen for COPD, but no study has directly evaluated and compared the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these methods in the Chinese setting.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We present the protocol for a multicentre cross-sectional study, to be conducted in eight community hospitals from four cities among Chinese adults aged 40 years or older to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different case-finding methods for COPD, and determine the test performance of individual and combinations of screening tests and strategies in comparison with quality diagnostic spirometry. Index tests are screening questionnaires (COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), COPD Assessment in Primary Care To Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk Questionnaire (CAPTURE), symptom-based questionnaire, COPD Screening Questionnaire (COPD-SQ)), microspirometer and peak flow. Each participant will complete all of these tests in one assessment. The primary analysis will compare the performance of a screening questionnaire with a handheld device. Secondary analyses will include the comparative performance of each index test, as well as a comparison of strategies where we use a screening questionnaire and a handheld device. Approximately 2000 participants will be recruited over 9 to 12 months.</p>

              <p>The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines individuals as being at high risk of COPD if they have chronic respiratory symptoms, exposure to risk factors or medical/family history of respiratory disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to the above definition, about 90% of people aged ≥40 years in China were at high risk of COPD in 2014.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The prevalence of diagnosed COPD in China was 13.7% in 2015.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Considering the substantial proportion of the Chinese population that is at risk of undiagnosed disease, screening for COPD in China is essential. Recently, China called for national policies and programmes for the prevention and early detection of COPD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10</xref> In line with this, government agencies have recommended the incorporation of pulmonary function tests into routine health examinations in China’s thirteenth five-year plan for healthcare.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>While guidelines recommend that COPD is diagnosed based on spirometry and symptomology,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> spirometry is not always available in primary care settings in China.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Among a large population of COPD patients in China, less than 12% had ever been tested using spirometry.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10</xref> As a result, there is a need for simple and affordable COPD screening tools in primary care settings.</p>
              <p>While COPD screening programmes are not currently recommended by the USA<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> or UK<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> due to insufficient evidence of health benefits, the national policy do recommend screening for undiagnosed COPD in China.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Despite the support for screening in China, there is no recommendation on the best strategy or approach to use. Multiple screening questionnaires have been developed to identify patients at risk of COPD, either in primary or secondary care settings.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–20</xref> Questionnaire items include the presence of respiratory symptoms (eg, wheeze, dyspnoea and cough) while some tools also explore exposures, smoking history and age. The questionnaires are all designed to be self-completed, but vary regarding the populations in which they were developed/validated, for example, general population or targeted groups such as symptomatic patients or current smokers. Microspirometers are small handheld devices that measure lung function, which are low cost, quick to use and require minimal coaching for patients. Peak flow monitors are simple, low-cost devices that measure how much air patients can expel during a forced expiration (peak expiratory flow, (PEF)), and evidence indicates that these devices may also be suitable as a possible screening tool for COPD.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 21 22</xref></p>
              <p>Screening tests can be used individually or in combination as screening ‘strategies’. Systematic reviews and more recent primary studies typically assess the use of a single test, concluding that many of the available tests may be appropriate for use in COPD screening.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref> However, studies in community settings in China are limited and it is not known which screening test or strategy would be most appropriate to use. As a middle-income country with a large potential COPD population, it is important to explore the most effective and cost-effective screening strategy. Accurately detecting individuals who merit referral for quality diagnostic spirometry could minimise the number of ineligible referrals, thus protecting health system resources and ensuring appropriate and timely treatment for those subsequently diagnosed.</p>

                  <p>A fully incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken from a healthcare perspective to calculate the cost per true case detected for all pre-determined strategies. The strategies (including combinations) will be ordered by the number of true cases detected, from least to greatest, and the principles of dominance and extended dominance will be applied to eliminate redundant strategies from the analysis. Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to explore the impact on results of any changes in assumptions, for example, time taken for a strategy.</p>

                <p>A 2-day training event will be organised for all researchers to ensure standardised study processes are followed at all research sites. Training will cover study processes and assessment techniques as well as expert teaching regarding respiratory physiology and spirometry lung function tests. Researchers’ competency in conducting spirometry will be certified at the end of the training. Spirometry traces from practice sessions will be over-read by an expert to ensure sufficient quality prior to participant recruitment commences. Local respiratory specialists will over-read all spirometry tests during the study period, to ensure quality is maintained. During site initiation visits, the study team will observe a complete study assessment to ensure researchers adhere to the study protocol. The study will conduct monitoring site visits throughout the study period.</p>

              <p>This study aims to identify the most effective and cost-effective screening strategies for identifying undiagnosed COPD in the primary care setting in China.</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the accuracy of different COPD screening strategies, including screening questionnaires, peak flow and microspirometer measurement. This study is being conducted in a range of community hospitals from rural and urban areas which are broadly representative of primary care institutions in China. The planned cost-effectiveness analysis will calculate the cost per true case detected for each strategy, which will help inform decisions about the future feasibility of screening strategies within the primary care setting in China. This trial should inform primary care across China and elsewhere with similar healthcare systems, and help to direct current effort towards case-finding more efficiently.</p>
              <p>While the study will be conducted in four purposively selected cities, it is possible that additional cities will be required to obtain a representative sample of the Chinese COPD population. However, increasing the number of study locations would have introduced difficulties such as training and monitoring study sites, thus we believe the selected cities represent an acceptable balance between study feasibility and representativeness. Furthermore, estimates of effectiveness are based on measurements undertaken under research conditions. While the screening tests are likely to be reproducible in routine practice, it is possible that peak flow and microspirometer measures could be done to a higher standard in research settings, leading to potential overestimation of effectiveness.</p>
              <p>This study also helps building research capacity within primary care, as it is the first respiratory study for the participating community hospitals and the majority of general practitioner (GP) researchers being taught how to conduct high quality spirometry will have no prior experience and might have difficulty in understanding the research process.</p>
              <p>Recent health policies have seen lung function testing being incorporated into a routine health examination programme among the general population, and objectives being set to increase the proportion of those over 40 years old received lung function tests from 7.1% in 2017 to 15% in 2020 and 25% in 2025.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Considering the increasing importance of lung function testing in China and the intensive spirometry training given to clinicians through this study, we believe this study could also help improve the quality of COPD management in primary care in China.</p>
              <p>Considering that there is no ‘GP first contact’ in China yet, it is challenging to plan how best to attract people attending community hospitals and recruit them into the study. However, voluntary pulmonary function screening identifies high rates of undiagnosed asymptomatic COPD.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> How to encourage residents to volunteer to participate in screening is also something we need to consider. It is also hard to anticipate residents’ willingness to participate in this study and how participants will respond to the study measures. However, what is worth mentioning is that, besides posters, referral by doctors, friends or family members, and WeChat, a social media which has a prominence in Chinese society now, also plays an important role in the recruitment process to inform residents or disseminate the programme. Last but not least, it will be important to discuss how this approach can be rolled out from a trial setting into routine practice. Real world study may be the most appropriate method to make it clear how the validated screening strategy works in practices.</p>
              <p>COPD screening is extremely important to China and its 99.9 million potential COPD patients.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This study will provide robust evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different COPD screening methods and strategies and confirm which the best COPD screening strategy is. The service might be a template for delivery of a procedural screening strategy that can reach large numbers of an under-recognized population. Although the long-term benefits of screening are still to be proven, this programme has capacity to contribute significantly to improving public health.</p>
