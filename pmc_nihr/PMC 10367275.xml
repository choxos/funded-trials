                  <title>Background
</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) involves repeated breathing pauses during sleep due to upper airway obstruction. It causes excessive daytime sleepiness and has other health impacts. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is effective first line treatment for moderate to severe OSA. Unfortunately, many patients have difficulty tolerating CPAP and pressure intolerance is probably an important contributing factor. Mandibular advancement devices (MAD) are an alternative to CPAP. They are worn in the mouth during sleep to reduce airway obstruction. There is some evidence that, when used in combination with CPAP, MADs improve airway anatomy enough to reduce the CPAP pressure required to treat OSA and that this combination therapy could improve CPAP adherence.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Consecutive patients starting on CPAP for moderate to severe OSA will be recruited at a regional NHS sleep service. Patients with high CPAP pressure requirements after initial titration, who satisfy all entry criteria and consent to participate, will undertake a 2-arm randomised crossover trial. The arms will be (i) standalone CPAP and (ii) CPAP + MAD therapy. Each arm will last 12 weeks, including 2 weeks acclimatisation. CPAP machines will be auto-titrating and with facility for data download, so the impact of MAD on CPAP pressure requirements and CPAP adherence can be easily measured. The primary outcome will be CPAP adherence. Secondary outcomes will include measures of OSA severity, patient-reported outcome measures including subjective daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and treatment preference at the trial exit and health service use. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be undertaken.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">If the intervention is shown to be effective and cost-effective in improving adherence in this standard CPAP-eligible OSA patient population it would be relatively straightforward to introduce into existing OSA treatment pathways, within the wider NHS and more widely. Both MAD and CPAP are already used by sleep services so their combination would require only minor adjustments to existing clinical pathways. It would be straightforward to disseminate the results of the study through regional, national, and international respiratory meetings. The health economics analysis would provide cost-effectiveness data to inform service planning and clinical guidelines through policy briefing papers, including those by NICE and SIGN.</p>

              <title>Introduction
</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par38">This study will assess an intervention that could enhance the effectiveness of an existing NICE-recommended therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Both mandibular advancement devices (MAD) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy are part of NHS clinical services. Should the results prove effective and cost-effective the new ‘combination therapy’ could be rapidly introduced as an additional, efficient tool to help the significant number of patients who struggle with ‘monotherapy’.</p>
                <p id="Par39">OSA is caused by closure of the upper airway during sleep due to excessive muscle relaxation. Pauses in breathing caused by total (apnoeas) or partial (hypopnoeas) airway closure cause oxygen levels to drop and brief awakenings that result in excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA impacts all aspects of life, including social and work performance and driving safety, and impairs quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. OSA has other important health effects. It is linked to high blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and a 2.5 times higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease including heart attack and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. OSA is associated with abnormal heart rhythms including atrial fibrillation, which itself undermines QoL and daytime functioning, and increases risks of stroke and road traffic accidents.</p>
                <p id="Par40">OSA is straightforward to diagnose and is treated with CPAP. A patient wears a mask connected to a small electric air pump that generates pressure to keep the throat open during sleep. CPAP is highly effective in treating OSA, improving daytime sleepiness, functional status and QoL. It is a treatment of choice for moderate-to-severe OSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">Unfortunately, not everyone tolerates CPAP and adherence rates range from 20 to 83%, so untreated OSA is prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Uncomfortably high pressure is a possible reason for CPAP intolerance. Patients start on a low pressure which is increased until OSA is controlled. For some patients the required pressure is higher than they can tolerate, making CPAP difficult to sleep with and defeating the purpose of treatment. In a nationwide survey of CPAP users, we found 68% had had difficulty using CPAP due to the pressure being delivered (details below). One method to try to improve CPAP tolerance is to use an auto-titrating CPAP machine. These aim to make CPAP more tolerable by continually monitoring for apnoeas and adjusting pressure according to whether they are occurring. Meta-analyses suggest auto-CPAP leads to a small improvement in CPAP adherence, although average pressure delivery is not much different to fixed pressure machines. Whilst auto-titration may help some patients to tolerate CPAP, it does not address all pressure-related issues and in some patients the pressure needed to control OSA exceeds CPAP's capacity, leading to ‘breakthrough’ OSA. More expensive machines deliver much higher pressures, but these are not available in every NHS service and there is no robust evidence that they are better tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par42">MAD are worn in the mouth during sleep. They treat OSA by advancing the lower jaw and increasing airway space. MAD are not as good as CPAP at treating OSA. However, they are useful in milder diseases, are cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and sometimes help people with more severe OSA who cannot tolerate CPAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">Combining MAD with CPAP could potentially open the airway enough to allow CPAP pressure to be reduced. This could allow patients requiring higher CPAP pressures to tolerate treatment better and use CPAP more, increasing the chance of improving OSA symptoms and avoiding longer-term health impacts. If this study shows combination CPAP-MAD does reduce CPAP pressures, then it would also establish the utility of this intervention for improving the experiences of patients with ‘breakthrough’ OSA.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Up to 24% of middle-aged men and 9% of women have at least mild OSA (apnoea–hypopnoea index [AHI]) ≥ 5/h) (Young et al. 1993). Two per cent to 7% of adults have associated excessive daytime sleepiness, known as OSA syndrome (OSAS). Untreated OSA has a substantial economic burden in terms of reduced work productivity, increased road traffic accidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and health care costs, especially for cardiovascular disease and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, older and middle-aged patients with OSA were shown to have roughly double the healthcare costs of aged-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which were reduced considerably with effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the limited utility of other treatments for more severe OSA means that patients who cannot tolerate CPAP often remain untreated, so new ways to modify CPAP pressure delivery are still needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par45">If the results of this study show CPAP-MAD combination therapy to be both effective and cost-effective it would be straightforward to make this treatment widely available. Results of our national patient survey suggest there are a significant proportion of OSA patients around the UK who need help and could benefit. Successfully treating these patients would not only improve their symptoms but could also reduce risk of longer-term conditions associated with untreated OSA, such as stroke. At population level, there is strong evidence that CPAP adherence is cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and superior to no treatment after a minimum of 2 years’ treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has been estimated that effectively treating all OSA could save the NHS roughly £1000 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The British Lung Foundation commissioned a report in 2014 which estimated that a total of £55 million and 40,000 QALYs annually could be saved if all people with moderate to severe OSA were diagnosed and treated with CPAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

The trial is explained, and a patient information sheet provided, and verbal agreement is gained to contact the patient to obtain their CPAP pressure reading once they have completed the initial CPAP titration. If the patient is still eligible and remains willing to take part in the trial, consent is taken by the Chief Investigator when the participant attends their six-week CPAP review.</p>

                <p id="Par73">Participants will receive a telephone call if they have not sent their dental impression to the device manufacturer within 2 weeks. Our experience with a previous MAD study identified this as an area where additional support reduces the chance of a participant dropping out at an early stage if they have difficulty with moulding a dental impression. There is also telephone support available to participants mid-treatment phase to “touch base” and deal with any concerns.</p>

Alternative options for OSA treatment will be discussed as required and appropriate. Participants will return to long term follow-up under the clinical service. Participants are not expected to come to significant harm from involvement in the trial. However, if they do then the NHS Indemnity scheme would apply.</p>

                <p id="Par79">Using data from the TOMADO study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we estimated a pooled variance of 5.51 within pairs of observations. Using this estimate as a reference (assuming that patient variability between CPAP and CPAP-MAD will be similar) we obtain a sample size of 58 patients to detect an hour increment in the average use of the treatment (combination over standard of care). The sample size formula used is Eq. (9) of Siyasinghe and Sooriyarachchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To allow for estimated loss to follow-up (informed from TOMADO experience) we intend to randomise an additional 10% of patients to give a final sample size of 64.</p>

                <title>Recruitment {15}</title>
                <p id="Par80">The recruitment rate will be closely monitored by the project team and the Trial Steering Committee. The aim is to have 50% recruited by months 14–16 from when the trial opens for recruitment and an assessment of feasibility for recruitment will be undertaken at this time if recruitment is below 35%.</p>
                <p id="Par81">One potential area for modification if recruitment is low is the eligibility threshold for CPAP pressure. The chosen inclusion criterion of ≥ 14 cm water was informed by the limited published data and a survey of our CPAP patients’ pressure ranges. Pressure readings for all patients screened for the trial will be recorded and if necessary we will examine the recruitment uplift potential of reducing the threshold to, e.g. 13 or 12 cm water.</p>
                <p id="Par82">From the initial review of screening results during the project team meeting of September 28th 2022, it was evident there was a significant chance of missing potentially suitable participants through pressure threshold requirements. Of the 22 not eligible due to pressure, 18 had reading &lt; 10 cm, one had reading 10–11 cm; two had reading 12–13 cm and one had reading 13–14 cm. Following communication with TSC, it was agreed to lower the eligibility threshold to ≥ 12 cm water and amendment was completed and granted Trust approval on 16<sup>th</sup> November 2022.</p>
                <p id="Par83">An important component of this trial is for the research team to work closely with the clinical service, specifically the CPAP practitioners (a representative will be included in the TSC). It will provide a direct line of communication to the staff conducting recruitment to get real-time feedback from patients approached (and should hopefully aid with participant retention). The CPAP team’s understanding of the patient population at Papworth will also be extremely important when it comes to adapting the logistics of the recruitment process in the event of low recruitment; and for the future rollout of any changes to clinical practice that the trial results lead to.</p>

It will provide a direct line of communication to the staff conducting recruitment to get real-time feedback from patients approached, which we hope will aid participant retention. The availability of telephone support aims to deal with any concerns that could impact on participant retention in a timely fashion. We have anticipated there might be reticence to attend appointments in person at Papworth and therefore retained the option to conduct the research visits 2 and 3 remotely. To improve data collection for follow-ups, we have put in place processes for participants to record data on either paper or by using the personal electronic CRF system available to the study so they can complete the study questionnaires at a time that suits them, rather than during core working hours. In addition, there is an option for participants to send electronic images of the sleep diary entries to Papworth.</p>

                  <p id="Par100">The primary outcome is the difference in CPAP adherence (hours per night) between treatment arms. The adherence in combination therapy minus that in CPAP defines the difference.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">The analysis will be a mixed-effects model, with a random intercept for each participant to account for variation in adherence within participants. We will adjust for oxygen desaturation, ESS at baseline, age, gender and BMI. If it is not possible to obtain adherence per night and instead we can only obtain mean adherence for each participant per treatment, the above analysis will not be possible. Instead, we will use a linear regression, adjusting for the same covariates as specified immediately above. In either case, we will report the 95% confidence interval for the difference in adherence between the two arms. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is greater than 1 (hour), we will conclude that there is evidence of increased CPAP adherence on the experimental (CPAP + MAD) arm compared to the standard (CPAP) arm.</p>

                <title>Methods for economic analysis</title>
                <p id="Par123">The economic analysis will account for short-term cost-effectiveness, using a within-trial analysis, and long-term cost-effectiveness using a decision model. The within-trial cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted from the viewpoint of the NHS, personal social services, and patients. Patient-specific resource use (device cost, device fitting and maintenance, delivery of kits and devices, use of GP and hospital services, treatment for adverse events) will be measured using data extracted from patient records and patient-reported data. Shared resource use (training of nurses and patients to use devices) will be accounted for using a mix of administrative logs and staff interviews. Valuation of resources used will be based on national unit costs or, in their absence, literature or local unit cost data. Outcome measures for quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, SF36) will be patient-reported and use NICE-recommended valuation methods, whereas effectiveness (adherence) will be device reported with no further valuation. A mixed effects model will be used to estimate differences in patient costs and outcomes (i.e. adherence, QALYs). We will investigate the importance of controlling for the following variables at baseline; quality of life, health service use, time period, oxygen desaturation, ESS at baseline, age, gender and BMI. We will undertake deterministic sensitivity analysis to consider, for example, varying the price and length of life of the MAD, and the impact of missing value imputation on findings. Results will be reported as total costs and effects for each arm, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and incremental net benefit.</p>
                <p id="Par124">The structure of the long-term cost-effectiveness model will be based on McDaid et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and account for the long-term impacts, e.g. on hypertension, stroke, and road traffic accidents. The model will be parameterised using; data from the PAPMAT trial (on treatment effects, costs, health utilities, the relationship between ESS and quality of life), updated national data (for mortality), estimates from McDaid et al. where a previous update did not find better data despite reviews of hundreds of abstracts (i.e. CVD risk, OSAS, road traffic accident risk), and a new evidence review on compliance. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will include; alternative estimates from the McDaid et al. model and Sharples et al. 2014 HTA report, alternative appropriately inflated costs from Sharples 2014 report. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to assess uncertainty that will be illustrated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p>

                <title>Interim analyses {21b}</title>
                <p id="Par125">The proposed interim analysis will be conducted when 29 patients have completed the primary endpoint, which is expected to happen at Month 21. The primary rationale behind the timing of the interim analysis is based on the minimum sample size needed to make precise estimates of the variance parameters in each arm of the trial. A range of published literature exists on the topic of minimum sample size for pilot studies, which is akin to the sample size requirements for an interim sample size re-estimation or internal pilot.</p>
                <p id="Par126">Traditionally a “rule of thumb” approach was used to set the sample size for pilot studies at around 30, though there have also been a number of papers published giving a more scientific basis for the selection of sample size for pilot studies.</p>
                <p id="Par127">For two-arm studies with a continuous outcome, Julious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] recommends a total sample size of 24 and Keiser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] recommends a total sample size of 20–40, whilst Sim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] recommends a total sample size of at least 50 and Teare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] recommends a total sample size of at least 70. Our recommendation for performing the interim sample size re-estimation after 29 patients have completed their primary endpoint sits towards the lower end of these figures. This must be carefully balanced with the duration of treatment and follow-up, particularly in the case of trials using a cross-over design, which will naturally delay the point at which the interim analysis occurs.</p>
                <p id="Par128">Sample size re-estimation is the primary task of the interim analysis. The trial statistician will prepare the analysis code to calculate the standard deviations (SD) of the crossover difference in the primary endpoint between the CPAP/MAD combination therapy and the CPAP therapy where the treatment group is labelled using a dummy randomisation list. An independent statistician will then run the code with the real randomisation list provided by the data manager and output the updated estimates of the SD for the crossover difference. The original sample size calculation will be repeated with the updated estimates to provide an updated sample size estimate which will be reported to the DMEC.</p>
                <p id="Par129">Another important task is to present a summary of the safety data so that the DEMC can evaluate if there is evidence of treatment safety or treatment harm. The frequencies of the AEs and SAEs will be summarised by the treatment group. Note that AEs that are OSA symptoms will not be reported.</p>
                <p id="Par130">In addition, information about patient recruitment and non-compliance will be reported at the interim analysis. The summary of recruitment data will be presented as well as the treatment group and month where appropriate. Non-compliance will be summarised by treatment group and the reasons for non-compliance will be reported where appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par131">The trial statisticians and data management team will assess data quality to ensure collecting high-quality data. The completeness of study data and data completeness will be monitored regularly.</p>
                <p id="Par132">Treatment efficacy will not be assessed at the interim analysis. In the event that the DMEC request additional data analyses at the interim stage the trial statistician will be responsible for providing these (via the independent statistician if unblinding is required).</p>

                <p id="Par134">Missing data will be quantified per variable (%). All essential variables for the outcomes are expected to be complete or at least low missing percentage before starting analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par135">For participants who discontinue the allocated treatment CPAP + MAD but continue to use the CPAP machine, we will use their adherence data as if they were still continuing their allocated treatment (i.e. intention to treat). For participants who discontinue the allocated treatment CPAP (and thus no longer provide adherence data), we will impute their adherence as zero hours for each remaining day. This pragmatic approach reflects the primary endpoint, which is the number of hours of CPAP adherence, and the wider research question, which is to examine if CPAP adherence is greater for participants allocated to CPAP + MAD compared to those allocated to CPAP only. More details with regards to the treatment of missing data will be given in the SAP, and in the health economics analysis plan (HEAP) in terms of costs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par160">Recruitment will be consecutive from the centre’s regular clinical population. Most patients are referred from primary care (although from a single centre) and so this, in addition to the fact that our approach to treating OSA is not significantly different to that of other centres, give us confidence that the results of this trial will be generalizable.</p>
              <p id="Par161">The inclusion criteria include a pragmatic approach to classifying OSA severity, depending on the diagnostic test used. Overnight oximetry is our centre’s entry level diagnostic test. It is used alongside expert clinical assessment to confirm OSA in most of our patients who receive this diagnosis and go on to start CPAP. Oximetry provides a 4%ODI/h. This is less sensitive than respiratory polygraphy or polysomnography, both of which also provide an AHI/h. Even using the AHI there are differing sensitivities etc. depending on the scoring rules used. Despite this, it is common practice to use the same numerical categories to define OSA severity. The impacts of this variability on diagnostic sensitivity etc. are well recognised. Whilst this might be relevant in other studies of OSA interventions using different outcomes, we do not consider it to be a problem for this study, where the primary outcome is adherence to treatment. Severity categories based on sleep study indices (4%ODI or AHI) are arbitrary and correlate poorly with symptom severity and adherence. Taking only patients with at least moderately severe OSA means there is negligible risk of including subjects with a false positive diagnosis, particularly as those who have not responded to initial auto-titrating CPAP will be identified and their diagnosis reviewed at visit 2 as part of eligibility checking.</p>
              <p id="Par162">We hope that most participants will be willing to attend all visits in person. This will allow, among other benefits, the monitoring of blood pressure, which is an important secondary outcome that continues to be the subject of ongoing meta-analyses. However, to be inclusive and maximise recruitment and retention we will be offering visits 4 and 5 remotely to those patients who might otherwise find it difficult to commit to the trial. This is likely to also increase generalizability as data from our centre suggest that patients from areas of higher social deprivation may be less likely to attend appointments and remain under clinical follow-up.</p>

              <p>TQ conceived the trial, developed the original protocol for the clinical trial and oversaw the background scientific review, which was undertaken and drafted by CF. SV, VS, YDC and ML provided statistical expertise in clinical trial design. SV and ML will undertake the statistical analysis. YDC drafted the statistical analysis plan. JFR and KKL drafted the economic analysis plan and will undertake the within-trial economic analysis and long-term economic modelling. With regards to subsequent publications: we expect authorship of the publication that reports the results to be similar to the authorship of the protocol. If any protocol authors do not fulfil authorship criteria in subsequent publications, their role in protocol design will be acknowledged in those publications. Likewise, the author list will include any new researchers who fulfil authorship criteria. Furthermore, we will include as authors any professional writers who fulfil authorship criteria, though there are no plans to use professional writers.</p>
