                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>SIOP Ependymoma I was a non-randomised trial assessing event free and overall survival (EFS/OS) of non-metastatic intracranial ependymoma in children aged 3–21 years treated with a staged management strategy. A further aim was to assess the response rate (RR) of subtotally resected (STR) ependymoma to vincristine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (VEC). We report final results with 12-year follow-up and <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses of recently described biomarkers.</p>

              </caption>
              <p>We report original results and twelve-year follow-up of an international paediatric ependymoma clinical trial of 74 participants. Our study reports event free and overall survival of a staged management strategy targeting maximum local tumour control. We demonstrate a measurable response of subtotally resected ependymoma to vincristine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. We also highlight areas for improvement in trial management which has informed our current Ependymoma II clinical trial. Additionally, we confirm the significance of chromosome 1q gain, <italic toggle="yes">hTERT</italic> expression, and H3K27me3 loss in a trial series and apply DNA methylation profiling. Our study contributes to debate about the efficacy of chemotherapy in childhood ependymoma and shares the long-term outcomes of a previously unreported trial cohort.</p>

                <p>Previous retrospective studies indicated five-year OS for those with primary GTR and STR ranged from 30% to 85% and 0% to 45% respectively. As there were no reliable prospective data at the time of study design RR, rather than survival was used to measure chemotherapy efficacy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> This study assumed five-year OS of 70% with GTR and 35% with STR (HR = 0.34 favouring GTR). It was assumed that 3/8 would achieve GTR. Using two-sided 5% significance and 80% power, a study of 65 participants was proposed (GTR 24, STR 41). On the basis of previously published responses to high-dose chemotherapy combinations in ependymoma,<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> it was anticipated that if RR to chemotherapy in the STR group was under 25% there would be no interest in the combination. In contrast, RR 45% or more would suggest worthwhile efficacy and was set as the criterion for chemotherapy response. A one-stage Fleming-A’Hern design required 32 STR participants with a minimum of 13 responses to claim sufficient activity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Due to poor compliance with chemotherapy allocations, an “as-treated” analysis was performed for chemotherapy treated participants to better understand the true RR to VEC.</p>

                <p>89 participants with intracranial ependymoma from 25 centres in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands were registered between 17th May 1999 and 1st November 2007. Four participants had metastatic disease at presentation, whilst 11 did not have a histopathological diagnosis of ependymoma. Of those with a non-ependymoma diagnosis on histopathology, six underwent <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> DNA methylation profiling, all of which were confirmed as non-ependymoma. No patients were removed on the basis of DNA methylation profile alone. This left 74 participants with non-metastatic intracranial ependymoma (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Thirty-eight of seventy-four (51%) participants were male. Median age at diagnosis was 7.8 years (range 3.1–18.8). Forty-seven of seventy-four (64%) had posterior fossa (PF) tumours and 39/74 (53%) were WHO Grade 2. Twenty-nine (39%) participants achieved GTR after first surgery. Of the 45 with initial STR, ten (22%) had early second-look surgery, four of these (40%) achieved GTR and six (60%) still had STR, leaving 41/74 (55.4%) with STR prior to adjuvant therapy, a GTR rate of 33/74 (44.6%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Most second-look surgeries (10/16, 63%) occurred prior to adjuvant therapy, but because decisions on further surgery were taken at local centres, it has not been possible to determine detailed outcomes of second surgery for the six participants undergoing subsequent surgery. To consider second-look surgery in more depth, a surgical panel retrospectively reviewed post-operative scans following STR to independently consider whether they would have attempted further early resection. There were limitations to imaging availability, but the surgical panel would have attempted early second resection in 10/25 cases reviewed (40%). Of these, four actually had early second-look surgery, two of whom achieved GTR.</p>
                <p>There was no difference in extent of resection between centres with high numbers of cases (five or more) compared to centres with low numbers (four or fewer) (High volume = 18/39 (46.2%) GTR, Low volume = 15/35 (42.9%) GTR, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .776, Chi-square test). There was no difference in age, tumour volume, or location between participants with GTR versus STR. Resection rates improved over time; the GTR rate between 1999 and 2002 was 12/37 (32.4%), rising to 21/37 (56.8%) between 2003 and 2007 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .035, Chi square test). The greatest improvements in resection rates over the trial were in lower volume centres (25%–50%) when compared with higher volume centres (43%–55%).</p>

              <p>Whilst knowledge of ependymoma has advanced since trial design,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37–40</xref></sup> development of effective treatments has shown little progress.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> We report long-term outcomes for children treated with a staged management strategy and that the best chemotherapy RR of 65.5% exceeded a prespecified 45% rate, supporting the use of VEC for inoperable childhood ependymoma. We also retrospectively applied molecular diagnostics to a clinical trial cohort.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A primary aim was to assess the role of chemotherapy in inducing a tumour response for participants with STR. The best RR of 65.5% suggests that VEC is associated with tumour response in this group. Whilst the number receiving chemotherapy was 29 rather than the targeted 32, the 19 responses exceeded the 13 prespecified for demonstration of efficacy. We assessed RR rather than survival as an outcome because no prospective survival data was available when the study was designed.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Further work is required to establish whether chemotherapy provides either a direct survival benefit or an indirect benefit through the facilitation of additional surgery. The <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> comparison between STR participants with and without chemotherapy was not designed to answer this.</p>
              <p>In 12 participants for whom STR was achieved, no chemotherapy was given, in breach of the protocol, additionally four patients with PD continued on chemotherapy when they should have discontinued. Both of these inaccuracies resulted from local treatment decisions, as prospective central radiological review was not mandated. Additionally, there were four cases in which the family did not consent to chemotherapy. The challenge of protocol compliance for post-operative chemotherapy regimens in ependymoma is not a unique experience; a similar problem has been reported in ACNS0831<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and the SIOP Ependymoma II study is experiencing related difficulties (Personal Communication, R Grundy, 2021). We have now included rapid central review within the current SIOP Ependymoma II study and based on this experience, we recommend the use of multidisciplinary meetings at trial registration to enhance protocol compliance.</p>
              <p>Whilst a number of studies have identified a role for chemotherapy in children under three years, aiming to avoid or delay radiotherapy,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> others have disagreed.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Our study demonstrated chemotherapy efficacy in older age groups. This is consistent with the findings of more recent US studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Garvin used a combination of vincristine, cisplatin, and etoposide and reported a RR of 57% in 35 evaluable participants, which is close to our RR of 65.5%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Massimino reported a cohort of 160 children using VEC chemotherapy to bridge the gap to second resection but did not directly report on the RR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> More recently, ACNS0121 investigated children with STR given vincristine, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and oral etoposide, followed by radiotherapy and second-look surgery with combined CR and PR of 67%.<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Preliminary results from the ACNS0831 study indicate a role for chemotherapy in some patients with totally, or near totally, resected ependymoma; maintenance with vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide following radiotherapy was associated with a significantly better 3-year EFS (80% vs 71%). Whilst this chemotherapy was delivered at a different stage of treatment and different resection status to our study, it provides further evidence of a role for chemotherapy in some patients with ependymoma.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The results of the STR and chemotherapy arm of ACNS0831 are awaited. The VEC chemotherapy regimen in our trial did not include a platinum based drug. Given the evidence of response of tumour residuum to VEC, future studies must consider the benefits of platinum chemotherapy against the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.</p>
              <p>Although not a primary aim, we have attempted to answer important questions related to surgery. The importance of GTR in obtaining good outcomes has been re-emphasised in this study, with improved EFS. It is important to note that our definition of GTR was less stringent than the present day. In line with standards at the time of protocol design, GTR was accepted as &lt;1.5cm<sup>2</sup> tumour on cross sectional imaging. In the present SIOP Ependymoma II study, 1.5cm<sup>2</sup> of tumour would be classified as residuum R3 making resection rates difficult to directly compare. A retrospective review of scans attempted to elucidate factors behind incomplete surgery. This was hampered by limited availability of complete sets of pre- and post-operative scans. However, as reported, no differences between GTR and STR participants were identified.</p>
              <p>This study was powered for a 38% GTR rate and bettered this with a rate of 45%. It is notable that GTR rates rose from 32.4% to 56.8% during the trial. Surgeons have become increasingly aware of the prognostic impact of GTR on ependymoma outcomes and, in association with this, resection rates reported in clinical trials have increased. However, surgeons are frequently not aware of the diagnosis at surgery. Review of a subgroup of operation notes in this study revealed that smear or frozen section results were frequently non-committal or incorrect. In less than half of cases in which operation notes were reviewed was there either confident suggestion of ependymoma or confirmed histology. Better pre-operative diagnosis may aid surgical planning and improve resection rates. Improved imaging techniques may help to address this challenge.<sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The small number of participants undergoing further early resection makes it hard to assess the added value of attempting to convert STR to GTR with repeated surgery. The retrospective surgical panel felt that twice as many participants may have been suitable for second-look surgery as occurred (40% vs 22%). As a result of this experience, earlier consideration of further surgery by an independent panel alongside close assessment of the morbidity associated with repeat surgery is a focus of the SIOP Ependymoma II trial.<sup><xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> A weekly panel review aims to deliver more definitive answers on the benefits and morbidity of exhaustively pursuing GTR. This is critical, as surgery for cerebellopontine angle ependymoma is associated with high morbidity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Interestingly, there was no difference in resection rates between high and low-volume surgical centres. There is a trend to refer children to higher volume centres for surgery, but our data would not support this. However, this is based on a small retrospective analysis and should not change practice.</p>
              <p>The protocol requested radiotherapy information including: baseline imaging used to determine gross tumour volume; copies of the radiotherapy plan and treatment chart; and copies of the simulator and machine verification films for quality assurance. However, there was no established process in place to facilitate this and hence full radiotherapy dosimetric data was not available for analysis. The trial was carried out during a time of transition from 2D simulator planning, to CT assisted 3D planning and the technical details reflect this. In the 20 years since the design of this study, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy, helical tomotherapy, and proton beam therapy have become standard of care for ependymoma and the radiotherapy techniques in this trial, including the dose of 54 rather than 59.4 Gy, do not reflect contemporary practice.</p>
              <p>This prospective clinical trial was designed prior to recent molecular discoveries; however, it provided an opportunity to apply retrospective molecular analyses to a well-defined cohort, allowing comparison with other studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> The results of central histopathology review and DNA methylation classification aligned closely with one another, however half of the cohort did not undergo DNA methylation profiling. Future studies must mandate the provision of tissue for molecular analyses, because they have the potential to provide more objective tumour classification for trial stratification and biological discovery.<sup><xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The finding that 1q gain was associated with poor outcome confirms previous reports.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In-line with ACNS0121 we assessed 1q gain across supratentorial and PF tumours and found it to only be associated with poorer outcomes in children with PF tumours.<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The prevalence of 1q gain in our cohort was higher than reported by others.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> One possibility is that this is a result of inclusion of multiple methods of testing, detecting additional cases that may not have been identified by FISH alone. Alternatively, there may be a genuinely higher rate of 1q gain, but we were unable to identify any abnormality that would account for this.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">hTERT</italic> mRNA expression was associated with poorer outcomes. However, this analysis was conducted in a small subgroup of the whole cohort. Notwithstanding this, our finding is consistent with the previous reports for ependymoma expressing <italic toggle="yes">hTERT</italic>.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> We also confirmed previous findings limiting <italic toggle="yes">hTERT</italic> expression to PFA and <italic toggle="yes">ZFTA</italic>-fused ependymomas.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Loss of H3K27me3 expression was associated with poorer OS, likely reflecting the strong association between loss of this marker and PFA tumours.<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> TNC expression and absence of H3K27me3 was limited to PFA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Given that TNC is a marker for PFA, based on the other samples tested with no DNA methylation result, there was likely to be at least a further nine PFA tumours in our cohort, indicating that 70% of our cohort were PFA, consistent with it being the most common childhood ependymoma type. RELA protein has also been reported as an immunohistochemical marker for <italic toggle="yes">ZFTA</italic>-fused ependymoma,<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> however, we identified RELA expression across multiple subtypes, indicating that RELA expression alone is not suitable for identifying these tumours. A potential prognostic parameter is <italic toggle="yes">CDKN2A/B</italic> which seems to be associated with particularly poor prognosis in retrospective studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Whilst we did not measure this it presents a further route of investigation for ZFTA-fused ependymomas.</p>
              <p>The retrospective nature of the methylation analysis resulted in low numbers of each subtype, highlighting the challenges of obtaining sufficient tissue. When designing prospective molecularly stratified studies, estimates of cohort size must account for this. It is also clear that with the description of new molecular entities this stratification will become even more challenging.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In some settings obtaining methylation results in time for prompt stratification can be challenging or impossible, therefore it is important to continue to identify reliable but robust alternative markers for molecular groups.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We confirm the importance of GTR in childhood ependymoma and present evidence that amongst those with STR there is activity of VEC with a RR of 65.5% (95% CI 45.7–82.1) with acceptable toxicity profile. This supports a potential beneficial role for chemotherapy in children with intracranial ependymoma. However, as this study was not designed to measure changes in EFS and OS, further data is required to determine whether there is an associated survival impact. Further work is needed to establish whether this varies depending on the molecular tumour designation. We confirm that 1q gain, <italic toggle="yes">hTERT</italic> expression, and H3K27me3 loss are poor prognostic factors for intracranial ependymoma. Future trials must include prospective, molecularly stratified, approaches to better understand the clinical implications of recent molecular discoveries.</p>
