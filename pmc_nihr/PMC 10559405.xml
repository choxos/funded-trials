                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">New treatments are needed for people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), who do not benefit from anti-depressants and many of whom do not recover fully with psychological treatments. The Community Navigator programme was co-produced with service users and practitioners. It is a novel social intervention which aims to reduce loneliness and thus improve health outcomes for people with TRD. Participants receive up to 10 individual meetings with a Community Navigator, who helps them to map their social world and set and enact goals to enhance their social connections and reduce loneliness. Participants may also access group meet-ups with others in the programme every 2 months, and may be offered modest financial support to enable activities to support social connections.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A researcher-blind, multi-site, 1:1 randomised controlled trial with <italic>N</italic> = 306 participants will test the effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme for people with TRD in secondary community mental health teams (CMHTs). Our primary hypothesis is that people who are offered the Community Navigator programme as an addition to usual CMHT care will be less depressed, assessed using the PHQ-9 self-report measure, at 8-month, end-of-treatment follow-up, compared to a control group receiving usual CMHT care and a booklet with information about local social groups and activities. We will follow participants up at end-of-treatment and at 14 months, 6 months after end-of-treatment follow-up. Secondary outcomes include the following: loneliness, anxiety, personal recovery, self-efficacy, social network, social identities. We will collect data about health-related quality of life and service use to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par42">About a third of people with depression who take anti-depressants with appropriate treatment protocols do not experience improvement and their depression can be termed “treatment resistant” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Psychological treatments are effective for some but of limited benefit for many in this treatment-resistant depression (TRD) group: symptom remittance was achieved for less than half the participants in a large trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for TRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among people with TRD in observational studies, only 20–30% recover over a few years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For people with TRD whose illness is already protracted, only about 40% recover over 10 years’ follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Many of those with TRD who have the most severe, complex, and enduring difficulties are supported in the UK by secondary mental health services (where people may be referred from GP, other primary care or mental health crisis services). In a UK trial, optimised medical and psychological support for TRD from specialist teams provided only modest additional benefit compared to routine secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A completed feasibility trial which informs this trial protocol confirmed the high levels of clinical and social need in our trial target population of people with TRD in secondary care services: participants were typically single, not in work, met clinical thresholds for severe depression and anxiety, and were extremely lonely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More research and new types of support are urgently needed for this clinical group.</p>
                <p id="Par43">The social determinants of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], including the important role of social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], have long been understood, yet we lack established social interventions of known effectiveness. Loneliness, defined as the subjectively experienced gap between desired and actual social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], is an independent predictor of recovery from depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. People with depression have tenfold increased odds of loneliness compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and are commonly extremely lonely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Yet support with social relationships and loneliness is often overlooked in mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and we lack well-developed, effective programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Reducing loneliness offers a promising intervention target, different from those addressed by pharmacological or psychological treatments for depression, for improving outcomes for people with TRD.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The Community Navigator programme is a novel social intervention designed to reduce depression severity by reducing loneliness and social isolation for people with TRD in secondary care. A completed feasibility trial of the Community Navigator programme indicated that the programme was feasible to deliver and evaluate, and was well-received by participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The direction and magnitude of effect suggested for loneliness and depression outcomes showed promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and warranted a definitive trial to test the effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme. The trial described in this protocol will test the programme’s effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par45">The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that people with TRD in secondary care community mental health services who are randomised to be offered the Community Navigator programme in addition to routine care, will be less depressed, measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire – Mental Health Disorders (PHQ-9) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], at 8-month (end-of-treatment) follow-up, compared to a control group receiving routine care and an information booklet about local social resources.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Secondary objectives include testing the hypotheses that, compared to controls, the intervention group will be less depressed at 14 months (6 months after end-of-treatment) follow-up, and less lonely, less anxious, with better personal recovery at 8- and 14-month time-points. A further objective is to determine the cost-effectiveness of the Community Navigator programme.</p>
                <p id="Par47">In an embedded sub-study, we will explore, through qualitative interviews, the perceived impact of the Community Navigator programme, how benefits were achieved, and key considerations for its provision in NHS settings. Methods and findings from the qualitative sub-study will be reported in a separate publication, outside of this trial protocol.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par48">This is a researcher-blind, parallel group randomised controlled superiority trial with two arms. Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio to receive either support from a Community Navigator in addition to routine care (treatment arm), or a booklet with information about local groups and resources plus routine care (control group).</p>
                <p id="Par49">Assessments will be conducted by blinded researchers at the time of consent (baseline) and at two main outcome points: 8-month (end-of-treatment) and 14-month (6 months after end-of-treatment). Baseline measures will be collected at the screening visit, or may be completed if necessary in subsequent meetings, within a maximum of 4 weeks from taking consent. Additional depression and loneliness ratings will be collected through a self-completed online form or through a phone or video call with a study researcher at 4 and 11 months. These additional 4- and 11-month data collection points will be used in additional analyses exploring mediating effects of loneliness on depression (see section “<xref rid="Sec45" ref-type="sec">Methods for additional analyses (e.g., subgroup analyses) {20b}</xref>”).</p>

                <p id="Par50">The trial is being conducted in England and patients are recruited through Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) or equivalent secondary mental health care services. Depending on local service configurations, participating services may be general CMHTs for adults with any mental health diagnosis, or teams specifically for patients with depression or anxiety. General adult CMHTs or older adult CMHTs may both be included, as long as they serve patients meeting the trial inclusion criteria.</p>

Control group participants will also be offered a booklet with information about local community groups and social activities: this constitutes minimal signposting support with developing social connections and addressing loneliness, which could be provided within routine care, may be helpful to participants, and may mitigate feelings of disappointment for people allocated to the control group. Participants in both trial arms may access any other types of available support and treatment from the CMHT or other services: participation in the trial will not restrict access to routine care.</p>

                  <title>The intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par69">The Community Navigator programme was co-produced with service users and practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is designed to increase social connections and reduce feelings of loneliness for people with TRD using secondary mental health services.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">The programme offers participants up to 10 sessions of 1:1 support from a Community Navigator and attendance at three participant group “meet-ups” over a 6-month period. Participants are then offered one follow-up phone call and attendance at one more meet-up group during the next 2 months, so the intervention is concluded within 8 months from randomisation. Participants must attend at least three individual sessions with the Community Navigator for the intervention to be considered to be delivered per protocol. It is designed to be delivered primarily through face-to-face contact, but 1:1 and participant group “meet-ups” could all be arranged remotely if required to meet participants’ needs and preferences. To help develop social connections as part of the goals of the intervention, participants will be able to access modest financial re-imbursement to cover costs incurred (a maximum of £100 per participant). This will help ensure that poverty, or delays with personal budgets or other forms of statutory assistance, are not insuperable barriers to enacting goals to address loneliness. A detailed intervention manual was developed during the completed feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and will guide the Community Navigators and supervisors in this trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">The frequency and timing of 1:1 meetings can be decided flexibly between the participant and the Community Navigator, to meet the participant’s needs. Support will involve three stages:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par72">The Community Navigator will help people map their social world, using a previously developed mapping technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], recording people, places and activities which are subjectively important to the person, and considering lapsed activities or contacts which the participant might want to resume, or new social groups or connections they might wish to develop. This mapping will be combined with exercises helping people to review and develop their current and desired sense of belonging to social groups. These are derived from a social identities intervention, “Groups4Health”, developed for the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and were adapted for our TRD population with the support of the developers during the feasibility trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par73">This information is then used by the Community Navigator to help the participant develop a “personal connections plan”, recorded using a bespoke chart developed in the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Participants develop goals for increasing their social connections and are helped to break these goals down into steps, and identify personal resources and support within their network and community which can help them achieve their goals. Plans may involve engaging in new social groups and developing new contacts, or reconnecting with groups, friends or family; developing more meaningful social connections with people within existing social groups or activities that are valued and reinforce positive social identities.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par74">Next, the Community Navigator will provide different types of social support as appropriate to help participants enact their plans. This may include informational support (e.g., finding out about local groups or activities, or travel options to access them); practical support (e.g., using the budget; planning how a participant wants to introduce themselves in a social situation), or emotional support (e.g., going with a participant the first time to a new group, checking in with them after a phone call to a potential friend). Community Navigators will use solution-focused problem-solving approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] to help participants break down goals into smaller steps if they are proving challenging. Participants’ social network maps will be reviewed and any progress in developing social connections encouraged and celebrated. Community Navigators will at all times help participants to develop social connections which are sustainable without long-term support from a Community Navigator; they will not provide befriending. For example, a Community Navigator would not typically accompany a participant several times to the same social group, as this support cannot be maintained after the end of the programme.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par75">Group meet-ups will have an informal style and be lightly facilitated by the Community Navigators. They will encourage information-sharing about helpful local resources, experiences of developing connections and what has helped. Navigators will also introduce participants who may have shared interests or points of connection, and potentially help facilitate a meeting as part of 1:1 support if participants are keen. Responding to qualitative feedback from the completed feasibility trial, we plan a “soft ending” to the programme which does not feel abrupt. Navigators will offer a telephone or video call follow-up and one more group meet-up (the fourth of four available to each participant) after the ten 1:1 meetings, all to be completed before 8-month follow-up.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">Participants will also continue to receive routine care from their mental health team (CMHT). If any treatment group participants are discharged from the CMHT more quickly than anticipated at trial enrolment, while they are still receiving support from a Community Navigator, this support will continue unless the clinical team explicitly direct that this is inadvisable. Local protocols will be developed for Community Navigators to be able to pass on any concerns about participants’ safety or wellbeing to the CMHT, even for participants who have been discharged from the team.</p>

                  <title>The control group</title>
                  <p id="Par77">Participants in the control group will be offered written information about community resources and activities within their area. Participants will be encouraged to consider these resources themselves or discuss them with their care team. This constitutes a very low-cost, low-intensity comparator to the trial intervention, to test whether active, individualised support is superior to generic signposting. Participants will otherwise receive routine care from a CMHT, unaffected by their participation in the study. Routine care from a CMHT typically includes reviews by a psychiatrist and, regular meetings with a care coordinator, and may include psychological therapy.</p>

                <p id="Par78">The intervention is designed to be delivered flexibly, in a personalised way to meet individual participants’ needs and help them attain personal goals. Participants may choose to stop meeting their Community Navigator at any point during the intervention, and attendance at group “meet-ups” is also voluntary.</p>
                <p id="Par79">A participant may be withdrawn from trial treatment whenever continued participation is no longer in the participant’s best interests, but the reasons for doing so must be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par80">Decisions to withdraw a participant from the trial intervention will be made ultimately by the site Principal Investigator, following consultation with the involved clinical team, and recorded in the participant’s case record form.</p>

                <p id="Par81">Community Navigators will use all available contact details held by the mental health team to contact participants. They will ask participants about their preferred contact methods and use these wherever possible. They will be as flexible as possible about the time and date of meetings and will seek to rearrange meetings in the event of participants cancelling or not attending meetings; keeping the invitation to participate open throughout the study intervention period.</p>
                <p id="Par82">In order to monitor intervention content and adherence, unblind members of the research team will collect brief information from Community Navigators about meetings with participants, which will be logged in the trial database. This will allow us to describe the number of sessions and meet-up groups attended by each participant and whether or not a participant was treated per protocol (at least three individual sessions).</p>

                <p id="Par112">We will recruit 306 participants. The standard calculation to detect a 0.4 standard deviation (sd) difference in PHQ-9 depression score between arms with 90% power and 5% alpha requires 132 participants per arm. Adjusting for baseline PHQ reduces the sample size by <italic>r</italic>-squared, where <italic>r</italic> is the correlation between baseline and follow-up outcome values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Assuming a correlation of 0.5 and 15% attrition (informed by the feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]) results in a sample size of 117 participants per arm. Assuming four sites, three navigators per site, and an ICC for clustering by navigator of 0.05, results in a design effect of 1.6 (based on 13 participants per navigator). Inflating the sample size for clustering in the intervention arm only (to 188), then adjusting group sizes to be equal, produces a sample size of 153 participants per arm.</p>
                <p id="Par113">In response to peer review comments, we have checked the sample size calculation using simulation and have found that we do obtain 90% power, as calculated, when analysing the data using a mixed model with ML, treating each control subject as a cluster of size 1. However, as noted by the reviewer, the confidence interval coverage and type I error are slightly improved by analysing the data using REML with the Kenward-Rogers adjustment. This results in a slight loss of power but is the analysis we now intend to use. The power to detect a (standardised) difference of 0.4 is reduced to 87%, or equivalently, we have 90% power to detect a difference of 0.42. This still provides 90% power to detect a minimum personally meaningful difference on PHQ-9 between groups of about 2 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>

The blinded study researchers will ask participants not to reveal whether or not they were allocated to get support from a Community Navigator, but it is possible some participants may reveal their allocation status to the researcher nevertheless. The research team will keep a log of such unblinding incidents and, wherever possible, an alternative researcher who is still blinded will carry out follow-up assessments.</p>

                    <p id="Par140">We will calculate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of Community Navigators plus routine care compared to routine care over 14 months from a health and social care cost perspective, using the EQ-5D-5L to calculate QALYs. Secondary analyses will include (i) using the ReQoL to calculate QALYs; (ii) including wider societal costs such as productivity and absenteeism and use of voluntary services.</p>
                    <p>We will calculate the cost of delivering the Community Navigator intervention, including training and supervision based on activity reported by the Community Navigators. Unit costs for staff costs and Community Navigator costs will be taken from the Personal Social Services Resource Unit (PSSRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. We will collect all participants’ mental health service use information from health records, including contacts with community mental health staff and any use of inpatient or crisis services. Other health and social care resource use including primary care will be collected from an adapted CSRI at completed with researcher support at baseline, 8 months and 14 months asking about the past 6 months. The feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] identified that our TRD client group also had a range of physical health needs, so we will ask about planned and unplanned acute hospital resource use. Participants will be asked to report use of social prescribing schemes, befriending, peer support groups and other social clubs, organisation and voluntary sector groups as part of a bespoke questionnaire at baseline and each follow-up time-point to collect detailed information on any additional activities that might have occurred as a result of the intervention, with equivalent information also collected for the arm receiving only routine care. Health and social care resource use will be costed using NHS reference costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and PSSRU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. For wider societal costs, we will ask about current employment status and for employed participants’ time off work sick in the past 6 months, with additional absenteeism and presenteeism information collected using the Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], incorporated into the CSRI. This will be costed using the human capital approach. Costs of voluntary services and accommodation will also be included in wider societal costs.</p>
                    <p>QALYS will be calculated using the EQ-5D-5L and appropriate UK tariff as the area under the curve adjusting for baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. EQ-5D-5L has been shown to be a valid and responsive measure for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] although there is limited evidence for TRD. The use of the EQ-5D-5L is recommended in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] allowing for comparisons across disease areas. In the Community Navigators feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (noting very small patient numbers), patients in the intervention group had a 0.19 increase in utility compared to 0.05 in the control group, indicated that the EQ-5D-5L may be sensitive to a treatment effect. However, to address potential limitations with the EQ-5D-5L, we will also calculate QALYs using the ReQoL and its published tariff, a measure of mental health-related quality of life.</p>
                    <p>We will report the mean incremental cost per QALY gained of the Community Navigator programme plus routine care, compared to routine care, over 14 months for all analyses. The denominator and numerator of the incremental cost per QALY gained will be calculated using regression analysis, accounting for baseline, site as a fixed effect and Community Navigator as a random effect. Other potential coefficients for inclusion will be considered as part of a health economics analysis plan signed off before database close. 95% confidence intervals, cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be calculated based on bootstrapped results. Assuming missing at random, we will use multiple imputation using chained equations to account for missing data. We will consider any potential missing not at random effects and sensitivity analyses for any uncertainty. All costs and consequences beyond 12 months will be discounted at a rate of 3.5% in line with NICE guidance.</p>

                <p id="Par160">This study is funded by the English National Institute for Health and Care Research, Health Technology Assessment Programme (NIHR HTA). It has been added to the NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio and included on the ISRCTN registry.</p>
                <p id="Par161">Our study will provide high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of a novel programme to address loneliness and social isolation and reduce depression for people with TRD in secondary care. We will provide a final report for the funders in adherence to their requirements. We will seek to publish scientific papers in open access journals, reporting the trial protocol, main results, qualitative investigations and health economics findings. In collaboration with the trial Lived Experience Advisory Panel members, we will co-produce a briefing document for policy makers, a guide to support future programme delivery in mental healthcare settings, and articles in publications read by practitioners and commissioners and by service users and the public. We will present findings at stakeholder workshops, meetings or conferences. We will update the Community Navigator intervention manual and training manual and make these publicly available, to speed up knowledge transfer if warranted by trial findings.</p>
                <p id="Par162">The Study CI will draft a publications plan identifying proposed lead and included authors and timescales for publications. This will be discussed and agreed at study TMG meetings. Authorship will be based on ICMJE guidelines. All proposed publications will be discussed with and reviewed by Priment CTU prior to publishing.</p>
                <p id="Par163">Trial participants will be asked during the consent process if they would like to receive a lay summary of the study findings. The study team will work with the trial Lived Experience Advisory Panel to develop an accessible summary of the study findings to send to all interested participants when the study is over.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par164">Our trial addresses a gap in evidence regarding theory-driven and potentially effective social interventions for people with TRD that, by targeting loneliness and social isolation, would act via a different mechanism from the pharmacological and psychological treatments currently available. Our intervention could help mental health services provide genuinely biopsychosocial care for an important clinical group who are not adequately helped by current treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par165">Research on interventions for loneliness in mental health is in its infancy: effective models of support have yet to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The Community Navigator programme represents one socially focused approach to addressing loneliness, involving employing additional staff with a bespoke role solely to help people with social connections, in addition to usual care. Other studies have developed and tested social interventions with different mental health client groups which involve seeking to train and upskill the existing care team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A range of psychological interventions for loneliness has also been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Whatever the result of our trial, further research is required to determine the most acceptable and effective intervention models to reduce loneliness and improve health and social outcomes across a range of clinical groups. To our knowledge however, the Community Navigator trial is the first study of a programme designed to reduce depression through alleviating loneliness for people with TRD in a secondary care context. Findings will provide rich information to inform practice and future research.</p>
