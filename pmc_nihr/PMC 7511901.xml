                  <p>To evaluate a 1-year programme to improve CRTs’ model fidelity in a non-masked, cluster-randomised trial (part of the Crisis team Optimisation and RElapse prevention (CORE) research programme, trial registration number: ISRCTN47185233).</p>

                  <p>Fifteen CRTs in England received an intervention, informed by the US Implementing Evidence-Based Practice project, involving support from a CRT facilitator, online implementation resources and regular team fidelity reviews. Ten control CRTs received no additional support.

                  <p>All CRTs were retained in the trial. Median follow-up CSQ-8 score was 28 in each group: the adjusted average in the intervention group was higher than in the control group by 0.97 (95% CI −1.02 to 2.97) but this was not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.34). There were fewer in-patient admissions, lower in-patient bed use and better staff psychological health in intervention teams. Model fidelity rose in most intervention teams and was significantly higher than in control teams at follow-up. There were no significant effects for other outcomes.</p>

              <title>Method</title>
              <p>A non-blind cluster-randomised trial evaluated whether a CRT service improvement programme improved patients' experience of CRT care, reduced acute service use and improved CRT staff well-being. The trial also investigated whether the Fidelity Scale scores of CRTs receiving the service improvement programme increased over the 1-year intervention period compared with control sites, and whether change in team Fidelity Scale score was associated with change in service outcomes. Cluster randomisation was used because the trial involved a team-level intervention. The primary hypothesis was that patients' satisfaction with CRT care, measured using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (8-item version, CSQ-8)<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> was greater in the intervention group than the control group at end-of-intervention 1-year follow-up.</p>
              <p>The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN47185233) in August 2014 and the protocol has been published.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> This paper reports the main trial results and relationships between teams' model fidelity and outcomes.

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>The 25 teams were randomised, stratified by NHS trust, after a baseline fidelity review had been conducted for all teams within each NHS trust. In order to maximise learning about implementation of the service improvement programme within available study resources, more teams (<italic>n</italic> = 15) were randomly allocated to the service improvement programme than to a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 10). A statistician independent of the study generated allocation sequence lists and conducted randomisations. Researchers and staff in participating services were aware of teams' allocation status in this non-masked trial. Patient-participants and trusts' informatics teams providing data from patient records were not informed of teams' allocation status.</p>

                <title>The intervention</title>
                <p>The team-level service improvement programme supported CRT teams to achieve high fidelity to a model of best practice, defined in the CORE CRT Fidelity Scale<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and informed by a systematic evidence review,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> a national CRT survey<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and qualitative interviews with stakeholders.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The service improvement programme was delivered over 1 year and consisted of: (a) ‘fidelity reviews’ at baseline, 6 months and 12 months: teams were assessed and given feedback on adherence to 39 best practice standards for CRTs; (b) coaching from a CRT facilitator (an experienced clinician or manager) 0.1 full-time equivalent, who could offer the CRT manager and staff advice and support with developing and implementing service improvement plans; (c) access to an online resource kit of materials and guidance to support CRT service improvement for each fidelity item; and (d) access to two ‘learning collaborative’ events where participating teams could meet to share experiences and strategies for improving services. Structures to support service improvement in each team included: an initial ‘scoping day’ for the whole team to prioritise and plan service improvement goals; and regular meetings of a CRT management group and the CRT facilitator, to develop and review detailed service improvement plans.</p>
                <p>Through these resources and structures, the service improvement programme constituted a sustained, multicomponent programme of support to CRTs, which aimed to address the different domains of implementation support identified as contributing to attainment of high fidelity in the US Implementing Evidence-Based Practices Program<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in a tailored way to meet individual services' needs: prioritisation of the programme, leadership support, workforce development; workflow re-engineering; and practice reinforcement.</p>
                <p>Teams in the control group received a fidelity review and brief feedback at baseline and 12-month follow-up, but no other aspects of the study intervention.</p>

                  <p>Information technology staff from participating NHS trusts provided anonymised data from patient records about all acute service use during data-collection periods. Study researchers calculated study outcomes from these raw data (further details in supplementary data 2).</p>
                  <p>Fidelity Scale scores were derived for each team from a structured, 1-day ‘fidelity review’ audit following a well-defined protocol, involving three independent reviewers from the study team (including at least one clinician and one patient or carer-researcher).

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>The primary hypothesis, that patients' satisfaction with the CRT, measured by the CSQ<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> is greater in the intervention group teams than control teams, was analysed using a linear random-effects model (mixed model) with a random intercept for CRT, controlling for mean baseline CSQ score by CRT. Patient-reported perceived continuity of care and measures of staff well-being were analysed similarly using linear random-effects models. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals were reported. The calculated sample size provided 95% power to detect half a standard deviation difference between groups in mean satisfaction measured by the CSQ (3.5 points assuming a typical s.d. of 7.0) using a two-sided test, allowing for within-team clustering (intraclass correlation coefficient  0.05).</p>
                <p>Patient outcomes at follow-up (in-patient admissions, bed days and readmissions following CRT care) were compared between intervention and control groups using Poisson random-effects modelling with a random intercept for trust. For each outcome, baseline score was set as the exposure variable, as it accounts for the baseline population and health of the catchment area as well as local admissions policies. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported. A second set of analyses was also conducted, using catchment area population as the exposure variable.</p>
                <p>At team level, Fidelity Scale scores in the intervention and control groups at follow-up were compared, adjusting for baseline scores. The relationship was explored between change in team Fidelity Scale score from baseline to 12-month follow-up, and changes in five study outcomes: patient satisfaction, staff work engagement, in-patient admissions, in-patient bed use and readmission following CRT care. Relationships at team level between change in outcomes and change in fidelity scale subscale scores were also explored. For patient satisfaction and staff work engagement, we fitted linear regression models relating change in outcome (follow-up – baseline) to change in Fidelity Scale score (follow-up – baseline). For the remaining outcomes, we used normalised change in outcome ((follow-up – baseline)/square-root (baseline)). To aid interpretation, we present correlations to summarise these relationships with the corresponding <italic>P</italic>-values from the regression/correlation analyses.</p>

                <p>Recruitment to the trial is summarised in the CONSORT diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>. All 25 CRT teams were retained in the trial. We did not achieve our recruitment target of 15 patients per team in six teams at baseline and in one team at follow-up. These shortfalls occurred in teams with smaller case-loads, or where eliciting staff help to contact potential participants was problematic. At each time point, 62% of eligible patients whose contact details were provided to researchers agreed to participate (353/567 at baseline; 371/594 at follow-up); however, the proportion of eligible patients in each CRT who were initially approached by CRT staff is unknown. At each time point, 79% of all current staff in trial CRTs participated (441/560 at baseline and 431/544 at follow-up). One NHS trust, covering five participating CRTs, was unable to provide data at follow-up from patient records about whether in-patient admissions were compulsory or voluntary; complete patient records data were otherwise obtained.

The CRT manager was unable to organise a scoping day for the whole team in one CRT. Otherwise, all the main components of the intervention were provided in all teams, but not always as promptly or completely as planned. Teams targeted a median of eight fidelity items each (selected as priorities by the team) over the course of the year in their service improvement plans.

The range in change scores on the CORE CRT Fidelity Scale in intervention group teams was from −22 to +37, with a mean change of 8.1 points. (The mean baseline Fidelity Scale score in the intervention teams was 116.4 and the mean follow-up score was 124.5). This contrasts with the control group, where none of the ten teams increased their Fidelity Scale score from baseline to follow-up, with a range in change scores from −20 to 0, with a mean change of −9.7 points. (The mean baseline Fidelity Scale score in the control teams was 122.2 and the mean follow-up score was 112.5.) There was a significant difference in outcome Fidelity Scale scores between intervention and control groups, adjusting for baseline scores (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0060).

                <p>At team level, there were significantly fewer total in-patient admissions and in-patient bed days in the intervention group than the control group over 6 months, after adjustment for baseline rates, suggesting that admissions were reduced more in intervention teams than in controls during the study period. These results were not replicated in a second analysis that adjusted for catchment area population instead of baseline rates, suggesting that admission rates relative to the size of the local population may not have been significantly lower in intervention teams than controls at follow-up, although we note that this second analysis does not adjust for differences in patient case-mix across areas. There was no difference between groups in rates of compulsory in-patient admissions or in rates of readmission to acute care following an episode of CRT care.

                <title>Relationship between outcomes and model fidelity</title>
                <p>There was a weak positive correlation of 0.34 between change in Fidelity Scale score and change in patient satisfaction, which corresponds to a mean increase of 0.65 points on the CSQ Scale for a ten-point increase in Fidelity Scale score. There was a weak negative correlation (i.e. in the expected direction) of −0.38 between Fidelity Scale score and readmissions following CRT care. There was no evidence of associations between change in total Fidelity Scale score and change in in-patient admission rates, bed days or staff work engagement. In <italic>post hoc</italic> exploratory analyses of subscale scores, a relationship between reduction in in-patient admissions and increase in access and referrals fidelity subscale score was apparent (correlation  −0.32). Readmissions following CRT care, by contrast, were most closely correlated with the timing and location of care (−0.45), and content of care (−0.34) subscales. Patient satisfaction was most closely correlated with the content of care subscale (correlation 0.36). Illustrative graphs are provided in supplementary data 7.</p>

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>For the primary outcome, patient satisfaction was not significantly greater in teams receiving the programme than in control teams. Model fidelity improved in 11 of 15 teams receiving the CRT service improvement programme over the study period, compared with none of the 10 control teams. There was some indication of significantly better results over the study period for the intervention teams compared with controls regarding hospital admission rates and in-patient bed use. Staff psychological health and psychological flexibility were higher at follow-up in the intervention group. There were non-significant trends favouring the intervention group teams regarding patient satisfaction, readmission to acute services following CRT care, and staff morale and job satisfaction. There was no evidence that the trial intervention reduced rates of compulsory admissions.</p>
                <p>Altogether, this suggests the intervention was insufficient to achieve all its intended service improvements, but did achieve some, notably better model fidelity and reduced in-patient admissions. It may thus help unlock the potential benefits of CRTs in reducing the high costs and negative experience for patients associated with in-patient admissions. Positive results from our study also provide international validation for the process developed by the US Implementing Evidence-Based Practice project<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> but not previously trialled in a UK NHS context, as a means to support implementation of complex interventions in mental healthcare.</p>

              <sec id="sec3-2" sec-type="other">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Three limitations of the study relate to its design. First, other local and national service initiatives that arose during the year of the trial may have influenced CRT implementation and outcomes independently of the trial intervention. Second, because CRTs in each trust share senior managers and communicate regularly at management level, there is a possibility of contamination, where elements of the trial intervention were also accessed by control teams. Third, the 1-year follow-up period may have been too short for teams to fully enact their service improvement plans and to capture all changes in model fidelity and outcomes resulting from the trial intervention.</p>
                <p>Four further limitations of the study relate to data collection. First, for patient experience outcomes, the participants recruited were highly satisfied with care, compared with previous studies,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and may well over-represent those who were best engaged and most easily contactable by CRT staff. CRTs may have varied in the proportion of patients they approached and asked about taking part in the trial, with possible resulting bias. There appears to have been a ceiling effect in our sample with the trial primary satisfaction outcome measure (CSQ-8): 26% of participants in the treatment group at follow-up gave a maximum score of 32, compared with 12% in the control group. There may have been differences between groups in patients' satisfaction with CRTs that our evaluation failed to capture. We further note that fidelity gains regarding service organisation or the extent of care, even where achieved, may not have translated into increased patient satisfaction as broadly measured by the CSQ-8, if not accompanied by improvements in staff's clinical competence<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and reduction in negative interactions with individual staff,<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> both of which have been identified as important to patient experience.</p>
                <p>Second, data regarding acute service use were provided in anonymised form from NHS patient records and could not be verified as complete by researchers. Information about whether in-patient admissions were compulsory or voluntary was not available for five teams at follow-up.</p>
                <p>Third, neither fidelity reviewers nor participating services could be masked to teams' trial allocation status during follow-up CRT fidelity reviews. Intervention group teams may have been more motivated to prepare thoroughly for their review and thus maximise their score. Reviewers may have unconsciously favoured the intervention group when assessing fidelity.</p>
                <p>Fourth, it was not possible to confirm wholly accurate data regarding CRTs' catchment area population size, some of which were based on general practitioner registration rather than geographical area (see supplementary data 2). This possible measurement error does not affect the results for service-use outcomes reported in the main text of this paper – which are in any case better able to assess change in service use (and therefore the impact of the intervention) during the study period, through adjusting for baseline service use in each team – but may have affected the second analysis of service-use outcomes (supplementary data 6), which adjusted for catchment area population.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec3-3" sec-type="other">
                <title>Implications for research</title>
                <p>A future economic evaluation of the study will explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention as delivered in this trial. Qualitative and process evaluations (also to be reported separately) will explore in more depth the content of support provided by facilitators in the project, the focus of teams' service improvement plans, the organisational contexts in which the intervention was delivered, and how these factors may relate to the extent of teams' success in improving model fidelity during the project. This may inform the development, and then evaluation, of a revised, CRT service improvement programme that better targets critical components of care, engages stakeholders and addresses organisational barriers to service change.</p>
                <p>Our trial sought to improve outcomes in CRTs through the mechanism of increasing teams' model fidelity, but only weak relationships between changes in teams' overall Fidelity Scale score and outcome were established, and not for all outcomes. Three possible reasons for this could be explored in future research. First, the reliability of the CORE CRT Fidelity Scale has not been unequivocally established.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
<italic>In vivo</italic> testing of interrater reliability is desirable. Second, some critical components of CRTs may not be assessed by the CORE CRT Fidelity Scale. All fidelity scales are better able to audit team organisation and the extent of service provision than to assess the clinical competence with which care is delivered,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and relationships between fidelity and outcomes are moderate even for the most well-established scales.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Other methods, possibly involving direct observation of practice; may be required to evaluate clinical competence in CRTs. Third, critical components of effective CRT services may be present but insufficiently weighted in teams' overall Fidelity Scale score for it to relate closely to service outcomes. The closer relationships with some outcomes we found for specific fidelity subscales provide some support for this idea. A large observational study, evaluating model fidelity and outcomes across many CRTs, could test hypotheses about the relationship between team outcomes and Fidelity Scale item or subscale scores.</p>

                <title>Implications for policy and practice</title>
                <p>In general, for the control teams in our trial, Fidelity Scale scores dropped, readmissions following CRT care rose, and in-patient service-use outcomes were worse than for the intervention group teams. This suggests that there is a pressing need for effective CRT service improvement support. This trial suggests that considerable input is needed to improve service quality in CRTs: our successfully implemented, multicomponent programme of sustained support for CRTs did not demonstrate improved patient satisfaction, and only partially achieved its aims. The CORE CRT service improvement programme provides a useful starting point for developing future CRT service improvement initiatives, having achieved improvements in model fidelity in teams from varied geographical and provider-trust contexts and a range of baseline levels of fidelity, and having some evidence of effectiveness in reducing admissions and in-patient service use. It is informed by a model of implementing complex interventions in mental health settings with prior evidence of effectiveness in US contexts<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> that now also has evidence of applicability to English services, with potential usefulness beyond CRTs. The CORE service improvement structures and the online CRT Resource Pack<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> are publicly available and provide guidance, materials and case examples to support good practice in CRTs. Clear specification of a CRT service model and development of effective resources to support CRT service improvement can help ensure that consistent provision of acceptable and effective home treatment for people experiencing mental health crisis is fully achieved.</p>
