                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is rising in the UK and is associated with maternal and neonatal complications. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance advises first-line management with healthy eating and physical activity which is only moderately effective for achieving glycaemic targets. Approximately 30% of women require medication with metformin and/or insulin. There is currently no strong evidence base for any particular dietary regimen to improve outcomes in GDM. Intermittent low-energy diets (ILEDs) are associated with improved glycaemic control and reduced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and could be a viable option in the management of GDM. This study aims to test the safety, feasibility and acceptability of an ILED intervention among women with GDM compared with best National Health Service (NHS) care.</p>

                  <title>Method and analysis</title>
                  <p>We aim to recruit 48 women with GDM diagnosed between 24 and 30 weeks gestation from antenatal clinics at Wythenshawe and St Mary’s hospitals, Manchester Foundation Trust, over 13 months starting in November 2022. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to ILED (2 low-energy diet days/week of 1000 kcal and 5 days/week of the best NHS care healthy diet and physical activity advice) or best NHS care 7 days/week until delivery of their baby. Primary outcomes include uptake and retention of participants to the trial and adherence to both dietary interventions. Safety outcomes will include birth weight, gestational age at delivery, neonatal hypoglycaemic episodes requiring intervention, neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, admission to special care baby unit or neonatal intensive care unit, stillbirths, the percentage of women with hypoglycaemic episodes requiring third-party assistance, and significant maternal ketonaemia (defined as ≥1.0 mmol/L). Secondary outcomes will assess the fidelity of delivery of the interventions, and qualitative analysis of participant and healthcare professionals’ experiences of the diet. Exploratory outcomes include the number of women requiring metformin and/or insulin.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval has been granted by the Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (22/EE/0119). Findings will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and shared with diabetes charitable bodies and organisations in the UK, such as Diabetes UK and the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background</title>
                <p>In the UK up to 16% of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the incidence is rising, in part due to increasing rates of obesity and maternal age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> GDM is associated with maternal and neonatal complications (the risk increases with poor glycaemic control), including macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, caesarean sections, neonatal hypoglycaemia and/or hyperbilirubinaemia, preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and stillbirth.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Women who have had GDM have an estimated 7-fold to 10-fold risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) later in life, and their children have a higher risk of developing adult obesity and T2DM.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref></p>
                <p>Excessive weight gain in pregnancy is a particular problem for women with GDM.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Harper <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> demonstrated that, in women with GDM, every additional 1 lb/week gained following diagnosis of GDM resulted in a 36%–83% increased risk of pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, macrosomia and large for gestational age babies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Such studies highlight the importance of adequate weight control throughout pregnancy in women with GDM in order to reduce both maternal and neonatal complications.</p>
                <p>First-line therapy for GDM is diet and physical activity. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance encourages a healthy diet with increased fruit and vegetables, low-glycaemic index (GI) foods, reduced refined sugars, regular mealtimes and regular physical activity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> These dietary measures fail to achieve glycaemic targets in ~30% of women who require medication with metformin and/or insulin.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A range of dietary approaches have been studied including daily diets promoting low-GI diets (limiting refined and promoting complex carbohydrates), continuous modest energy restriction (1800 kcal/day) and low carbohydrate diets.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There is currently no strong evidence base for any particular dietary regimen to improve outcomes in GDM.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Intermittent low-energy diets (ILED)</title>
                <p>The pathogenesis of GDM is strongly linked to obesity and chronic insulin resistance with many clinicians viewing GDM as a form of evolving T2DM. ILEDs typically include several days of a food based or meal replacement (eg, drinks/bars) low-energy diet (650–1000 kcal), with a standard healthy (non-restrictive) diet recommended on the remaining days of the week. These diets are associated with significant reductions in weight, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia in patients with pre-diabetes (Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) between 42 and 47 mmol/mol, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glycaemia), those with T2DM, and otherwise healthy subjects with overweight/obesity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–17</xref> These changes are equivalent to, or greater than, those achieved with standard daily energy restriction. A popular intermittent diet involves 2 consecutive or non-consecutive days/week of a low-energy diet (650–1000 kcal) and 5 days of normal eating/week, known as the 5:2 diet. The Manchester Intermittent versus Daily Diabetes App Study (MIDDAS), a study comparing an ILED and a continuous low-energy diet in T2D conducted in our unit, has shown the feasibility and safety of an ILED (800 kcal for 2 days/week) in patients with T2DM and obesity, including those using insulin.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> At the end of the study, approximately 70% of participants in the ILED group completed the study and achieved a 6% reduction in their baseline body weight. 42% achieved an HbA1c of &lt;48 mmol/mol.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Given the strong overlap between GDM and T2DM, an ILED may be a promising dietary intervention for those with GDM.</p>
                <p>A successful dietary approach to glycaemic control could empower women to take charge of the management of their GDM. Women with GDM are motivated to modify their diet driven by a desire to improve foetal outcomes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref></p>
                <p>Our patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) work indicates that women find the current NICE healthy eating guidance<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> confusing and vague. Our PPIE work has indicated that women are keen to try alternative dietary approaches, particularly if alternative diets are more effective in preventing the need to progress to medications such as metformin and insulin.</p>

                <title>Trial setting and recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants will be recruited from antenatal clinics at Wythenshawe and St Mary’s Hospitals, Manchester Foundation Trust (MFT) between November 2022 and December 2023. This is an urban area within Greater Manchester, and MFT serves patients from a wide range of minority ethnic and sociodemographic backgrounds. Women may self-refer to the antenatal clinic or be referred by their primary care team. Assessments will be carried out at MFT, or remotely if required by COVID-19 restrictions. The qualitative substudy will be carried out at MFT, remotely, or at a location of the participant’s choosing. We aim to recruit eligible participants over a period of 13 months. Potential participants will be given written information about the study and the opportunity to ask questions about the study prior to providing written consent (<xref rid="SP1 SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental files 1 and 2</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Participants who fulfil the broad eligibility criteria will be notified about the trial by the GDM nurse/midwife at the time of their diagnosis. Those who are interested will be provided with a comprehensive patient information sheet (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>) and more detailed eligibility screening questions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). They will be asked to attend their first appointment having fasted for at least 6 hours and complete a 4-day food diary (in line with our department’s usual care). On attending their first routine clinic appointment, interested participants will receive further information from the research team.

                  <p>We plan to recruit 24 participants per study arm (n=48) which, when considering an estimated attrition rate of 15%, will provide complete outcome data on 40 participants.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> It has been estimated that 24 participants per group will be sufficient to determine study outcomes, in line with sample size recommendations for feasibility studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref></p>
                  <p>This number will allow us to enable estimation of recruitment/retention parameters with sufficient precision. For example, based on 40 completed participants, it will enable recruitment rates in the region of 25% to be estimated with an error of ±13.42% at most; retention of 85% will be estimated with error of ±11.07% at most. It is also sufficient for estimation of variability (eg, SD) in gestational weight gain and capillary glucose concentrations (proposed outcomes for the future definitive trial) with negligible bias.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>

Clinicians will not be blinded due to the need to remain astute to safety, adherence and side effects, requiring open and honest discussions with patients at each appointment.
