                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 16% of adults in the UK. Patient quality of life is particularly reduced in end-stage renal disease and is strongly associated with increased hospitalisation and mortality. Thus, accurate and responsive healthcare is a key priority. Electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) are online questionnaires which ask patients to self-rate their health status. Evidence in oncology suggests that the use of ePROM data within routine care, alongside clinical information, may enhance symptom management and improve patient outcomes. However, National Health Service (NHS)-based ePROM research in CKD is lacking. This pilot trial will assess the feasibility of undertaking a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with CKD within the NHS.</p>

                  <p>The renal ePROM pilot trial is an investigator-led single-centre, open-label, two-arm randomised controlled pilot trial of 66 participants â¥18 years with advanced CKD. Participants will be randomised to receive either usual care or usual care supplemented with an ePROM intervention. Participants within the intervention arm will be asked to submit monthly self-reports of their health status using the ePROM system. The system will provide tailored information to patients in response to each report and notify the clinical team of patient deterioration. The renal clinical team will monitor for ePROM notifications and will respond with appropriate action, in line with standard clinical practice. Measures of study feasibility, participant quality of life and CKD severity will be completed at 3 monthly intervals. Health economic outcomes will be assessed. Clinicians will record treatment decision-making. Acceptability and feasibility of the protocol will be assessed alongside outcome measure and intervention compliance rates. Qualitative process evaluation will be conducted.</p>

              <p>Effective management of advanced CKD relies on the timely detection of clinical deterioration towards ESRD. This can be a major challenge between scheduled clinic visits, when it is often difficult to identify clinical deterioration unless a patient self-refers. Unfortunately, some patients self-refer too late because they have difficulty identifying the point at which they may require assistance. Without prompt recognition of advanced symptoms, such patients are at high risk of severe illness, emergency hospitalisation and associated worse clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are validated questionnaires which ask patients to self-rate their health status. They can provide important information regarding the patientâs perspective on the physical, functional and psychological consequences of treatment and the degree and impact of disease symptoms.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Evidence suggests thatÂ the use of PROM data, alongside regular clinical information, within routine care may:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Aid patientâprovider communication and support shared decision-making.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Improve patient activation and help patients to feel more involved/empowered in decisions around their care.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Improve the accuracy of symptom assessment and enhance symptom management.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Enhance patient education and self-management and maximise patient safety.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10â15</xref></p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>With recent advances in technology, there has been considerable interest in the use of electronic PROMs (ePROMs) for the routine monitoring of patients with long-term conditions. ePROMs offer patients an âelectronicâ method of data entryâfor example, webÂ based via PC, smartphone or using tablet devicesâand give clinicians a flexible platform with which they may view PROM data.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 16 17</xref></p>
              <p>ePROMs offer patients the option of inputting data at a time and place, and via a platform, that is convenient to them. ePROM data can be used to help provide patients with tailored advice on self-management and can provide clinicians with detailed health-related quality of life (HRQL) and symptom data both inÂ clinic and between scheduled appointments via home/remote data capture.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>For patients with advanced CKD, this would allow clinicians to monitor for symptom deterioration, facilitating the early detection of problems requiring attention and promoting timely intervention from the clinical team (eg, advice aimed at aiding patient self-management or escalation of care). Such intervention may delay disease progression and the need for costly and invasive RRT, and reduce emergency hospitalisations and other adverse outcomes.</p>
              <p>A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in an oncology setting in the USA, demonstrated that ePROM use is associated with improved HRQL, reduced accident and emergency visits, reduced hospitalisations and superior quality-adjusted survival.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Both in Canada and Denmark, ePROM collection has been shown to be feasible in a renal population.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 18 19</xref> However, National Health Service (NHS)-based ePROM research in CKD, utilising real-time patient and clinician feedback is lacking. Routine remote use of ePROM data by patients with advanced CKD may aid self-management, while also helping to improve the flow of information between patients and their clinicians, potentially improving patient safety, enhancing clinical interactions, optimising patient outcomes and delivering cost savings to the NHS.</p>
              <p>A RCT is needed to evaluate ePROM efficacy in advanced CKD to determine if health professionals, providers and policy-makers should implement routine ePROM collection in renal practice. However, before a definitive trial is undertaken, a pilot trial is required to assess the feasibility of undertaking such a study and to help inform the key elements (eg, appropriate outcome measure, sample size) of the design for the full-scale RCT.</p>

                <p>The primary comparison groups will be composed of those randomised to usual care (control group) versus those randomised to usual care supplemented with the ePROM intervention (experimental group). In the first instance, all analyses will be based on the intention to treat principle, thatÂ is, all participants will be analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomised irrespective of compliance with the allocated treatment or other protocol deviation. The data analysis for this pilot trial will be descriptive and mainly focus on CI estimation, with no hypothesis testing performed.</p>
                <p>Data will be explored to assess the key feasibility aspects of undertaking a full-scale RCT on the use of ePROMs in the management of advanced CKD. Dichotomous feasibility measures, such as the recruitment and retention rates, as well as data completeness, will be reported as numbers and percentages. Where appropriate, these values will be summarised across treatment groups.</p>
                <p>Adherence with the ePROM intervention will be assessed by calculating the number and percentage of participants who complete the ePROM reports as scheduled. To be considered adherent, participants will need to have submitted their report within 72âhours of the scheduled timeÂ point. Incomplete submissions (ie, with some questions not answered) will be accepted for the purpose of measuring adherence. AdÂ hoc ePROM reports (ie, those completed outside the scheduled reporting periods) will not contribute to the assessment of adherence, although we will assess the number of ePROM reports completed by each participant.</p>
                <p>The pilot data will also help inform the selection of the most appropriate primary outcome measure for the main RCT and provide data to facilitate estimation of the sample size required for the main RCT.

                <p>In this study, we will develop and pilot methods to capture the costs and outcomes to inform an economic evaluation in the main RCT. This will examine healthcare resource use and outcomes across the two arms of the study.</p>
                <p>The primary perspective adopted will be NHS/personal social care; which will focus on healthcare resource use and costs including: renal staff activity in response to ePROM notifications; GP and hospital consultations; in-patient hospitalisation; medications; referrals and NHS costs associated with maintenance of the ePROM system.</p>
                <p>Where possible, data on NHS resource utilisation will be collected from the electronic patient records. Other data will be collected via case report forms (CRFs), either completed in study follow-up visits or on event-triggered forms (eg, generated in response to an ePROM alert). Resource use will be valued using appropriate unit costs such as the British National Formulary and the most recent version of Unit Costs of Health and Social Care and NHS Reference Costs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>

                  <p>The Trial Management Group will monitor all aspects of the conduct and progress of the trial, ensure that the protocol is adhered to and take appropriate action to safeguard participants and the quality of the trial itself.</p>
                  <p>A single TSC will be convened and will meet at least yearly and as required depending on the needs of the TSC/trial office. The TSC will provide overall oversight of the trial, including the practical aspects of the study, as well as ensuring that the study is run in a way which is both safe for the patients and provides appropriate feasibility data to the sponsor and investigators. The TSC will also undertake the final assessment of feasibility. Given this is a pilot study, a data monitoring committee is not required.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants and study personnel/clinicians involved in the pilot trial will be invited to take part in the qualitative substudy. Up to 40 participants (20 patients and 20 study personnel/clinicians) will be recruited, purposively selected to capture those participants who experienced a range of outcomes and experiences during the trial where possible. However, recruitment will continue until data saturation is reached.</p>
                  <p>Semistructured interviews will be conducted by a member of the Centre for Patient-Reported Outcome Research team at the University of Birmingham according to a predefined topic guide, but there will be sufficient scope to explore novel themes where appropriate. All interviews will be digitally recorded, professionally transcribed and the transcripts anonymised. Transcript data will be entered into a specialist software package (eg, NVivo, QSR International) to aid organisation and analysis of the data. All data will be analysed by the CI using conventional content analysis. Formal triangulation of coding and member checking will be employed to enhance the credibility of the analysis. Only anonymised quotes will be used in any arising publications or reports.</p>

              <p>Personal data recorded on all documents will be regarded as strictly confidential and will be handled and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. Data transferred from the host site to the researchers (University of Birmingham) will be securely stored and only used for analysis or study monitoring relevant to the participant taking part in the research. The findings from the trial will be used to inform the design of a future, full-scale, RCT. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at scientific conferences and disseminated to the public via lay summaries/newsletters in partnership with our PAG. Study manuscripts will be prepared by the chief investigator and authorship will be determined by the trial publication policy. Intellectual property rights will be addressed in the Clinical Study Site Agreement between Sponsor and site. The full protocol is available on request to the corresponding author.</p>

              <p>Development of the research question, outcome measures and study design was informed by a series of meetings held with the RePROM PAG, which included people with lived experience of CKD. The PAG reviewed all patient-facing study documentation and considered the overall burden of study participation during the design process.</p>
