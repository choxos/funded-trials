                  <p id="P2">In a randomised, placebo-controlled, human infection experiment at University Hospital Southampton Clinical Research Facility, UK, healthy adults, aged 18-45 years, were randomised 2:1 to receive intra-nasal inoculation with either 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units of Nlac in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or 1 ml PBS alone. Participants, and researchers performing participant sampling and immunological assays, were all blinded to allocation. The primary endpoint was a comparison of circulating Nlac-specific plasma cell (B<sub>PLAS</sub>) and memory B cell (B<sub>MEM</sub>) frequencies post Nlac inoculation (day 7-28), as compared to baseline (day 0), measured using Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISpot) assays. The secondary endpoint was to measure the frequency of Nmen-specific B<sub>PLAS</sub> and B<sub>MEM</sub>. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03633474) and is now closed.</p>

              <p id="P5">The human oro-nasal pharynx is colonised by a wide range of harmless commensals which provide natural immunity against occasional pathobionts. The mechanism in many cases is undetermined but could be harnessed for future vaccine strategies. Pharyngeal colonisation with the pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nmen) occurs in approximately ten percent of the population and is prerequisite for invasive meningococcal disease.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> While glycoconjugate meningococcal vaccines have dramatically reduced invasive meningococcal disease, largely due to induction of herd protection through population-level reduction of Nmen colonisation,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> protein-based serogroup B vaccines (4CMenB/MenB-FHbp) do not reduce serogroup B Nmen colonisation and are therefore unlikely to provide herd protection.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P6"><italic toggle="yes">Neisseria lactamica</italic> (Nlac) is non-capsulate and lacks pathogenic potential, mainly colonising the upper respiratory tract (URT) of children. Age-specific rates of Nmen colonisation and disease correlate inversely with Nlac colonisation prevalence,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and experimental colonisation with Nlac protects against Nmen colonisation for at least 26 weeks.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Mathematical modelling predicts that the protective effect of Nlac on Nmen persists for a number of years and colonisation with Nlac results in generation of anti-Nmen opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) in serum, but not anti-Nmen serum bactericidal activity (SBA).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, vaccination of mice with Nlac outer-membrane vesicles (OMV) protects against fatal meningococcal infection through a SBA-independent mechanism.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> These data support the hypothesis that generation of cross-reactive adaptive immune responses, independent of the formation of Nmen-specific SBA, may be implicated in natural protection afforded by Nlac colonisation on Nmen colonisation and disease.</p>
              <p id="P7">Testing this hypothesis, we performed a randomised, placebo-controlled human infection model experiment (CHIME) with the primary aim of determining whether Nlac colonisation induced Nlac-specific plasma cell (B<sub>PLAS</sub>) and memory B cell (B<sub>MEM</sub>) responses in blood. The secondary aim was to establish whether Nlac-specific responses induced by Nlac colonisation were cross-reactive with Nmen. Generation of adaptive immune responses is likely timedependent, so in a second Nlac CHIME we investigated whether seroconversion was dependent on Nlac colonisation duration.</p>

However, Nlac-specific B<sub>PLAS</sub> response frequencies were universally higher than those specific to Nmen (median increase in Nlac-specific and Nmen-specific B<sub>PLAS</sub> per 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> PBMC of 5 [IQR 1·5-10·3] vs. 0·5 [0.0-3·3] for IgA-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·0010, Wilcoxon test], and 2 [1·0-9·5] vs. 0 [0·0-4·5] for IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> [<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·0001]). Median increases in IgG B<sub>MEM</sub> responses, expressed as a percentage of the total IgG B<sub>MEM</sub> population, were also higher for responses specific to Nlac (0·0260 %, IQR 0·0125-0·0629, median 16.3-fold increase) vs. Nmen (0·0044 %, 0.0000-0·0165, median 4·0-fold increase) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·0020). There was no significant correlation between: (i) Nlac- and Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> frequencies atbaseline (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>) or, (ii) increases in the frequency of Nlac- and Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> following Nlac-colonisation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P33">Antigen-specific B<sub>PLAS</sub> frequencies are higher following boosting compared with priming after intra-muscular vaccination,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> so we tested the hypothesis that variation in Nmen-specific B<sub>PLAS</sub> frequencies are due to recall of pre-existing IgG B<sub>MEM</sub> responses. We reasoned that Nmen-specific IgG B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses would occur more frequently, and would be higher in magnitude, amongst participants with cross-reactive B<sub>MEM</sub> responses at baseline. We compared Nmen-specific IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses amongst Study A participants with and without both detectable Nlac- and Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> responses at baseline (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, I and K</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Nmen-specific IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses were detected more often (Fisher’s exact test <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·015) and were higher in magnitude (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) amongst participants where both Nlac- and Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> responses were detected at baseline.

Further evidence that Nlac colonisation induced recall of pre-existing B<sub>MEM</sub> responses was provided by assessment of the dynamics of Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> frequencies. Amongst Nlac-colonised participants with detectable Nmen-specific IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses, Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> frequencies decreased significantly from baseline to the day 7-14 nadir, suggesting differentiation of pre-existing Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> into B<sub>PLAS</sub>, before increasing from nadir to day 28, suggesting subsequent expansion of the B<sub>MEM</sub> pool (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The same dynamics were not observed amongst Nlac-colonised participants where Nmen-specific IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> were undetectable (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).

A smaller but significant rise in anti-Nmen-dOMV IgG (anti-Nmen IgG) titre was also observed (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In keeping with previously-outlined B<sub>PLAS</sub> dynamics, increases in anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres between day 0-28 significantly positively correlated (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4F</xref>). There was no change in either IgG titres amongst PBS-inoculated participants (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, E and F</xref>).

Furthermore, increases in anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres between day 0-28 were higher amongst Nlac-colonised participants where Nmen-specific IgG B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses were detected post-inoculation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C and D</xref>). At baseline, significant positive correlations were observed between: (i) anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>), and (ii) anti-Nmen (but not anti-Nlac) IgG titres and Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> frequencies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5C and D</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P35">We reasoned that the induction of an adaptive immune response during Nlac colonisation would be influenced by colonisation duration. In Study B, we measured anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG in serum at both 14 days post-inoculation, and 28 days following eradication with ciprofloxacin, amongst participants colonised with Nlac for 14 versus 4 days (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). Amongst participants colonised with Nlac for 14 days, there was a significant increase in both anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres, when comparing day 14 with baseline. At 28 days post-eradication, anti-Nlac IgG titres were no longer significantly higher than baseline (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·087) but anti-Nmen IgG titres were (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, C and E</xref>). Interestingly, amongst participants colonised with Nlac for only 4 days, anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres did not increase (Friedman ANOVA <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·14 and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0·14, respectively) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, D and F</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P36">Post-hoc analyses were performed comparing Nlac colonisation density with B cell and IgG responses amongst Nlac-colonised participants in Study A. We observed no significant correlations between Nlac-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> at baseline and Nlac colonisation density measured at 7-28 days (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8A-C</xref>). Although the percentage of Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> did not correlate with Nlac colonisation density at 7 days following Nlac inoculation, inverse correlations were observed at 14 and 28 days (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8D-F</xref>). Given the positive correlations between baseline frequencies of Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> and day-28 anti-Nlac and anti-Nmen IgG titres (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 5E and F</xref>), we compared IgG titres with Nlac colonisation densities on day 28. While there were no significant correlations between Nlac colonisation on day 7 and baseline anti-Nlac IgG titres (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9A</xref>), significant negative correlations were observed between day-28 Nlac colonisation densities and (i) anti-Nlac IgG titres (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9B</xref>), and (ii) the increase in anti-Nlac IgG titres between day 0-28 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9C</xref>). There were no significant associations between anti-Nmen IgG titres and Nlac colonisation density (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 9, D-F</xref>). Next, we looked for correlations between B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses and Nlac colonisation density, opting to assess correlations between B<sub>PLAS</sub> peaks and Nlac colonisation density at 14 days and 28 days post-inoculation given the timing of peak B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses. No significant correlations were observed at day 14 but at day 28 there was a significant negative correlation between Nlac colonisation density and peak Nlac- and Nmen-specific IgA-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> frequencies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 10A and C</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P37">This work demonstrated that asymptomatic pharyngeal colonisation with Nlac induces adaptive humoral and B cell responses cross-reactive with Nmen, including formation of cross-reactive immunological memory. This supports the hypothesis that the protective effect of Nlac on Nmen colonisation is due to cross-reactive adaptive immune responses.</p>
              <p id="P38">Expansion of Nmen-specific IgA- and IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> was not universal but was observed in 65 % and 47 % of Nlac-colonised participants, respectively, while Nmen-specific B<sub>MEM</sub> frequencies increased in 53 %. These data are consistent with a previous Nlac CHIME where ~65 % of Nlac-colonised participants developed anti-Nmen OPA.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In contrast, expansion of Nlac-specific B cell responses was almost universal (increases in IgA- and IgG-secreting B<sub>PLAS</sub> and IgG B<sub>MEM</sub> in 88 %, 94 % and 94 %, respectively) with responses significantly higher in magnitude compared to Nmen-specific responses. These differences are likely explained by amino acid divergence amongst orthologous surfaced-expressed proteins found across the two species.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> While definitive protein antigens responsible for the cross-reactive B cell responses remain undefined, previous analyses of Nlac Y92-1009-dOMV using mass spectrometry revealed 15 protein orthologues present amongst pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">Neisseriaceae</italic>, while probing of Nmen H44/76-dOMV with anti-sera raised in mice following Nlac Y92-1009-dOMV vaccination by Western blotting revealed at least 14 cross-reactive bands.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P39">Development of novel strategies to protect against Nmen colonisation are justified as current protein-based serogroup B Nmen vaccines do not impact on this critical outcome.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> We propose that colonisation with Nlac could be utilised as an immunobiotic intervention to prevent Nmen colonisation given that: (1) Nlac colonisation protects against Nmen colonisation,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and (2) Nlac colonisation density negatively correlated with B<sub>PLAS</sub> and IgG responses observed in Study A, suggesting a role for adaptive immune responses generated in response to URT Nlac colonisation in controlling colonisation. The immunological mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown but could be due to induction of agglutinating IgA/IgG at the mucosal surface,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or neutrophil associated clearance secondary to IL-17 secretion by antigen-specific CD4+ T cell of Th17 effector phenotype.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P40">We predict that future prophylactic use against Nmen will be incomplete if Nlac is utilised in its current wild-type form as cross-reactive immune responses to Nmen were not universal. Furthermore, immune dynamics were consistent with a recall immune response (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). However, induction of cross-reactive immunity may not be the only contributory mechanism. Colonisation with Nlac following inoculation is less likely in Nmen-colonised individuals,suggesting competition for niche occupation.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This may explain why Study A participant five failed to colonise with Nlac following inoculation. We do not anticipate that this phenomenon would significantly impact the use of Nlac as an immunobiotic intervention as this strategy would probably most effectively be used in childhood, prior to the natural upswing in Nmen colonisation acquisition during adolescence, to enable maximal protection to be afforded against Nmen transmission.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P41">Notwithstanding the possible multifactorial nature of the protective effect of Nlac on Nmen, it would be optimal if colonising Nlac induced broad anti-Nmen mucosal immunity resulting in Nmen colonisation protection and protection against Nmen disease though generation of anti-Nmen SBA. In this regard, in a recent first-in-man study we demonstrated that colonisation with genetically-modified Nlac (GM-Nlac) expressing the meningococcal vaccine antigen Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), induced NadA-specific adaptive responses and anti-Nmen SBA.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> With proof of principle and safety established, we now aim to enhance and broaden anti-Nmen adaptive immunity generated using GM-Nlac, through co-expression of other meningococcal vaccine antigens.</p>
              <p id="P42">The randomised, placebo-controlled design of Study A was its key strength. Limitations should be discussed. Firstly, for Study A, the sample size was informed using Nlac IgG titres. While this sample size was sufficient to investigate Nlac- and Nmen-specific B cell responses, it only enabled an exploratory analysis of associations between B<sub>MEM</sub>/B<sub>PLAS</sub> responses and Nlac colonisation density. Secondly, the assessment of Nlac colonisation density in nasal wash was exploratory; colonisation density sampled using oropharyngeal swabs was not measured, precluding comparison of Nlac colonisation density between nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab. Thirdly, we did not assess responses restricted to the mucosal compartment, focusing instead on responses in blood. The key limitation of Study B was that due to the COVID-19 pandemic recruitment was terminated early. However, this should not detract from the main result, that seroconversion only occurred amongst participants assigned to Nlac colonisation for 14 days.</p>

                <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                <p>Future vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and <italic toggle="yes">Haemophilus influenzae</italic> disease, suitable for mass deployment in resource poor countries, could be low-cost strategies which induce herd protection against acquisition of these pathogens in the upper respiratory tract. One potential strategy could be to exploit naturally-occurring protective relationships between pathogenic and commensal organisms. In nature, an inverse epidemiological relationship exists between colonisation with the harmless commensal, <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria lactamica</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis-associated</italic> colonisation and disease, with circumstantial evidence suggesting that this phenomenon may be due to induction of cross-reacting immunity. If the nature of this cross-reactive immunity was understood, it could be exploited to develop vaccines that induced herd protection against <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis.</italic> Specifically, this knowledge could inform the development of novel serogroup B meningococcal vaccines where current formulations provide no protection against colonisation. We searched PubMed for studies published before 16/02/2022, with no language restrictions, using the search terms <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria lactamica</italic> AND <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis</italic> AND (colonisation OR carriage) AND (humoral OR antibody OR B cell OR T cell OR protection). This identified 36 studies, of which two were controlled human infection studies designed to assess the effect of <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation on (i) <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> colonisation, and (ii) the induction of anti-<italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> adaptive immunity. In the first study (n = 310), controlled infection with <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> led to a significant reduction in <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitis</italic> colonisation, with an effect observed by two weeks and persisting over at least 16 weeks. In the second study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=61), <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation was associated with the induction of anti-<italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> opsonophagocytic activity but not serum bactericidal activity.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p>In this study, using deliberate infection of human volunteers, we demonstrate for the first time that colonisation with <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> induces anti-<italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> IgG and B cell responses, including the formation of immunological memory, with seroconversion dependent upon the duration of colonisation. In addition, we outline B cell dynamics that support the notion that <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic>-specific plasma cell responses induced by <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation are due to recall of pre-existing cross-reactive immunological memory. Furthermore, we reveal significant negative correlations between anti-Nlac IgG titers and IgA-secreting plasma cell frequencies induced by <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation and <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation density, suggesting a role for these responses in bioburden control.</p>

                <title>Implication of all the available evidence</title>
                <p>Our findings support the hypothesis that the protective effect of <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation on <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> colonisation and disease is due to induction of cross-reactive adaptive immune responses. The observation that <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis-specific</italic> plasma cell and memory B cell responses were not always generated amongst <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic>-colonised participants is in keeping with previous work demonstrating that protection afforded by <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> colonisation on <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> colonisation was not universal. Future studies will assess whether induction of anti-<italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> adaptive immune responses by <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> prevents subsequent <italic toggle="yes">N. meningitidis</italic> colonisation, and whether this activity can be enhanced through genetic modification of <italic toggle="yes">N. lactamica</italic> to express meningococcal vaccine antigens. Ultimately this will lead to low-cost live bacterial vectored vaccines suitable for use in regions with high rates of meningococcal disease.</p>
