                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is an urgent need to determine the safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of novel antiviral treatments for COVID-19 in vaccinated patients in the community at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>PANORAMIC is a UK-wide, open-label, prospective, adaptive, multiarm platform, randomised clinical trial that evaluates antiviral treatments for COVID-19 in the community. A master protocol governs the addition of new antiviral treatments as they become available, and the introduction and cessation of existing interventions via interim analyses. The first two interventions to be evaluated are molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Eligibility criteria: community-dwelling within 5 days of onset of symptomatic COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR or lateral flow test), and either (1) aged 50 years and over, or (2) aged 18–49 years with qualifying comorbidities. Registration occurs via the trial website and by telephone. Recruitment occurs remotely through the central trial team, or in person through clinical sites. Participants are randomised to receive either usual care or a trial drug plus usual care. Outcomes are collected via a participant-completed daily electronic symptom diary for 28 days post randomisation. Participants and/or their Trial Partner are contacted by the research team after days 7, 14 and 28 if the diary is not completed, or if the participant is unable to access the diary. The primary efficacy endpoint is all-cause, non-elective hospitalisation and/or death within 28 days of randomisation. Multiple prespecified interim analyses allow interventions to be stopped for futility or superiority based on prespecified decision criteria. A prospective economic evaluation is embedded within the trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The development and roll-out of national coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination schemes has been transformative in reducing disease severity and to a lesser extent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Despite this, the emergence of new variants and waning immunity have led to intermittent surges in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The implementation of effective COVID-19 treatments therefore remains a critical management strategy and may be of great importance if future vaccine-escaping variants emerge. A number of drugs have been trialled as repurposed COVID-19 community treatments with evidence that some should not be used for this indication<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> while others are likely to be beneficial.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Directly-acting antiviral drugs are an important therapeutic approach, but evidence is limited.</p>
              <p>Two new antiviral options are molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), with others being developed. Molnupiravir is a prodrug; the ribonucleoside analogue β-d-N4 -hydroxycytidine (NHC) is metabolised to NHC-triphosphate in cells, which when integrated introduces catastrophic hypermutation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Paxlovid is a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir; nirmatrelvir inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 3 CL protease that is necessary for viral replication,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and ritonavir significantly slows the clearance of nirmatrelvir.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Initial trials of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for COVID-19 have demonstrated safety and efficacy.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> However, these trials were in unvaccinated patients prior to the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant becoming prevalent, and it is not clear if there are particular subgroups of patients who should be prioritised for treatment. Furthermore, the impact on viral load, antiviral resistance and emergence of new variants requires further evaluation, and cost-effectiveness of these agents at scale is as yet unknown. The impact on long COVID is also yet to be assessed. Nevertheless, these encouraging efficacy trials, and the likelihood that further plausible treatments will become available and require evaluation, justifies a large-scale, ongoing, pragmatic evaluation of antiviral treatments for use in the community in a largely vaccinated population, while current variants are circulating, to rapidly generate robust evidence for guiding decisions about widespread deployment.</p>
              <p>We therefore established an adaptive multiarm platform trial with a master protocol to test whether novel antiviral agents are safe, effective and cost-effective treatments for people in the community with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of an adverse outcome.</p>

                <title>Objective</title>
                <p>To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of novel antiviral treatments in reducing all-cause, non-elective hospitalisation and/or death within 28 days of randomisation among patients with test-positive COVID-19 in the community and who are at increased risk of requiring hospital treatment.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of COVID-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC) is an open-label, prospective, adaptive platform, randomised clinical trial in community care.</p>
                <p>A multiarm ‘platform trial’ is a clinical trial that allows for multiple treatments for the same disease to be tested simultaneously under a single master protocol. Prespecified adaptations allow interventions to be added to the trial, or stopped for futility or superiority while the trial is in progress through prespecified interim analyses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Participants are randomly assigned to either usual care, or usual care plus a trial intervention. Usual care represents the standard care that participants would receive via the National Health Service (NHS), and is largely supportive, apart from for those at the highest risk of an adverse outcome.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>The master protocol defines a priori decision rules to allow for dropping a treatment for futility or declaring a treatment superior to usual care.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> If at an interim analysis, usual care plus an antiviral is deemed superior to usual care alone for the primary endpoint of all-cause, non-elective hospitalisation and/or death within 28 days of randomisation, the superior treatment may be incorporated into usual care as the new standard of care. Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. A subset of participants is additionally enrolled into a virology substudy, and are asked to provide nasopharyngeal swabs and fingerpick blood samples at intervals over the 14 days following recruitment.</p>
                <p>The first and second antivirals to be evaluated in PANORAMIC are molnupiravir<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, respectively.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) contributors contribute to refining the study question, design, implementation, interpretation and dissemination of findings. At trial conception, the aims and design of the study were discussed with members of the public who had experience of COVID-19, either personally or through household members, and who were at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. PPI groups supporting the trial include an ethnically diverse main study PPI group who have advised on patient facing documents and study processes, and have helped to draft easy read versions of study documents. In addition, bespoke PPI groups established in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have advised on data capture and recruitment processes specific to their local health systems, and will contribute to advise on dissemination. Two PPI contributors sit on the Trial Steering Committee to help guide trial progress. A co-investigator has a specific remit for community engagement, developing and implanting initiatives with the support of pharmacy networks to ensure uptake especially in areas of higher social deprivation and among minority ethnic groups: feedback about all aspects of the trial is received from this community engagement programme.</p>

                <p>The PCV-CTU is able to act as a central recruiting site, and PANORAMIC Hubs act as clinical recruitment sites. PANORAMIC Hubs are clinical sites that include General Practice (GP) sites as single practices or a federation of practices that are able to operate under a single site agreement with a principal investigator to undertake study procedures as detailed in the master protocol. Hubs can include GP practices, community trusts and other healthcare providers. Potential participants can be referred to Hubs by other healthcare facilities for screening. As well as recruiting patients through routine consultations, Hubs perform database searches for COVID-19 positive test results in registered patients who are clinically vulnerable (see <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>), and invite them to take part in the trial. All mandated study procedures can be conducted remotely, in keeping with the prevailing self-isolation advisory governmental guidance for patients with COVID-19 in the community.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>

                  <p>Participants are randomised using a secure, fully validated and compliant web-based randomisation system embedded within Spinnaker (a data entry system), with binary stratification by age (&lt;50 years vs ≥50 years) and vaccination status (yes vs no). Participants are randomised to one trial arm using fixed equal allocation ratios corresponding to the number of eligible arms in the trial. For example, if there are two active interventions (A and B), the allocation ratio will be 1:1:1 for usual care, active A, active B (respectively), such that 33% of participants are randomised to usual care. If there are three active interventions, the allocation ratio will be 1:1:1:1, such that 25% of participants are randomised to usual care. As this is a nationwide, individually randomised trial that aims to include large numbers of participants, individual participant characteristics and infecting strain types of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be equally distributed between trial arms.</p>
                  <p>PANORAMIC is an open-label trial. The participant, legal representative (if applicable) and recruiting clinician know the participant’s allocation. The trial team and recruiting clinicians are kept blind to emerging results of interim analyses.

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>PANORAMIC trial is testing novel antiviral agents that have the potential to be widely used to treat COVID-19 in the community. Each agent is fully specified in an ISA. The antiviral drugs are couriered to participants, typically within 24 hours of randomisation. Pharmacies can supply antivirals to participants via community pharmacy services or online pharmacy services. The antivirals can also be collected from a pharmacy by the participant (or someone on their behalf, with appropriate infection control measures).</p>
                  <p>PANORAMIC is a randomised controlled, open-label, pragmatic trial.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> The control arm is usual care. Usual care can include antiviral treatment available to individual patients in routine care in the NHS.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the UK, patients at highest risk are able to access antiviral treatments directly from the NHS via COVID Medicine Delivery Units and analogous organisations; otherwise, in the absence of complicated infection (eg, bacterial super-infection), Usual care in the NHS is generally supportive.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Participants assigned to an intervention arm additionally receive the usual care through the NHS that they would ordinarily have received, had they not participated in the trial. The trial team are not involved in making clinical or clinical management decisions for participants. Participants receiving a monoclonal antibody infusion or an antiviral agent as part of their usual care were eligible to receive a (different) antiviral through the trial. However, those at highest risk of an adverse outcome were informed that they were eligible for access to antiviral treatment through NHS services.</p>

                  <title>Follow-up</title>
                  <p>Following randomisation, participants in the intervention arm receive a participant pack containing: the allocated antiviral agent; an information booklet; a participant card detailing how the medication should be administered, precautions and safety guidance; a medication appendix providing further information about the allocated intervention; an emergency card with a phone number with a 24-hour phone line to access an on-call clinician for safety concerns; and, a pregnancy test to be used by participants of childbearing potential for certain interventions.</p>
                  <p>All participants are emailed a link each day to an online symptom diary and are asked to complete it daily for 28 days. Participants are asked: to rate a variety of symptoms (such as fever, cough, breathlessness and fatigue) on an ordinal scale (eg, ‘no problem,’ ‘mild problem,’ ‘moderate problem’ or ‘major problem’); whether they have been hospitalised or required contact with health and social services; how they are feeling on a scale of 0–10 (0 being the worst one can imagine and 10 being the best one can imagine); whether they feel fully recovered; whether they are taking over-the-counter medication; whether the number of people in the household has changed; confirm whether they have taken the antiviral agent (if applicable); and, at fortnightly intervals the EQ-5D-5L to assess their health-related quality of life. The central trial team calls participants/Trial Partners with no internet access and those who have not completed their diary for at least two consecutive days before days 7, 14 and 28.</p>
                  <p>All participants will receive a phone call from the trial team on Day 2 of the trial to confirm receipt of trial materials, confirm consent and understanding of follow-up procedures and to answer any queries. Participants receiving an antiviral agent receive additional safety calls from members of the trial team, to determine whether participants are experiencing adverse effects, and, if applicable, to ensure that participants who are physiologically capable of becoming pregnant and who are not using highly effective contraception confirm a negative pregnancy test result prior to starting the intervention. The exact schedule of safety calls is intervention-dependent, and outlined in each ISA.</p>
                  <p>To investigate the impact of trial interventions on the longer-term effects of COVID-19, we contact participants at 3 and 6 months after randomisation to ascertain well-being, persistence of symptoms perceived to be related to the index COVID-19 illness, and longer-term consequences. Participants’ medical record data may additionally be accessed up to 12 months following enrolment to gather follow-up data from enrolment to 6 months. Sources of routinely collected data (eg, NHS Digital) may also be used to follow-up participants for up to 10 years.</p>

                    <p>Details of the statistical design and methods are described in a Master Statistical Analysis Plan and Adaptive Design Report (ADR). The primary endpoint analysis is a Bayesian logistic regression model of the primary endpoint comparing a given intervention versus usual care, adjusting for age, comorbidity status and vaccination status.</p>
                    <p>The trial design incorporates multiple prespecified interim analyses that allow each intervention to stop early for futility or superiority. If the Bayesian posterior probability of beneficial treatment effect (alternative hypothesis) is greater than or equal to a prespecified threshold at an interim or final analysis, the null hypothesis (no beneficial intervention effect) is rejected, and the intervention is deemed superior to usual care with respect to hospitalisation/death. The decision criteria are defined in the ADR and control the Type I error at the traditional 0.05 two-sided level for each intervention, accounting for multiple interim analyses. As described in the ADR, the prespecified interim analyses may be bypassed for a given intervention at the discretion of the blinded Trial Management Group (TMG) in the event of a fast accrual rate. The success thresholds at final and interim analysis are prespecified and dependent on the number of interim analyses, which is a function of the speed of enrolment. The ADR also contains extensive simulations to explore the performance of the adaptive design, including power and Type I error. Subgroup analyses are performed according to age group, baseline comorbidity status, severity of symptoms at baseline, duration of symptoms at baseline, use of an inhaled corticosteroid steroid at randomisation or during 28 days of follow-up, swab positivity status (PCR positive vs Lateral Flow Device positive), vaccination status and COVID-19 risk category (as per the UK government description). Details of subgroup analyses can be found in the statistical analysis plan. All statistical analyses of primary and some secondary outcome data analyses are performed by Berry Consultants and the University of Oxford. Berry Consultants is based in the USA; as such they will not receive identifiable trial data.</p>

                  <p>The master protocol specifies a maximum sample of approximately 5300 participants per arm, which provides approximately 90% power for detecting a 33% relative reduction in the risk of hospitalisation/death in an experimental arm relative to usual care, based on the assumption of an underlying 3% hospitalisation/death rate in the usual care arm, and an intervention lowering the hospitalisation/death rate to 2%. However, an intervention-specific appendix may define an alternative maximum sample size for an intervention based on alternative assumptions for a given intervention or based on the relevant state of the pandemic. For example, if the severity of COVID-19 weakens and the aggregate (blinded) primary endpoint event rate is lower than expected, the maximum sample size may be increased to ensure sufficient statistical power.</p>

                  <p>A risk assessed and proportionate approach to safety monitoring is adopted for each antiviral included in the trial.

All safety procedures will be according to University of Oxford Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit pharmacovigilance Standard Operating Procedures.</p>
                  <p>For each antiviral agent, we only collect adverse events (AEs), other than those prespecified symptoms collected via the participant diaries, if and when specified in the relevant ISA. For certain interventions, pregnancy occurring within 28 days of first intervention administration is recorded as an AE of Special Interest. All-cause hospitalisation and/or death is the primary outcome, and these data are captured in CRFs. SAEs other than hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19 are reported for all antiviral agents over the follow-up period. Hospitalisations for pre-existing conditions, including elective procedures planned prior to trial entry, which has not worsened, do not contribute to our primary outcome, and do not constitute SAEs.</p>

                <p>A subset of patients from the intervention and comparator arms of the trial are invited to participate in a virology sampled cohort for additional virological testing. The primary aim of the virology sampled cohort is to determine whether the antiviral treatment under study reduces viral load to undetectable levels sooner, and to explore the effect of antiviral treatment on development of antiviral resistance. The substudy primary outcome is SARS-CoV-2 viral load at Day 7. Secondary outcomes include SARS-CoV-2 viral load Days 0–7 and Day 14; SARS-CoV-2 viral genetic whole genome sequence at Day 1, Day 5 (±1 day) and Day 14 (±1 day) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at Day 1, Day 5 (±1 day) and Day 14 (±1 day); and to identify any common viral genetic mutations (occurring in greater than 1% of patients) in patients receiving novel antiviral(s).</p>
                <p>The eligibility criteria are as for participants taking part in the main trial, but with an additional exclusion criterion: participants who are within 3 months of receiving a non-trial anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy are ineligible.</p>
                <p>Up to approximately 300 participants from each trial intervention arm and the usual care arm are recruited into the voluntary virology sampled cohort. The first 30 patients enrolling from each trial arm undergo intensive daily viral load monitoring, and are asked to provide daily nasopharyngeal self-taken swabs for 7 days, and an additional nasopharyngeal swab on Day 14 (±1 day). For participants in intervention arms, the first sample will be taken immediately prior to commencing antiviral treatment (Day 1). The remaining 270 from each arm in the virology samples cohort have less intensive viral load monitoring, and are asked to provide three nasopharyngeal swabs: one prior to starting treatment, one on Day 5 (±1 day) and one on Day 14 (±1 day).</p>
                <p>All participants are asked to take three fingerprick dried blood spot samples: one pretreatment, one on Day 5 (±1 day) and one on Day 14 (±1 day).

                <p>A prospective economic evaluation is embedded within the trial design to assess the cost-effectiveness of each antiviral from an NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. The resource inputs associated with embedding each trial antiviral treatment into routine clinical practice are estimated. Broader resource use is drawn from linked routine health data—encompassing primary care encounters, hospital inpatient/day case admissions, outpatient visits and accident and emergency attendances. Unit costs are valued using national reference tariffs and attached to resource inputs to generate a compound total NHS and PSS cost per trial participant over the trial time horizon. EQ-5D-5L data are converted using standard algorithms into utility scores for quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimation. Cost-effectiveness is expressed as incremental cost per QALY gained.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Secondary expressions of cost-effectiveness include incremental cost per hospitalisation and/or death prevented over 28 days. Bivariate regression of costs and measures of health consequence, with multiple imputation of missing data, will be conducted to generate within-trial estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses will assess the impact of areas of uncertainty surrounding components of the economic evaluation. If economic outcomes are non-convergent within the trial follow-up period, then extrapolation of cost-effectiveness through decision-analytical modelling will be considered, drawing on the best available information from the literature to supplement the trial data. Specific plans for the economic evaluation are outlined in a prespecified health economics analysis plan.</p>

                <p>A phase 3 placebo-controlled, randomised trial of molnupiravir recruited 1433 COVID-19 outpatients in over 20 countries, with a primary efficacy endpoint of all-cause hospitalisation or death within 29 days of enrolment (Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of Covid-19 in Nonhospitalized Patients - 'MOVe-OUT' trial).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The authors found that treatment with molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death compared with placebo (risk difference, −3.0%; 95% CI: −5.9% to −0.1%).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in molnupiravir and placebo groups (30.4% and 33.0 %, respectively), as did adverse events deemed to be related to the trial regimen (8.0% and 8.4%, respectively). No deaths were attributed to the trial treatment (one death in the molnupiravir group and nine deaths in the placebo group).</p>
                <p>As in the PANORAMIC trial, participants were at higher risk of an adverse illness course, received a 5-day course of molnupiravir at a dose of 800 mg two times per day, and received the intervention within 5 days of symptom onset. However, the trial recruited unvaccinated patients; the vast majority of the UK adult population are multiply-vaccinated (primary course plus boosters).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, Delta, Gamma and Mu variants accounted for the majority of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the MOVe-OUT trial,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> whereas the predominant variant in circulation in the UK has been Omicron since December 2021.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> PANORAMIC additionally incorporates an assessment of the impact of antiviral drugs on viral load and markers of viral resistance.</p>
                <p>In a phase 2–3 randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 2246 outpatients with COVID-19 from the USA (41%), Europe (30%), South America (12.3%), Asia (14%) and Africa (0.6%), at higher risk of an adverse illness course, treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir resulted in a 5.8% absolute risk reduction in the primary outcome of COVID-19 related hospitalisation and all-cause death within 28 days (0.72% and 6.53%, respectively, risk difference −5.81%, 95% CI: −7.78% to −3.84%, p&lt;0.0001).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Viral load was significantly reduced by treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (adjusted mean difference of −0.868 log10 copies per millilitre, 95% CI: −1.074 to −0.6615, p&lt;0.001). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups, and all 13 deaths occurred in the placebo group. The trial population was again unvaccinated, and therefore distinct from the UK population taking part in the PANORAMIC trial.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The platform design, informed by the experience of the Platform Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE) trial,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> allows PANORAMIC to add new interventions to the trial as they become available; this increases the efficiency of the trial as multiple interventions can be assessed by a single trial platform without having to set up a new trial each time a new intervention for this condition requires evaluation. Prespecified interim analyses allow randomisations to interventions to be stopped as soon as prespecified criteria for superiority or futility are met, potentially reducing time to trial conclusions. This ensures the trial’s relevance in the face of rapidly evolving pandemic circumstances.</p>
                <p>Deploying antimicrobials of any kind at scale raises the question of their possible impact on antimicrobial resistance. A virology substudy has been incorporated in PANORAMIC, which allows us to estimate virological endpoints, as well as facilitating careful evaluation of potential harms associated with antiviral treatment, such as the development of antiviral resistance and emergence of new variants.</p>
                <p>Cost-effectiveness of novel antivirals is as yet unknown, but is critically important to considerations of widespread deployment of expensive: PANORAMIC aims to fill this gap in the evidence base for these agents.</p>
                <p>Traditionally, primary care research implementation has followed a similar model to hospital-based studies, in which the ‘participant comes to the research’. In this approach, potential participants are invited to participate if they receive their healthcare or live in the proximity to the research site. The capacity of PANORAMIC for recruitment of eligible people from almost anywhere in the UK, not limited by where people live or receive their healthcare, allows the ‘research to be taken to the patient’. This is particularly important, given that participants are ill and probably highly infectious.</p>
                <p>The trial has been designed to be minimally burdensome for participants; all trial procedures are possible remotely, from registration, to eligibility checks, to receiving trial medications and virology substudy materials by courier. This has facilitated rapid recruitment to the trial, with over 26 000 participants recruited to date. PANORAMIC strives to be a truly representative trial, with participants from various backgrounds recruited nationally from all four UK nations. A proactive outreach strategy has been employed, led by the trial’s national pharmacy, and inclusion and diversity lead, with the support of UK-wide pharmacy networks, to help to promote the trial to diverse communities and to those disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This includes people from ethnic minority backgrounds and those living in areas of higher deprivation, traditionally known to be under-represented in clinical trials. The proportion of PANORAMIC participants in the molnupiravir versus usual care comparison older than 50 years who are from ethnic minorities is approximately 5%, which is not dissimilar to that in the English and Welsh general population (just over 6%).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, we recognise that recruitment to the trial requires prospective participants to navigate the registration process, which might mean that people from certain groups, such as non-English speaking populations, may be less likely to enrol in the trial.</p>
                <p>In addition to the primary outcome that is measured at 28 days, PANORAMIC evaluates longer-term outcomes at 3 and 6 months, which will help ascertain the effect of antiviral treatment on long COVID. Long COVID, defined as symptoms beyond 4 weeks after index illness<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> may affect between 10%<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and 43.4%<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> of patients with COVID-19, and is characterised by a range of physical and psychological symptoms.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Thus far, we do not know whether novel antiviral treatments reduce symptoms associated with the acute illness over the longer-term.</p>
                <p>Some may consider the open-label design of the trial a weakness. The lack of blinding means that we cannot estimate the proportion of any positive effect from the treatment that results from a possible placebo effect. Performance bias is more likely to affect outcomes that are considered subjective, such as symptom or wellness ratings. However, the objective primary outcome in PANORAMIC (non-elective hospitalisation and/or death) is unlikely to be affected by a placebo effect, as hospital admission is a clinical decision, and the virology substudy will also provide a helpful pointer as to whether the treatments are effective.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, comparison with usual care is in keeping with pragmatic trial design and more closely reflective of real-world practice.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> As placebos are not used in clinical care, the results of an open-label trial are more likely to reflect what would happen if the intervention were introduced into routine clinical practice,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> additionally enabling a more realistic assessment of cost-effectiveness. Findings from the pragmatic, open-label PRINCIPLE trial have found no difference in outcome measures that rely on participants’ self-reported recovery between participants allocated to usual care and usual care plus a study drug.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 30 36</xref></p>
