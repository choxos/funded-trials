                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents, with an average worldwide prevalence of 5%. Up to 40% of young people continue to experience symptoms into adulthood. Young people with ADHD experience poorer outcomes than their peers across multiple domains, with treatment shown to reduce these risks. Primary care practitioners play an important role in healthcare provision for this group in the UK. However, many feel unsure about how best to provide support, reporting prescribing concerns and need for more evidence-based guidance. A lack of national data on primary care provision hinders efforts to improve access to care and optimise outcomes. This mixed-methods study aims to provide evidence that may be used to improve primary care services for young people aged 16–25 years with ADHD.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>There are three interlinked work packages: (a) a mapping study including a survey of stakeholders (healthcare professionals, people with ADHD and commissioners) will map ADHD prescribing practice, shared-care arrangements, available support and practitioner roles by geographic locations across England for different respondent groups; (b) a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (10–15 healthcare professionals and 10–15 people with ADHD) will explore experiences of ‘what works’ and ‘what is needed’ in terms of service provision and synthesise findings; (c) workshops will integrate findings from (a) and (b) and work with stakeholders to use this evidence to codevelop key messages and guidance to improve care.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The protocol has been approved by Yorkshire and the Humber—Bradford Leeds Research Ethics Committee. Recruitment commenced in September 2022. Findings will be disseminated via research articles in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, public involvement events, patient groups and media releases. A summary of study findings will be shared with participants at the end of the study.</p>

                <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in children and adolescents, with an average worldwide prevalence of 5%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Up to 40% of young people with ADHD will continue to experience symptoms into adulthood,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which can affect physical and mental health, further education, work, relationships, involvement with criminal justice and mortality, with ensuing economic impacts on the individual and society.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> A recent UK surveillance study estimated that the annual number of people aged 17–19 years with an ongoing need for ADHD medication lies between 270 and 599 per 100 000, with an even higher number requiring non-pharmacological support for their ADHD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Higher ADHD prevalence is associated with financial difficulties and economic disadvantage, resulting in higher service needs in some areas.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The social and financial challenges of COVID-19 are likely to have intensified support needs, while also introducing new barriers to accessing health services. Treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of experiencing poorer outcomes in young people with ADHD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> Withdrawal of treatment in young people can have particularly profound effects, as this is a vulnerable life stage, when multiple simultaneous transitions are occurring.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>

                <title>ADHD service provision</title>
                <p>For young people with ADHD who require ongoing support into adulthood, UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends a smooth transition into adult services, with the prescribing and monitoring of ADHD medication carried out under shared care protocol arrangements between primary and secondary care services.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the Children and Adolescents with ADHD in Transition between Children’s and Adult Services study estimated that less than a quarter of young people who needed ADHD medication made the transition to adult mental health services.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This is likely to be due to a combination of factors, including the availability and accessibility of adult ADHD services, which vary widely, and a lack of information on, and preparation for, transition.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 8–12</xref> Even where medication is continued, management of ADHD may be suboptimal without access to specialist assessment of ADHD, advice on titration, or non-pharmacological support.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
                <p>The variation in services and support for young people (aged 16–25 years) with ADHD creates inequities in access and increases pressure on primary care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> As a result, general practitioners (GPs) may end up providing care for young people with ADHD ‘by default’ due to long waiting times, a lack of adult services, or because a person does not meet service eligibility criteria,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>; with some GPs reporting concerns about safety, risk and responsibility and workload.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Variations in prescribing protocols and classification of ADHD drugs in local formularies,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> means some young people may also have difficulties registering with a GP willing to prescribe. Young people with ADHD have expressed a lack of confidence in primary care to help them manage their condition, and report frustration with the information provided by GPs and the support available.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 14 15</xref></p>

                <p>Debates over how to tackle a ‘failure of healthcare’ for ADHD, especially at transition, often include an expanded role for primary care through recently established primary care networks (PCNs) of GP practices.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 16</xref> NICE recommend further studies about the role of primary care in supporting young people discharged from children’s services.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Challenges around shared care and guidance implementation have been recognised by working groups established by the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN), and National Health Service (NHS) England.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There is currently no overview or map of the different models of care and roles that exist in primary care to support people with ADHD, though our own and others’ qualitative research has highlighted variations in prescribing practice and shared care models.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> NHS England’s mandate to strengthen primary care and reduce inequalities, needs to be met through consulting with patients and the public, and using the patient pathway approach.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, the current lack of national level data mapping pathways in primary care for young people with ADHD, is hindering efforts to optimise outcomes for this underserved group.</p>

The NHS Long Term Plan,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> also emphasises the importance of working collaboratively to find solutions to address unmet health and social care needs.

              <sec id="s1-5">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>This research has been developed in response to identified gaps in the literature and existing services (as outlined above), and priorities highlighted by people with ADHD. The research team includes young people with ADHD whose input will help ensure the research is sensitive and relevant, an academic GP to ensure identified solutions are deliverable within primary care settings. Also, our research advisory groups (RAGs), made up of healthcare practitioners and young people with ADHD and their supporters.</p>
                <p>Under the NHS Long Term plan,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and NHS Mental Health Implementation plan,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the recent formation of PCNs in combination with the establishment of NHS integrated care systems (ICSs) (partnerships of organisations that come together to plan and deliver joined up health and care services), represents an opportunity to establish new and effective working practices to enable consistent and accessible healthcare for all young people with ADHD. The NHS Community Mental Health Framework,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> also sets out a vision for how community services should modernise to offer joined-up-care for those with mental health needs, within ICSs. Recent guidance, stemming from professionals across primary, secondary, and tertiary care in the UK, has recommended the development of an ADHD specialism within primary care, as part of a roadmap for improving access to treatment.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The evidence base outlined above, and current guidelines,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> highlight the key role primary care services have to play in the provision of healthcare for young people with ADHD, and the potential for supporting an expansion of this role. Not only are primary care practitioners, such as GPs, often the gatekeepers through the referral system to secondary care services, such as adult mental health and specialist ADHD services, but NICE guidelines recommend that they also provide healthcare support such as routine monitoring, and prescribing of medication under shared care agreements with secondary care services.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
                <p>Furthermore, primary care services have an increasing role to play in terms of providing mental health and well-being support to young people with ADHD, with additional roles such as mental health workers and social prescribing link workers funded through PCNs.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, the challenges for primary care in delivering co-ordinated and accessible healthcare for young people with ADHD, need to be better understood.</p>
                <p>Currently, little is known about whether or how services are provided for young people aged 16–25 with ADHD in primary care in England, or about areas of good practice, and optimal models and pathways for improving access to healthcare for this underserved group. While the NHS Long Term Plan,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> aims to dissolve the historic divide between primary and secondary/specialist care, delivering healthcare across systems remains challenging. For example, existing evidence indicates that GPs can feel unsupported and uncertain about providing medication under shared care agreements.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 27</xref></p>
                <p>In line with current need, the aim of this research is therefore to map current services and provide an evidence-base to inform coproduced guidance to improve primary care for young people aged 16–25 years with ADHD. The objectives are to:</p>

Participants in each will include people aged 16 or over with lived experience of ADHD (and their supporters), health professionals with a focus on primary care (such as GPs, nurses, mental health practitioners, and clinical pharmacists), and primary care commissioners/providers. Sampling, recruitment strategies, and eligibility criteria, vary slightly between work packages.

                  <p>A mapping study will involve an online survey of primary care provision for young people and adults with ADHD in England. Informants will be sampled from three key stakeholder groups—service users, healthcare professionals and commissioners/providers—via a mixture of convenience and purposive techniques. Due to the sampling methods, self-selection bias is likely, which is acknowledged within the study design and will be clearly discussed as a limitation in the write up of findings. Despite this limitation this sample is still expected to provide valuable data. The target sample size will be a minimum of 252 participants in total (providing a minimum of six responses for each ICS in England). The survey will be open for up to 16 weeks. Responses will be reviewed part-way through this period, with subsequent survey promotion and reminders targeted to achieve a balanced mix of responses by geographic location and stakeholder group. The survey will use the seven-step pragmatic health service mapping method, developed through extensive patient and public involvement<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and previously used to map adult mental health service availability for adults with ADHD in England in 2018.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

This reflexive theoretical stance will highlight the context of the data, and the influence of researcher and stakeholder perspectives, providing a nuanced interpretation of meaning suitable to inform the coproduction of guidance (in WP3).</p>
                  <p>An understanding of the need for information resources and prescribing and healthcare support will be developed within a range of different geographical and socio-economic contexts, and different models of care.</p>
