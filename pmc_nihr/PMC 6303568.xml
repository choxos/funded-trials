                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a potentially devastating condition caused by compression of the cauda equina nerve roots. This can result in bowel, bladder and sexual dysfunction plus lower limb weakness, numbness and pain. CES occurs infrequently, but has serious potential morbidity and medicolegal consequences. This study aims to identify and describe the presentation and management of patients with CES in the UK.</p>

                  <p>Understanding Cauda Equina Syndrome (UCES) is a prospective and collaborative multicentre cohort study of adult patients with confirmed CES managed at specialist spinal centres in the UK. Participants will be identified using neurosurgical and orthopaedic trainee networks to screen referrals to spinal centres. Details of presentation, investigations, management and service usage will be recorded. Both patient-reported and clinician-reported outcome measures will be assessed for 1âyear after surgery. This will establish the incidence of CES, current investigation and management practices, and adherence to national standards of care. Outcomes will be stratified by clinical presentation and patient management. Accurate and up to date information about the presentation, management and outcome of patients with CES will inform standards of service design and delivery for this important but infrequent condition.</p>

                  <p>UCES received a favourable ethical opinion from the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 02 (Reference: 18/SS/0047; IRAS ID: 233515). All spinal centres managing patients with CES in the UK will be encouraged to participate in UCES. Study results will be published in medical journals and shared with local participating sites.</p>

              <p>Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but potentially devastating condition caused by compression of the cauda equina nerve roots. This most commonly occurs due to a prolapsed intervertebral disc. The clinical syndrome includes any of bilateral sciatica, saddle anaesthesia, bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â3</xref> The disabling nature of these symptoms causes significant medical and social morbidity and high healthcare and social-care costs. In addition, litigation related to the management of CES leads to significant medicolegal workload and costs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4 5</xref></p>
              <p>Due to the consequences of CES for patients and society, several groups have issued clinical guidance on standards of care for CES.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6â8</xref> However, the evidence base for current clinical guidance consists of small retrospective single-centre case series.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 9 10</xref> Even systematic reviews of outcomes in CES have included relatively few patients, with the largest including 464 patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11</xref> Lack of a clear definition of CES has hampered comparative analysis of historical studies, and different interpretations of available evidence have been offered.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12</xref> A diagnosis of CES encompasses patients presentingÂ with mild to severe urinary and bowel symptoms, perineal or perianal numbness, sexual function disturbance or bilateral sciatica, and patients may also experience lower limb weakness, numbness or unilateral sciatica.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3 13</xref> Outcomes for different presentations vary and accurate division by presentation may help to clarify the understanding of outcome studies and develop care standards appropriate to the presentation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 14</xref></p>
              <p>Retrospective case series in the UK have identified approximately 15â31 patients per year per specialist neurosurgical or spinal centre with confirmed CES.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 13 15 16</xref> Published estimates of the incidence of CES are fewer than one case per 100â000 population.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> However, in 2010â2011 in England, 981 surgical decompressions were performed for CES,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and the population was estimated at 52Â 234Â 000<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> giving an incidence of 1.9 per 100â000. Therefore, there may be over 1000 patients managed for CES in the UK each year. Accurate data on the presentation and management of these patients would establish current management plus adherence to and feasibility of care-quality statements, as well as potentially informing the revision of guidance based on accurate and current data.</p>
              <p>The British Neurosurgical Trainee Research Collaborative (BNTRC) has previously successfully used a network of neurosurgical trainees across the UK and Ireland to identify cases via local tertiary referral systems in conditions such as chronic subdural haematoma.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> As CES is managed in the UK by specialist spinal services, similar case ascertainment via specialist referral systems to neurosurgical, orthopaedic or joint spinal services provides a method of accurately identifying patients with CES during hospital admission. We propose to carry out the first national cohort study of the presentation and management of CES in the UK and establish the largest prospective series of patients with CES. This will provide data on CES incidence, epidemiology, presentation, management and outcomes. This will inform the development of clinical guidance and identify areas for future research in CES.</p>

              <p>Understanding Cauda Equina Syndrome (UCES) is a prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed CES managed at specialist spinal centres in the UK. Cases will be identified by neurosurgical or orthopaedic trainees in each specialist centre through daily screening of tertiary referrals and admissions to specialist spinal services. All patients managed as CES by the treating team will be included in this study.</p>
              <p>Data regarding timing and type of symptom onset, referral, investigation, management and outcome will be recorded anonymously on a secure database by the local trainee investigator during the patientâs hospital admission and after discharge. Patients' consent will be sought for the use of their data and they will be asked to complete patient-reported outcome measures representing their condition before surgery and up to 1âyear after surgery. Imaging at presentation will also be collected. This data will be compared with care quality statements and published outcome data for CES. This is an observational study. No changes to routine patient care will occur during this study.</p>

                <p>Capture-recapture methods will be used to ensure complete case ascertainment. In December 2018, June 2019 and December 2019 all local investigators will check their case ascertainment by asking their local coding departments for all discharges coded as CES using the diagnostic code from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) G83.4Â Cauda Equina Syndrome. Any additional patients identified through this method that meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>This study aims to establish the number of patients presenting with CES in the UK over 1âyear. We expect approximately 20 patients per spinal centre per year depending on the population served and a total of approximately 600â1000 patients in 1âyear across the UK. The incidence of CES will be established based on the number of patients identified at each unit and the catchment population of that unit. If all units in the UK participate, incidence will be calculated based on theÂ UK population estimates. Incidence will be calculated from all patients identified as being eligible for the study from referral screening and local coding departments, even if they do not consent for further participation.</p>
                <p>A descriptive analysis of the clinical and demographic characteristics of presenting symptoms, signs and outcomes of patients with CES will be performed. This will be determined from both clinician-reported and patient-reported data. CES incidence and characteristics will be broken down into categories such as suspected CES, incomplete CES, with retention CES and early CES, based on the clinical data. The categorical and quantitative findings on imaging will also be described. Methods of patient presentation to specialist services will be described. Type, timings and findings of investigations in patients presenting via different routes will be compared. The investigation and management of patients with CES will be described and compared with that laid out in current care quality standards. Proportions meeting the standards will be reported. Patient outcomes will be assessed and analysed using both clinician-reported and patient-reported outcome measures at 6âmonths and 1âyear. Patient outcomes will be stratified by demographics, presenting features, causative pathology, timing and findings of investigations, and timing and type of surgery. Patient usage of healthcare services over the year following diagnosis and management of CES, will be assessed using both patient-reported service usage and electronic records.</p>

                <p>The design and aims of this study were discussed with current patients being investigated for CES, and those who had previously been treated for CES. Patients trialled the questionnaires and provided feedback on the questionnaires and patient information leaflet.

                <title>Patient consent</title>
                <p>Once patients are identified as being eligible to participate in the study, they will be asked by a member of their clinical team whether they would be willing to receive further information about the study. For the majority of patients this will occur during their admission to the spinal unit, and the approach will be made by a member of ward medical or nursing staff. Once verbal consent is gained to give further information about the study, patients will be provided with the information leaflet for the study. Patients who indicate that they are happy to have further discussions regarding the study will be visited in hospital by a member of their clinical team to complete the written consent process. The person undertaking written consent will be adequately trained to do so, and have a good knowledge of the study protocol, aimsÂ and processes. The participant will be informed about and consent to their medical records being inspected by regulatory authorities and representatives of the sponsor. Both the participant and the person undertaking theÂ consent will sign and date the informed consent form to confirm that consent has been obtained. The participant will receive a copy of this document and a copy will be filed in the Investigator Site File.</p>
                <p>Decompression surgery for CES takes place as an emergency and admissions occur at all times of day and night, throughout the week and weekends. Following decompression, the length of stay in hospital wards may be as short as 1â2âdays, or may be longer than a week when there are ongoing bladder or bowel problems. All patients will be given adequate time to read the information leaflet with a minimum time period of 6âhours. Some patients will be discharged prior to being identified as being eligible for the study. These patients will be contactedÂ by telephone by a member of the clinical team and asked if they would be willing to receive information about the study by post or email. If they agree, the information leaflet and consent form will be sent to them, and they will be re-contacted to go through the consent process over the telephone at least 24âhours after receiving the information.</p>
                <p>When participants prefer to fill out paper questionnaires or do not respond to the email link, their contact details (name, addressÂ and telephone number) will be passed to the central study team at NHS Lothian using the NHS email system with the consent of the patient. The central study team will contact the participants to find out whether they still wish to take part in the study. Those who wish to continue with the study will be sent the questionnaires by email, by post or they can be completed over the telephone with a member of the central study team depending on the preference of the participant. If participants do not wish to continue with the study, they will not be contacted further.</p>
                <p>Participants are free to withdraw from the study at any point. If withdrawal occurs, the primary reason for withdrawal will be documented in the participantâs electronic case report form. The participant will not be contacted any further for outcome measures but their basic anonymous clinical details will be retained to allow accurate epidemiological assessment of the incidence of CES. If a patient loses capacity to consent for ongoing participation during the course of the study, the data they have already submitted or has already been submitted by their clinical team with their consent will continue to be used in the study, but they will not be contacted with further questionnaires.</p>
