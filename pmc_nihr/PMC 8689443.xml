              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><milestone-start id="q1"/>Migraine with aura occurs in as many as one-third of patients with migraine (with prevalence estimated at 20%-40% of all people with migraine), although most of these patients do not experience aura with every migraine attack.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Currently, no well-established treatments are available to abort or prevent aura symptoms,<sup><xref rid="noi210081r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and therapeutic responses to acute therapy, specifically sumatriptan, may be different in migraine with aura compared with migraine without aura.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The evidence is mixed on the association of aura with preventive treatments for migraine.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Cortical spreading depression-like events are widely considered to be the underlying substrate of a migraine aura.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Thus, it is unclear whether monoclonal antibodies, which are generally believed to be substantially restricted to the periphery, would be equally effective in migraine with aura vs without aura. Given the importance of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the regulation of vascular tone<sup><xref rid="noi210081r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and the associations between migraine with aura and cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref rid="noi210081r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> well-established safety data on patients with migraine with aura are needed.<milestone-end rid="q1"/></p>
              <p>Erenumab, which is known in the US as erenumab-aooe, is a human anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody that was developed for migraine prevention. Erenumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in episodic migraine and chronic migraine, reducing both monthly migraine days (MMDs) and acute migraine–specific medication (AMSM) use.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To understand the efficacy and safety profiles of erenumab in patients with migraine with aura, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of clinical data from 4 pivotal randomized clinical trials of erenumab. We believe this analysis provides Class II evidence (according to the Levels of Evidence for Primary Research Question from the North American Spine Society), as the evidence showed a reduction in MMDs and a reduction in AMSM use.</p>

                <p>The studies enrolled adult patients aged 18 to 65 years who had episodic migraine (≥4 to &lt;15 migraine days per month and &lt;15 headache days per month) or chronic migraine (≥15 headache days per month, of which ≥8 were migraine days).

Two clinical trials excluded patients if they had poorly controlled hypertension.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The efficacy analyses we performed included pooled data from the 3 episodic migraine trials<sup><xref rid="noi210081r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; data from the 1 chronic migraine trial<sup><xref rid="noi210081r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> were assessed separately. Our safety analyses used data that were pooled from all 4 clinical trials. Race and ethnicity data were self-reported by participants and included the following categories: Black or African American, White, and other (ie, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, multiple, or other).</p>

                <title>Efficacy Outcomes and Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>We conducted efficacy assessments throughout the double-blind treatment phase at week 12 (including data from weeks 9-12) and throughout the open-label treatment phase or active treatment phase. Patients used a daily electronic diary to report information about their migraine and nonmigraine headaches, acute medication use, and, in the chronic migraine trial, aura symptoms. Efficacy end points for this subgroup analysis included changes in MMD, proportion of patients achieving 50% or greater reduction in MMD, and changes in monthly AMSM days.</p>
                <p>Subgroups of patients with and without a history of aura were determined from medical history provided by the investigators during screening. In the chronic migraine clinical trial, patients were instructed to record their aura symptoms daily during the baseline and treatment phases. Because some patients with a history of aura did not experience aura during the 4-week baseline period, we calculated change in monthly aura days in patients with 1 or more or 3 or more aura days during baseline regardless of their history of aura. In the episodic migraine trials, aura information was not routinely collected; therefore, we did not calculate changes in aura days.</p>
                <p>The efficacy analysis in the episodic migraine clinical trials included pooled data on patients who received 1 or more erenumab dose (70 mg or 140 mg) or placebo during the double-blind treatment phase (short-term analysis) and completed 1 or more postbaseline monthly measurement. Long-term analysis included data on patients who received 1 or more erenumab dose (70 mg or 140 mg) and completed 1 or more measurement during the extension periods. The efficacy analysis in the chronic migraine trial included patients who received 1 or more erenumab dose (70 mg or 140 mg) or placebo during the double-blind treatment phase (short-term analysis) or 1 or more dose of erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg) during the extension periods (long-term analysis) and completed 1 or more postbaseline measurement.</p>
                <p>In the adjusted analyses of continuous efficacy outcomes in the short-term analyses, we used a generalized linear mixed model, including treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, stratification factors, and baseline value as covariates and assuming a first-order autoregressive covariance structure. Binary efficacy outcomes in the short-term analyses were assessed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, after the missing data were imputed as nonresponse, classified by stratification factors. <italic>P</italic> values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Descriptive summaries were provided for efficacy outcomes in the long-term analyses. We performed a sensitivity analysis of efficacy outcomes in the short-term analyses of the pooled episodic migraine trials for patients who were treated at headache specialty centers (ie, those with ongoing clinical activities related to migraine care outside of a migraine trial) to account for potential misclassification of patients with migraine and aura; however, we did not perform a similar sensitivity analysis in the chronic migraine trial because of the low numbers of patients from non–headache specialty sites.</p>

Open-label treatment phase data were used to assess the overall long-term safety profile of erenumab. Cardiovascular risk factors at baseline were identified from predefined search strategies or dedicated case report form pages for diabetes, history of hypertension, high blood pressure at screening (systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg measured on ≥2 occasions), cigarette use, history of dyslipidemia, high cholesterol level (total cholesterol &gt;5.17 mmol/L, low-density lipoprotein &gt;3.36 mmol/L, or high-density lipoprotein &lt;1.03 mmol/L), high lipid level (triglyceride &gt;1.69 mmol/L), and body mass index of 30 or higher (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and hypertension AEs were identified using a narrow standardized MedDRA query for ischemic central nervous system vascular conditions, a narrow standardized MedDRA query for ischemic heart disease, a narrow Amgen MedDRA query for peripheral arterial disease, and a narrow and broad standardized MedDRA query for hypertension.</p>
                <p>Safety analysis sets included pooled data on all patients from the 4 clinical trials who received 1 or more erenumab dose (70 mg or 140 mg) or placebo during the double-blind treatment phase (short-term analysis) or 1 or more dose of erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg) during the extension periods (long-term analysis).<sup><xref rid="noi210081r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Events that spanned the double-blind treatment phase and extension phases were counted as a single occurrence in the short-term period unless the event worsened in the extension phase. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (per 100 patient-years) of AEs were calculated as the total number of patients who reported 1 or more AEs divided by the total time at risk for reporting the AEs (in years, summed across all patients) multiplied by 100. Time at risk included only the time to first occurrence of the AE. If a patient did not have the corresponding AE to report, then time at risk included time to safety follow-up visit for long-term analysis. All statistical calculations were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).</p>

Patients had a mean (SD) age of 41.7 (11.2) years, identified as primarily White individuals (n = 2222 [91.0%]), were predominantly women (n = 2055 [84.1%]), and had a mean (SD) disease duration of 20.7 (12.3) years. The mean (SD) baseline MMDs were 10.6 (5.1) in patients with a history of aura and 11.2 (5.6) in patients without a history of aura. Previous or current use of preventive treatment and use of AMSM at baseline were higher in patients without a history of aura than patients with a history of aura as were previous preventive treatment failure (<xref rid="noi210081t1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>).</p>

In patients with episodic migraine without a history of aura, least-squares mean (LSM) differences in MMD change from baseline at week 12 were –1.2 (95% CI, –1.6 to –0.7) in those who received 70 mg of erenumab and –2.5 (95% CI, –3.2 to –1.8) in those who received 140 mg of erenumab compared with the placebo. In patients with episodic migraine and a history of aura, the LSM differences were –1.1 (95% CI, –1.7 to –0.6) in those who received 70 mg of erenumab and –0.9 (95% CI, –1.6 to –0.2) in those who received 140 mg of erenumab compared with those who received placebo (<xref rid="noi210081f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

In patients with chronic migraine without a history of aura, the LSM differences were –2.7 (95% CI, –4.1 to –1.3) in those who received 70 mg of erenumab and –2.1 (95% CI, –3.5 to –0.7) in those who received 140 mg of erenumab compared with those who received placebo.

                <p>The total erenumab exposure during the long-term analysis was 2002.5 patient-years with a median (IQR) 69.4 (28.1-63.4) weeks of erenumab treatment for patients without a history of aura (n = 1352). This exposure was 1479.5 patient-years with a median (IQR) 44.3 (28.0-52.3) weeks of erenumab treatment for patients with a history of aura (n = 1147). A total of 2499 patients received 1 or more dose of erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, including patients in the 7-mg or 21-mg dose group from the double-blind treatment phase who received 70 mg or 140 mg during the extension phases.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Previous studies indicated that patients with migraine with aura may respond differently to acute therapies compared with those with migraine without aura.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, CGRP was found to provoke migraine attacks without aura in patients with a history of aura.<sup><xref rid="noi210081r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Thus, it was not known whether erenumab was efficacious in patients with migraine with a history of aura. <milestone-start id="q4"/>Findings of this post hoc secondary analysis support the safety and efficacy of erenumab in patients with migraine with or without a history of aura. Those who received erenumab in both subgroups attained greater reductions in MMDs from baseline than those who received placebo, with an increased proportion of patients achieving 50% or greater reductions in MMDs. Among patients who used AMSM, monthly AMSM days were reduced.<milestone-end rid="q4"/> These clinical responses were maintained in the longer term, with a treatment time frame ranging from 1 to 1.25 years and up to 5 years in some cases.</p>
              <p>In this post hoc analysis, no differences were found in the safety profiles of patients with and without history of aura, and no unexpected safety findings were observed. Most of the reported AEs were mild or moderate.</p>
              <sec id="H2-6-NOI210081">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p><milestone-start id="q5"/>This study has some limitations. The results may not be generalizable to patients from racial and ethnic minority groups and those older than 65 years, as the representation of these populations was limited in this study. There were some imbalances in baseline characteristics, including higher exposure to previous preventive treatments and acute medications in patients with migraine without a history of aura, and time of exposure to erenumab that may confound any indirect comparisons between the 2 subgroups. However, we believe that these imbalances do not affect the main objective of this analysis. Patients with a history of aura in the development program were overrepresented. In contrast to the commonly reported 1-year prevalence of 25% to 40% of patients with migraine experiencing aura,<sup><xref rid="noi210081r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="noi210081r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> almost half of the patients in the present analysis had a history of aura.<milestone-end rid="q5"/> This finding was largely based on lifetime prevalence but in some cases may have been interpreted as a current diagnosis. Differences between reported rates and rates found in the 4 clinical trials could be attributable to selection bias or diagnosis errors; thus, we performed a sensitivity analysis for patients in headache specialty centers, which would be expected to have more accurate aura diagnoses.</p>
                <p>The ability to assess the association of erenumab with aura was limited to the chronic migraine trial, in which we were able to conduct a preliminary assessment of aura days in patients who reported experiencing aura during baseline. We did not observe a substantial treatment difference, but conclusions are limited because of the small number of patients available for analysis.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This post hoc secondary analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials found that erenumab reduced migraine frequency and AMSM days in patients with migraine with and without a history of aura. The safety profile of long-term erenumab treatment was similar in patients with and without a history of aura and was comparable to that of placebo over 12 weeks, with no increased emergence of adverse events over time. These findings suggest that erenumab may be safe and effective for this patient population.</p>
