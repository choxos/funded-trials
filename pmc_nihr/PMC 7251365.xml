                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Serum biomarkers may inform and improve care in traumatic brain injury (TBI). We aimed to correlate serum biomarkers with clinical severity, care path and imaging abnormalities in TBI, and explore their incremental value over clinical characteristics in predicting computed tomographic (CT) abnormalities.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We analyzed six serum biomarkers (S100B, NSE, GFAP, UCH-L1, NFL and t-tau) obtained &lt;24 h post-injury from 2867 patients with any severity of TBI in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research (CENTER-TBI) Core Study, a prospective, multicenter, cohort study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>All biomarkers scaled with clinical severity and care path (ER only, ward admission, or ICU), and with presence of CT abnormalities. GFAP achieved the highest discrimination for predicting CT abnormalities (AUC 0•89 [95%CI: 0•87–0•90]), with a 99% likelihood of better discriminating CT-positive patients than clinical characteristics used in contemporary decision rules. In patients with mild TBI, GFAP also showed incremental diagnostic value: discrimination increased from 0•84 [95%CI: 0•83–0•86] to 0•89 [95%CI: 0•87–0•90] when GFAP was included. Results were consistent across strata, and injury severity. Combinations of biomarkers did not improve discrimination compared to GFAP alone.</p>

                  <p>Currently available biomarkers reflect injury severity, and serum GFAP, measured within 24 h after injury, outperforms clinical characteristics in predicting CT abnormalities. Our results support the further development of serum GFAP assays towards implementation in clinical practice, for which robust clinical assay platforms are required.</p>

                  <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                  <p id="para0007">Blood-based biomarkers hold potential for informing and substantially improving the clinical management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). To date, however, only one biomarker (S100B) has been integrated into some national guidelines for triaging the need to perform computerized tomography scanning (CT scan) of the brain in patients with mild TBI. The superiority or incremental benefit of biomarkers beyond canonical clinical variables used in CT prediction rules has not convincingly been demonstrated. Moreover, uncertainty exists as to how single or multi-biomarker tests perform. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the ability of blood biomarkers with advanced analytical and clinical validity (GFAP, UCH-L1, NSE, S100B, t-tau and NFL) to predict the presence of traumatic abnormalities on head CT scanning in the acute clinical setting. We screened MEDLINE, Embase, EBM Reviews and Cochrane Library for relevant articles on October 25, 2016, and, subsequently updated the results by monitoring the literature every 3 months. Synthesis of these data indicated that only S100B had high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) and could be used to rule out the need for acute CT scanning. The evidence to support use of other emerging markers was limited and insufficient to warrant clinical application. Recently, the ALERT-TBI trial (1959 participants), published in 2018, showed that GFAP and UCH-L1, in combination, discriminated between patients with and without CT abnormalities. Results from the TRACK-TBI study in the US, highlighted the potential of biomarkers as a screening tool for MRI abnormalities in patients with normal CT findings. However, the clinical utility of these biomarkers still remains uncertain. Further work is needed to determine the most effective and efficient biomarker or multimarker strategy for integration into clinical care.</p>

                  <title>Added value of this study</title>
                  <p id="para0008">We use data from a well-characterized multicenter cohort of 2867 patients with TBI to provide the first evidence of medical utility of blood biomarkers beyond standard of care-based clinical characteristics. Our results support potential for their adoption into clinical use to inform and improve decision making in current practice. In particular, we corroborate and extend recent results regarding the diagnostic performance of GFAP, showing that GFAP captures the greatest discriminatory information, performing as well as a combination of all markers and adding value to clinical characteristics. We believe this is the largest study to simultaneously assess and compare the diagnostic performance of a panel of 6 biomarkers reflecting distinct types of injury and pathophysiological mechanisms, across a population of patients with a full range of TBI severities and wide range of injury patterns.</p>
                  <p id="para0009">The assessment of the utility of biomarker measurements in individual care pathways, as defined in CENTER-TBI, allows us to explore their use in a range of contexts of care. This ensures the robustness and generalizability of our estimates derived from real-world patient population and clinical scenarios, while confirming the generation of actionable information for clinicians. Comparison of our results with those from other studies shows similar trends, but also highlights between-platform inconsistencies in assay calibration and reported biomarker values.</p>

We highlight the potential role of GFAP as part of a comprehensive triage strategy and consider it to be best positioned for implementation into medical practice and incorporation in clinical decision algorithms. Robust clinical use assay platforms are a prerequisite for such clinical implementation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para0011">The delivery of precision medicine for traumatic brain injury (TBI) requires objective tools to identify disease phenotypes and to guide clinical decisions <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Clinical assessment and computerized tomography (CT) of the head form the diagnostic cornerstone in clinical practice, but a need remains for more detailed disease classification utilizing a multidimensional approach. Moreover, indiscriminate use of CT, resulting in high costs, and increased recognition of risks of radiation exposure have called for more selective use of CT scanning in patients with milder forms of TBI [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Various clinical decision rules (CDR) have been developed for this purpose <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, but their adoption in clinical practice is variable.</p>
              <p id="para0012">A major focus of recent research has been on the potential of biomarkers to improve diagnosis and patient characterization, and enable tailored management <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several publications have provided extensive evidence of analytical and early clinical validity of various biomarkers, and documented efforts to achieve regulatory clearance <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the development of clinical algorithms and guidelines which integrate biomarker measurements to inform decision-making has been inconsistent, partial and inconclusive <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), a biomarker of astroglial breakdown, has been implemented in the Scandinavian TBI Guidelines <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but is seldom used outside the Nordic countries and with sub-optimal performance in real-world conditions <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The pivotal ALERT-TBI study showed high sensitivity for the combination of astroglial (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and neuronal (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 [UCH-L1]) biomarker blood levels measured within 12 h after injury in triaging the need for CT scanning <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but did not address the added value compared to clinical characteristics used in CDRs, or explore its value relative to S100B <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. More in general, few studies have examined the incremental value of biomarkers beyond clinical characteristics.</p>
              <p id="para0013">As a consequence, uncertainty exists how biomarkers, either singly or in combination, can best improve existing decision-making and processes of care, creating a barrier to widespread implementation and adoption of these tests in medical practice. Nevertheless, blood-based biomarkers provide objective information, offer additional risk stratification and hold potential to inform personalized interventions.</p>
              <p id="para0014">The CENTER-TBI Core study (Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.center-tbi.eu/" id="PC_link5aCmWTEfVT">www.center-tbi.eu</ext-link>) was designed to advance multimodal characterization and classification in TBI [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Within this unique framework, in which patients were stratified by care path, we aimed to determine the relation – and their relative performance – of a panel of biomarkers, assessed within 24 h of injury, with clinical severity, care pathways and presence of CT abnormalities across the entire injury spectrum of TBI. We further aimed to explore the incremental value of biomarkers compared to established clinical characteristics in predicting the presence of CT abnormalities.</p>

                <p id="para0015">The CENTER-TBI Core study is a prospective observational clinical and biomarker study of patients with TBI, conducted in 65 clinical sites from 17 European countries and Israel between December 19, 2014, and December 17, 2017. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02210221). Details of protocol and clinical data have been previously published [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In brief: patients with all severities of TBI presenting to a study center within 24 h of injury and scheduled for CT scanning were enrolled, stratified by care path (emergency department [ER], admission [Adm] and intensive care unit [ICU]). The only exclusion criterion was severe pre-existing neurological disorder.</p>

                <p id="para0019">Blood samples for determination of biomarkers were collected using gel-separator tubes for serum, and centrifuged within 60 minutes. Serum was processed, aliquoted (8 × 0·5 ml), and stored at −80 °C locally until shipment on dry ice to the central CENTER-TBI biobank (Pécs, Hungary).</p>
                <p id="para0020">We assayed six biomarkers: S100B, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), GFAP, UCH-L1, neurofilament protein-light (NFL), and total tau (t-tau). S100B and NSE were measured with a clinical-use automated system, using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kit (ECLIA) (Elecsys S100 and Elecsys NSE assays) run on the e 602 module of Cobas 8000 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at the University of Pécs (Pécs, Hungary). Serum GFAP, UCH-L1, NFL and t-tau were analyzed with an ultrasensitive immunoassay using digital array technology (Single Molecule Arrays, SiMoA)-based Human Neurology 4-Plex B assay (N4PB) run on the SR-X benchtop assay platform (Quanterix Corp., Lexington, MA) at the University of Florida (Gainesville, Florida). Unique aliquots were used for analyses on the two platforms to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and analyzed in one round of experiments using the same batch of reagents by qualified laboratory technicians blinded to clinical information. Replicate assays were performed on a subset of samples with a balanced distribution across strata. The percent of replicates performed were 4·3% for the SiMoA platform and 5·7% for the Roche platform – these numbers were selected to fit within the assaying logistics and assay work flow for the full assay runs on the respective platforms.</p>
                <p id="para0021">Clinical data, including variables used in clinical decision rules (CDRs) for triaging CT scanning (<italic>Supplementary Table 1</italic>), were collected using a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF), with variables coded in accordance with the Common Data Elements (CDE) scheme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/" id="interref0003">https://commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="para0022">All patients underwent head CT examinations according to local protocols. Imaging studies were transmitted to a central repository (Icometrix, Leuven) for structured reporting according to the NINDS TBI-CDEs. Central reviewers were blinded to clinical information, except gender, age, and care path. The presence of any traumatic intracranial abnormality on CT was considered a positive scan. Skull fractures in isolation were not considered as intracranial abnormality.</p>

Predictive mean matching was used for continuous data, logistic regression for binary data, and polytomous regression for categorical data. Fifty imputed datasets were created, with results summarized according to Rubin's rules <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The diagnostic performance of biomarkers, separately and in combination to identify patients with positive CT findings was assessed with logistic regression. We allowed for non-linear effects of log transformed biomarkers using restricted cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom. From these models, we derived estimates of the area under the ROC curves (AUC, or <italic>c</italic>-statistic). A bootstrap resampling procedure with 200 repetitions was applied to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Univariable and multivariable analysis, adjusting for clinical characteristics, was performed.</p>
                <p id="para0027">The clinical characteristics derived from CDRs were included in the multivariable analysis as they are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Continuous variables were included without categorization to fully capture the diagnostic information they contain.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0042">We studied the relation of serum biomarkers to clinical severity, care path and the presence of traumatic intracranial abnormalities on CT scanning. We found that all biomarkers studied scaled with injury severity, classified according to the GCS and with care path intensity. Within each of these stratifications, biomarkers were higher in patients with abnormalities on head CT imaging compared to those without. Serum GFAP levels in the first 24 h post-injury were highly predictive for CT positivity, outperforming other markers and adding value to clinical variables considered in contemporary CT decision rules. Combining results of all biomarkers did not clearly improve discrimination compared to GFAP alone.</p>
              <p id="para0043">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study across all injury severities, evaluating systematically a panel of 6 biomarkers, and quantifying their performance relative to clinical characteristics in predicting CT abnormalities in patients with mild TBI. Recently, Thelin et al. reported on the same panel of biomarkers in a cohort of 172 patients with TBI <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The focus of this study was, however, on prognosis. Other previous studies have shown relations of biomarkers to clinical severity and to the presence of CT abnormalities <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Most, however, mainly focused on one or two biomarkers and have seldom addressed performance of biomarkers relative to clinical characteristics. Moreover, a living systematic review identified serious problems in the design, analysis and reporting of many of the studies <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Until recently, the strongest evidence for a role in triaging CT scanning existed for S100B. This marker is incorporated in the Scandinavian guidelines for the management of moderate to minimal TBI <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Previously, a study including 397 patients with general trauma, of whom 209 had mild TBI, reported that GFAP performed better than S100B, in particular in patients with extracranial injuries <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Our results expand these earlier data, convincingly showing that GFAP outperforms S100B both in the overall group of mild TBI and in the subset of patients with a GCS of 15. However, we believe that a decision to replace S100B by GFAP in such guidelines may be premature. Assays for S100B are commercially available with high reproducibility. Currently, no GFAP assays are available as a commercialized clinical assay platform. Indeed, the platform we used for analysis of GFAP is a research-use-only (RUO) platform, and our replication assays showed substantial variation (28% on a log transformed scale). Factors that may have contributed to poor reproducibility include: not fully automated analyses, and that replicate samples had undergone a second freeze-thaw cycle. There is no evidence that refrigerated storage of samples for up to 72 h has a significant effect on GFAP values <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, but a decrease of GFAP levels has been reported in CSF after two freeze-thaw cycles <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0044">The clear effects of GFAP and other biomarkers in the presence of assay heterogeneity speaks to the robustness of our findings. The role of biomarkers goes beyond triage for CT scanning in patients with mild TBI. Our results in this specific subgroup confirm the potential of GFAP to predict presence of MRI abnormalities in patients with normal CT findings after TBI <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Assay reproducibility and thresholds</title>
                <p id="para0045">Reliability and reproducibility of biomarker assays are fundamental for clinical implementation. Absolute GFAP levels in our study were much higher than those reported in the ALERT-TBI study, which used a different platform <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Whilst different reference values between platforms may be acceptable, insight into comparability of values obtained with different platforms is desirable. Variation between platforms also precludes the concept of determining a universal cut-off value. Moreover, cut-off values are generally derived from reference values, obtained from healthy controls, whilst “action thresholds” are needed in diseased patients, which may be very different from reference values <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Further, it should be recognized that any biomarker represents a continuous variable and that use of a threshold value leads to loss of information. We suggest that biomarkers may be combined with clinical characteristics for risk estimation, and then continuous values may be retained. We have hence refrained from suggesting threshold values, a decision which was reinforced by the variability in replicate assays.</p>

                <title>GFAP versus a multi-marker approach</title>
                <p id="para0046">Contrary to our expectations, a multi-marker approach applying combinations of biomarkers did not increase the diagnostic value for CT positivity, compared to GFAP alone. GFAP showed similar discrimination as all biomarkers combined when analyzed versus clinical severity and care path. Nevertheless, these observations do not preclude potential usefulness of combinational approaches in terms of outcome prediction and/or tracking the disease process over time. Conceptually, different biomarkers should differentially reflect specific aspects of the disease process of TBI [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in this study we did not find any benefit of combining acute GFAP levels with UCH-L1 levels, a combination of (presumed) glial and neuronal markers used in the recent ALERT-TBI trial, which provided the basis for a recent FDA marketing authorization [<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our results provide no support for implementation of this combined assay into clinical practice. We do note, however, that a key difference between our study and ALERT-TBI is that the time window for blood sampling was 24 h in our study and 12 h in ALERT-TBI. This may be relevant as the half-life for UCH-L1 is short <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, sensitivity analysis differentiated for time of sampling (<italic>Supplementary Fig. 6</italic>) did not show superior performance of UCH-L1 in the first six hours after trauma. The finding that a single marker approach (GFAP) may be sufficient in the acute phase to inform diagnosis and care path is of particular relevance for low and middle income countries (LMICs) and other austere environments, where even basic imaging is inaccessible, or too expensive and unevenly distributed, with limited opportunities for patient transfer.</p>

                <p id="para0058">In conclusion, each of the six investigated biomarkers scaled with the severity of TBI and with care path. GFAP serum levels obtained within 24 h post-injury predict CT positivity across the full range of injury severities. In patients with mild TBI and in patients with a GCS of 15, GFAP adds value to clinical characteristics and outperforms other markers, including S100B. No clear additional value for predicting CT positivity was found when combining GFAP with other biomarkers. Our evidence supports development of novel CT decision rules, combining serum GFAP with clinical characteristics, for triaging patients with mild TBI for CT scanning. To this purpose, validated clinical-use assays are required.</p>
