                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the end result of a susceptible individual being exposed to sufficiently deleterious environmental stimuli. More than 90% of COPD-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). LMICs face unique challenges in managing COPD; for example, deficient primary care systems present challenges for proper diagnosis and management. Formal diagnosis of COPD requires quality-assured spirometry, which is often limited to urban health centres. Similarly, standard treatment options for COPD remain limited where few providers are trained to manage COPD. The Global Excellence in COPD Outcomes (GECo) studies aim to assess the performance of a COPD case-finding questionnaire with and without peak expiratory flow (PEF) to diagnose COPD, and inform the effectiveness and implementation of COPD self-management Action Plans in LMIC settings. The ultimate goal is to develop simple, low-cost models of care that can be implemented in LMICs. This study will be carried out in Nepal, Peru and Uganda, three distinct LMIC settings.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">We aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a simple questionnaire with and without PEF to case-find COPD (GECo1), and examine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation of a community-health-worker-supported self-management Action Plan strategy for managing exacerbations of COPD (GECo2). To achieve the first aim, we will enrol a randomly selected sample of up to 10,500 adults aged â¥â40Â years across our three sites, with the goal to enrol 240 participants with moderate-to-severe COPDÂ in to GECo2. We will apply two case-finding questionnaires (Lung Function Questionnaire and CAPTURE) with and without PEF and compare performance against spirometry. We will report ROC areas, sensitivity and specificity. Individuals who are identified as having COPD grades BâD will be invited to enrol in an effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomised trial of a multi-faceted COPD self-management Action Plan intervention delivered by CHWs. The intervention group will receive (1) COPD education, (2) facilitated-self management Action Plans for COPD exacerbations and (3) monthly visits by community health workers. The control group will receive COPD education andÂ standard of care treatment provided by local health providers. Beginning at baseline, we will measure quality of life with the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and St. Georgeâs Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) every 3Â months over a period of 1 year. The primary endpoint is SGRQ at 12Â months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the Short-Form 36 version 2 will also be calculated. We will additionally assess the acceptability and feasibility of implementing COPD Action Plans in each setting among providers and individuals with COPD.</p>

                <title>The global importance of COPD</title>
                <p id="Par17">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is â<italic>a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases</italic>â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The primary risk factor for COPD in high-income countries (HICs) is tobacco smoke exposure; however, household air pollution (HAP), from burning solid fuels such as wood, dung, agricultural crop waste, and coal for energy, is the primary risk factor for COPD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to chronic progressive symptoms and functional impairment, some individuals with COPD are prone to intermittent deteriorations in respiratory health, or âexacerbationsâ, often driven by infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The global burden of COPD is large and increasing. In 2015, it was estimated that 174 million people worldwide had clinically significant COPD, and an estimated 3.2 million individuals died from the disease, an increase of 11.6% since 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. COPD will become the third leading cause of death by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Prevalence estimates vary due to different methods of diagnosis; however, the BOLD studies report a prevalence of moderate COPD or higher to be around 10% globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Exacerbations are a major source of morbidity from COPD, and the cause of direct healthcare costs in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>

                <title>COPD in LMICs</title>
                <p id="Par18">More than 90% of COPD-related deaths occur in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The economic cost of illness due to COPD among LMICs was estimated to be US$1 trillion in 2010 and is expected to increase to US$2.6 trillion by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indirect costs, including loss of productivity both by individuals affected by COPD and their caregivers, are important in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. LMICs face unique challenges when addressing COPD, including poorly resourced primary care systems and trained workforce shortages, which present challenges with COPD diagnosis and management, especially during exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The chronic nature of COPD means that people may access multiple healthcare providers, including alternative providers.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>COPD case finding</title>
                <p id="Par19">The âgold standardâ method for diagnosis of COPD is quality-assured, post-bronchodilator spirometry, though COPD represents a range of phenotypes with different symptomatic presentations including shortness of breath, cough and sputum production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In LMICs this is often only available from pulmonary physicians in specialised urban centres, while most of the burden associated with this condition occurs in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A number of COPD case-finding questionnaires have been validated in HIC settings, which are, therefore, likely to be more sensitive to tobacco-associated COPD than biomass-fuel smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 2010, Yawn et al. developed and validated a simple five-item Lung Function Questionnaire (LFQ) and compared this to standard spirometry (area under the curve (AUC)â=â0.720 with sensitivity and specificity of 73.2 and 58.2%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Martinez et al. combined peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements with a case-finding instrument to improve the sensitivity, specificity and AUC for detecting COPD (89.7%, 78.1%, 0.795, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Case-finding instruments combined with low-cost peak-flow meters could be useful tools for identifying individuals who should be further screened for COPD in LMIC settings as well, although this has not been previously tested.</p>

                <title>COPD self-management</title>
                <p id="Par20">Written self-management Action Plans are an integral part of evidence-based management of COPD according to international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Action Plans support people with COPD to recognise and react appropriately to exacerbations through initiation of additional pharmacotherapy and modification of healthcare-seeking behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A number of studies and systematic reviews have tested self-management interventions for prevention and successful treatment of COPD exacerbations in high-income settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Bourbeau et al. demonstrated a 39.8% reduction in hospitalisations for exacerbations of COPD in a multicentre randomised control trial of self-management with comprehensive patient education compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A similar trial by Effing et al. reviewed the effectiveness of self-management on the severity of exacerbations and found a trend to fewer exacerbation days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Finally, a 2005 Cochrane Review found that Action Plans aid people with COPD in recognising severe exacerbations and reacting appropriately to an exacerbation via the self-initiation of antibiotics and/or orally administered steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The potential benefits, cost-effectiveness and implementation challenges of Action Plans in LMIC have not previously been studied.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Efforts to scale-up COPD case finding and management are hampered by a shortage of specialised healthcare providers. Healthcare workforce shortages have been well documented among LMICs and community health worker (CHW) models of care have been widely utilised in health priority areas including infectious diseases and nutritional interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. CHWs are a diverse category of health workers who commonly work in communities outside of fixed health facilities and have formal, but limited, training for the tasks they perform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. CHWs can serve as a bridge between people and healthcare systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Many LMICs have existing CHW networks and a long history of implementing public health interventions utilising CHWs to deliver health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. CHWs are uniquely qualified as connectors and tools of empowerment in chronic disease management because they live within the community in which they work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">Given the high and rising global burden of COPD, better strategies to diagnosis COPD and manage exacerbations are urgently needed for LMICs. In two linked studies (Global Excellence in COPD Outcomes: GECo1 and GECo2), we aim to validate a modified COPD case finding questionnaire (with and without PEF) to better identify individuals for further screening for COPD, as well as to develop evidence to support the wider implementation of COPD Action Plans among CHWs, allowing for simple, low-cost models of COPD care in LMICs. This study will enrol individuals in three distinct LMIC regions, namely Nepal, Peru and Uganda.</p>

Nepalâs GDP is Â£49 billion, with 25% of the population living below the national poverty line. The current ratio of physicians per person is 1:1742. The current minimum wage is Rs 9700 per month (Â£66). The study site is in Bhaktapur, 8 miles east of Kathmandu. The majority of the estimated 80,000 inhabitants of Bhaktapur municipality are either craftsman or businessmen, while many migrants come to work in the outskirts at brick or carpet factories. CHWs, called female community health volunteers (FCHVs), are volunteers coordinated by the Bhaktapur municipality to promote community-based healthcare, health education and referrals. FCHVs are trained by their District Public Health Office, under the Ministry of Health to serve within their respective communities, mainly on family planning, vaccination and nutrition programmes. There are approximately 90 FCHVs active in the municipality of Bhaktapur and over 52,000 throughout Nepal.</p>

                  <p id="Par70">CHWs will be selected from local catchment areas and trained on delivering health education related to COPD based on willingness to participate. CHWs will participate in a 2-day workshop consisting of health education and role-playing which is harmonised across sites (see âAdditional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>â). CHWs assigned to the intervention component of the trial will additionally receive training on how to support individuals with COPD in self-management of symptoms and exacerbations as indicated in the Action Plans. CHWs delivering the intervention arm will also be trained in medication distribution, patient communication, navigation of local health systems, and on delivering reinforcement of self-management behaviours during follow-up (Training plan included in the âAdditional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>â). A COPD Knowledge Questionnaire will be applied before and after training to assess the effectiveness of the delivered training to the CHW. CHWs will be evaluated for a set of specific competencies before being approved to interact with study participants. Training will be repeated twice through the study to reinforce concepts taught in initial training and address questions or concerns that arise during the follow-up period.</p>

                  <p id="Par72">The primary outcome of the trial will be a comparison of the change in SGRQ from baseline to 12Â months between the two arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We will assess respiratory symptoms at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12Â months post randomisation using the SGRQ. The SGRQ measures impaired health and perceived well-being among individuals with chronic airway disease and offers many advantages for our study, namely: (1) can be used to quantify changes in health following treatment, (2) it is not limited to individuals with COPD and (3) it provides a standard metric that can be used for easy comparison across our three diverse settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par73">The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire will be collected at baseline and quarterly through the trial period. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in five dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort and Anxiety/Depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Each dimension has three response categories corresponding to no problems, some problems and extreme problems. The instrument is designed for self-completion, and respondents also rate their overall health on the day of the interview from a 0â100 hash-marked, visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be derived from the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D has been widely tested and used in both general populations and patient samples and has been locally validated in Nepal, Peru and Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

This approach aims to ensure an adequate sample size to help inform a decision about continuation of GECo2 to a main trial based on an indication of a treatment effect for the primary outcome. This SGRQ score has previously been shown to have a standard deviation of 25 points in a similar population and the clinically important difference is 4 points (a recent Cochrane Review on the use of COPD Action Plans found an average decrease of 4 points in SGRQ in three randomised trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A sample of 112 participants with COPD will be needed to produce an 80% one-sided confidence interval that excludes a 4-point difference in SGRQ under the scenario of no difference in means. We expect to have sufficient subjects to enrol 240 participants from the GECo1 study.</p>

                    <p id="Par77">The primary analysis will be a comparison of SGRQ scores at 12Â months between the randomised groups. We will use multiple linear regression, initially with adjustments for baseline SGRQ score and country and in subsequent analysis with adjustments for other factors including age, gender and disease severity. We will estimate the difference in means with a one-sided 80% confidence interval. We will examine repeated measurements of SGRQ by treatment group and fit random effects models to consider the effect of the intervention over time. The main analysis will be by intention-to-treat (ITT), based on cases where the primary outcome is available and will, therefore, rely on an assumption that data is missing at random. We will describe the number (%) with missing primary outcome, look at reasons for missingness and consider characteristics of the patients excluded from the ITT analysis. Models will be rerun including adjustment for factors found to be related to missingness of the 12-month score. In pre-specified exploratory analysis we will examine differences by site, and by existing vs. new diagnosis of COPD.</p>

                  <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                  <p id="Par79">This analysis will primarily aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention centred on a self-management strategy for COPD exacerbations within the effectiveness-implementation trial. However, in an attempt to integrate implementation science concepts with decision analysis, we will also incorporate health system factors relating to service provision in the analysis for each of the three settings and explore equity implications. The main analysis will compare the health-related costs and benefits of the COPD Action Plan plus education with the health-related costs and benefits of default standard care, as observed within the trial. Costs will be calculated using the reported levels of resource use and multiplying these estimates by the unit costs for each resource. The EQ-5D results will provide estimates of the effectiveness in terms of QALYs. QALY tariffs will be taken from the country itself, when available, or from another relevant source (e.g. adjacent country or international average). Cost-effectiveness ratios will be reported as the additional cost per QALY gained; however, these will also be reported as additional cost per hospitalisation and exacerbation averted to provide a clear picture of the value of the intervention. As COPD is expected to affect the labour status and productivity of working-age people and their caregivers, we will additionally explore the broader productivity benefits. The main cost-effectiveness analysis will further include a sensitivity analysis that accounts for the performance of the case-finding questionnaire and which extends to the short-term costs using assumptions and evidence of future costs not captured within the GECo study.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">To explore equity in the cost-effectiveness analysis, we will assess whether there are population and individual characteristics that enable some sub-groups to gain more from the intervention than others. With the benefit of intense follow-up and monitoring at multiple time periods, we will be able to explore whether the intervention provides equity benefits over the course of implementation. Equity will be assessed according by examining differences in the effectiveness of the intervention according to socioeconomic sub-groups. Within the trial, different health system factors, or âconstraintsâ, may hinder access, utilisation or service provision and affect the cost-effectiveness of the COPD Action Plan. Examples of constraints include: access to drugs for the management of exacerbations and access to emergency care for severe complications, which work through factors such as health insurance coverage or distance to health facilities. We will also identify constraints through the implementation science outcomes related to acceptability and feasibility. For this reason, the second part of this work will explore how constraints interact with the value of the COPD Action Plan, in the health system in each setting.</p>

The risk of administration of short-term corticosteroids is minimal and patients with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis undergoing treatment will be excluded. The largest risk with antibiotics is drug reaction, though antibiotic resistance due to overuse is an additional risk. Participants who experience a drug reaction will be instructed to discontinue the medication and contact the local study investigator. Based on the severity of reaction, they will be referred to the local health centre.
