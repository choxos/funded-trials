                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>On average women retain 5 to 9 kg 1 year after giving birth which can increase the risk of later obesity and chronic diseases. Some previous trials in this population have been effective in reducing weight, but are too intensive and costly to deliver at scale. There is a need for low-cost interventions to facilitate weight loss in this population.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The primary aim is to assess the feasibility of delivering a weight management intervention for overweight/obese postnatal women within child immunisation appointments. We will conduct a randomised controlled cluster feasibility trial with a nested qualitative study to assess study recruitment and acceptability of the intervention. General
practitioner practice (cluster) will be the unit of randomisation, with practices randomised to offer usual care plus the intervention or usual care only. Eighty women will be recruited. The intervention group will be offered brief support that encourages self-management of weight when attending child immunisation appointments. Practice nurses will encourage women to weigh themselves weekly and record this, and to make healthy lifestyle choices through using an online weight management programme. Women will be advised to aim for 0.5 to 1 kg/week weight loss. At each child immunisation the nurse will assess progress by weighing women. The comparator group will receive a healthy lifestyle leaflet. Data on weight, body fat, depression, anxiety, body image, eating behaviours and physical activity will be collected at baseline and follow-up. Women and nurses will be interviewed to ascertain their views about the intervention. The decision to proceed to the phase III trial will be based on prespecified stop-go criteria.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Data will be stored securely at the University of Birmingham. Results will be disseminated through academic publications and presentations and will inform a possible phase III trial. The National Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol.</p>

              <p>Pregnancy is associated with significant weight gain and many women report pregnancy as the critical point for the onset of excess weight.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The postnatal period is characterised not only by weight retention, but also susceptibility to further weight gain, which can significantly increase the risk of later obesity and serious chronic diseases.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> There is also an association between postnatal weight retention and poor mental health.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> It is estimated that on average women gain about 14 to 15 kg during pregnancy and at 1 year after birth 5 to 9 kg is retained.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3 9 10</xref> Of women who are overweight prior to conception, 44% are living with obesity by 1 year after giving birth, while 97% of women who are living with obesity prior to pregnancy remain so at 1 year postnatally.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, there is a need to intervene routinely in the postnatal period, to help women manage their weight after having a baby and minimise long-term health risks.</p>
              <p>Several systematic reviews have identified the need for high quality trials on how to best help women to lose weight after having a baby.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–16</xref> Within these reviews, the vast majority of studies have recruited small sample sizes and evaluated intensive physical activity and/or dietary interventions delivered by specialists; while these types of interventions can be effective, they cannot be delivered to all the women who give birth each year in the UK, of whom nearly two-thirds will be living with overweight.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A recent systematic review of reviews of lifestyle interventions for postnatal weight management highlighted the lack of studies that have tested an intervention embedded within routine healthcare.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

                <title>Self-management strategies and weight loss</title>
                <p>A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effectiveness of self-help interventions for weight loss,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> has shown that self-help interventions can lead to small, but significantly greater weight loss than unsupported attempts to lose weight at 6 months compared with minimal interventions. In the small group of studies providing data at 12 months, weight loss was no longer significant, suggesting that self-help interventions on their own may not be useful for sustaining long-term weight loss, and that additional components, within weight loss interventions are required. Nonetheless, given the potential scalability and relatively low cost of this type of intervention, self-help programmes may be a useful component within a broader intervention to treat those who are overweight.</p>
                <p>Self-monitoring of weight by regular weighing is common to many self-management interventions. The potential efficacy of regular weighing is based on the principles of self-regulation theory.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Self-regulation theory describes three distinct stages; self-monitoring, self-evaluation and self-reinforcement. Self-monitoring is a method of systematic self-observation, periodical measurement and recording of target behaviours with the goal of increasing self-awareness. The awareness fostered during self-monitoring is an essential initial step in promoting and sustaining behaviour change. Strong evidence supports the role of self-monitoring as an effective strategy in the health behaviour change process. Reviews by Michie <italic>et al</italic> of effective behavioural techniques for healthy eating, physical activity and reduction of alcohol consumption concluded that self-monitoring was effective alone, but when combined with other techniques the effect size nearly doubled.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> In a systematic review of RCTs to examine the effectiveness of self-weighing as a strategy for weight loss, multi-component interventions including self-weighing compared with no/minimal control also resulted in mean differences of −3.7 kg (95% CI −4.6 to −2.9).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

                <title>Accountability/audit and feedback</title>
                <p>There has been some evidence to suggest that adding accountability to a self-weighing programme increases weight loss.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a review by Madigan <italic>et al</italic>, in 13 of the included trials, the intervention group asked to weigh themselves knew that they were accountable to a therapist/researcher, while this was not the case in two trials. There was a significant difference in mean weight loss between intervention and control for those trials with accountability compared with those without (−4.0 kg, 95% CI −5.0 to −3.0 kg vs −2.3 kg, 95% CI −3.1 to −1.5 kg; p=0.007).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Participants in group weight loss programmes often report that it is the weekly weigh-in that is the most salient component of the programme, providing external accountability and keeping them committed to their diet and physical activity plan.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Based on this evidence, it can be hypothesised that including accountability/audit to self-help and self-monitoring interventions could further facilitate weight loss.</p>

                <title>Internet-based weight management interventions</title>
                <p>The widespread use of technology has led to an interest in digital health interventions, including for weight management. Systematic reviews of eHealth or web-based interventions for weight loss and/or maintenance in adults have found that these interventions can result in modest weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> One such digital interventions is the POWeR (Positive Online Weight Reduction) online weight management programme.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The POWeR programme was designed for use with minimal additional support and was developed with extensive user feedback; the development process and content of the POWeR intervention is described elsewhere.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> The POWeR programme has been shown to result in significant weight loss at 12 months in primary care patients with overweight when combined with brief nurse support.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It focusses principally on fostering users’ self-regulation skills for autonomously self-managing their weight, rather than providing detailed dietetic advice. A recent systematic review concluded that internet-based weight management interventions for postnatal mothers appear to be beneficial, and survey study results have reported that irrespective of age or socioeconomic status, 90.5% of new mothers use the internet as a source of information with weight loss as the fourth most searched topic.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–31</xref> Therefore, based on this evidence it may be hypothesised that including an online intervention may be beneficial for postnatal weight loss.</p>

                <title>Study rationale</title>
                <p>There is a need to support women to lose excess weight in the postnatal period. Given the large numbers of women who give birth each year either with pre-existing overweight or obesity, or who gain excess weight during this period, an intervention is needed that can be delivered at scale without significant implications for a healthcare workforce. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has highlighted the low quality of previous research as a limitation to developing clinical guidance in this area.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Here we investigate the feasibility of a postnatal weight management intervention embedded within pre-existing healthcare contacts. This pragmatic intervention is based on existing evidence for the effectiveness of both self-monitoring and an online programme for weight management (POWeR).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 27</xref>

                <p>This is a feasibility trial therefore a formal sample size calculation has not been conducted. The trial is not designed or powered to detect a statistically significant difference in effectiveness between the two treatment groups.</p>
                <p>We will recruit 10 to 12 GP practices (clusters) across Birmingham, UK, and the list of participating practices will be held by Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU). We will then aim to recruit 80 participants from these GP practices over 8 months. Potentially eligible participants will be identified initially from medical records at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS Foundation Trust (BWCH). Initial screening of medical records by BWCH will confirm the women is aged ≥18 years, has given birth at least 4 weeks previously and is registered at a participating GP practice. We will exclude mothers whose babies have died or have been removed from their care.</p>
                <p>A trial invitation letter and participant information sheet (PIS) will be mailed to potentially eligible women by BWCH, which includes a telephone number to call or a reply slip to return if they are interested in participating. Interested women will undergo telephone screening for eligibility.

In the first year, babies are routinely immunised at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months of age; we plan to embed the intervention within these pre-existing immunisation contacts. The intervention group will be offered brief support that encourages active self-management of weight in the postnatal period when they attend their practice to have their child immunised during the first year of life. The intervention involves motivation and support by nurses to encourage women in the postnatal period to make healthier lifestyle choices through self-monitoring of weight and signposting to an online weight management programme (POWeR).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

                <p>Outcome data will be collected at baseline and 3 months follow-up (except height (baseline only)). While this feasibility trial will not be powered to detect meaningful differences in outcome measures, it will give us the opportunity to ensure that there are no issues with the completion of these measures in a main trial. Height and weight will be measured at baseline to calculate BMI. Weight and percentage body fat will be assessed using a Tanita SC-240MA analyser using a standardised procedure (eg, light clothing). Demographic (eg, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status), lifestyle and pregnancy related information (eg, history of pregnancy related problems, mode of delivery), infant feeding practices and maternal sleeping patterns will be collected. Anxiety and depression will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, body image using the Body Image State Scale, eating habits using the three-factor eating questionnaire and self-reported physical activity will be measured using the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38–41</xref>

                <p>At follow-up, self-weighing will be assessed using the Daily Self-Weighing Perceptions Questionnaire and weight control strategies using the Weight Control Strategies Scale.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> We will also record whether the usual care group have accessed the POWeR website to assess any intervention contamination. To inform the design of the economic evaluation in the phase III trial, we will explore the acceptability of the ICECAP instrument,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> a broader measure of health than the EQ-5D<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> that focusses on general well-being.

                <p>In addition, to check that the intervention has no adverse impact on infant immunisation rates, the proportion of babies who attended all three immunisation appointments will be reported for each practice (both groups) and the rate compared with the normal immunisation rate for the practice. Reasons for missed appointments will be summarised descriptively. Recruitment, adherence and immunisation rates will be summarised as proportions with 95% CIs.</p>

                <p>For the phase III trial to take place there needs to be evidence from this feasibility trial of meeting prespecified stop-go rules. The trial is too small to include meaningful and sensitive stop-go criteria regarding the impact of the intervention on immunisation rates. However, we will check that the intervention has not adversely affected usual immunisation rates at each GP practice (as described above). The criteria to proceed to the phase III trial will be based on three criteria: recruitment rate, adherence to weekly self-weighing and registration with the online weight loss programme (POWeR) using the traffic light system shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP4">online supplementary table 3</xref>.</p>

              <p>The postnatal period is characterised not only by weight retention, but also by susceptibility to further weight gain. Most trials in this population include small sample sizes and/or evaluated intensive weight loss interventions. These types of interventions cannot be offered to all women who give birth in the UK every year. This study will generate evidence as to whether a full phase III trial to test the effectiveness of this novel postnatal weight management intervention embedded within existing primary care contacts is feasible. Currently there is no national guidance for health professionals regarding postnatal weight management and the full trial testing the effectiveness of this intervention would have the potential to influence policy and future national guidelines.</p>
