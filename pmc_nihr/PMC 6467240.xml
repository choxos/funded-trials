                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a clinically important complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a prognostic marker in PAH, has been associated with muscle loss in other conditions. We aimed to define the associations of GDF-15 and muscle wasting in PAH, to assess its utility as a biomarker of muscle loss and to investigate its downstream signalling pathway as a therapeutic target.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>GDF-15 levels and measures of muscle size and strength were analysed in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat, Sugen/hypoxia mouse and in 30 patients with PAH. In C2C12 myotubes the downstream targets of GDF-15 were identified. The pathway elucidated was then antagonised in vivo.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Circulating GDF-15 levels correlated with tibialis anterior (TA) muscle fibre diameter in the MCT rat (Pearson r=−0.61, p=0.003). In patients with PAH, plasma GDF-15 levels of &lt;564 pg/L predicted those with preserved muscle strength with a sensitivity and specificity of ≥80%. In vitro GDF-15 stimulated an increase in phosphorylation of TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Antagonising TAK1, with 5(Z)-7-oxozeaenol, in vitro and in vivo led to an increase in fibre diameter and a reduction in mRNA expression of atrogin-1 in both C2C12 cells and in the TA of animals who continued to grow. Circulating GDF-15 levels were also reduced in those animals which responded to treatment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Circulating GDF-15 is a biomarker of muscle loss in PAH that is responsive to treatment. TAK1 inhibition shows promise as a method by which muscle atrophy may be directly prevented in PAH.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Even with the emergence of modern pulmonary vasodilators the morbidity and mortality for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains high.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Skeletal muscle dysfunction is as an important complication and target for therapeutic intervention in patients with PAH.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Despite the effects of rehabilitation,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> there remains a rationale for developing anabolic agents<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> which might improve patients’ outcomes.</p>
              <p>Muscle strength and size is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and breakdown.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the quadriceps of patients with PAH there is an upregulation of the proatrophic ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and Muscle RING finger protein-1 (MuRF1), while prohypertrophic protein kinase B (AKT),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> a component of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> is downregulated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The monocrotaline (MCT) rat, a model of PAH, has smaller hindlimb muscle fibre cross sectional area (CSA), a reduction in contractile function and a tendency to overexpress atrogin-1 and MuRF1, when compared with control treated animals.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>
</p>
              <p>The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) proteins have been implicated in the development of both PAH and muscle wasting.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> One TGFβ protein, growth/differentiation factor (GDF-15) has been shown to be a prognostic marker in idiopathic (I)PAH.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> GDF-15 has also been associated with muscle wasting in intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW), COPD and cancer.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> GDF-15 has been shown to suppresses appetite,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> via its recently discovered receptor the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor-alpha-like (GFRAL)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> as well as directly affecting muscle by increasing the local expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF1.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> The downstream signalling pathway through which GDF-15 acts in muscle remains to be elucidated,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> although one potential target is the TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Delineating and then targeting the pathways through which GDF-15 acts in muscle is a potential method to prevent or treat muscle wasting in PAH as well as other conditions where GDF-15 is a marker of prognosis.</p>
              <p>We therefore aimed to determine the local and systemic expression profiles of GDF-15 in animal models of PAH, to investigate the association of GDF-15 and muscle wasting in patients with PAH and to explore the mechanism of action of GDF-15 with a view to developing a therapeutic intervention.</p>

MCT rats weighed, grew and ate less than controls. Although both the MCT rat TA and soleus exhibited muscle loss only the TA and not the soleus atrophy index (muscle weight/total weight) was reduced (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure E3</xref>). Further investigation was, therefore, limited to the TA. TA size, by MRI and fibre diameter, was lower in the MCT rats compared with controls (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure E4</xref>). Sugen/hypoxia treated mice also had smaller TAs and TA muscle fibres than hypoxia or control treated animals (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure E5</xref>).</p>

                <p>In C2C12 myotubes, GDF-15 treatment induced a significant increase in phosphorylation of both TAK1 and its target NFκB, it reduced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and did not affect AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A–H</xref>). GDF-15 mediated NFκB phosphorylation was inhibited by the selective TAK1 inhibitor 5(Z)-7-oxozeaenol at a concentration of 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A,B</xref>). This inhibitor was also able to reverse the atrophic effects of GDF-15 on myotube diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5C-D</xref>) as well as prevent increases in mRNA expression of atrogin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5E</xref>). The addition of MG-132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, to myotubes also prevented GDF-15 mediated reductions in myotube diameter, suggesting that GDF-15 has direct proteolytic effects on muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5F,G</xref>). The effects of GDF-15 at 5 ng/mL on phosphorylation of TAK1 and NFκB and myotube diameter were similar to those seen with 50 ng/mL (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure E8</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have shown that GDF-15 levels may be a useful biomarker that is responsive to treatment aimed at preventing muscle loss in PAH. Our data also implicate proteolytic pathways including TAK1-NFκB and atrogin-1 in GDF-15 meditated muscle wasting, a process that can be at least partially reversed by the TAK1 inhibitor 5(Z)-7-oxozeanol.</p>
              <p>The role of TGFβ proteins in muscle wasting in PAH has not been widely analysed, being limited to one study showing increased circulating myostatin in MCT-treated rats.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We have identified, as is the case in ICUAW,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> COPD<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and cancer,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> that PAH-associated muscle loss may also be a GDF-15 driven phenomenon.</p>
              <p>Studies in ICUAW have supported a potential autocrine or paracrine effect of GDF-15 on muscle mass.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A GDF-15 antibody has been shown to be able to prevent the muscle loss seen in mice xenografted with human tumours which secreted GDF-15 confirming its endocrine effects.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Our data also suggest that GDF-15 mediates muscle loss in an endocrine manner, with the pulmonary vascular endothelium and plexiform lesions<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> acting as the potential source of raised circulating GDF-15 levels.</p>
              <p>We have previously shown that GDF-15 can cause an increase in the expression of the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 in myotubes in culture.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our study adds weight to the argument that GDF-15 causes muscle loss through proteolysis and not through inhibition of the prohypertrophic IGF-1-AKT pathway. It also seems that the TAK1 pathway may play a pivotal role in the muscle wasting process stimulated by GDF-15 and its inhibition rescues GDF-15 mediated atrophy in cells through a reduction in atrogin-1 mRNA.</p>
              <p>GDF-15 has previously been shown to signal through TAK1 and NFκB in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infected epithelial cells,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> but not previously in muscle cells. TAK1 is a key intermediate in a number of signalling pathways that drive muscle wasting including myostatin and tumour necrosis factor α.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 32</xref> Clinical trials of drugs targeted at the muscle aiming to block these factors individually have met with limited success.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> 5(Z)-7-oxozeanol has been used to antagonise TAK1 in a number of animal models of disease including autoimmune diabetes<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and cerebral ischaemia.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> TAK1 inhibitors may be more successful than other more specific drugs aimed at antagonising muscle loss, as they have the potential to inhibit these synergistic muscle wasting pathways.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p>
              <p>Recent data suggest that TAK1 knockout in satellite stem cells prevents regeneration after acute muscle injury resulting in a significant reduction in muscle mass both in vivo and in vitro.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Our data suggest that rather than inhibiting growth TAK1 inhibition results in an increase in muscle size in the MCT rat. This may be due to the small doses of 5(Z)-7-oxozeaonal used, which might result in a reduction but not abolition of TAK1 signalling. It is also likely that it reflects differences in the activity of TAK1 on satellite cells and mature myofibres and the predominant processes leading to loss of muscle in the various models. For example, inhibiting satellite cell proliferation/differentiation is likely to have a large effect on muscle mass in a model of regeneration in response to injury but less effect on a model of atrophy.</p>
              <p>An ideal biomarker should be specific, easily detectable, obtained relatively non-invasively, related to disease severity and disease progression, including response to treatment, and be measurable in a standardised way.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> We have shown that in MCT-related muscle loss, GDF-15 is able to fulfil all these criteria. GDF-15 has been identified as a biomarker and potential regulator of muscle wasting in a number of conditions<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref> and PAH is no different. It is now important to test whether patients who gain muscle mass in PAH have a GDF-15 profile similar to the MCT rats who responded most significantly to 5(Z)-7-oxozeaenol treatment.</p>
              <p>Johnen <italic>et al</italic> reported that GDF-15 can reduce muscle mass by suppressing appetite.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Consistent with this, MCT-treated animals in our study ate significantly less than their control counterparts. However, TAK1 inhibition had no discernible effect on food intake in the MCT rat while it did affect muscle mass. This, along with in vitro data, suggests that TAK1, a downstream mediator of GDF-15, has a direct proatrophic effect on skeletal muscle that is independent of its role as an appetite suppressant. This is supported by data in ICUAW, where, circulating GDF-15 levels were associated with muscle loss, despite that patients being fed by nasogastric tube<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and the fact that the GFRAL receptor through which GDF-15 controls appetite<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> is not present in the skeletal muscle.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Overall, it seems most likely that GDF-15 affects muscle mass both directly and also through appetite suppression; however, in both cases inhibiting GDF-15 activity is likely to reduce muscle wasting.</p>
              <p>Our data have potential implications outside PAH. GDF-15 has been repeatedly identified as a marker of mortality in a wide range of health and disease.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Sarcopenia and cachexia are also almost universally associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality across disease states.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Our data add more evidence suggesting that GDF-15 and its downstream signalling molecule TAK1 may be a potential target for future therapeutic intervention aimed at improving muscle mass, exercise tolerance, quality of life and possibly even mortality across a wide range of conditions.</p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>There was wide variation in the induction of PH in the animal studies, which when combined with the relatively low number of samples studied and the requirement to analyse specific time points, may have contributed to the absence of statistical significance for some of the observations. Alternative sources of GDF-15 production outside the lung and muscle contributing to the systemic levels of the protein have not been excluded. This is especially true of experiments involving the systemic toxin MCT. The majority of the western blots were performed on film, where the relationship between band density and protein content is not linear. The clinical study is cross sectional, was conducted in a single, heterogeneous population, the ROC curve is unvalidated and the animal model studies are associative, which can only suggest, but not prove, a causal link between GDF-15 and muscle loss in PAH. Finally, the relative contributions of appetite, high levels of GDF-15 and low physical activity to muscle loss in PAH have not been defined and remain speculative. In particular, in those with very low functional capacity, inactivity is likely to be a marked contributor to muscle loss. Future work showing that a reduction in GDF-15 levels is associated with improved muscle mass as well as functional outcomes would add weight to our argument.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>GDF-15 has been shown to be a candidate ‘ideal’ biomarker of muscle and weight loss in PAH. The lung tissue was shown to be a potential source of circulating GDF-15. GDF-15’s effects on muscle in vitro appear to be mediated by proteolysis and the activation of TAK1 since inhibition of both the 26S ribosomal protein unit and the kinase, by a specific inhibitor, suppressed GDF-15-induced myotube atrophy, making TAK1 inhibition an attractive target to prevent muscle loss in PAH. This study also has wider implications for the investigation and management of muscle loss across the spectrum of human disease, where GDF-15 may be important.</p>
