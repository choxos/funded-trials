                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">High salt intake is a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Reducing salt intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure. Despite population-level interventions, including product reformulation and public awareness campaigns, adult salt consumption in the UK still exceeds recommendations; this is primarily due to salt consumed in processed and pre-packaged foods. Moderate or high-intensity dietary advice to encourage individuals to reduce their salt intake has been shown to be effective at reducing blood pressure, but evidence of the effectiveness of interventions that are suitable for delivery at scale in routine primary care is scarce. This feasibility trial investigates a complex behavioural change intervention to reduce dietary salt intake and blood pressure by encouraging individuals to purchase lower-salt foods when grocery shopping.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This randomised controlled trial will test the feasibility of a novel intervention to reduce salt intake, and the trial procedures to assess its effectiveness. We will recruit participants through UK general practices and randomise 40 participants with high blood pressure, in a 2:1 allocation to receive either the Salt Swap intervention or a control information leaflet. The primary outcomes relate to the criteria for progression to a large-scale trial. These include follow-up rates at 6 weeks, fidelity of intervention delivery and use of the intervention mobile app. Secondary outcomes include the effect of the intervention on the salt content of purchased foods (grams per 100 g), urinary sodium excretion assessed through 24-hour urine samples and blood pressure. Trial process measures will be collected and qualitative assessment will provide insights into participant engagement with the intervention content and perceived barriers to and facilitators of salt reduction dietary behavioural change.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">If the outcomes indicate the trial is feasible and there is evidence that behavioural change may result in salt reduction, we will proceed to a definitive trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention to lower blood pressure. If successful, this intervention approach could be applied not only to people with high blood pressure, but also to the wider population with normal blood pressure in whom dietary salt intake exceeds recommendations.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature mortality globally and a significant contributor to preventable morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hypertension is one of the most significant risk factors for CVD, and a key contributor to the global burden of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. At least one quarter of adults in the UK (and more than half of those older than 60 years) have hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is a positive association between blood pressure and dietary salt intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], both in individuals with hypertension and also in those with normal blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite UK government recommendations for adults to reduce dietary salt intake to &lt; 6 g/day, intake remains high at an average of 8.1 g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with around three quarters of this derived from packaged or processed foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Overall, 70% of the adult population are estimated to have salt intake &gt; 6 g/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">Clinical trials have proven that dietary interventions with intensive support to reduce salt intake, sometimes involving the provision of low-salt foods, can significantly reduce systolic blood pressure, by up to 7 mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, systematic reviews have demonstrated that advice-based interventions such as nutritional counselling or tailored education can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but the effectiveness of these interventions depends largely on intensity. Interventions most likely to be effective are those including moderate-to-high-intensity advice, involving multiple one-to-one or group counselling sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The challenge is that such interventions are not feasible to deliver at scale by non-specialist staff without a significant expansion in the workforce and training. At present any dietary advice in routine primary care usually consists of non-tailored information to help patients maintain a low-salt diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is a wide range of salt content in foods within and between product categories, and it is difficult for non-specialists to provide accurate and personalised advice to help individuals achieve a low-salt diet.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Brief behavioural interventions have been used successfully in primary care to encourage smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and reductions in alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions for dietary change is limited. A recent pilot study of a low-intensity dietary counselling intervention to reduce blood cholesterol demonstrated a significant beneficial short-term effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], indicating potential for a brief-intervention approach. However, a study of a brief intervention to reduce blood pressure, covering a range of strategies including diet, showed no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and there is currently no established brief intervention known to be effective to reduce salt intake.</p>
              <p id="Par26">One approach to magnify the effectiveness of advice-based interventions for dietary change is to use technology to deliver personalised advice at the point at which individuals make a choice about the food and drink they buy or consume. Studies using digital tools such as smartphone applications (apps) as a standalone intervention to reduce salt intake indicate their potential effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">This study investigates the feasibility of a trial examining a complex, behaviour change intervention to reduce salt intake, combining brief advice delivered by non-specialist health practitioners in primary care with use of an app to guide food-purchasing decisions. It aims to motivate and support individuals with high blood pressure to reduce their salt intake by swapping to lower-salt products when grocery shopping. A definitive trial to show whether this intervention is effective at lowering salt intake and blood pressure would need to be large and would be expensive. Before this is justified, we need to ensure that people engage with the intervention, that it can reduce salt intake in the short term and that the research methods run as expected.</p>

The practice will send potential participants an invitation letter asking them to contact the research team if they are interested in participating; the letter will also include a link to an electronic version of the participant information sheet. GPs may also identify eligible patients opportunistically during routine consultations or via the National Health Service (NHS) Health Check programme. We will aim to randomise 40 participants in the study.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par58">This study investigates the Salt Swap intervention, which aims to help people swap to lower-salt alternatives for everyday foods when grocery shopping. The intervention development was informed by two established behaviour change frameworks, the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These theoretical frameworks were used to identify the key determinants of behaviour, particularly the aspects of capability, opportunity and motivation, that need to be influenced in order to support people to reduce purchases of high-salt foods and drinks. The intervention development is described elsewhere.</p>
                  <p id="Par59">The intervention incorporates motivation and education, problem solving, goal setting and action planning. It comprises two main components: brief advice provided by a healthcare professional (HCP) at the GP practice and instructions to use the Salt Swap app. Healthcare professionals, typically practice nurses or healthcare assistants, will be trained by one face-to-face training session with a researcher and by video-based training materials. The content of the 20-min one-to-one advice session is based on best practice guidance and information by expert sources including NHS Choices and the British Heart Foundation (BHF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is supported by the Salt Swap booklet given to participants during the intervention visit.</p>
                  <p id="Par60">This advice incorporates information on:

                  <p id="Par69">In addition, during this session participants are encouraged to download a novel mobile phone app, Salt Swap, which delivers tailored, salient information on the salt content of products. Users scan a product barcode to receive nutritional information, presented using the traffic light labelling system recommend for use in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and are shown suggested lower-salt alternatives. The app contains a database of food and drinks available in UK supermarkets and their nutritional composition. The app allows users to set goals for salt reduction and to receive feedback on the achievement of these goals and the salt reduction achieved through swapping to lower-salt products (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All other clinical care will continue as usual.

A researcher will assess eligibility based on the full inclusion and exclusion criteria, verbally provide information as described in the participant information sheet and answer any questions about participation in the study. Those who are eligible will be booked into an initial face-to-face baseline study visit at their GP practice. When the participant attends the baseline visit, the researcher will provide verbal and written information about the trial and seek informed consent (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for the schedule of procedures). Having had a chance to ask questions, those individuals willing to participate will give written informed consent by means of a participant-dated signature. The consent form will also be dated and signed by the researcher who presented and obtained the informed consent.

                  <p id="Par73">The baseline assessment will be undertaken at the initial baseline visit following informed consent. The researcher will collect clinical measures of height (metres), weight (kilograms), and blood pressure (seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured after 5 min rest and using the mean of the second and third of three readings taken 1 min apart using a validated digital automatic blood pressure monitor, the OMRON M10-IT). The researcher will also record demographic information, relevant medication history and medications (verified through the patient’s electronic clinical record) and details of the participant’s shopping behaviour including the frequency of shopping, the number of people for whom they are shopping, the types of stores or settings most commonly visited for groceries and key influences on purchasing decisions (using an investigator-designed questionnaire).</p>
                  <p id="Par74">At the end of the baseline visit participants will be instructed on how to use a mobile phone app to record their grocery shopping throughout the study. The app, called ShopScanner, is linked to a food and nutrient information database to enable recording of the nutrient content of purchased foods.

During this visit, a researcher will measure blood pressure and document any changes to relevant medical history or medications. Participants will be asked to complete an investigator-designed questionnaire to assess aspects of the intervention (or control leaflet) they received.</p>
                  <p id="Par79">The follow-up questionnaire will collect data on changes in knowledge about dietary salt intake, awareness of salt intake and dietary-salt-related behaviours. Separate questions for each group will assess how helpful the Salt Swap intervention (advice session and Salt Swap app) or control leaflet were (1–5 scale from very unhelpful to very helpful) as well as the specific reasons why it was considered helpful or unhelpful (for the Salt Swap intervention only). The intervention group questionnaire will also collect data on app acceptability (“would you be interested in using a free app like the Salt Swap app if it was publically available in future?”) and frequency of use (always, most of the time, occasionally, never). Both groups will be asked if any other forms of support (e.g. apps, tools, advice or contact with health professionals) were used throughout the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">Participants will be asked to submit their grocery shopping receipts for the past 6 weeks and to provide a second 24-hour urine sample at this appointment or within a week of their follow-up visit. The research team will be responsible for arranging follow-up visits.

The analysis will test the change in salt content of food purchases from baseline over the 6-week follow-up, using linear mixed-effects regression models to account for repeat observations. Effectiveness analysis will be based on data from all participants for whom both a baseline and a follow-up measure is available.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par124">This study will determine the feasibility of a novel, brief intervention to reduce salt intake, and of the trial design and methods to collect outcome measures. The growth of smartphone (and app) use provides an opportunity to develop behaviour change interventions that can reach large numbers of the population. There is an increasing body of evidence that interventions using apps to change dietary behaviour can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, interventions encouraging people to swap to healthier products while grocery shopping in-store or online have also been shown to have potential for changing purchasing behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This study will add to the evidence base in this area by providing feedback on the acceptability of and engagement with interventions of this nature. It will address an important gap in the literature on how to provide interventions at scale to support people with high blood pressure to reduce their salt intake.</p>
              <p id="Par125">In the field of behaviour change, researchers are increasingly encouraged to report the evaluation of behaviour change interventions using established taxonomies and ontologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The outcomes included in this trial will show whether participants engage with the intervention as a whole and help us to understand their engagement with the specific behaviour change techniques incorporated within it. The think-aloud grocery shopping sessions and interviews with participants will provide real-world observations on the usability of the intervention. Furthermore, the qualitative and quantitative feedback from healthcare professions will enable us to assess the feasibility of delivering the intervention as part of routine care in primary care. A further strength of the study is the inclusion of clinical outcomes measures, which would be used in a future trial to evaluate clinical effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par126">This study utilises a novel method for collection of grocery shopping data, in addition to the more standard method of collecting till receipts. This has the potential for more efficient and robust assessment of nutrient outcomes, and the trial will provide valuable evidence on the feasibility of this method.</p>
              <p id="Par127">The study is limited in its ability to assess the study outcomes among a diverse range of individuals, due to the small sample size and regional recruitment area. Similarly, the small sample size limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The single follow-up assessment at 6 weeks is appropriate for a feasibility-stage trial but a future large-scale trial would include a longer-term follow-up in order to measure sustained effects on behaviour change and the impact on blood pressure. However, if the outcomes indicate the trial is feasible, and there is potential evidence of behavioural change, this study will provide valuable data to inform power calculations for a future trial on the effectiveness in reducing salt intake and lowering blood pressure in a broader study population.</p>
              <p id="Par128">If successful, this intervention approach could be applied not only to people with high blood pressure but also to the wider population with normal blood pressure in whom dietary salt intake exceeds recommendations.</p>
