                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Adolescent girls are less physically active than recommended for health, and levels decline further as they approach adulthood. Peers can influence adolescent girls’ physical activity. Interventions capitalising on peer support could positively impact physical activity behaviour in this group. Building on promising feasibility work, the purpose of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to assess whether the Peer-Led physical Activity iNtervention for Adolescent girls (PLAN-A) increases adolescent girls’ physical activity and is cost effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PLAN-A is a two-arm secondary school-based cluster randomised controlled trial, conducted with girls aged 13–14 years from twenty schools in the south west of England. The intervention requires participants to nominate influential girls within their year group to become peer supporters. The top 15% of girls nominated in each school receive three days of training designed to prepare them to support their peers to be more physically active during a ten-week intervention period. Data will be collected at two time points, at baseline (T0) and 5–6 months post-intervention (T1). Schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 10) arm after T0. At each time point, all consenting participants will wear an accelerometer for seven days to assess the primary outcome of mean weekday minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Multivariable mixed effects linear regression will be used to estimate differences in the primary outcome between the two arms and will be examined on an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) basis. A self-report psychosocial questionnaire will be completed by participants to assess self-esteem and physical activity motivation. Resource use and quality of life will be measured for the purposes of an economic evaluation. A mixed-methods process evaluation will be conducted to explore intervention fidelity, acceptability and sustainability. Analysis of quantitative process evaluation data will be descriptive, and the framework method will be used to analyse qualitative data.</p>

              <p id="Par20">Among adolescents, physical activity is associated with reduced risk of obesity and improved fitness, muscle and bone strength and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] report that large proportions of adolescents do not meet the Chief Medical Officer’s recommendation of an hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day. Physical activity levels can decrease by as much as 7% per year throughout adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] with the decline starting sooner and becoming steeper for girls than for boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, there is a clear need to increase physical activity among adolescent girls.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Promoting young people’s health in schools is a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and systematic reviews have looked at the effectiveness of school-based physical activity interventions on levels of MVPA and its impact on health indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of 17 school-based physical activity interventions for girls indicated they only had a small positive effect. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar results have been found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Many of these multi-component interventions focussed on top-down strategies, and existing reviews encourage researchers to explore novel approaches to increase physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Factors influencing girls’ physical activity levels and participation include psychological correlates such as perceived competence, self-efficacy motivation, attitude and enjoyment of physical activity, as well as external factors such as competing priorities, friendship group changes, ‘sporty’ stereotypes, and family and peer support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Peers play a pivotal role in adolescents’ physical activity through social support, peer presence, peer norms, the quality of friendships, peer affiliation and peer victimisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Evidence also suggests that adolescents socialise in groups with similar physical activity levels and, over time, their physical activity behaviours reflect those of their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Peer-based interventions could be an effective means of helping adolescents become more physically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Several peer-based interventions have aimed to increase physical activity among adolescents. A large randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], in which older pupils mentored younger, same sex pupils using a booklet addressing barriers to physical activity and setting activity goals in weekly meetings, found no evidence of an impact on MVPA. A pilot, reward-based intervention involving the combination of older and same age peers to encourage others to try new activities, resulted in a 5.1 (95% CI = 1.1–9.2) minute difference in objectively assessed MVPA in favour of the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">The peer-led health intervention ASSIST (A Stop Smoking In Schools Trial) was successful in reducing the odds of 12–13 year olds being a smoker up to 2 years post intervention by 22% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ASSIST utilised Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which suggests that social influencers amongst a group of individuals can act as change agents, using their capacity to influence change in social norms, which in turn can lead to changes in behaviour. Pupils in ASSIST were asked to nominate influential students in their year group to become ‘peer supporters’ and hold informal conversations with their peers about the risks of smoking and the benefits of being smoke-free. The process evaluation revealed that asking peer supporters to work informally, rather than under the supervision of teaching staff, meant they took the responsibility seriously and were more effective at passing on messages about not smoking to their peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">The approach taken in ASSIST has been adopted in PLAN-A (Peer-Led physical Activity iNtervention for Adolescent girls), which has a theoretical underpinning using DOI together with Self-determination Theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Within SDT, positive and sustained behaviour change and well-being is likely if motivation for physical activity is based on authentic choice and personal value, supported by an environment that fosters an individuals’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. SDT is well suited to a peer-based intervention because peers can create a social climate that can undermine or facilitate girls’ interest in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Previous research has shown that interventions which have a theoretical underpinning are more likely to be effective in changing adolescent girls’ physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], however, few have been theory-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In contrast, numerous elements of the PLAN-A intervention, including the design, delivery and content were informed by DOI and SDT.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The PLAN-A intervention has been developed as a novel approach to increase adolescent girls’ physical activity by capitalising on the power of peer influence by promoting peer support and enhancing communication between peers. It addresses barriers to girls’ physical activity participation, seeks to create new peer-norms for physical activity whilst building on previous successful, sustainable peer-led interventions.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par43">The PLAN-A feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] found a between-arm difference in mean weekday MVPA of 6.1 min with 95% confidence intervals between 1.4 to 10.8 min, suggesting that a target between-arm difference of 10 min of MVPA per weekday is achievable. Recognising that even smaller intervention effects on MVPA may also lead to meaningful differences in health at a population level, the sample size necessary to detect a range of differences in weekday MVPA (i.e., 10, 8 &amp; 6 min) were calculated. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the power calculations where the following parameters are fixed: cluster size = 70 (informed by feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]), intra class correlation (ICC) on weekday MVPA = 0.01 (informed by the feasibility study; T0 = &lt;.0, T1 = .02, T2 = &lt;.0001 and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), MVPA standard deviation = 20 min (based on feasibility study), coefficient of variation in cluster size of 0.22, 5% two-sided alpha and inflation to account for 30% of participants not providing primary outcome data. 12 schools and 800 pupils are required to detect a 10-min difference in MVPA with 90% power, however 20 schools and 1400 pupils would provide 90% power to detect a smaller 6-min difference in MVPA and ample power to detect an 8-min difference. Further accounting for correlation between baseline and follow-up measures of MVPA (ρ = 0.4) slightly reduces the number of schools required (last column, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sample size parameters</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>MVPA Difference (mins)</th><th>Power</th><th>N pupils (uninflated)</th><th>N pupils (inflated)</th><th>N Schools</th><th>N Schools when allowing for correlation between baseline and follow-up</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10</td><td>90</td><td>560</td><td>800</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>80</td><td>420</td><td>600</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>90</td><td>700</td><td>1000</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>80</td><td>560</td><td>800</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>90</td><td>980</td><td>1400</td><td>20*</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>80</td><td>840</td><td>1200</td><td>18</td><td>16</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*sample size used</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

As well as being framed by DOI to capitalise on peer influence potential, training content is grounded in SDT to build the girls’ perceived autonomy, competence and social support for being a peer supporter in relation to physical activity and when supporting their peers.

                  <p id="Par56">Resource use will be collected on all aspects of intervention set-up and delivery. These include research staff, trainer, school staff and pupil time, expenses, travel, materials, venue hire costs and administration. Time burden for each component of intervention refinement and delivery will be logged by the research team, with respect to staff grade to determine cost. School staff and pupil time for peer nomination and intervention delivery will be recorded on proforma by research staff after consultation with school contacts. Intervention resources such as printed manuals, worksheets and equipment to facilitate the delivery of activities will be itemised, and the cost of hiring and transporting pupils to venues for the training will be recorded per school. Although the intervention has the potential to influence participants healthcare use long-term, we will not collect this information within the trial as we wish to minimise participant burden and do not believe the intervention is likely to influence healthcare use in the short term. Participant health-related quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D-Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and KIDSCREEN-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] questionnaires.</p>

                  <p id="Par59">Trial outcome data will be reported in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and intervention elements will be described using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The primary comparative analysis will be examined on an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) basis including all participants in randomisation without imputation for missing data. Multivariable mixed effects linear regression will be used to estimate differences in the primary outcome; objectively-assessed mean weekday minutes of MVPA, between intervention and control groups adjusting for baseline outcome score and randomisation variables. Secondary analysis will be similar and will adjust for further imbalanced variables between trial arms at baseline. Similar analyses will be repeated for secondary outcomes. A sensitivity analysis, using a suitable imputation method, will be conducted to assess the effect of missing data. <italic>P</italic>-values and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. A small number of pre-specified subgroup analyses will be carried out to evaluate whether the intervention is differentially effective/cost-effective in different subgroups, such as by school-level socioeconomic position. The trial is not powered to detect effectiveness in subgroups, and this analysis will be treated as exploratory, presented using confidence intervals and interpreted with caution. Mediation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] will look at whether any intervention effect is mediated by the SDT constructs; autonomous motivation, perceived competence and peer norms for physical activity. No secondary per-protocol analysis is planned due to the informal nature of the intervention. However, if a school fails to deliver the intervention, a per-protocol analysis will be conducted based on whether the intervention training was delivered (yes/no). An additional sensitivity analysis of the intervention effect on the primary outcome will be performed if the school context audit shows a between arm difference of new school physical activity provision.</p>
                  <p id="Par60">A public sector perspective will be taken in the economic analysis, including costs to Local Authorities and schools. To increase generalisability, national unit costs for trainer and teacher time will be used where available. Time spent by peer supporters receiving training will be reported, but the opportunity cost of pupil training and dissemination will not be included in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost per student within each school will be estimated by dividing the costs of the peer-supporter programme at that school by the total number of female students completing the primary outcome at T1. In line with the analysis of the primary outcome, imputation will be used as a sensitivity analysis. An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be determined by dividing the cost per pupil of the intervention by the difference in daily MVPA in the intervention and control arms. This will be repeated in pre-specified subgroup analysis (i.e. school level socioeconomic position). EQ-5D-Y and KIDSCREEN-10 responses will be used in secondary analyses to explore whether the intervention has any short-term impact on health-related quality of life. Currently, there is no value set for the EQ-5D-Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], so comparison between arms will be based on raw responses to each of the five items. A mapping algorithm will be used to estimate utility scores from the KIDSCREEN-10 and compare them between arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Health economics data will be reported as outlined in the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par61">If there is evidence that the intervention increases MVPA, we will explore whether existing epidemiological models can be used to extrapolate how sustained increases in MVPA might affect health outcomes and healthcare utilisation in adulthood. The identification of suitable models and a pre-specified effectiveness threshold at which extrapolation would be explored will be agreed with the Trial Steering Committee and detailed in a health economics analysis plan.</p>

                  <p id="Par62">Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be transcribed verbatim and anonymised before being coded. Thematic analysis techniques will be used to generate initial codes using NVivo 11 (QSR International Pty Ltd). These will be grouped to form themes for each stakeholder group. Data from different stakeholder groups will be triangulated using the Framework method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], resulting in a matrix in which data are described by themes and codes, allowing comparisons between and within stakeholder groups to be made. To ensure we have a thorough understanding of the different perspectives and mechanisms of impact of the intervention, transcripts will be analysed using both an inductive and deductive approach with our research questions in mind. Consistency and agreement of coding will be ensured by double coding transcripts, and new or disputed codes will be discussed. These codes will be refined to create emergent themes and a framework of agreed codes will be applied to the remaining transcripts. Qualitative data will be presented in line with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par63">This paper describes the protocol for a cluster-randomised trial of the refined PLAN-A intervention, developed as a novel approach to increasing adolescent girls’ physical activity by capitalising on the power of peer influence by promoting peer support and enhancing communication between peers. Many adolescent girls do not engage in a enough physical activity, especially within the school curriculum. Multi-component interventions have attempted to increase girls’ physical activity levels, however many of these focussed on top-down strategies which yielded little improvement. Underpinned by a combination of DOI and SDT, the PLAN-A intervention addresses barriers specific to girls’ physical activity participation, whilst building on previous successful, sustainable peer-led interventions. The goal of this study is to explore whether the PLAN-A intervention can increase adolescent girls’ (13–14 years) physical activity levels and be cost-effective from a public sector perspective.</p>
