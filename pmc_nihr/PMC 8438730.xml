                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Black-British communities are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D). Structured education programs are a core component of T2D healthcare but they are less successful in people from minority ethnic groups. Culturally tailored T2D education has demonstrated greater benefits than usual care. The aim of our study was to evaluate acceptability, fidelity and trial feasibility of the Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles for Diabetes (‘HEAL-D’) culturally tailored T2D self-management education and support (DSMES) program.</p>

                  <title>Research design and methods</title>
                  <p>A mixed-methods randomized controlled feasibility trial in black-British adults with T2D was conducted. Participants were assigned to control (usual care) or intervention (HEAL-D; 7 sessions, 14 hours of group-based culturally tailored diet and lifestyle education, behavior change support and supervised physical activity), in a ratio of 1:1. Primary outcomes were recruitment and retention rates, intervention attendance and completion. Fidelity was assessed through observations and qualitative evaluation was undertaken with participants and educators.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>102 patients responded to invitation letters (n=1335); 63 were randomized but 8 were subsequently deemed ineligible due to high baseline glycosylated hemoglogin (HbA1c) requiring intensive medical management or missing baseline HbA1c measurement. Of the remaining 55 participants (27 intervention, 28 control), 69% were female, 47% were of African and 51% were of Caribbean ethnicity. 93% completed the trial, providing end point data. Intervention attendance was high; 85% completed the program (attendance at ≥5 sessions), and 74% attended ≥6 sessions. The intervention was delivered with acceptable fidelity, although the qualitative evaluations identified some areas of structure and format in need of refinement.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We have shown it is feasible to recruit and randomize black-British adults with T2D to a trial of a culturally tailored DSMES program. We have shown the intervention is highly acceptable for both patients and healthcare providers. A future trial should assess clinical and cost-effectiveness of HEAL-D.</p>

              <p>In the UK, as in other upper-middle-income and high-income countries, minority ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In black-British communities, T2D is three times more prevalent than among white-Europeans<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and poorer outcomes are evident.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref></p>

                <p>Recruitment was open April–October 2018. In the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, primary care database searches identified potential participants and letters of invitation were sent. Additionally, primary and intermediate care practitioners referred participants that they identified through their practice, and posters/flyers were distributed in practices for self-referral. Participants from the preceding intervention development project were invited to participate but, due to their prior involvement, they were allocated to receive HEAL-D and were not included in the randomization process.</p>
                <p>Eligible participants were of self-declared black-British, African or Caribbean ethnicity; aged ≥18 years; had a clinical diagnosis of T2D; able to communicate in English and suitable for general diet and lifestyle advice, and group-based education (ie, no complex diet needs such as chronic kidney disease, or complex learning needs; suitability judged by the referring healthcare practitioner). Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and complex clinical needs. Following recruitment, an additional criterion was added (October 2018), HbA1c &lt;86 mmol/mol, after a proportion of participants were found to have high baseline values that needed intensive medical management.</p>

Seven sessions, each 2 hours, were delivered by a lay educator of black-British ethnicity and a diabetes specialist registered dietitian (no specific ethnicity). Physical activity classes, delivered by exercise instructors trained in rehabilitation exercise, were included in five sessions; these included resistance (eg, circuit training and resistance band training) and cardiorespiratory (eg, walking group, dance aerobics and Zumba) exercises. Sessions were scheduled for daytime, evening and weekend delivery, using a weekly or fortnightly schedule, with participants choosing the program location and timing that best suited their needs. ‘Flexible attendance’ allowed participants to switch between programs where needed/desired, for example, missed sessions. The sessions were delivered in community venues such as church halls or community centres, aiming for group sizes of 8–12 participants. The sessions followed an evidence-based curriculum, focusing on four specific diet and lifestyle goals:</p>

                <p>An educator delivery manual was developed, which detailed the structure and delivery of the sessions. Delivery of specific sections of the sessions were designated to the different educator roles, whereby the dietitian mainly led on education/information and discussion-based sections and the lay educator led on interactive games and tasks.</p>
                <p>The educators received 8 hours of formal training, delivered by the lead researcher (LMG); both educator roles received training on the learning objectives of the sessions, how to deliver the different components of the sessions and the theory and delivery of the BCTs. In addition, the lay educators received training on T2D and principles of self-management while the dietitian educators received training on important cultural beliefs and practices relevant to the intervention.</p>
                <p>Lay educators were recruited via a range of channels, including the Diabetes UK ‘Community Champion’ initiative, which trains members of ethnic minority communities to raise T2D awareness among their communities (eg, risk screening roadshows), and through the research teams’ networks. Lay educators were considered eligible if they were of black-British ethnicity, with good command of written and spoken English, an interest in health and/or T2D, effective presentation skills, confident at communicating and working with the public and having rights to work in the UK. Dietitian educators were recruited from clinical service provision in south London.</p>
                <p>Usual care was determined by the participants’ medical team, typically in primary care, and was not actively influenced by the research team. Both arms received usual care; there was no other intervention provided to the control arm. Medical management of diabetes, blood pressure and lipids were undertaken by the participants’ primary care physician throughout the study.</p>

                  <p>Adherence to intervention elements was scored as: occurrence (2 points), attempted occurrence (1 point) or non-occurrence (0 points); means were calculated. Adherence to scheduled times was calculated as per cent actual/recommended time. Educators were interviewed after delivering the intervention to evaluate acceptability from an educator perspective and to identify any refinements that were needed. All focus groups and interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts data were analysed by one member of the research team (CR) for descriptive themes using thematic content analysis with data managed using NVivo V.10 (QSR International, 2021) and with themes discussed by the team. As themes were descriptive process considerations, extensive double coding was deemed unnecessary. However, all extracts for each theme were read by a team member (LMG) against each theme name, for validation.</p>

Intervention adherence was assessed using attendance records; completion of HEAL-D was defined as attendance at ≥5 out of 7 sessions. Retention was calculated as the number of participants who attended the end point visit as a percentage of those recruited. Data completion was calculated as the proportion of participants who had paired baseline and end point data. These rates were evaluated by sex, ethnicity, age group and employment status. Rates are expressed as number (%), and clinical and patient-reported data are presented as mean (SD), with 95% CIs.</p>

The adjusted mean difference in change score has been presented with 95% CI, providing signal of efficacy estimates. In line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for pilot studies and because we were not formally powered to detect between-group differences in outcomes, differences have not been tested for significance.

                <p>Six HEAL-D courses were delivered between April and December 2018 in five different community venues in the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark. Four dietitian (two of black-British and two of white-British ethnicity) and four lay educators (all black-British ethnicity) delivered the courses, with all sessions within a course delivered by the same educator pairing. The group sizes ranged from 2 to 10, with an average of six participants per course.</p>

                <p>Fifty-one of the 55 randomized participants completed the trial, giving a retention rate of 93% (95% CI 82 to 98); retention rates were equal across intervention and control arms (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S2</xref>) and there were no appreciable differences seen by sex, ethnicity, age group and employment status (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S2</xref>). Most withdrawals were due to missing the end point visits, in which two participants were sick or travelling and two participants could not be contacted.</p>

No appreciable differences in attendance were seen in relation to sex, ethnicity, age group and employment status (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S3</xref>). A third of participants (10/27) used ‘flexible attendance’, switching between courses, thus enabling them to attend more sessions/complete the program.</p>

                <p>Of the 55 participants who entered the trial, 93% (n=51) had complete outcome data for HbA1c, weight and lipids. Each patient-reported outcome variable was complete for at least 85% (n=47) of participants (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S4 and S5</xref>).</p>
                <p><xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the clinical and patient report outcome measures, by arm and timepoint. Mean baseline HbA1c was 60.6 (SD 11.4) and 59.1 (SD 11.2) mmol/mol in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Adjusted mean difference in HbA1c change scores between intervention and control was −2.8 (95% CI −9.5 to 3.9) mmol/mol. The primary outcome in a future definitive trial would be HbA1c, as the main clinical measure used to assess overall glycemic control and a predictor of long-term complications. To inform the sample size calculation for a future definitive trial, we analyzed the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between baseline and end point HbA1c, which is estimated to be 0.672, as well as the SD of HbA1c values by treatment group (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Overall, content (mean 1.65) and time adherence (mean 108% of the scheduled time) were satisfactory but with inconsistencies. Content adherence was poorest for session 2 (‘get moving’; 1.42) and session 4 (‘shape up’; 1.08), which were the two sessions in which new interactive tasks were introduced. Session 5 (‘drop the pressure’) had the greatest content adherence score (1.92) but was delivered more quickly than planned (72% of scheduled time). In session 7, the time spent on the education content was double that of the scheduled time (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S7</xref>).</p>
                <p>The educator interviews illuminated some fidelity issues:</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>While session 1 was designed to adhere to pedagogic practice in providing scaffolding for the remaining sessions (eg, identifying objectives, goal setting), educators concurred this did not suit the participants, was not easily delivered and the session felt rushed, with corners often cut in content or interactivity: “<italic toggle="yes">we probably stuck to the taught curriculum very well and the practical tasks very well, but probably not the goal setting, problem-solving, the tasks for them…. The first session was, the time, we just didn't deliver anywhere near the whole session”. Group 1—Lead Educator</italic>. This had a knock-on effect on session 2: as one assessor noted elements could not be done because ‘<italic toggle="yes">probably hadn’t had time to give out the task cards [in Session 1]’</italic>.</p>

                    <p>Educators all agreed that the educational/discussion part of the sessions, was too packed, resulting in some tasks being dropped/covered less well: “<italic toggle="yes">The overall programme was excellent. I think my only issue was timing. It was cutting it a bit fine for a lot of them….if we're trying to encourage them to engage and to give that kind of feedback as to how they've done, or any issues that they might have”. Group 4/5—Lead educator</italic>.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Most educators felt they were ‘<italic toggle="yes">breaking the rules</italic>’ by dropping or changing aspects but perceived this as necessary to accommodate participant needs: “<italic toggle="yes">Some of the educators really went by the book. I guess that’s what they’re meant to do, but with X, they really allowed people to ask questions which are not part of the session.

                <title>Acceptability of the intervention—patient and educator</title>
                <p>Overall, the educator and participant data showed that HEAL-D was acceptable and successfully implemented (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S6</xref>). Numerous statements illustrated that participants had taken on board the advice and information and made real changes in their life. Concerning the structure and content, participants and educators provided examples of good operationalization and effectiveness in practice. Some delivery had to be matched to individual groups for optimal engagement, such as: the use of videos and PowerPoints versus activities; demonstrating and discussion; the relative inputs of the lay and professional educators.</p>
                <p>The acceptability and usefulness of the chosen BCTs were evaluated. Those BCTs focused particularly at improving knowledge and skills were seen to be highly effective. The balance between theoretical and practical components of <italic toggle="yes">demonstrating the behavior</italic> were valued (eg, participatory physical activity and cook and taste sessions alongside verbal and visual information). The participatory physical activity sessions and cooking demonstrations seemed to increase both capability and self-efficacy, empowering participants to repeat the activities outside of the sessions. Components designed to achieve <italic toggle="yes">social support (</italic>eg, group sessions facilitated for interaction and support) and <italic toggle="yes">social comparison</italic> (eg, sharing experiences) were well received. The group interaction was key as individuals motivated each other and learned from each other, which gave the information credibility and salience that they may not have previously experienced. These components supported the learning by raising self-efficacy, making it acceptable to challenge traditions and created confidence to resist social pressures. The use of <italic toggle="yes">credible sources (</italic>eg, culturally concordant lay educators and videos with tips from faith leaders and other community members), reinforced the social acceptability of the new behaviors. BCTs aimed at supporting behavior regulation and self-efficacy (eg, self-monitoring, goal-setting, action planning, problem-solving) were less frequently mentioned in the evaluations and appeared to be less effective in supporting behavior change.</p>

              <p>Using mixed methods, we have evaluated the acceptability of HEAL-D, an evidence-based, culturally tailored DSMES program for black-British adults, alongside assessing intervention fidelity and trial feasibility. Importantly, we have shown that it is feasible to recruit, randomize and retain black-British adults with T2D in an RCT, and to implement a culturally tailored DSMES program in primary care, training healthcare professionals and lay educators to deliver a curriculum of evidence-based BCTs. Our attendance data demonstrate, overall, a high degree of acceptability among participants. Our in-depth evaluation methods have enabled us to understand the operationalization of HEAL-D, particularly understanding what elements worked and what components need refinement. This is important in allowing us to refine the delivery to enhance effectiveness and uptake.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref></p>
              <p>We engaged key stakeholders, particularly people living with T2D, healthcare professionals and community leaders, in developing HEAL-D to ensure its sensitivity to service users while also being implementable and having adoption potential by the health service. Intervention co-development is time-consuming, requiring a multidisciplinary collaborative approach and is therefore expensive to conduct.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Co-development of HEAL-D was conducted over an 18-month period and involved three phases of qualitative research.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 31</xref> This enabled us to identify priorities, from both a patient and service provider perspective, for the intervention and where there were competing priorities to resolve these with our stakeholders. The HEAL-D program reflects this input, with specific elements that would otherwise not have been chosen if we had used a researcher-driven, ‘top down’ approach. An example is the flexible attendance schedule, identified as a priority by patients and subsequently used by a third of participants, resulting in near maximal attendance.</p>
              <p>The development and evaluation of complex behavioral interventions should include assessment of intervention fidelity, focusing on transferring principles and processes based around theorized mechanisms of change.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While fidelity is a multidimensional construct and there is little consensus about its key elements, recently it has been proposed to consist of five domains: study design; training; intervention delivery; intervention receipt by participants and intervention enactment, defined as the extent to which participants apply the skills learned.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref> In the evaluation of HEAL-D, we focused on the complexity of intervention delivery, receipt and enactment, using observations of delivery alongside participant focus groups and educator interviews. The effectiveness of complex interventions is often dependent on the skills of those delivering them. Due to time and resource limitations, we were not able to focus in detail on developing educator training modules and processes for evaluating educator competencies. Our delivery was largely manualized, and our fidelity observations focused on assessing ‘adherence’, defined as the extent to which the educators delivered the essential content prescribed in the manual. ‘Competence’ is a related construct, which includes the ability of educators to responsively tailor intervention content and develop a collaborative and trusting relationship with participants as well as accurately pacing delivery and content.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref> We did not systematically assess competence, but our data confirm the need for further training of educators, particularly around the BCTs and appropriate pacing of delivery.</p>
              <p>A major strength of our work is our use of mixed methods, enabling a much greater understanding of the delivery and acceptability of our intervention than would be the case from purely quantitative assessments and is increasingly recognised as an area of ‘best practice’ in feasibility trials.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The sociodemographic profile of our participants shows that we engaged a diverse range of participants. We did not see any clear differences in attendance or acceptability based on gender, socioeconomic status or age. However, we do acknowledge that this trial largely recruited from two South London boroughs in which people of black-British ethnicity form a ‘majority-minority’ ethnic group, therefore, it was highly relevant to both the local communities and healthcare practitioners. It will be important that a future trial evaluates HEAL-D in different areas/regions and considers issues of implementation where people of black-British ethnicity are not so well represented. We principally focused on two methods of recruitment, primary care database screening with invitation letters and clinic referrals from healthcare practitioners; our recruitment rates are calculated from only the database screening letters of invitation and show a low response rate. While we were not able to formally quantify the response rate to practitioner referrals, anecdotally we observed that this was more effective. This is important for a future trial, in which focusing on recruitment through referral pathways rather than invitation letters is recommended. This feasibility trial employed broad eligibility criteria, avoiding the need for additional screening visits. However, a small number of randomized participants were subsequently found to have high HbA1c, deemed in need of intensive medical management, thus these participants were excluded from the data analysis. A trial will need to have eligibility criteria and screening procedures that ensures the suitability of participants prior to randomization. Our focus group evaluations of intervention acceptability included participants from our co-design study as it was not feasible to run separate groups; these participants may have viewed the intervention differently due to their prior involvement and may have introduced a source of bias in the data. Additionally, our study did not evaluate the feasibility of generating economic data; an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention would be an important aspect of a future trial.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, culturally appropriate T2D education has been shown to bring about significantly greater benefits for people from minority ethnic backgrounds compared with standard education.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> To be effective it is important that interventions are sensitive to the needs of patients, while also being implementable within the healthcare system. We have shown that it is possible to recruit and retain black-British adults with T2D in a trial of a culturally tailored DSMES program, and train healthcare professionals to deliver the intervention in primary care with good fidelity. It will be important to take the HEAL-D intervention forward to a fully powered trial to evaluate its clinical and cost-effectiveness. It is important that we use our qualitative data to recognise and address any potential implementation issues before HEAL-D is rolled out at larger scale.</p>
