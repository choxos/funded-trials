                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>School-based COVID-19 mitigation strategies have greatly impacted the primary school day (children aged 3–11) including: wearing face coverings, two metre distancing, no mixing of children, and no breakfast clubs or extra-curricular activities. This study examines these mitigation measures and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (<italic toggle="yes">Secure Anonymised Information Linkage</italic>) Databank.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Responses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1–5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement two metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a two metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Implementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, two metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school. Primary school staff found teaching challenging during COVID-19 restrictions, especially for younger learners and those with additional learning needs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in the temporary closure of educational settings worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Implemented worldwide from mid-April 2020, school closures were used as a public health measure to reduce social contacts and the risk of transmission amongst pupils, school staff, families and the wider community. However, recent evidence indicates that children below the age of 14 appear to have lower susceptibility to infection and display fewer clinical symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Population-level data suggests that whilst transmission risks within school exists, risks are lower compared to within households [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Adults living with young children (0–11 years) during the period after schools reopened encountered no greater risk of COVID-19 infection [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and school staff were at no greater risk of COVID-19 infection than other working-age adults [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Educational settings reopened for face-to-face teaching and learning from September to December 2020. In Wales, one of the four nations of the UK, education is a devolved responsibility of the Welsh Government. Operational guidance to schools in Wales in the 2020 autumn term [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (1 September to 22 December) included widespread adaptation to social behaviours and a variety of school-based mitigation measures. This included encouraging wearing face coverings, reducing contacts, maintaining social distancing between pupils and staff, segregating classes and guidance on breakfast clubs, extra-curricular activities and outdoor learning [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Research examining the implementation of guidelines by schools highlights major challenges, including the ability of school staff to maintain a two metre distance from staff and pupils [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. School staff highlight the conflict between balancing preventative measures with learning, with measures such as physical distancing policies negatively impacting on teaching quality. A rapid scoping review assessing the impacts of school-based measures concluded that there is an urgent need for research assessing the effectiveness of these measures on directly affected populations (e.g. pupils and school staff) [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and on the psychosocial well-being and mental health of school populations. This is important as evidence suggests teacher wellbeing is a critical factor in creating stable environments for children to thrive [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and is positively associated with academic achievement [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study linked routinely collected COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results data with survey data to examine the association between COVID-19 positive cases within the primary school setting and different school-based mitigation measures aligned to guidance, implemented between October to December 2020. It also examined these measures with school staff’s self-reported (a) cold symptoms in the previous seven days, as a proxy for infection rates; and (b) levels of anxiety and depression. Secondary qualitative data exploring the impacts of wearing face coverings are also presented to complement quantitative findings.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This study adopted a mixed methods design. Participants were recruited through the HAPPEN primary school network (<italic toggle="yes">Health and Attainment of Pupils in a Primary Education Network</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in September 2020. An online survey (open 9 October 2020 to 16 December 2020) with school staff captured self-reported implementation of school-based COVID-19 mitigation measures and individual level outcomes of cold symptoms and anxiety/depressive symptoms. The survey findings were linked with routine data on COVID-19 test results for staff and pupils within the respective school of the staff participant for the school-level outcome.

                <title>School staff survey and linked data</title>
                <p>A convenience sample of primary school staff were recruited by contacting members of the HAPPEN network and directly emailing all primary schools in Wales, UK (n = 1,203) in September 2020. The survey was promoted through existing partnerships with stakeholders including regional education consortia groups. The online survey was open for responses from 9 October 2020 to 16 December 2020 (study period) when schools returned for face-to-face teaching. Inclusion criteria for participation was any primary school staff working within a local authority maintained (publicly funded) primary school. The development of the survey was based on input from the research team specialising in child health and education research (authors EM, MJ, SB), education stakeholders (regional education consortia curriculum staff) and a headteacher and teacher from two primary schools to ensure appropriate wording and usability. The final survey contained 41 questions consisting of demographic, categorical and open-ended questions. The survey included the validated questionnaires Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to assess the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The survey was conducted online and could be completed by a member of school staff at a convenient time via an electronic device including mobile phone, tablet, laptop and computer. Responses were downloaded to an Excel spreadsheet. Quantitative data responses were uploaded to the SAIL Databank [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to be linked with COVID-19 school testing data [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and analysed using Stata (version 16). A full copy of the survey is presented in <xref rid="pone.0264023.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>, and detail regarding survey item, item response categories and item coding for analyses are presented in <xref rid="pone.0264023.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Appendix</xref>.</p>
                <p>The process of data coding involved two researchers. The first researcher downloaded the raw data, cleaned the data, checked for duplicates, generated a unique participant ID number and removed identifiable information. This process protects participants’ anonymity by ensuring that the second researcher conducting the analyses could not identify individuals. This coded dataset was uploaded to the SAIL Databank, a national data infrastructure asset of anonymised data about the population of Wales that enables secure data linkage and analysis for research. To link the data, the demographic data are separated from the survey data and sent to a trusted third party, Digital Health and Care Wales and the survey data goes to SAIL using a secure file upload. A unique Anonymous Linking Field (ALF) is assigned to the person-based record before it is joined to clinical data via a system linking field. This dataset was accessible to authors listed from Population Data Science.</p>

                <p>A COVID-19 school incident in Wales, UK, is defined as one or more positive COVID-19 cases in a school [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The primary outcome was the probability of at least one positive school-level COVID-19 test (pupils or staff) within the school setting linked to the staff participant during the study period. Secondary binary outcomes investigated at an individual level captured by the online survey included self-reported cold symptoms in the previous seven days as a proxy of infection risk as evidence suggests a crossover of symptoms between COVID-19 and the common cold [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and moderate/severe anxiety (GAD-7) and moderate/severe depression (PHQ-9). Eligibility criteria within final analyses models were any primary school staff participant with complete linked survey and routine records. Participants contracted to multiple schools were excluded from analyses (n = 3) (see <xref rid="pone.0264023.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Logistic regression analyses adjusting for confounding variables (school size, proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals as an indicator for deprivation) and clustered by school determined the Odds Ratio (OR) at a school level for at least one positive linked COVID-19 test at the respective school during the study period and for individual-level (school staff) secondary outcomes (self-reported cold symptoms, moderate/severe anxiety, moderate/severe depression).</p>
                <p>All exposure measures relating to government guidance were captured through self-report by school staff via the online survey and were analysed in individual models (univariable) and then in a combined model (multivariable). Items with multiple category responses or continuous numerical values were assigned ordinal categories to ease interpretation. For example survey response categories for <italic toggle="yes">keep two metres from pupils/staff</italic> included i) <italic toggle="yes">never</italic>, ii) <italic toggle="yes">rarely</italic>, iii) <italic toggle="yes">some of the time</italic>, iv) <italic toggle="yes">most of the time</italic>, v) <italic toggle="yes">always</italic>, with combined ordinal categories for analyses of i) <italic toggle="yes">never/rarely</italic>, ii) <italic toggle="yes">some of the time</italic>, iii) <italic toggle="yes">most of the time/always</italic>. For these variables, likelihood-ratio tests of variables as whole were performed to assess goodness of fit between models including and excluding variables for the primary outcome. Further detail of exposures for all survey items within analyses including possible response category, grouping and coding can be found in <xref rid="pone.0264023.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Appendix</xref>.

                <title>Qualitative analysis</title>
                <p>Secondary qualitative content analysis was conducted to explore the impact of wearing face coverings on teaching, attained from item 29 (see <xref rid="pone.0264023.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Appendix</xref>). Content analysis aims to make contextual inferences of data by condensing text into related concepts to provide knowledge to describe a phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Conceptual content analysis was chosen to quantify the frequency of reoccurring words/themes and offer a descriptive lens of the quantitative data in terms of the most significant impacts of wearing face coverings for school staff [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An inductive approach was used as knowledge of this subject is limited due to the new and rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lead researcher (EM) followed the steps of preparation, organising and reporting outlined by Elo and Kyngäs [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                <p>During the preparation stage, words or sentences were chosen as the unit of analysis to represent related concepts. The lead researcher (EM) who was female and had previous experience in qualitative data analysis read the open-ended responses several times to facilitate immersion in the data [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and to gain an understanding of ‘what is going on’ [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The use of memoing recorded notes of patterns and emerging insights relating to coding ideas. Thoughts relating to decision processes were documented in a reflexive journal [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the case of inductive content analysis, an open coding process to organising the data was applied by manually assigning freely generated open codes, consisting of words and sentences representing key conceptual responses. The initial list of words and sentences were grouped under higher order headings [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], with each heading named using content-characteristic words that describe the phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The categories produced were discussed and reviewed with the research team to develop the final list of category headings characterising any impacts of face coverings on teaching. The researchers did not have any interaction with participants.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study aims to examine the association of different school-based mitigation measures reported by primary school staff between October to December 2020 on the likelihood of any school-level COVID-19 infection (pupils and staff) at the linked school during this period. This study also examined the association of these measures with individual-level self-reported infection (cold symptoms), anxiety and depression of school staff. Findings suggest that reporting more direct non-household contacts was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 at the school level, and a trend towards self-reported infection. Reporting six or more non-house contacts within 1-metre was also associated with higher depression in school staff. We found no evidence that reporting wearing face coverings or maintaining a two metre distance from pupils or other staff during the study period was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 in the linked school setting.</p>
              <p>Whilst this observational study offers a real-world evaluation of the school setting, findings highlight the challenge for staff in implementing and adhering to school guidelines. This study assumes that reported measures were in place for the duration of the study period in line with operational guidance issued to schools at that time. However, changes in day-to-day school practice brings methodological challenges of evaluating compliance with and effectiveness of national-level guidance. Our findings of within-school agreement suggests some measures are implemented at a school-level (face coverings, mixing classes at play, breakfast and extra-curricular clubs). In comparison, agreement of other measures (number of contacts, maintaining two metre distance from pupils and staff and teaching outdoors) suggest individual-level influences of adherence to measures, reflecting the challenge of implementing generic guidance in a dynamic school environment.</p>
              <p>The finding that reduced contacts may be protective at the school-level is important within the contexts of different settings where the implementation and adherence to different blanket mitigation measures varies. Specifically, this study finds an association between the number of direct physical contacts and increased likelihood of COVID-19 school infections. It is well established that contact patterns of close proximity, prolonged contact and contact frequency are strongly associated with increased risk of transmission [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our finding is consistent with the evidence base regarding contact patterns where reducing number of contacts is associated with a reduction in the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>) [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A crossover between COVID-19 and common cold symptoms has been established [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the current study also found an association between direct physical contacts and self-reported cold symptoms. As this study suggests variation of school-based mitigation measures between and within-schools, encouraging individual behaviours of school staff such as reducing direct contacts may be of benefit in reducing transmission of COVID-19 or general infection in the school setting.</p>
              <p>Relating to proximity, qualitative findings from this study suggest challenges for staff wearing face coverings including pupils having difficulty hearing and understanding, and this required them to talk louder or move physically closer to pupils to be heard. Research demonstrates that people speak louder when wearing masks [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Staff also noted that pupils were unable to interpret facial expressions or emotions, impacting their relationship with pupils and children’s perception of compassionate emotions conveyed by staff. Challenges were cited for ALN or EAL pupils particularly regarding speech and language development. As facial expressions and gestures are largely responsible for verbal, non-verbal and emotional face-to-face communication, face masks may hinder interpersonal communication with pupils [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>Type of face mask was not captured in this study (e.g. medical/non-medical grade). Guidance to primary schools during the study period (autumn term 2020) did not enforce medical-grade face coverings [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The type of face covering worn by staff in this study may include cloth masks which have been found to increase respiratory infection risk due to moisture retention, reuse and poor filtration [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This may explain individual-level findings that staff wearing face masks had higher odds of reporting cold symptoms in the previous seven days. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the main purpose of face coverings is to prevent onward transmission to others as opposed to protecting the individual wearing the face covering [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed a reduction in COVID-19 incidence with mask wearing, though type of fask mask, compliance and frequency of use were not captured [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is important to note the many confounding variables of face covering usage that were not measured in this study. This includes background prevalence in the area which may influence wearing face coverings. Evidence suggests that mandating face covering use alone may not increase usage and thus, individual behaviours and other influences are likely to play a role in face covering behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, this observational study assumes reported mitigation measures were in effect for the duration of the study period. It is possible that reverse causality occurred, that is a school staff practitioner may have chosen to wear a face covering following the onset of common cold symptoms.</p>
              <p>The use of visors was associated with higher anxiety/depression for staff in this study. Impacts on teacher wellbeing have been highlighted in previous research by HAPPEN during school closures and the phased reopening of schools in the summer term of 2020, with primary school staff advocating for their wellbeing to be prioritised [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This is important as teacher wellbeing is associated with academic achievement [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. School staff in the current study also commented on the physical impacts of wearing face coverings, including negatively affecting their vision, causing headaches and breathing difficulties. Qualitative research exploring face covering behaviour has highlighted the wide range of motivations, including individual and community protection, and barriers such as physical challenges and discomfort [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is possible that the physical discomforts expressed by staff in this study influence face covering behaviour.</p>
              <p>We found no evidence in this study that maintaining a two metre distance from pupils reduces the odds of a COVID-19 school-level incident. However, few staff were able to achieve this. Research examining the implementation of preventive school-based measures in primary schools in England highlights the challenge of maintaining physical distancing from pupils and the negative impact of distancing measures on teaching including teaching letter formation [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This finding is mirrored in the current study, with specific references to the challenges of teaching phonics and those discussed previously. The potential consequences of failing to address these pedagogical impacts include pupils falling further behind in their learning [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study did not find evidence of higher odds of COVID-19 school incidents where children from different classes mix, including breakfast club, extra-curricular clubs and mixing different classes at playtime. School provision during the COVID-19 pandemic encompasses balancing transmission risks against the benefits for children’s social and emotional development, wider skill development, educational attainment and reducing inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities including food insecurity, child poverty and child hunger [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] which negatively impact educational attainment [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Provision such as breakfast clubs that address socio-economic inequalities are of great public health, education and economic importance and this was reflected in guidance at the time of the study encouraging breakfast clubs [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and UNESCO recently updated advice to policymakers and educators, issuing a set of risk-based considerations regarding school provision since reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0264023.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whilst the principles aim to prevent and minimise transmission risks within the school setting, the WHO advocate that at the forefront, educational settings should prioritise “<italic toggle="yes">the continuity of education for children for their overall well-being</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">health and safety</italic>”, the “<italic toggle="yes">social learning and development of children</italic>” and to consider implications of decisions on school staff. Findings from this study highlight the challenges of evaluating the implementation of guidance and the variation in implementation at an individual and school-level. Governments continually review available evidence to inform risk-based approaches to education delivery that safeguard children’s learning, health and wellbeing and support school staff. This must consider the risk of transmission in addition to the impacts on pupils, teachers and senior school leaders. Finally, both the Welsh and UK governments have recently announced plans to reverse some of these guidelines for schools in the upcoming 2021/22 academic year starting in September 2021. This includes the removal of isolation policies for children in close contact with confirmed cases, removing the use of school ‘bubbles’ to segregate year groups, and face coverings will no longer be recommended.</p>

              <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
              <p>All primary schools in Wales (n = 1,203) were contacted however the findings in this study are a convenience sample, only representing those that participated and may not be representative of non-participating schools. A range of school-based measures have been implemented and the findings in this study may not encapsulate all approaches. School-based mitigation measures included in analyses were obtained from a self-report survey and may result in recall bias. This is an observational study and so cannot show cause and effect. As with all observational studies, unmeasured confounders and reverse causality may influence findings, e.g., face covering usage may increase due to a previous COVID-19 case in the school, higher community prevalence and individual behaviours. Thus, face covering use and future COVID-19 cases may be linked by an unmeasured confounder. This study assumed that reported measures were in effect for the duration of the period of study based on national-level guidance issued to schools by the Welsh Government at the start of the autumn term 2020. It is possible that within-schools’ day to day practice varied. Despite this, the sample consists of a range of primary school staff including headteachers, teachers and support staff working in schools in 15 of 22 local authorities in Wales, of varying school size and ranges of pupils eligible for free school meals. This study was able to examine all COVID-19 PCR test results in Wales and link these to the relevant school setting and so gives an objective assessment of the association of self-reported adherence to mitigation measures and COVID-19 test positive cases.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was variable and challenging in primary schools in Wales. This study did find evidence that reducing the number of direct non-household contacts is associated with lower risk of COVID-19 in the school and general infection for the individual. This study did not find evidence that face coverings, two metre social distancing, stopping children mixing or removing breakfast clubs are associated with fewer COVID-19 cases in the school or with lower general infection rates and did find evidence that these measures can affect teaching quality.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. COVID-19 mitigation measures in primary schools and associations with infection is an interesting and important topic. The low risk of severe disease and death in children has led to debates on whether school closures and mitigation measures affecting learning are justified.</p>
              <p>Despite the density of data and the important topic, my overall impression is that the paper would benefit from being more focused. There are four separate outcomes for associations with staff self-reported mitigation measures; (i) school-level positive COVID-19 cases (primary outcome), (ii) self-reported cold symptoms, (iii) moderate/severe anxiety and (iv) depressive symptoms, and adding qualitative data to this.</p>
              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>• The univariable and multivariable OR were presented separately rather than in the same table for the same outcome. I had to scroll back and forth several times to follow the flow. As a reader I would prefer that univariable and multivariable results are presented in the same table with one table per outcome.</p>
              <p>• Numbers already presented in the tables were repeated numerically in the text, adding to information overload.</p>
              <p>• The questions was phrased with multiple alternatives (see below) whereas the analyses are done separately as dichotomous exposures. It is not clear whether the research question is relative or related to the exposure as whole. I would have expected that Keeping 2 metres from STAFF was treated as one variable (exposure as whole), and that this variable should be tested for significance before interpreting the significance of the subvariables (rarely, some of the time, most of the time, always) I think authors need to clarify this.</p>
              <p>Keep 2 metres from STAFF 34. How often are you able to keep 2 metres away from other members of staff during the teaching day? i) Never</p>
              <p>ii) Rarely</p>
              <p>iii) Some of the time</p>
              <p>iv) Most of the time</p>
              <p>v) Always</p>
              <p>• It is not clear whether the authors corrected for multiple comparisons, which would be relevant if the outcome is treated as categorical variables. The outcome is not frequent and most associations are not significant.</p>
              <p>• The authors refer to two different levels of significance &lt;0.5 and &lt;0.1, which is fine. However, these levels are only presented with bold or italic OR and CI in the tables. It would be easier for the reader if the p-value information was presented numerically, or by one and two asterix depending on the level of significance.</p>
              <p>• Adding qualitative data to the manuscript is interesting and important. However, the analysis is drowning in all the other information and would deserve better.</p>
              <p>• Self-reported cold symptoms in the previous seven days is included as a separate outcome (proxy for infection risk). However, it is not clear how this should be interpreted and what it adds to the research question.</p>
              <p>• In the discussion they find that staff wearing face-masks had higher odds of reporting cold symptoms in the previous seven days. It is not clear whether they were more likely to use masks due to cold-symptoms, rather than vice-versa.</p>
              <p>• The authors suggests that asymptomatic transmission from children could be an explanation. However, asymptomatic transmission from children in school settings is not very common.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. COVID-19 mitigation measures in primary schools and associations with infection is an interesting and important topic. The low risk of severe disease and death in children has led to debates on whether school closures and mitigation measures affecting learning are justified.</p>
              <p>Despite the density of data and the important topic, my overall impression is that the paper would benefit from being more focused. There are four separate outcomes for associations with staff self-reported mitigation measures; (i) school-level positive COVID-19 cases (primary outcome), (ii) self-reported cold symptoms, (iii) moderate/severe anxiety and (iv) depressive symptoms, and adding qualitative data to this.</p>
              <p>We would like to thank you for taking the time to read our manuscript and to provide your comments. The manuscript covers two themes: infection (COVID &amp; cold like symptoms), and wellbeing (anxiety and depression) with complementary qualitative data to give context to quantitative findings. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are very much on risk of infection and the impact of mitigation measures on mental health. We feel these aspects need to be addressed together as one impacts on each other. Therefore, whilst we appreciate and agree that this may feel like a data dense manuscript, we believe the risk of infection has to be discussed alongside the impact to mental health. We also believe that the qualitative context is very important in understanding the full picture, and adds a significant contribution to the literature. </p>

              <p>Comments:</p>
              <p>• The univariable and multivariable OR were presented separately rather than in the same table for the same outcome. I had to scroll back and forth several times to follow the flow. As a reader I would prefer that univariable and multivariable results are presented in the same table with one table per outcome.</p>
              <p>Thank you for raising this point. We agree that presenting the univariable and multivariable analyses in the same table ensures clarity for the reader. We have addressed this as suggested, presenting each outcome within separate tables with univariable and multivariable analyses. These tables and models have been renumbered as below:</p>
              <p>Quantitative results</p>
              <p>Page 15-21</p>
              <p>Table 3: School-level probability of any positive COVID-19 case in school (model 1: univariable, model 2: multivariable) </p>
              <p>Table 4: Individual level (school staff) self-reported cold symptoms (model 3: univariable, model 4: multivariable)</p>
              <p>Table 5: Individual level (school staff) moderate/severe anxiety symptoms (model 5: univariable, model 6 multivariable)</p>
              <p>Table 6: Individual level (school staff) moderate/severe depressive symptoms (model 7: univariable, model 8 multivariable)</p>
              <p>• Numbers already presented in the tables were repeated numerically in the text, adding to information overload.</p>
              <p>We appreciate you drawing attention to the presentation of our results and we agree that repeating the results numerically in the text may overload the reader. To address your comment, we have removed the majority of numerical results. We feel that in instances of statistically significant results at the 5% level, stating the Odds Ratio is useful for the reader. However, we have removed the 95% CIs to ensure results are concise and readable. This style of presentation of results can also be found in other Covid published research in PLOS ONE. </p>
              <p>Quantitative results</p>
              <p>Page 14, line 321-325</p>
              <p>In the multivariable models, compared to reporting 0 contacts, reporting more non-household direct contacts was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 at the school level (1-5 contacts OR = 2.89, Table 3, model 1), and a trend to higher general infection (Table 4, model 3). Reporting 6 or more contacts within 1-metre was associated with higher depression (OR = 2.70, Table 6, model 8).</p>
              <p>• The questions was phrased with multiple alternatives (see below) whereas the analyses are done separately as dichotomous exposures. It is not clear whether the research question is relative or related to the exposure as whole. I would have expected that Keeping 2 metres from STAFF was treated as one variable (exposure as whole), and that this variable should be tested for significance before interpreting the significance of the subvariables (rarely, some of the time, most of the time, always) I think authors need to clarify this.</p>
              <p>Keep 2 metres from STAFF 34. How often are you able to keep 2 metres away from other members of staff during the teaching day? i) Never, ii) Rarely, iii) Some of the time, iv) Most of the time, v) Always</p>
              <p>• It is not clear whether the authors corrected for multiple comparisons, which would be relevant if the outcome is treated as categorical variables. The outcome is not frequent and most associations are not significant.</p>
              <p>Thank you for raising this point regarding some survey items and associated response categories and exposure coding. We assigned ordinal categories for the purpose of analyses to some items, including the item you have highlighted (staff social distancing). We treated these variables as categorical in the analyses, with the reference category indicated in the results tables. An example is demonstrated below and presented in S3 Appendix: </p>
              <p>Exposures Survey item Survey responses categories Coding for analyses </p>
              <p>Keep two metres from STAFF 34. How often are you able to keep 2 metres away from other members of staff during the teaching day? i) Never</p>
              <p>ii) Rarely</p>
              <p>iii) Some of the time</p>
              <p>iv) Most of the time</p>
              <p>v) Always Ordinal:</p>
              <p>- Never/rarely (i, ii)</p>
              <p>- Some of the time (iii)</p>
              <p>- Most of the time/always (iv, v)</p>
              <p>Example taken from S3 Appendix</p>
              <p>Analyses with ordinal responses used the grouped never/rarely category as the reference group. </p>
              <p>We did not conduct sub-variable analyses but included the distributions of response categories in Table 2. To improve the clarity for readers and address the points you have raised, we have updated Table 2 to reflect the exposure categories used within analyses. For example:</p>
              <p>Survey item Response % (n) % (n) of schools with �<!-- &#x0f0b3; -->80% agreement of responses (for school-level outcome)</p>
              <p>Keep two metres from pupils Never/rarely 67.1% (237) 61% (36)</p>
              <p> Sometimes 23.5% (83) </p>
              <p> Most of the time/always 7.9% (28) </p>
              <p> Missing 1.4% (5) </p>
              <p>Example taken from table 2 (page 12-13)</p>
              <p>We have also updated the layout and presentation of tables 3 to 6 to aid the interpretation of tables. For example: </p>
              <p>Self reported measures from survey Univariable (model 1) Multivariable (model 2)</p>
              <p> OR 95% CI OR 95% CI</p>
              <p>Keep two metres from staff</p>
              <p>(reference never/rarely) Sometimes 1.58 0.47 to 5.32 1.82 0.63 to 5.26</p>
              <p> Most of the time/always 2.46 0.76 to 7.96 2.85* 0.97 to 8.37</p>
              <p>Example taken from table 3 (page 15-16)</p>
              <p>We have presented a full breakdown of exposures included within analyses, survey item, response and coding in S3 Appendix. However, we agree that further clarity is required within the manuscript. To address this within the manuscript text, we have included additional explanations as below: </p>
              <p>School staff survey and linked data:</p>
              <p>Page 7, line 160-162</p>
              <p>A full copy of the survey is presented in S2 Appendix, and detail regarding survey item, item response categories and item coding for analyses are presented in S3 Appendix. </p>
              <p>Quantitative analysis</p>
              <p>Page 8-9, line 193-206</p>
              <p>All exposure measures relating to government guidance were captured through self-report by school staff via the online survey and were analysed in individual models (univariable) and then in a combined model (multivariable). For the purpose of analyses, items with multiple category responses or continuous numerical values were assigned ordinal categories. For example survey response categories for keep two metres from pupils/staff included i) never, ii) rarely, iii) some of the time, iv) most of the time, v) always, with combined ordinal categories for analyses of i) never/rarely, ii) some of the time, iii) most of the time/always. Further detail of exposures for all survey items within analyses including possible response category, grouping and coding can be found in S3 Appendix. This study assumed self-reported mitigation measures to be in effect for the duration of the study period based on operational guidance issued to schools at the time of the study [9].</p>
              <p>We have also amended the column title in S3 Appendix to Coding for analyses. </p>
              <p>Finally, we have addressed this within the results write up:</p>
              <p>Quantitative results</p>
              <p>Page 14, line 336-339</p>
              <p>In the multivariable models we found a trend to an increased odds of a COVID-19 positive test for the grouped exposure of staff maintaining a 2-metre distance from other staff most of the time/always compared to never/rarely</p>
              <p>• The authors refer to two different levels of significance &lt;0.5 and &lt;0.1, which is fine. However, these levels are only presented with bold or italic OR and CI in the tables. It would be easier for the reader if the p-value information was presented numerically, or by one and two asterix depending on the level of significance.</p>
              <p>We appreciate that bold or italic is unclear for the reader. To address this, we have amended tables 3-6 (pages 15-21) presenting univariable and multivariable analyses with one (p&lt;0.1) and two (p&lt;0.05) asterisks. </p>
              <p>For example:</p>
              <p>At least one school positive COVID-19 test (pupils and staff) during study period (SAIL) (school-level)</p>
              <p>Self reported measures from survey Univariable (model 1) Multivariable (model 2)</p>
              <p> OR 95% CI OR 95% CI</p>
              <p>Face covering </p>
              <p>(reference no face covering)</p>
              <p> Mask 2.82** 1.11 to 7.31 2.10* 0.87 to 5.05</p>
              <p> Visor 1.65 0.47 to 5.74 1.42 0.40 to 5.2</p>
              <p>Taken from table 2</p>
              <p>• Adding qualitative data to the manuscript is interesting and important. However, the analysis is drowning in all the other information and would deserve better.</p>
              <p>We agree with the importance of providing complementary qualitative data within our manuscript, and believe it offers a rich perspective of school staff that have been required to adapt their teaching practice and adhere to a range of school-based mitigation measures. Qualitative research can offer a meaningful contribution to shaping policy and practice. In the case of this study, we explored staff perspectives of the impacts of face coverings to further explain the quantitative findings. </p>
              <p>As this is a secondary outcome of the manuscript we were conscious to ensure that the qualitative results were discussed succinctly and clearly. We also felt it was important to include one example verbatim quote to represent each theme, with additional verbatim quotes available for the reader in S5 Appendix. Whilst it would be possible to dedicate an entire qualitative paper to these findings, we feel they complement the quantitative data and offer potential mechanisms to explain these findings, as outlined in the discussion. </p>
              <p>Furthermore, the immediacy of the COVID-19 pandemic requires rapid research to provide evidence informing emerging policy and practice, which we believe we should include all findings in this manuscript to ensure research findings are delivered in a timely way so that they can be used to inform practice in schools. </p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>Page 5, line 102-104</p>
              <p>Secondary qualitative data exploring the impacts of wearing face coverings are also presented to complement quantitative findings.</p>
              <p>• Self-reported cold symptoms in the previous seven days is included as a separate outcome (proxy for infection risk). However, it is not clear how this should be interpreted and what it adds to the research question.</p>
              <p>Thank you for raising this point. We agree that additional clarity is required to explain the inclusion of this outcome and have addressed this within the manuscript as listed below. We have used self-reported cold symptoms in the previous seven days as a proxy for infection (either COVID-19 or general infection). Evidence from the UK ZOE COVID study shows the crossover of symptoms between the common cold and COVID-19, particularly following two vaccine doses. It is also possible that Covid cases in the school (either pupil or staff) were not detected, including asymptomatic transmission or not being tested. Therefore, reporting cold symptoms indicates that transmission of either COVID-19 or other general infections is occurring. In the case of the school setting, this could suggest that some school-based mitigation measures may not be effective in preventing transmission, or are not being adhered to. In addition, if staff reported general cold or other viral infection symptoms, it is possible that this was transmitted within the school environment and would suggest they could also be exposed to COVID-19 or be transmitting an infection onwards to others. </p>
              <p>We have addressed this as outlined below, including the addition of a reference to support the crossover between COVID and cold symptoms.</p>
              <p>Quantitative analysis</p>
              <p>Page 8, line 180-183</p>
              <p>Secondary binary outcomes investigated at an individual level captured by the online survey included self-reported cold symptoms in the previous seven days as a proxy of infection risk as evidence suggests a crossover of symptoms between COVID-19 and the common cold [25], and moderate/severe anxiety (GAD-7) and moderate/severe depression (PHQ-9).</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Page 26, line 523-525</p>
              <p>A crossover between COVID-19 and common cold symptoms has been established [25], and the current study also found an association between direct physical contacts and self-reported cold symptoms. As this study suggests variation of school-based mitigation measures between and within-schools, encouraging individual behaviours of school staff such as reducing direct contacts may be of benefit in reducing transmission of COVID-19 or general infection in the school setting.</p>
              <p>• In the discussion they find that staff wearing face-masks had higher odds of reporting cold symptoms in the previous seven days. It is not clear whether they were more likely to use masks due to cold-symptoms, rather than vice-versa.</p>
              <p>Thank you for raising this important point. Our study assumes that reported measures including the use of face coverings were in effect for the duration of the study period. We agree that reverse causality may be occurring in some instances. Whilst we acknowledged this within the strengths and limitations section (below), we have addressed this by also outlining this within the discussion:</p>
              <p>Discussion </p>
              <p>Page 27, line 551-555</p>
              <p>In addition, this observational study assumes reported mitigation measures were in effect for the duration of the study period. It is possible that reverse causality occurred, that is a school staff practitioner may have chosen to wear a face covering following the onset of common cold symptoms. </p>
              <p>Strengths and limitations </p>
              <p>Page 30, line 615-618</p>
              <p>As with all observational studies, unmeasured confounders and reverse causality may influence findings, e.g., face covering usage may increase due to a previous COVID-19 case in the school, higher community prevalence and individual behaviours. Thus, face covering use and future COVID-19 cases may be linked by an unmeasured confounder.</p>
              <p>• The authors suggests that asymptomatic transmission from children could be an explanation. However, asymptomatic transmission from children in school settings is not very common.</p>
              <p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this. We have removed the sentence that suggests asymptomatic transmission could be occurring as it is not possible to ascertain this from the current study.</p>

              <p>The authors have made substantial revisions responding to previous comments, and the flow and readability of the paper is much improved.</p>
              <p>I believe I was not sufficiently clear in one of my previous comments regarding the multivariable analysis. My previous comment was:</p>
              <p>The questions was phrased with multiple alternatives (see below) whereas the analyses are done separately as dichotomous exposures. It is not clear whether the research question is relative or related to the exposure as whole. I would have expected that Keeping 2 metres from STAFF was treated as one variable (exposure as whole), and that this variable should be tested for significance before interpreting the significance of the subvariables (rarely, some of the time, most of the time, always) I think authors need to clarify this.</p>
              <p>This was not related to ordinal data, but to the validity of the analysis. Before doing pairwise comparisons of separate values within a variable (i.e. testing “sometimes” versus “never/rarely”) the variable “keeping 2 meters distance” should be tested for significance. The p-value for the whole variable can be calculated in two ways:</p>
              <p>1. A likelihood ratio test comparing a model containing the variable vs a model not containing the variable</p>
              <p>2. A wald test that tests the joint significance of beta1 = beta2 = 0 (where beta1 is the coefficient for sometimes and beta2 is the coefficient for most of the time/always)</p>
              <p>I believe pairwise comparisons (i.e. testing “sometimes” versus “never/rarely”) should be limited to significant variables to make sense, and the the p-value for the whole variable should be presented in the table alongside the pairwise comparisons.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
              <p>The questions was phrased with multiple alternatives (see below) whereas the analyses are done separately as dichotomous exposures. It is not clear whether the research question is relative or related to the exposure as whole. I would have expected that Keeping 2 metres from STAFF was treated as one variable (exposure as whole), and that this variable should be tested for significance before interpreting the significance of the subvariables (rarely, some of the time, most of the time, always) I think authors need to clarify this.</p>
              <p>This was not related to ordinal data, but to the validity of the analysis. Before doing pairwise comparisons of separate values within a variable (i.e. testing “sometimes” versus “never/rarely”) the variable “keeping 2 meters distance” should be tested for significance. The p-value for the whole variable can be calculated in two ways:</p>
              <p>1. A likelihood ratio test comparing a model containing the variable vs a model not containing the variable</p>
              <p>2. A wald test that tests the joint significance of beta1 = beta2 = 0 (where beta1 is the coefficient for sometimes and beta2 is the coefficient for most of the time/always)</p>
              <p>I believe pairwise comparisons (i.e. testing “sometimes” versus “never/rarely”) should be limited to significant variables to make sense, and the the p-value for the whole variable should be presented in the table alongside the pairwise comparisons.</p>
              <p>I have no further comments</p>
              <p>On my behalf of the co-authors, we would like to thank you for taking the time to read our revised manuscript. We are glad that you are satisfied that we have addressed the useful comments provided and that this has improved the flow and readability of the paper. </p>
              <p>Thank you for drawing further attention and providing additional clarity regarding your previous comment about the multivariable analysis. Further to the changes in revision one, we have addressed this point as you have suggested by performing a likelihood ratio test for the variable keep two metres as a whole variable i.e. survey response categories. We have assessed the goodness of fit of two alternative models including and excluding this whole variable. The output from this test shows a significantly improved difference with the inclusion of the keep two metres from staff variable (p=0.03), a variable that we found to be associated with increased likelihood of COVID-19 positive test in the school. For keep two metres from pupils, the output presents a likelihood ratio of p=0.1 (borderline significant at the 10% level), though we did not report on this variable as we found no association with outcomes in multivariable models. To ease interpretation of Odds Ratios, we created ordinal categories relating to level of exposure. </p>
              <p>We have addressed this within the manuscript, including stating within the methods, results and in the Table 3 footnote. Please find below further information of these revisions:</p>
              <p>Quantitative analysis, page 8-9, line 191-198.</p>
              <p>Items with multiple category responses or continuous numerical values were assigned ordinal categories to ease interpretation. For example survey response categories for keep two metres from pupils/staff included i) never, ii) rarely, iii) some of the time, iv) most of the time, v) always, with combined ordinal categories for analyses of i) never/rarely, ii) some of the time, iii) most of the time/always. For these variables, likelihood-ratio tests of variables as whole were performed to assess goodness of fit between models including and excluding variables for the primary outcome. </p>
              <p>Table 3, page 16, line 282-287. </p>
              <p>Univariable (model 1) and multivariable (model 2) logistic regression models of self-reported school-based mitigation measures (survey) and school-level probability of any positive COVID-19 case in school (SAIL). OR: Odds Ratio; 95% CI: 95% confidence intervals; p&lt;0.05**, p&lt;0.1*; adjusted for school size, proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals, clustered by school. Model 2 likelihood-ratio test keep two metres from pupils (p=0.1) and staff (p=0.03). See S3 Appendix for variable codebook. </p>
              <p>Finally, we have replaced 2-metre to two metre throughout the manuscript, and have updated table layouts.</p>
