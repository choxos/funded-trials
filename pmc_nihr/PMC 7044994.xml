                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In the UK and Ireland, severe and complex obesity is managed in specialist weight management services (SWMS), which provide multicomponent lifestyle interventions to support weight loss, and use of medication if available. Liraglutide 3 mg (LIRA 3 mg) is an effective weight-loss medication, but weight loss in individual patients is variable, and its efficacy has not been assessed in SWMS. This study aims to investigate whether a targeted prescribing pathway for LIRA 3 mg with multiple prespecified stopping rules could help people with severe obesity and established complications achieve ≥15% weight loss in order to determine whether this could be considered a clinically effective and cost-effective strategy for managing severe and complex obesity in SWMS.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In this 2-year, multicentre, open-label, real-world randomised controlled trial, 384 adults with severe and complex obesity (defined as body mass index ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> plus either prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea) will be randomised via a 2:1 ratio to receive either standard SWMS care (n=128) or standard SWMS care plus a targeted prescribing pathway for LIRA 3 mg with prespecified stopping rules at 16, 32 and 52 weeks (n=256).</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome is to compare the proportion of participants achieving a weight loss of ≥15% at 52 weeks with a targeted prescribing pathway versus standard care. Secondary outcomes include a comparison of (1) the weight loss maintenance at 104 weeks and (2) the budget impact and cost effectiveness between the two groups in a real-world setting.</p>

              <p>Obesity is a complex disease characterised by increased hunger and reduced satiety.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Severe and complex obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with at least one major obesity-related complication.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Around 10% of the adult population in England has a BMI ≥35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and many have established complications such as type 2 diabetes (T2D),<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> hypertension<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and sleep apnoea,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> imposing colossal direct and indirect healthcare costs.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Lifestyle interventions are considered cornerstones for the management of obesity.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Despite the impressive results from intensive lifestyle interventions in Look Ahead study,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and more recently the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DIRECT) and Counterweight-Plus studies,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> which used intensive and structured weight management programmes to achieve weight loss and T2D remission in real-life community settings, lifestyle interventions still commonly only achieve an average of 5% wt loss<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> and long-term weight maintenance remains a challenge.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Although weight loss as little as 5% does produce metabolic improvements, it is not enough to make a difference to the lives of most people with severe and complex obesity. Maximal benefits for the treatment of obesity-associated complications are obtained with weight loss above 15%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Pharmacotherapy for obesity can support some people to achieve these results,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> but currently it is not used frequently enough to be considered a cornerstone treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Severe and complex obesity is managed in specialist weight management services (SWMS) in the UK and Ireland.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 11 19 20</xref> SWMS consist of a multidisciplinary team typically led by a medical clinician with expertise in obesity management and/or a specialist dietician and supported by specialist physiotherapists, psychologists and nurses; these services offer intensive lifestyle interventions with similar components to those used by DIRECT and Look Ahead studies, and can be supported by pharmacotherapy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Orlistat is the only weight loss medication approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in SWMS; however, its side effects and limited effectiveness<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 21</xref> have reduced the penetrance of its usage. SWMS support is usually required for up to 1 year, before patients may be offered bariatric surgery.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>Liraglutide 3.0 mg (LIRA 3 mg), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogue, was approved in 2015 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of obesity in combination with lifestyle intervention after multiple, large, phase 3 randomised controlled trials demonstrated its safety and efficacy for weight loss, weight maintenance and improvement of obesity-related complications.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 22–24</xref>
</p>
              <p>The average weight loss in the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity - Liraglutide Evidence (SCALE) Obesity and Prediabetes trial at 1 year after initiation of treatment with LIRA 3 mg was 8.0%±6.7% compared with 2.6%±5.7% for patients in the placebo group.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The same data also suggest that after 1 year of therapy, LIRA 3 mg can result in ≥15% wt loss in 14% of patients, compared with 3.5% of patients treated with placebo.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Nevertheless, SCALE trials were placebo controlled, included patients with BMI as low as 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and typically combined LIRA 3 mg with moderate-intensity lifestyle interventions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 22–25</xref> These limitations make it difficult to predict the clinical effectiveness of LIRA 3 mg for the treatment of severe and complex obesity in SWMS. Addressing these limitations, Wadden <italic>et al</italic> in a pragmatic, single-centre, open-label study demonstrated that by intensifying the diet and behavioural therapy in combination with LIRA 3 mg, 28% of participants were able to achieve ≥15% wt loss at 12 months compared with 12% with intensive behavioural therapy alone.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Therefore, the current evidence suggests that LIRA 3 mg could help a number of patients with severe and complex obesity referred to SWMS to achieve significant weight reduction, and this is highly likely to generate substantial health benefits and long-term cost savings, especially if weight loss can be maintained, as demonstrated at the 3-year results of the SCALE Prediabetes study.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p>
              <p>Currently, LIRA 3 mg has not been approved by NICE for use in management of severe and complex obesity in the UK. NICE guidelines take into account both the clinical and the cost effectiveness of treatment. EMA has approved LIRA 3 mg with a single stopping rule of 5% wt loss at 16 weeks after initiation of treatment, based on a post-hoc analysis of the SCALE trials demonstrating that ‘early responders’ (defined as those achieved ≥4% wt loss after 16 weeks of LIRA 3 mg) were more likely to achieve clinically significant weight loss at 1 year compared with ‘early non-responders’ (10.8% vs 3.0% mean weight loss in those without T2D and 8.5% vs 3.1% mean weight loss in those with T2D).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Based on the EMA single stopping rule, it is estimated that 62%–77% of patients with obesity referred to SWMS will be suitable to continue long-term on LIRA 3 mg.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, only 9%–21% of those who achieve ≥5% wt loss at 16 weeks will obtain maximal benefit (≥15% wt loss) from LIRA 3 mg.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Taking into account the cost of the medication, it is unlikely that NICE or other equivalent organisations will approve long-term treatment with LIRA 3 mg for all patients who currently present for obesity treatment in SWMS and achieve the single EMA stopping rule. A different and more pragmatic use of LIRA 3 mg in SWMS is needed in order for the medication to be targeted to those who will benefit most from using it.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we describe the rationale and methodology of a study investigating the effectiveness and cost of a targeted prescribing pathway (with multiple prespecified stopping rules) for the use of LIRA 3 mg in SWMS settings for treatment of severe and complex obesity. The targeted prescribing pathway aims to optimise the use of LIRA 3 mg in ‘early responders’ (in accordance with the EMA stopping rule) to the combination of lifestyle intervention plus LIRA 3 mg as well as identifying patients who are most likely to benefit more from continued long-term prescription of LIRA 3 mg (ie, those who are able to achieve ≥15% wt loss at 1 year). This approach aims to direct the use of this medication to patients with severe and complex obesity that will have substantial benefit from it, and at the same time to optimise the health economic outcomes (cost effectiveness and budget impact of SWMS) associated with the use of LIRA 3 mg.</p>

                <p>The current study (Effectiveness and cost of integrating a pragmatic pathway for prescribing liraglutide 3.0 mg in obesity services (STRIVE study)) is a phase 4, investigator-initiated, 2-year, parallel, two group, multicentre, open-label, real-world, randomised controlled trial taking place in the UK and Ireland. The total duration of participation will be 104 weeks (±2 weeks). In total, 384 patients with severe and complex obesity who are referred to a SWMS will be randomised through a validated online system (sealedenvelope.com) provided through the Leicester Clinical Trials Unit (LCTU) in a 2:1 fashion (2 intervention: 1 control) to either the intervention (SWMS standard care plus targeted prescribing pathway) or control arm (SWMS standard care; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Randomisation will be stratified by centre and BMI (<underline>&gt;</underline>45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; &lt;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

                <p>The study is intentionally designed to reflect a pragmatic ‘real-world’ scenario and each SWMS provider may require a different number of visits for their programme. However, study appointments for data collection, medication titration reviews, application of the stopping rules of LIRA 3 mg and dispensing of the medication will be standardised for all of the study sites.</p>
                <p>The first 52 weeks of the study will determine whether using the targeted prescribing pathway of LIRA 3 mg plus standard care in a SWMS setting will result in more participants achieving ≥15% wt loss compared with participants in the control group (standard care alone). The second 52 weeks of the study will assess whether patients who lose ≥15% of their baseline weight by the first 52 weeks with the targeted prescribing pathway plus standard care are more likely to maintain ≥15% wt loss for another 52 weeks compared with patients in the control group (standard care alone) who were also able to achieve ≥15% wt loss by the first 52 weeks. Further measurements on budget impact of SWMS and cost effectiveness for both treatment groups will be assessed and compared.</p>

                <title>Control (standard care)</title>
                <p>Across the UK and Ireland, each region has a SWMS. This service includes a clinician-led multidisciplinary team approach, potentially including a specialist physician, dietitian, nurse, psychologist and physiotherapist/physical activity physiologist. The accessibility and the workflow of the SWMS are broadly similar for all the five participating sites in this study.</p>
                <p>Participants in the control group will follow the best medical care provided by the SWMS at the relevant site. This typically involves dietary advice to reduce energy intake (and may include a period using formula-diet meal replacement or total diet replacement), accompanied—if available—by a physical activity programme, both supported by behavioural change techniques with regular professional contacts. The nature of the standard care will vary between the different SWMS at each site. Clinician input will include the medical assessment of participants for severe and complex obesity and the prescription of antiobesity drugs (ie, orlistat) as per local SWMS policy. Participants will remain in the SWMS in line with NICE guidance throughout the duration of the research study. Participants may be offered treatment options within the duration of the study, including bariatric surgery, as per NICE guidance and according to the decision of the local SWMS multidisciplinary team.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis will compare the proportion of participants achieving ≥15% wt loss at 52 weeks (primary outcome) after randomisation between the two study arms using a logistic regression model with adjustment for stratification factors (site and BMI). The adjusted proportion (95% CI) of participants achieving ≥15% wt loss will be estimated by group. The primary analysis will be based on the complete case population. This is defined as all randomised participants who have data available for the outcome being analysed, according to the study group to which they were randomised at baseline.</p>
                <p>The secondary analyses of the primary outcome will be based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analyses. The ITT population is defined as all randomised participants in the study and the per protocol population is defined as all randomised participants who were compliant with their treatment group. Treatment compliance for the control group is defined as completion at least 70% of the planned contacts in the SWMS. Participants in the intervention group are defined as treatment compliant if they complete at least 70% of the planned contacts in the SWMS, and take at least 70% of their planned doses of LIRA 3 mg as stipulated by the prescribing pathway. In all analyses, participants will be analysed within the treatment arm to which they were allocated at baseline. More specifically, participants within the intervention group who were taken off LIRA 3 mg due to prespecified stopping rule will remain in the intervention group. Participants who have undergone bariatric surgery during the first 52 weeks of the study will be excluded from the complete cases population analysis (primary analysis) and the per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome (but they will be included at the ITT analysis). Missing primary outcome data will be imputed for the ITT analyses; categorically, we will classify those participants as ‘non-responders’ (did not achieve ≥15% wt loss at 52 weeks). The characteristics of those with missing outcome data will be compared with those who have completed follow-up.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes measured at 52 and 104 weeks will be analysed based on the complete cases population. Binary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression models and summarised using proportion (95% CI). Continuous outcomes will be compared using linear regression models and summarised as mean with standard deviation (95% CI). If continuous outcomes are non-normally distributed, the most suitable regression model will be selected. Only the complete cases population will be used for the secondary outcomes to reduce the number of models. Participants who have undergone bariatric surgery during the first 52 weeks of the study will be excluded from the analyses for secondary outcomes at 52 weeks. Moreover, participants who have undergone bariatric surgery during the study period will be excluded from the analyses for secondary outcomes at 104 weeks. Data on treatment adherence, safety (including AEs), and treatment satisfaction will be summarised and tabulated.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will perform a responder analysis which will repeat the analyses of the secondary outcomes with the intervention group restricted to those participants who responded to the targeted prescribing pathway (those achieving ≥15% wt loss at 52 weeks after randomisation). This allows us to statistically compare the outcomes of ‘super’ responders within the targeted prescribing pathway to all the participants who received standard care in the control group.</p>

                <title>Health economic input</title>
                <p>A state-transition Markov cohort model has been developed for the cost-effectiveness analysis, with health states encompassing the possible comorbidities associated with obesity and documented to respond to weight loss. A thorough review of the literature was conducted to identify such conditions and inform transition probabilities in the model.</p>
                <p>The model projects development of T2DM, myocardial infarction, stroke, asthma cancer or mortality in the long term (up to lifetime horizon) based on short-term effects of interventions in surrogate outcomes—BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and (for patients with T2D) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Effects on surrogate outcomes are translated into lifetime risks through risk-prediction models.</p>
                <p>Treatment effects are applied incrementally to the efficacy of the targeted prescribing pathway group. Effect on weight, in terms of BMI % reduction, is applied at every subsequent cycle starting from 3 months after treatment start for as long as the cohort remains on treatment and over the predefined catch-up time post treatment. Note that a natural increase in weight is applied each year to all interventions considered, including no treatment.</p>
                <p>Treatment can be discontinued at 16 weeks, 32 weeks or at 52 weeks (based on the prespecified stopping rule). Discontinuation causes the cohort to receive the standard care provided via the SWMS at the control group. Thus, if the discontinuation is allowed at 16 weeks, ‘non-responders’ will have the same effect of the cohort in the control group, and ‘responders’ will have the effect of the targeted prescribing pathway in the clinical trial.</p>
                <p>Discontinuation of treatment beyond 52 weeks causes BMI, and other cardiometabolic risk factors, to revert to the levels projected under the no treatment option. Reversal takes place over a given number of cycles (years). Costs and quality-of-life outcomes are applied to the health state in which the cohort resides at each particular moment in time or once off to events. Costs and health benefits (life years, quality-adjusted life years, years T2D free, years cancer free, etc.) are summed up for the time horizon of the model and results reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The risk of acquiring obesity-related comorbidities has been taken from published epidemiological studies.</p>
