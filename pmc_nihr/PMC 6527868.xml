                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Dopamine is a key modulator of striatal function and learning and might improve motor recovery after stroke. Previous small trials of dopamine agonists after stroke provide equivocal evidence of effectiveness on improving motor recovery. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of co-careldopa plus routine occupational and physical therapy during early rehabilitation after stroke.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of co-careldopa versus placebo in addition to routine NHS occupational and physical therapy was done at 51 UK NHS acute inpatient stroke rehabilitation services. We recruited patients with new or recurrent clinically diagnosed ischaemic or haemorrhagic (excluding subarachnoid haemorrhage) stroke 5â42 days before randomisation, who were unable to walk 10 m or more, had a score of less than 7 points on the Rivermead Mobility Index, were expected to need rehabilitation, and were able to access rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. Participants were assigned (1:1) using stratified random blocks to receive 6 weeks of oral co-careldopa or matched placebo in addition to routine NHS physiotherapy and occupational therapy. The initial two doses of co-careldopa were 62Â·5 mg (50 mg of levodopa and 12Â·5 mg of carbidopa) and the remaining doses were 125 mg (100 mg of levodopa and 25 mg of carbidopa). Participants were required to take a single oral tablet 45â60 min before physiotherapy or occupational therapy session. The primary outcome was ability to walk independently, defined as a Rivermead Mobility Index score of 7 or more, at 8 weeks. Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN99643613.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between May 30, 2011, and March 28, 2014, of 1574 patients found eligible, 593 (mean age 68Â·5 years) were randomly assigned to either the co-careldopa group (n=308) or to the placebo group (n=285), on an average 18 days after stroke onset. Primary outcome data were available for all 593 patients. We found no evidence that the ability to walk independently improved with co-careldopa (125 [41%] of 308 patients) compared with placebo (127 [45%] of 285 patients; odds ratio 0Â·78 [95% CI 0Â·53â1Â·15]) at 8 weeks. Mortality at 12 months did not differ between the two groups (22 [7%] vs 17 [6%]). Serious adverse events were largely similar between groups. Vomiting during therapy sessions, after taking the study drug, was the most frequent adverse event and was more frequent in the co-careldopa group than the placebo group (19 [6Â·2%] <italic>vs</italic> 9 [3Â·2%]).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Co-careldopa in addition to routine occupational and physical therapy does not seem to improve walking after stroke. Further research might identify subgroups of patients with stroke who could benefit from dopaminergic therapy at different doses or times after stroke with more intensive motor therapy.</p>

              <p id="para200">Studies of the brain structures involved in learning suggest that the basal ganglia and dopamine play a key part in the acquisition of motor skills. Dopamine is a key modulator of striatal function and might contribute to motor recovery after stroke.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Preclinical studies<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> suggest that the potential mechanisms of action of dopamine in improving motor learning are through potentiating drive and arousal in conditioned learning and up-regulation of glutaminergic transmission, which modulates synaptic efficacy. Levodopa is an orally-administered dopamine precursor that crosses the bloodâbrain barrier before being metabolised to dopamine. Co-careldopa is an established treatment for Parkinson's disease that combines levodopa with carbidopa, a peripheral DOPA-decarboxylase inhibitor that maximises the central bioavailability of levodopa.</p>
              <p id="para210">One systematic review<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> of clinical trials investigated the use of dopamine agonists to enhance motor recovery from stroke and concluded that the evidence was insufficient.

                  <p id="para240">We did a systematic search of MEDLINE (1946âSept 25, 2015), Embase (1996âWeek 42, 2014), Embase Classic (1947âSept 25, 2015), PsychINFO (1806âSept 25, 2015), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews assessing dopaminergic therapy on motor recovery after stroke. The search included expanded terms relating to âstrokeâ, âdopamineâ, and ârehabilitationâ (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Only one systematic review had examined the use of dopamine agonists to enhance motor recovery from stroke in humans. Two studies concerning the use of levodopa met the review inclusion criteria, neither of which showed evidence of a positive treatment effect with this drug. Seven other trials, not cited by the systematic review, addressed this question. These trials were of variable quality and reported mixed results. Many were limited by small sample sizes (n=10â100) or comparatively short follow-ups (15â180 days), or only single doses of co-careldopa were administered. Some recruited patients months or years after stroke. Several trials showed benefits of dopamine on motor outcomes; however, others found no improvement. These disparate findings have not thus far addressed the question whether pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic systems could be used to enhance the reacquisition of motor skills after stroke.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of the study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para260">We found no evidence that combining dopaminergic therapy with routine NHS occupational and physical therapy was effective in improving walking after stroke. Our study was limited by the 10% of patients who were lost to follow-up at 8 weeks; less than 10% of patients met the strict definition to be included in per-protocol analysis of the primary outcome; and the intensity of therapy delivered in DARS could have been insufficient. Despite these limitations, the findings seem to be robust and generalisable to patients with limited mobility in the first few weeks after stroke.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para280">The findings of our study appear consistent with smaller studies of dopaminergic therapy. A formal meta-analysis of trials of dopaminergic therapy in stroke recovery has not been done and given the wide range of different outcome measures in populations of patients with stroke recruited at different times after stroke, it might not be justified. Further research is needed to develop imaging and clinical markers that will allow identification of promising drug therapies that might enhance motor therapy for improving walking ability and arm function after stroke. Subgroups of patients with stroke who might benefit from dopaminergic therapy at different doses or times after stroke with more intensive motor therapy need to be identified.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para290">To optimise efficacy of dopaminergic therapy and minimise adverse effects, administering levodopa before motor therapy to enhance brain dopamine concentrations during therapy is a logical strategy. We hypothesised that elevating central dopaminergic activity during motor therapy early after stroke onset would improve motor recovery, when the potential for recovery might be greater.</p>
              <p id="para300">The DARS trial aims to assess whether giving a combination of co-careldopa for up to 6 weeks with routine occupational and physical therapy during early rehabilitation after stroke enhances the effect of conventional rehabilitation on the ability to walk independently for 10 m or more.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>

                <p id="para340">Participants received either co-careldopa (Sinemet) or matching placebo before routine therapy sessions, for a maximum of 6 weeks. The content and number of sessions was variable according to patient need and was decided as part of the routine management of the patient. The initial two co-careldopa doses were both 62Â·5 mg (levodopa 50 mg; carbidopa 12Â·5 mg) and subsequent doses were 125 mg (levodopa 100 mg; carbidopa 25 mg). Participants took the study drug orally 45â60 min before physical therapy or occupational therapy sessions directed at motor skills (walking, transfers, dressing). Therapy staff recorded details of every therapy session delivered from day of randomisation to the last administration of co-careldopa or placebo or 6 weeks post-randomisation (whichever was sooner). This included timing of drug administration in relation to therapy, duration of therapy session (overall and by activity), and role of therapist present. Patients might not have been able to take the drug 45â60 min before the start of a therapy session. In these situations, the drug was administered immediately before the start of a session.</p>
                <p id="para350">Baseline data were collected by the clinical research team from clinical records and via face-to-face administration of the questionnaires. All baseline data were collected before randomisation. Follow-up data and safety data were collected at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, face-to-face, in the participant's home, at the hospital, or at a community facility. Data were recorded on paper case report forms provided by the Clinical Trials Research Unit.

Since trial monitoring indicated that the combined mortality rate and loss to follow-up was likely to exceed 10%, the sample size was increased to 590â600 participants.</p>
                <p id="para400">We based analyses on the intention-to-treat population (ITT), with significance assessed at the 5% level. We included all randomly assigned participants in the primary ITT analysis, assuming those participants who died or were lost to follow-up were unable to walk independently. We used a multilevel logistic regression model, adjusting for stratification variables: age, sex, type of stroke, RMI baseline score, centre (fitted as a random effect), baseline prestroke NEADL and Barthel Index scores, and number of days from stroke to randomisation. We report parameter estimates or odds ratios (ORs), with 95% CIs and p values (fixed effects) or SEs (random effects). Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the primary analysis. We included all randomly assigned participants in the safety analyses.</p>
                <p id="para410">We analysed independent walking ability at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation in a similar way. We used stepwise multilevel linear regression to analyse secondary endpoints, except for mRS, for which we used a stepwise multilevel proportional odds logistic regression model. We used further analyses to assess the sensitivity of the conclusions of this analysis to non-compliance, using a staged definition based on whether and when the drug was taken, the amount of motor therapy, and the number of sessions.</p>
                <p id="para420">We estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the UK health and social care perspective over 12 months using the within-trial economic evaluation. We based costs on a resource use questionnaire and utility derived from the European Quality of LifeâFive Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) measure. We used multiple imputation to handle missing data. Non-parametric bootstrapping characterised uncertainty in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. All analyses were completed in SAS software, version 9.2.</p>

The co-careldopa group reported better mood with a 1Â·3 point difference in the GHQ-12 at 6 months, compared with the placebo group, but not at 8 weeks or 12 months. Carers in the co-careldopa group reported less burden at 8 weeks (CBS mean difference â4Â·55 points [95% CI â0Â·14 to â8Â·96]; p=0Â·043), 6 months (â4Â·99 [â0Â·17 to â9Â·81]; p=0Â·042), and 12 months (â7Â·17 [â1Â·70 to â12Â·64]; p=0Â·011). Responses from carers were obtained in under half of study participants and numbers varied at each timepoint (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). During the 12-month follow up, the proportion of participants reporting no psychological distress seemed to improve from around a third to almost half of patients in both placebo and co-careldopa treated groups. An increase in the proportion of participants who were able to walk was observed at 6 months in both groups. Little further change was observed at 12 months in either of the groups. As expected, NEADL scores at 8 weeks after randomisation were lower than the prestroke scores in both groups (patients were asked their prestroke status). As for physical function, improvement in NEADL scores was seen at 6 months. ABILHAND scores showed a similar pattern of improvement. Good functional independence (mRS score of 0â2) at 8 weeks was achieved in less than a fifth of participants in both groups. Musculoskeletal pain was reported by two thirds of participants at 8 weeks in both groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p>

              <p id="para510">The DARS study found no evidence of improvement in walking ability when combining dopaminergic therapy with motor therapy after acute stroke. Although just over 10% patients were lost to follow-up, the findings are likely to be robust and generalisable to patients with limited mobility in the first few weeks after stroke. A greater proportion of patients achieved the primary outcome of independent walking at 8 weeks in the placebo group than was anticipated in comparison to a previous study (44% <italic>vs</italic> 26%).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> This result is most likely to be due to recruitment of participants at an earlier time after stroke onset in DARS at an average of 18 days compared with 43 days.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> A range of secondary outcomes in DARS showed no suggestion of benefit on arm function, disability, activities of daily living, or cognition. Co-careldopa had an acceptable safety profile. Vomiting, a known side-effect of levodopa, was uncommon but more frequent with co-careldopa than with placebo.</p>
              <p id="para520">Levodopa was chosen from several other potential drug therapies, such as amphetamines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), because levodopa has a better safety profile than amphetamines and was considered to have stronger basis for a purported mechanism of action on motor learning than SSRIs.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para530">Strengths of the trial are the double-blind, placebo-controlled design, large participant recruitment from multiple NHS stroke services, and good adherence with study treatment and therapy sessions, with over 80% of participants receiving at least 20 min of motor therapy in over 80% of therapy sessions. Although 60% more placebo patients received sufficient motor therapy, fewer than 10% of patients met the prespecified per-protocol analysis criteria mainly due to participants taking the trial medication outside the specified 45â60 min window before therapy. This criterion was, in retrospect, too strict because serum levodopa concentration would be elevated at the target concentration for a wider time window of 30â120 min. Future trials of combined timed drug and therapy might consider the use of less strict criteria for per-protocol analyses.</p>
              <p id="para540">A limitation of the trial was the loss to follow up at 8 weeks. The primary ITT analysis made the assumption that those participants with missing outcome data did not achieve the primary outcome (ie, walking independently). Sensitivity analyses testing the robustness of this assumption did not alter the ITT analysis conclusion.</p>
              <p id="para550">A possible explanation for the absence of a significant response to co-careldopa is the use of intermittent rather than sustained daily dosing, as was used in previous trials, including a positive small trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> that used 3 weeks' continuous levodopa therapy. An intermittent dosing strategy was chosen with the intention of maximising brain dopamine concentrations during therapy and reducing the risk of adverse effects and patient withdrawal. Higher doses of co-careldopa might be beneficial for some patients but could potentially lead to more adverse effects. The dose used in the trial produces clinical benefits in Parkinson's disease.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Future phase 2 trials of recovery-enhancing drugs might usefully compare intermittent versus daily dosing in terms of tolerability and clinical measures of recovery.</p>
              <p id="para560">Another possible hypothesis for the absence of response to co-careldopa is that the intensity of therapy delivered in DARS was insufficient. However, DARS participants received the 16 h recommended from a systematic review of augmented therapy time.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para570">DARS enrolled more participants with stroke than all previous studies of dopaminergic therapy combined. The results are consistent with these smaller studies.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A formal meta-analysis of trials of dopaminergic therapy in stroke recovery has not been done and, given the wide range of different outcome measures in populations of patients with stroke recruited at different times after stroke, might not be appropriate. Of the seven reported randomised trials, three showed no benefit on motor function,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> two showed improvements in walking speed<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> or procedural motor learning,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and one slightly larger study showed a slight improvement in disability.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> One trial<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> showed that 100 mg of levodopa administered daily had a benefit on walking in 53 participants, with a significant increase in Rivermead Motor Assessment score of 2Â·3 points after 3 weeks compared with placebo. This trial involved more frequent daily physical therapy.</p>
              <p id="para580">Future research of pharmacotherapy and stroke recovery should consider incorporation of potential proof of concept imaging biomarkers, such as fMRI (laterality index) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (motor evoked potentials) measures, into early phase trials.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Future research is needed into the development of more sensitive clinical markers of motor recovery that would show proof-of-concept efficacy on neurological impairment in early phase trials before doing large pragmatic trials with activity and disability measures as the primary trial outcome.</p>
              <p id="para590">DARS is the largest, multicentre, stroke rehabilitation trial to combine timed administration of a masked investigational medicinal product with therapy sessions. This approach required a high degree of coordination of drug administration with planned therapy and was successfully delivered with support from research teams from the National Institute for Health Research Stroke Research Network. DARS has shown that it is feasible to deliver multicentre trials of pharmacotherapy-enhanced rehabilitation in NHS stroke services but highlights the challenges involved in multicentre trials in delivering combined drug and motor therapy at an intensity recommended by expert guidelines. Although we found no evidence of dopaminergic therapy in conjunction with motor therapy improving walking after stroke, the learning and experience from DARS has lessons for the design and conduct of future rehabilitation multicentre trials investigating the effect of drugs to enhance recovery.</p>
