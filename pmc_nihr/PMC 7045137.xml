                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy are the key markers of hypertensive target organ damage (TOD) associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We have previously shown that dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation lowers blood pressure (BP) in hypertension, however, whether this approach might also improve markers of hypertensive TOD is unknown. In this study, we will investigate whether daily dietary inorganic nitrate administration reduces LV mass and improves measures of arterial stiffness.</p>

                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p>NITRATE-TOD is a double-blind, randomised, single-centre, placebo-controlled phase II trial aiming to enrol 160 patients with suboptimal BP control on one or more antihypertensives. Patients will be randomised to receive 4 months once daily dose of either nitrate-rich beetroot juice or nitrate-deplete beetroot juice (placebo). The primary outcomes are reduction in LV mass and reduction in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central BP.</p>
                  <p>The study has a power of 95% for detecting a 9 g LV mass change by cardiovascular MRI (~6% change for a mildly hypertrophied heart of 150 g). For PWV, we have a power of &gt;95% for detecting a 0.6 m/s absolute change. For central systolic BP, we have a&gt;90% power to detect a 5.8 mm Hg difference in central systolic BP.</p>
                  <p>Secondary end points include change in ultrasound flow-mediated dilation, change in plasma nitrate and nitrite concentration and change in BP.</p>

              <p>Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In 2016, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs, which represents 31% of all global deaths.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Approximately half of these deaths were caused by complications from hypertension.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Hence, novel and cost-effective therapeutic strategies continue to be sought. In this regard, there has been a major emphasis to increase vegetable intake since increased consumption of a vegetable-rich diet particularly green leafy vegetables confers protection against CVD, including the lowering of blood pressure (BP).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> One particular constituent of such vegetables that has been proposed to underlie the beneficial effects of this food group is inorganic nitrate; through bioconversion to nitrite, and then nitrite to nitric oxide (NO)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> in the body. Importantly, provision of inorganic nitrate to hypertensive patients causes a rise in plasma nitrate and is associated with a decrease in BP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>

              <p>Dietary inorganic nitrate once ingested rapidly enters the circulation<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> with a proportion of this nitrate being extracted and then secreted and concentrated in the saliva.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Bacteria residing in the oral cavity convert this nitrate to nitrite which is then swallowed<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; appearing soon after within the circulation. We have recently shown that daily supplementation with dietary nitrate (providing approximately 6.4 mmol nitrate daily) for 4 weeks was associated with robust, sustained and clinically meaningful reductions in BP (measured by clinic, ambulatory and home methods) of ~8/4 mm Hg.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, persistent hypertension leads to both vascular and cardiac remodelling and whether inorganic nitrate-induced reductions in BP might be associated with improvements in either of these in the long term is unknown. Experimentally in patients one can assess this potential through the measurement of arterial stiffness and left ventricular (LV) mass, respectively, with increases of either conferring increased CV risk. Arterial stiffness (and its inverse measure, distensibility) refers to the decreased elasticity that develops in arteries as a consequence of vascular remodelling resulting from alterations of the fibrous components of the extracellular matrix (including elastin and collagen).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Importantly, increased arterial stiffness, as measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> is a strong predictor of CV events,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and there have been suggestions that drug development targeting this phenomenon is likely to provide a new genre of therapeutics in the combat against CVD.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Additionally, an increased central pulse pressure occurs when the large conduit blood vessels lose their elasticity and become less able to accommodate all of the blood ejected from the heart. This increase in pressure results in an increase in central systolic BP and causes an increase in the stress imposed on the left ventricle, which in turn can result in LV hypertrophy (LVH).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Elevated LV mass is an initial compensatory mechanism to normalise wall stress due to elevated BP. However, this cardiac remodelling eventually becomes maladaptive with an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, cardiac chamber dilation, reduced LV contractility and progressive deterioration to heart failure.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The measure of LVH as a prognostic indicator of adverse outcome was first convincingly identified in the Framingham study,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and numerous studies since have confirmed the strong relationship between LVH and CV events and mortality.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Perhaps, more importantly, LV mass reduction is associated with further improvements in CV outcomes.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref>
</p>
              <p>It has been proposed that insufficient supply of endogenous NO likely contributes to the progression and worsening of arterial stiffness and LVH.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Preclinical studies have demonstrated that an elevation of systemic nitrite levels reduces cardiac hypertrophy in mice.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Moreover, administration of inorganic nitrate reduces PWV healthy volunteers and hypertensive patients in short-term studies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 27</xref> It is also possible that decreasing arterial stiffness improves ventricular–arterial coupling which might result in benefits in cardiac function.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p>
              <p>The objective of this study is to determine whether a dietary nitrate intervention might elevate the levels of NO in the body sufficiently to alter both heart and blood vessel remodelling in hypertensive patients with suboptimal BP control.</p>

For PWA, the pulse wave will be recorded from the brachial cuff applied to the non-dominant arm. For PWV, the pulse wave will be simultaneously recorded from the carotid and femoral site using an oscillometric method. A small, inflatable neck pad will be placed directly over a carotid artery and secured around the neck by a Velcro tab and a cuff will also be placed around the patient’s ipsilateral upper thigh. Both carotid and femoral cuffs will be simultaneously inflated automatically to 65 mm Hg and the corresponding oscillometric signal from each cuff digitally analysed to extract the pulse time delay. To estimate the aortic length, the distance between the sternal notch and the thigh cuff will be measured. From these measurements, PWV can be derived as PWV=aortic distance/pulse time delay.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>

Images will be magnified with a resolution box function and images of the brachial artery acquired continuously using semi-automated edge detection software (FMD Studio, Quipu s.r.l, Pisa, Italy) and analysed in real time. An automatic mathematical contour tracking operator locates the pulsed-wave Doppler of the brachial artery, which will be used to measure the diameter and blood flow velocity continuously for 1 min at baseline, then during 5 min of reduced blood flow (induced by inflation to 300 mm Hg of a pneumatic cuff placed on the right forearm site distal to the segment of artery being analysed), and finally for a further 5 min during the reactive hyperaemia following cuff release. FMD is defined as the maximum percentage increase in vessel diameter during the reactive hyperaemia. This procedure will be performed at visit 1 (baseline) and visit 3 (16 weeks). In some volunteers, following FMD, 0.4 mg of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate will be administered at visit 1 and visit 3 to determine whether changes in FMD responses following intervention might be due to changes in smooth muscle reactivity.</p>
