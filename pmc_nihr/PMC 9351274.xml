                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Various washout policies are widely used in adults living with long-term catheters (LTC). There is currently insufficient evidence on the benefits and potential harms of prophylactic LTC washout policies in the prevention of blockages and other LTC-related adverse events, such as urinary tract infections. CATHETER II tests the hypothesis that weekly prophylactic LTC washouts (normal saline or citric acid) in addition to standard LTC care reduce the incidence of catheter blockage requiring intervention compared to standard LTC care only in adults living with LTC.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">CATHETER II is a pragmatic three-arm open multi-centre superiority randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot, economic analysis, and embedded qualitative study. Eligible participants are adults aged ≥ 18 years, who have had a LTC in use for ≥ 28 days, have no plans to discontinue the use of the catheter, are able to undertake the catheter washouts, and complete trial documentation or have a carer able to help them. Participants are identified from general practitioner practices, secondary/tertiary care, community healthcare, care homes, and via public advertising strategies. Participants are randomised 1:1:1 to receive a weekly saline (0.9%) washout in addition to standard LTC care, a weekly citric acid (3.23%) washout in addition to standard LTC care or standard LTC care only. Participants and/or carers will receive training to administer the washouts. Patient-reported outcomes are collected at baseline and for 24 months post-randomisation. The primary clinical outcome is catheter blockage requiring intervention up to 24 months post-randomisation expressed per 1000 catheter days. Secondary outcomes include symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infection requiring antibiotics, catheter change, adverse events, NHS/ healthcare use, and impact on quality of life.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par25">Long-term catheters (LTC) are used by patients with conditions such as intractable urinary incontinence or chronic urinary retention to empty the bladder. Chronic urinary retention can be secondary to a variety of conditions such as enlarged prostate, underactive bladder, and neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) CG139 recommends an indwelling catheter for those who are unable to perform intermittent catheterisation or those for whom toileting is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The indwelling catheter may be inserted into the urinary bladder via the urethra (urethral catheter) or via the anterior abdominal wall (suprapubic catheter). The urine is either drained into a catheter bag or emptied when convenient with the use of a catheter valve. Current NHS standard care includes a change of the catheter bag or valve every week by the patient, or carer, and a change of the catheter every 4–12 weeks by the clinical team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">There is no robust evidence to support a definition for the duration of catheter stay that constitutes “long-term” catheter use. Evidence from a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] indicate that most studies defined LTC use as urethral or supra-pubic catheter in situ for &gt; 28 days with predicted use over 6–12 months. This definition was also used in the NICE CG139 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. LTC use may be for many years, Wilde et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported a mean duration of six years in 202 participants (median 3.25 years).</p>
                <p id="Par27">The exact prevalence of LTC use is not known. It was estimated that between 0.2–0.5% of the general population of the United Kingdom (UK) are living with a LTC (unpublished data, Farrer B, Norris S, 2018; personal communication, NIHR Clinical Research Network, NHS Research Scotland Primary Care Network). New evidence estimates the prevalence in the UK at approximately 90,000 LTC users (or 0.14% of the overall population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is anticipated that LTC use will continue to increase with the increasing ageing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">LTC can be associated with several adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which affect the daily life of patients and can consume substantial NHS resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Wilde et al. reported typical adverse events of LTC blockage (34% of participants): symptomatic catheter-associated urinary tract infections (S-CAUTI), whether or not this has been proven bacteriologically (57%); accidental dislodgment (28%); urinary leakage (67%); bladder spasms (59%); kinks/twists (42%) and pain (49%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">LTC blockages often occur secondary to the formation of encrustations on the luminal and outer surfaces of the catheter, with an incidence of 40–50% in patients in most studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Wilde et al. in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] assessed 202 patients with LTC over 12 months and showed that 34% of patients reported blockage and a rate of 8.54/1000 days of catheter use. Catheter blockage is considered a medical emergency and can lead to distress, autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injury at or above T6, increased healthcare utilisation and urosepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Current best practice for the management of LTC blockage requires a regular (and more frequent) change of the catheter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Catheter washouts are often used in these cases despite the lack of evidence on their benefit, potential harm, best solution to be used, appropriate volume and frequency, and individual impact on quality of life among patients with LTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Several catheter washouts policies are used in clinical practice for the prevention and/or management of LTC blockage. Washouts used are of different types (normal saline, acidic, antimicrobial), volumes and frequency of administration. The Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] assessed the best available evidence and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether prophylactic catheter washout policies had a beneficial or harmful effect on any of the outcomes in patients with LTC. The authors recommended a rigorous and methodologically robust randomised controlled trial to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of washout policies in patients with LTC.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Muncie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] compared saline washouts versus no washouts policy over 24 weeks in a limited population and showed no significant differences in S-CAUTI per 100 days of catheter use. Concerns exist that the use of washouts can damage the bladder mucosa and possibly increase the risk of S-CAUTI. NICE CG139 recommend that “[catheter] washouts must not be used to prevent catheter-associated infections” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par32">In CATHETER II, researchers will evaluate what is the clinical and cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability and satisfaction, and safety of weekly prophylactic catheter washout policies in addition to standard LTC care compared to standard LTC care only, in adults living with LTC.</p>

Participants and/or their relatives, friends, or other informal carers will receive training to administer catheter washouts from an appropriately trained member of the local study team to enable them to self-administer the washouts in accordance with best practice. Training is provided with either face-to-face or by video/phone consultation and is supported with an online training video and hardcopy instructions for use with troubleshooting advice. If a health professional usually changes the catheter bag or valve for a participant and capacity and capability allows, they will be asked to undertake training and perform the washout within the study. The washouts are couriered directly to the participant from the trial office.</p>

                <p id="Par95">We have used information from a survey of experts and patients and also from available literature to decide that for washouts to be worthwhile there must be a reduction in LTC blockage of 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (and personal communication, Cambridge PPI group survey). In our case, this would be a reduction in the rate of blockage from 11.8 per 1000 days (unpublished data, Farrer B, Norris S, 2018) to 8.9 per 1000 days. Participants will be followed up for 2 years. The trial has a 90% power and a significance level of 2.5%. The number of blockages has a negative binomial distribution with a dispersion parameter of 0.6. Recruiting 200 participants per arm allows for approximately 50 out of 730 loss to follow-up days. All available days of follow-up are to be used.

Potential participants may be identified by database searches; A&amp;E or in urology, neurorehabilitation and care of the elderly outpatient clinics and wards; and from continence clinics and district nurse and community nurse teams. Potential participants are approached and provided with an invitation letter and a short patient information leaflet. A follow-up telephone call or reminder letter may be sent. In care homes, the care home manager identifies potentially eligible individuals who are approached and provided with a patient information leaflet. Across all settings, a study poster may be displayed as a resource to support recruitment.</p>
                <p id="Par97">Participants may also be recruited through research registries and advertising campaigns utilising methods such as social media, mainstream media, websites and newsletters and with the support of digital marketing agencies. Potential participants identified in this way are referred to a suitable local recruiting site, if one is available, or recruited centrally with all study activities delivered remotely and with clinical oversight by the chief investigator.</p>
                <p id="Par98">All participants are provided with a full patient information leaflet. Eligibility is confirmed and consent is taken prior to baseline data collection and randomisation.</p>

                  <p id="Par133">In CATHETER II, serious adverse events (SAEs) are recorded from each participant from the time a participant consents to joining the study until their last trial follow-up. The occurrence of SAEs is queried by the site at every contact with the participant or the person carrying out the washout. An event must be serious and related to the catheter or the catheter washout procedure to be considered an SAE in CATHETER II. In addition, all deaths by any cause are recorded as SAEs in CATHETER II. Adverse events captured as outcome measures (for example, catheter blockage) for the study are not reported through SAE processes. Any hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation planned prior to randomisation, for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition or due to events captured as outcome measures are not recorded as SAEs. The investigator (or delegate) reviews appropriate documentation related to the SAE and records the details on the SAE form. If an SAE is recorded on a participant questionnaire, the trial office liaises with the clinical team to obtain further information if appropriate. The seriousness, relatedness and expectedness of the event are evaluated by the Investigator or the CI or delegate. If an event is confirmed as being a related and unexpected SAE, the trial office notifies the sponsor within 24 h and the CI (or delegate) reports any related and unexpected SAEs to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) within 15 days of the CI being aware of the event. All SAEs are regularly reported in progress reports to the REC, funder, DMC and TSC.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par137">Catheter care pathways are complex and heterogenous across the UK, with varying involvement and responsibilities for prescriptions, catheter changes and clinical management across GP practices, district and community nurses, secondary/tertiary care and social care. The CATHETER II study adopts multiple recruitment strategies to identify and recruit potentially eligible participants.</p>
              <p id="Par138">Recruitment to the study was temporarily paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adaptations made to the study protocol to limit face-to-face contact, minimise the risk to participants and research staff and resume recruitment included: the use of post and telephone for consent and baseline data collection; the training of participants and/or their carer to administer washouts by video consultation (where possible); the adoption of local/NHS infection control policy where face to face training to administer washouts is required; optional baseline urine dipstick pH test with participants provided with testing kits and instructions to self-perform the test; and pre-recorded webinars replacing site initiation visits. Follow-up proceeds by post and telephone as per the original protocol. At the time of submission of this publication, the study continues to be delivered in accordance with these COVID-19 pandemic adaptations.</p>
              <p id="Par139">A 2019 qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] cited potential recruitment barriers in a hypothetical clinical trial comparing regular catheter washouts against standard care. One barrier is patients being unwilling to change their current catheter care if they are happy with how it is currently managed. The CATHETER II protocol permits changes to washout policy if clinically necessary. Another cited recruitment barrier is the complex health issues/co-morbidities in the study population with these patients often not having time to commit to research. CATHETER II minimises face-to-face clinical visits, with nearly all study activities delivered remotely by post, phone and videocall. Feedback from sites to date indicates that these barriers remain an issue for a proportion of potential participants.</p>
              <p id="Par140">No other robust randomised controlled trials investigating the study question are published or in progress. The research question remains a very important clinical dilemma for patients, clinicians, nursing organisations and NHS policymakers.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par141">Recruitment commenced on 12 December 2019. Recruitment to the trial was paused on 16 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and re-opened to recruitment in September 2020. Due to ongoing delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not possible to provide an approximate end date for the recruitment. The current protocol is version 10, 07 March 2022.</p>
