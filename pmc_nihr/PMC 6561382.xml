                  <p>The Its Not JUST Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Study (INJUSTIS) is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study. The aims of this study are to identify genetic, serum and other biomarkers that may identify specific molecular mechanisms, reflecting disease endotypes that are shared among patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis regardless of aetiology. Furthermore, it is anticipated that these biomarkers will help predict fibrotic activity that may identify patterns of disease behaviour with greater accuracy than current clinical phenotyping.</p>

                  <p>200 participants with the multidisciplinary team confirmed fibrotic lung disease (50 each of rheumatoid-interstitial lung disease (ILD), asbestosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and unclassifiable ILD) and 50 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis participants, recruited as positive controls, will be followed up for 2 years. Participants will have blood samples, lung function tests, quality of life questionnaires and a subgroup will be offered bronchoscopy. Participants will also be given the option of undertaking blinded home handheld spirometry for the first 3 months of the study. The primary end point will be identification of a biomarker that predicts disease progression, defined as 10% relative change in forced vital capacity (FVC) or death at 12 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a group of immunoinflammatory and fibrotic diseases of the lung parenchyma. In a substantial number of patients there is progressive fibrosis of the alveoli and interstitium that leads to increasing disability and ultimately the death of patients with these diseases. Establishing the aetiology of these fibrotic lung diseases is often a clinical challenge and the relevance of aetiology to disease behaviour remains controversial. The best characterised fibrotic ILD is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which has a median survival of 3 years, and 5-year survival of 25%, which is worse than most cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Other conditions characterised by progressive pulmonary fibrosis include asbestosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD), where the aetiology is assumed, and unclassifiable ILD where the clinical phenotype does not precisely reflect IPF.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The progression of these related conditions is also remorseless, and their genetic predisposition similar to IPF, raising the possibility of shared targetable mechanisms across disease phenotypes regardless of likely aetiology.</p>
              <p>Recently two drugs, pirfenidone<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and nintedanib,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have been approved for the treatment of IPF. While these drugs are described as âanti-fibroticâ, they can only be prescribed for IPF, rather than all forms of progressive fibrotic disease.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, patients with pulmonary fibrosis where the aetiology has been assumed, or the clinical features arenât specific for IPF, cannot receive antifibrotic therapy at the current time. However, the risk factors and molecular pathways driving fibrosis in aetiologically defined or phenotypically unusual pulmonary fibrosis may be similar to IPF, thus potentially resulting in a large number of patients not having access to life-prolonging therapy. Our understanding of IPF has improved significantly both in terms of biomarkers<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> and clinical end points.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of non-IPF ILD, with currently no approved treatments or cure.</p>
              <p>RA-ILD, seen in 5%â10% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis remains a significant life-limiting complication with mortality in excess of 10% compared with patients without ILD. Subclinical interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are seen in 30%â50% but individual risk of progression to ILD is unknown.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Chronic HP diagnosis rests on history of antigen exposure and radiological appearance, which often has an overlap with other ILDs. Sometimes, there is no known antigen exposure, and more recent hypotheses suggest a combination of exposure in genetically predisposed individuals.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> While acute HP has a good prognosis, chronic HP is a progressive disease lacking evidence-based treatments with current therapy relying on immunosuppression. Despite improvements in radiology and the advent of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs), unclassifiable ILD remains a significant burden of ILD in clinical practice and represents between 10% and 38% of all ILDs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> These patients present a diagnostic challenge and again no evidence-based treatments are available.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have highlighted phenotypical and molecular similarities across a range of ILDs. For example, the minor allele frequency of the MUC5B promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), widely associated with IPF,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> is found with increasing frequency in patients with chronic HP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Short telomeres have also been associated with RA-ILD<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and chronic HP, resulting in a prognosis similar to patients with IPF.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Patients with RA-ILD and usual interstitial pneumonia pattern have radiological changes that are indistinguishable from IPF and the presence of traction change and honeycombing is associated with poor outcomes regardless of aetiology.</p>
              <p>Together, these features suggest that there may be shared mechanisms in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis common among patients with lung fibrosis due to a number of aetiologies. To explore this hypothesis, the Its Not JUST Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Study (INJUSTIS) will recruit a clinical cohort comprising of ILD subgroups, to explore genetic, serum and clinical biomarkers that may distinguish progressive fibrosing lung disease phenotypes regardless of aetiology. This may then eventually enable therapeutics targeting specific mechanisms of disease rather than clinical phenotypes of disease.</p>

                  <p>The primary end point of disease progression (10% relative FVC decline or death within 12 months) will be used dichotomously across all subgroups collectively analysed together, with the exception of IPF controls. Association of baseline biomarker levels with dichotomous disease progression and overall survival will be analysed using binomial family of generalised linear models, while Gaussian family or otherwise appropriate models will be used to assess associations with continuous secondary end points. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure will be applied to account for multiplicity as appropriate. Repeated measures mixed models will be used to assess associations over time, which includes time points within one model and circumvents correction for multiple testing. Fixed factors will include baseline demographic information. Where putative biomarkers are identified, end point data will be used to compare biomarker levels by time-to-event through proportional hazard models; comparable ability to predict end points will be assessed through sensitivity and specificity analyses (receiver operator characteristic curves).</p>
                  <p>To identify transcriptomic biomarkers, RNA-seq libraries will be prepared and entered into a workflow for read count normalisation enabling quantification of transcript expression; normalisation ensures length and abundance of cDNA reads are corrected according to other genes (reads per kilobase per million) and further library scaling can occur.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Libraries, aligned to an appropriate reference genome, will enable detection of differential gene expression and SNPs/variants according to primary end point and secondary measures of disease severity. Transcript-discovery artefacts, transcripts that remain below detectable levels of change across compared samples, as well as any with zero mapped reads will be excluded. R statistical packages will be used for these bioinformatics workflows.</p>
                  <p>Further statistical analyses will be performed to determine associations between identified biomarkers and exploratory secondary objectives. Statistical approaches include, but are not limited to, correlation and analyses of variance between biomarker levels and patient-reported QoL outcomes or disease exacerbations; machine learning strategies on home spirometry to detect decline in lung function, and subsequent comparison of sensitivity with traditional spirometry measures at predicting end points. Factor analysis approaches will be used to reduce dimensions of data sets and assess clustering; generalised linear models will be used to test associations.</p>

Some participants may be on background therapies such as immunosuppression and corticosteroids. While these therapies are likely to be confounders, it is possible they may decrease or increase progression of fibrosis based on the PANTHER (Prednisone, Azathioprine, and <italic>N</italic>-Acetylcysteine: A Study That Evaluates Response in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) Study.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Therefore, models will include treatment strategy as part of the minimal set of adjustment for estimating direct effect on end point.

                <title>Sample size justification</title>
                <p>A power calculation has been conducted using prior data obtained at 3 months in the PROFILE (Prospective Observation of Fibrosis in the Lung Clinical Endpoints) study of patients with IPF.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The study demonstrated that 90 stable and 90 progressive individuals were sufficient to detect a twofold change in MMP7 with &gt;90% power and 5% type I error rate. MMP7 was selected for power calculation as the most conservative of the biomarkers identified in the PROFILE Study, with the lowest threshold for biomarker change and least statistical precision, thus powering on MMP7 ensures that other biomarkers will be analysed with adequate power. The calculation demonstrates that a sample of 100 participants with progressive fibrosis and 100 with stable fibrosis will be large enough to detect dynamic differences in biomarkers over 3 months with 80% power and a type I error rate of 5% (Î±=0.05). Therefore 200 participants with ILD will be recruited assuming 50% disease progression. Fifty positive IPF controls will be recruited to take part in the study to benchmark progressive fibrotic lung disease but will not be included in the final analysis.</p>
                <p>The study is also appropriately powered for genetic risk scores. An individual SNP with 25% minor allele frequency would have &gt;70% power to detect an OR of 1.8 for stable versus progressive disease. The power for a risk score comprising multiple variants is expected to be greater. This assumes an additive genetic model, p&lt;0.05, in 100 stable versus 100 progressive patients whereby with each additional marker added to the model the power is actually increased rather than reduced. The markers used will all be defined a priori based on data obtained from the PROFILE Study<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> but are likely to include MUC5B, DSP, AKAP13, SP-D, CA-125, CA19-9, MMP-7, CRPM and C6M.</p>
                <p>Following the recruitment of 100 participants who complete 1 year in the study, an interim sample size re-estimation by an independent data monitoring committee will be conducted to determine the progression status between blinded subgroups. If the blinded progression status is approximately 50%, recruitment will continue as described. If however, any subgroups show a relatively stable phenotype they will be excluded from subsequent recruitment, after being unblinded to the data monitoring committee. To attain an adequately powered sample size with 50% progressive fibrosis, further recruitment will be enriched with participants from the progressive phenotypical subgroups relative to rate of progression in interim analysis. Those recruited from subsequently excluded subgroups will be removed from the primary analysis, as they will be sources of inconsistency. However, if all subgroups progress at a substantially lower rate than expected and conditional power calculations at interim analysis suggest futility then all subgroups will be included in an analysis that demonstrates the null hypothesis (fibrotic lung disease progress at a rate specific to aetiology) could not be rejected.

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The INJUSTIS is a prospective longitudinal study of non-idiopathic fibrotic ILD, that will identify biomarkers of progression of fibrotic lung disease regardless of aetiology should such biomarkers exist. However, this study is not powered to detect differences between fibrotic lung diseases of specific aetiologies, although it may provide insights into specific fibrotic lung diseases for further investigation.</p>
