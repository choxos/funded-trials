                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is disabling and relatively common. Although evidenced-based treatments are available, at least 15% of children remain symptomatic after one year of treatment. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an alternative therapy option; however, little is known about whether it is an acceptable treatment approach. Our aim was to find out if adolescents who remain symptomatic with CFS/ME after 12 months of treatment would find ACT acceptable, to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of ACT.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We recruited adolescents (diagnosed with CFS/ME; not recovered after one year of treatment; aged 11–17 years), their parent/carer and healthcare professionals (HCPs) from one specialist UK paediatric CFS/ME service. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore barriers to recovery; views on current treatments; acceptability of ACT; and feasibility of an effectiveness RCT. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns in data.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Twelve adolescents, eleven parents and seven HCPs were interviewed. All participants thought ACT was acceptable. Participants identified reasons why ACT might be efficacious: pragmatism, acceptance and compassion are valued in chronic illness; values-focussed treatment provides motivation and direction; psychological and physical needs are addressed; normalising difficulties is a useful life-skill. Some adolescents preferred ACT to cognitive behavioural therapy as it encouraged accepting (rather than challenging) thoughts. Most adolescents would consent to an RCT of ACT but a barrier to recruitment was reluctance to randomisation. All HCPs deemed ACT feasible to deliver. Some were concerned patients might confuse ‘acceptance’ with ‘giving up’ and called for clear explanations. All participants thought the timing of ACT should be individualised.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>All adolescents with CFS/ME, parents and HCPs thought ACT was acceptable, and most adolescents were willing to try ACT. An RCT needs to solve issues around randomisation and timing of the intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is relatively common (prevalence 0.55% across community, primary care and hospital populations)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and can be severely disabling with persistent fatigue, chronic pain, postural instability and cognitive dysfunction.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It negatively impacts on children’s emotional,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> educational<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and social functioning.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Despite specialist treatments (cognitive behavioural therapy-for-fatigue (CBT-f), activity management (AM) and graded exercise therapy (GET)), at least 15% of children with CFS/ME remain symptomatic after one year of treatment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Alternative treatment approaches are needed.</p>
              <p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an approach used in related conditions in children.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> A randomised controlled trial (RCT) in paediatric chronic pain suggests ACT is better than standard care at improving functional disability and health-related quality of life,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and recent WHO guidelines recommend ACT for treating chronic pain in children.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Studies of ACT in CFS/ME have focused on adults. One feasibility study in 40 adults with CFS/ME showed ACT resulted in sustained improvements in CFS/ME-related disability at 6 months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>ACT offers a similar but different approach to CBT-f.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Differences include: focussing on improving functioning and quality of life by aligning behaviour with chosen values, rather than reducing symptoms; stepping away from thoughts (cognitive defusion) rather than challenging them; and acting presently in the moment at whatever current functional capacity is possible (psychological flexibility).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref></p>
              <p>We aimed to determine if ACT is an acceptable treatment approach for adolescents who remain symptomatic after 12 months of treatment, and whether it would be an acceptable intervention for an effectiveness RCT of ACT.</p>

                <p>Participants were recruited from one UK specialist paediatric CFS/ME service. It was not deemed feasible to contact all eligible participants in the service, so sampling was opportunistic that is, individuals who had clinic appointments with a clinician or therapist in the CFS/ME service within the recruitment timeframe were approached. Inclusion criteria: adolescents (11–17 years) with CFS/ME,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> not recovered after one year of treatment (ie, ongoing care with the service); their parents; CFS/ME healthcare professionals (HCPs). Eligible participants were approached in clinic, given information leaflets and, if interested, provided consent to be contacted by the study lead (PC) who answered any questions and consented them into the study. Parents were eligible if their child was eligible and consented to participate. They were recruited alongside their child. HCPs were given information leaflets in a team meeting and via email, and if interested, consented into the study by contacting the study lead (PC).</p>

                <p>Semi-structured interviews and one HCP focus group were undertaken (PC) February to September 2020 until data saturation was achieved.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Participants were interviewed at home, the CFS/ME service or over Skype. From March 2020, all were over Skype due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents and parents were asked to be interviewed separately but were given the option to be together.</p>
                <p>Topic guides (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>) were developed with psychologists (JS, AL), a qualitative researcher (RMP), clinician (EC) and Young Person Advisory Group. Questions explored: treatment needs; acceptability of ACT; and trialling ACT. HCPs were asked additional questions on delivering ACT. Interviews were checked with an experienced qualitative researcher (RMP) to adapt topic guides, and monitor and improve interview technique. A standardised easy-to-understand explanation of ACT called ‘James’ Story’ (written by JS and AL) was provided written and orally to participants before and during the interview. It highlights the key elements of ACT and how it differs from CBT-f that participants may be more familiar with (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>).</p>

                <p>Interviews were recorded, transcribed, anonymised and imported into qualitative data-management software NVivo (PC). Notes were made during interviews. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> to identify patterns within the data. Transcripts were double-coded (CL, AL, JS, JL) and disagreements discussed. Deductive coding was used to create a coding framework around the pre-existing ‘sensitising concepts’<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> of overarching themes ‘ACT acceptability’ and ‘trialling ACT’. Inductive coding was then used to derive codes from participants’ own words to provide more detail and generate subthemes. Data were checked between participants to explore the range of views.</p>

                <p>We interviewed 30 participants (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>): 12 adolescents (10 were female; age=12–17 years, median=15.5 years; in the service for 2–5 years) and 11 parents (10 were mothers; one was the parent of two adolescents). Of 14 adolescents approached, one declined to participate, one was ineligible. Three child-parent dyads were interviewed together, the remainder separately. We interviewed seven HCPs (clinicians, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists). Five took part in a focus group, two were interviewed individually.

Adolescents saw it as an ‘extra possibility’ (ID-a) for managing CFS/ME, especially for those struggling. They felt therapy options were lacking, therefore an alternative treatment provided hope.

                    <p>Ten of the 12 adolescents reported they would try ACT. Although, some were cautious because they were not ‘the biggest fan[s] of change’, they thought it was ‘worth trying’ (ID-a) if it provided a new possibility for treatment. Two participants said they would not try ACT because they did not need the treatment and would be ‘wasting a space for someone who needs it’ (ID-a) but recognised it could have been helpful for them earlier in their illness.

One adolescent found it ‘impossible’ (ID-a) to challenge thoughts in CBT-f because of the cognitive effort required, so preferred the ‘values’ and ‘person-centred’ focus in ACT.</p>

In contrast, some adolescents felt this fear could be overcome: ‘Just the initial thought is quite scary but then after some time working on it would be okay’ (ID-a). The emotional engagement required for discussing values was felt ‘too challenging for some people [because] talking about stuff that’s really important could upset them’ (ID-a). Some questioned whether ACT was sufficiently CFS-focussed: ‘[ACT is for] anxiety and depression … I’d like to be explained why it would be helpful in CFS’ (ID-a).</p>

Some said at 12 months was not appropriate because patients may not have attended sufficient appointments by 12 months due to waiting times: ‘[treatment] is a year but our actual clinical contact with them is probably only six months’ (ID-h). They felt ACT would be more suitable for those ‘stuck’ (ID-h) after initial treatments, regardless of how long that took. Others felt ACT would be ‘beneficial from the get-go’ (ID-h) and should be offered from the beginning, not only at 12 months.</p>
                    <p>Adolescents’ opinions differed about whether ACT should be delivered after or alongside current treatments. For some, ‘doing the activity management and CBT [simultaneously] was too much’ (ID-p), especially while coming to terms with the diagnosis and ‘losing’ their former life. Other adolescents reflected how their mood was inevitably affected by CFS/ME and thought psychological treatment alongside AM/GET would be useful.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>All participants said ACT was acceptable, and most adolescents would partake in an RCT. Parents and adolescents thought ACT was suitable for those with persistent CFS/ME symptoms because of its pragmatic and compassionate approach. Issues with delivering ACT and an RCT were discussed, including: extra training required for psychologists; timing of when ACT should be offered and concern that patients might confuse ‘acceptance’ with ‘giving up’.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study include: multi-perspective views from three participant groups; interviewing adolescents with a variety of ages and illness durations; good engagement (only one adolescent declined to participate); and recruiting from the pool of adolescents who would be eligible for an RCT. Limitations are that: participants provided opinions based on information about what ACT would involve rather than actually undergoing treatment; participants were likely biased toward being engaged in treatment and research which could overestimate acceptability of ACT and the proportion who would consent to a trial; few (four) males were interviewed; not all eligible patients in the service were contacted as sampling was opportunistic; and recruitment was from one UK paediatric specialist CFS/ME service, so results may not be generalisable to all eligible patients, males or other centres.</p>
              <p>Our findings are consistent with results from a feasibility study with adolescents with functional somatic syndromes, where 90.5% completed group-based ACT and all would recommend it to a friend.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In our study, some adolescents appeared to have a treatment preference for ACT or treatment-as-usual. This should be borne in mind when designing a trial.</p>
              <p>Our study found that participants wanted pragmatic and values-focussed strategies in treatment, which is consistent with research on ACT in paediatric chronic pain,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> where the core elements of ACT (ie, ‘functional contextualism’<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> to facilitate behaviour in line with personal values and goals<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) have demonstrated efficacy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Adolescents highlighted the loss of their core-values during their illness, so perhaps values-based treatment serves as a motivational factor.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> They said a compassionate approach was also needed to address the grief and loss of sense-of-self which is common in CFS/ME.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Similarly, they expressed the need for treatment that validates their thoughts, rather than challenges them. This is a key difference between how ACT and CBT-f approach cognitions<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> and might be why some participants said they preferred ACT to CBT-f. While CBT-f also enhances acceptance,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> its centrality in ACT is unique.</p>
              <p>Comparable to adult CFS/ME literature,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–30</xref> our study identifies ‘acceptance’ as fundamental for being able to enjoy life while affected by CFS/ME. Although this is common to chronic illness,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> CFS/ME presents particular challenges related to stigma, contested diagnosis and uncertain aetiology.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In adults, it has been suggested that acceptance should be targeted before commencing other treatment, to maximise clinical benefit,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> aligning with opinions of some participants in this study who proposed ACT should be offered at the beginning of treatment.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This work suggests ACT is acceptable and most adolescents and parents would consent to randomisation for an RCT. Given patients and HCPs feel there is a lack of options for those who have not yet fully recovered after receiving currently evidenced treatments, we recommend further work to develop a pilot study of ACT to inform an effectiveness RCT. Issues raised for designing an RCT of ACT included: extra training required for psychologists; clear explanations to patients and parents that ‘acceptance’ is not synonymous with ‘giving up’; timing of when ACT should be offered; and consideration of trial design as some adolescents had a treatment preference for ACT versus treatment-as-usual.</p>
