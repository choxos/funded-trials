                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acute hospital admission is distressing for care home residents. Ambulatory care sensitive conditions, such as respiratory and urinary tract infections, are conditions that can cause unplanned hospital admission but may have been avoidable with timely detection and intervention in the community. The Better Health in Residents in Care Homes (BHiRCH) programme has feasibility tested and will pilot a multicomponent intervention to reduce these avoidable hospital admissions. The BHiRCH intervention comprises an early warning tool for noting changes in resident health, a care pathway (clinical guidance and decision support system) and a structured method for communicating with primary care, adapted for use in the care home. We use practice development champions to support implementation and embed changes in care.</p>

                  <p>Cluster randomised pilot trial to test study procedures and indicate whether a further definitive trial is warranted. Fourteen care homes with nursing (nursing homes) will be randomly allocated to intervention (delivered at nursing home level) or control groups. Two nurses from each home become Practice Development Champions trained to implement the intervention, supported by a practice development support group. Data will be collected for 3 months preintervention, monthly during the 12-month intervention and 1 month after. Individual-level data includes resident, care partner and staff demographics, resident functional status, service use and quality of life (for health economic analysis) and the extent to which staff perceive the organisation supports person centred care. System-level data includes primary and secondary health services contacts (ie, general practitioner and hospital admissions). Process evaluation assesses intervention acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, ease of implementation in practice and study procedures (ie, consent and recruitment rates).</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Currently in the UK 421 100 people aged over 65 years live in residential care, including care homes with nursing (referred to subsequently in this paper as ‘nursing homes’).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Older people living in nursing homes have increasing levels of comorbidity,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> frailty and physical health needs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are ‘conditions that can lead to unplanned hospital admissions that may been have avoidable or manageable by timely access to medical care in the community’.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The conditions include: angina, asthma, cellulitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, gastroenteritis, epilepsy, hypertension, hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, severe ear, nose and throat infections.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
                <p>In the UK, ACSCs account for one-sixth of hospital admissions from all age groups.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our ageing population led to a 40% increase in admissions between 2001 and 2011,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and all-cause hospital admissions from nursing homes rose by 63% between 2011 and 2015.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Four ACSCs contribute to a large proportion of hospitalisations from nursing homes: respiratory infections,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> UTIs<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 17</xref> and dehydration,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and may underlie other problems such as falls and delirium.</p>
                <p>In addition to causing distress to residents, their families and staff, hospitalisation is expensive for health and social care systems. Hospital admission increases the risk of decline in functional ability, delirium, adverse events and prolonged stays.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Areas with many nursing homes tend to have higher rates of unplanned hospital admission in the over-75 age group.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The King’s Fund<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and British Geriatrics Society<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> have raised concerns about the quality of healthcare provision to nursing homes. The UK National Health Service (NHS)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> has made reducing avoidable hospital admission from nursing homes a policy imperative.</p>
                <p>A number of interventions have been developed, falling broadly into two categories; multicomponent interventions (implementation of a range of tools) and single-component interventions (predominantly advance care planning or single disease care pathways (eg, pneumonia). Multicomponent interventions show significant reductions in avoidable admissions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–26</xref> Key characteristics include enhancing knowledge and skills of nursing home staff,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> clinical guidance and decision-support tools (care pathways), engaging with families<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and specialist input from geriatricians or nurse practitioners.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, research highlights the importance of collaborative development of interventions with nursing home staff,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> residents and families,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> considering implementation support<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and using local champions.</p>
                <p>The intervention with the strongest evidence base is ‘INTERACT’ (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers). This complex intervention, developed and implemented in the USA, aims to detect and diagnose a range of medical conditions in residents recently discharged from hospital to skilled nursing facilities and reduce readmissions. It comprises a quality improvement programme focusing on the management of acute changes in residents’ condition<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Communication tools, for example, Stop and Watch early warning tool and Situation Background Assessment Response (SBAR) structured communication with primary care tool.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Care pathways or clinical tools addressing, for example, dehydration, UTI, fever and acute mental status change.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Advanced care planning, tracking and communication tools.</p></list-item></list>

                <p>In the preliminary stages of the Better Health in Residents in Care Homes (BHiRCH) programme, we worked with stakeholders including staff and our carer reference panel (CRP), to develop and adapt the INTERACT tools for use in the UK (Blighe <italic>et al</italic>, unpublished data, 2018). We identified current UK care pathways for ACSCs in nursing homes for our four key conditions (respiratory infections, acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, UTIs and dehydration) and adapted them in consensus co-design workshops with staff and care partners.</p>
                <p>We conducted a rapid research review and semistructured interviews to understand the optimal approach to enhance skills and knowledge in nursing home staff. The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework was used to co-design implementation support and guidance.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We conducted a feasibility and acceptability study in two nursing homes in the north of England between October 2016 and January 2017 to optimise the intervention and its implementation.</p>

We will monitor intervention fidelity noting where nursing homes make amendments to the structure or content of the care pathway. PDCs will have a monthly support phone call with the research team to reflect on their activities and achievements which we will document. They will keep an activity log of support provided by practice development support groups to document the level of facilitation required to support the implementation process. To understand the effectiveness of study procedures we will collect data on consent and recruitment rates, the numbers of care partners who wish to be involved in the resident’s care, assess completeness of outcome measures, data collection and return rate of questionnaires.</p>
                <p>We will conduct 20 semistructured interviews (30–45 min each) with five nursing home managers, five nurses, five care assistants and five care partners from the seven intervention homes. We will explore participants’ views on the effectiveness of the intervention in preventing avoidable hospital admissions and their experiences of implementing the intervention. Care partners will be purposively sampled to ensure a range of gender, age and types of family carer. All participants will give informed consent, including for recording of their interviews.</p>

Given this is a pilot study, analyses will be mainly descriptive focussing on recruitment, participant characteristics, other baseline and outcome variables, loss to follow-up and tabulation of serious adverse events (SAEs).

We will calculate costs associated with the intervention, including the cost of enhancing staff’s knowledge and skills and resources associated with implementation. Resource use associated with hospital admissions, primary care and other NHS and social care costs will be collected using the CSRI. Costs will be reported from an NHS/prescribed specialised services (PSS), government and societal perspective. We will assess feasibility of calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for residents, using the EQ-5D- 5 L. In the societal level analysis, a calculation of carers’ QALYs will be included. We will provide an initial estimate of the incremental mean cost per QALY gained in intervention compared with control homes. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, showing the percentage of cases that the intervention is cost-effective over a range of values of willingness to pay for a QALY gained, will be constructed for each different costing perspective and for the different methods of calculating QALYs. We will model the lifetime costs and outcomes of the intervention compared with controls. This will involve assessing the quality of the published information available, the development of an initial model and identification of which cost and outcome components would benefit most from further research (ie, extra value of perfect information and extra value of partial perfect information analysis).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref>

Two CRPs have been created to ensure public involvement at all stages, chaired by SN (London) and BW-C (Bradford). Each panel comprises up to eight family carers of people with dementia and a person living with dementia. The carers are members of, and supported by, the Alzheimer’s Society research volunteer network. They will meet at 6-monthly intervals throughout the programme, advise and work collaboratively on recruitment and consent processes, accessibility of information leaflets, data collection, interpretation and dissemination. Our CRP chairs will attend study recruitment and information events at participating care homes to publicise the trial. They provide strategic oversight by attending programme steering group and international advisory meetings. We held informal consultations with a group of seven residents living in one nursing home to inform development of study information materials for residents.</p>

It will monitor all aspects of the conduct and progress of the study, ensuring adherence to the protocol and will take appropriate action to safeguard participants and trial quality. For this pilot trial, it also takes on the role of a data monitoring committee. The BHiRCH Programme Steering Committee includes senior members of the research team and external experts and supervises the overall programme, on behalf of NIHR and the Sponsor. An international advisory group provides advice and guidance to ensure the project remains grounded in real experience and is informed by international best practice and research.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The aim of our study is to pilot test an intervention to reduce avoidable acute hospital admissions for the four most common ACSCs in UK nursing home residents. Our intervention is closely aligned with UK health policy which aims to improve healthcare provided within nursing homes and prevent distressing transitions to acute hospitals. Despite policy imperatives, little empirical research has been conducted in this area in the UK. The quality of intervention studies has varied with insufficient attention paid to methodology, particularly implementation, intervention adherence and clustering effects.</p>
              <p>We have adapted elements of an existing intervention (INTERACT) to the UK context with stakeholder input and extensive co-design. Trials of complex interventions are often methodologically challenging but the nursing home environment brings additional issues. Each nursing home, even those that are part of large company chains, is unique in context, with a distinct culture of care and variability in practice which may be greater than that seen in clinical NHS settings. A particular strength of our intervention is that the implementation is informed by implementation science theory, tailored to the context and led by local PDCs supported by a local PDC support group comprised of key stakeholders who can assist with achieving change in care practice.</p>
              <p>We anticipate participant recruitment, particularly of residents with impaired capacity to consent to research procedures may be challenging. Additionally, nursing homes may not have the infra-structure to support data collection. We plan to overcome these problems through developing the role of an existing member of the nursing home staff as a research facilitator and will provide reimbursement for their time and additional work.</p>
              <p>Our pilot study will provide data to indicate whether a fully powered randomised controlled trial is warranted. In addition it will provide invaluable information on how to optimise the implementation of complex interventions in nursing homes.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="s5">
              <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
              <p>Some residents may have dementia or other conditions that impair their ability to give informed consent to participate in the individual data collection, and we will adhere to the UK Mental Capacity Act (2005). We have an established procedure should we observe incidents of concern and will adhere to local authority safeguarding procedures.</p>
              <p>Academic dissemination will be through publication of results, reported per CONSORT guidelines in international peer-review journals and conference presentations. Regular updates will be given via social media, our website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brad.ac.uk/health/dementia/research/bhirch/">https://www.brad.ac.uk/health/dementia/research/bhirch/</ext-link>) and twitter (@BHIRCHCareHomes). We will present at congresses attended by nursing home owners and staff and will hold a national conference at the end of the study to disseminate findings and share best practice on active care for ACSCs.</p>
