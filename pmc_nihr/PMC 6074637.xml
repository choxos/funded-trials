                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Up to 30% of hearing aids fitted to new adult clients are reported to be of low benefit and used intermittently or not at all. Evidence suggests that additional interventions paired with service-delivery redesign may help improve hearing aid use and benefit. The range of interventions available is limited. In particular, the efficacy of interventions like the Active Communication Education (ACE) programme that focus on improving communication success with hearing-impaired people and significant others, has not previously been assessed. We propose that improved communication outcomes associated with the ACE intervention, lead to an increased perception of hearing aid value and more realistic expectations associated with hearing aid use and ownership, which are reported to be key barriers and facilitators for successful hearing aid use. This study will assess the feasibility of delivering ACE and undertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial to evaluate whether ACE would be a cost-effective and acceptable way of increasing quality of life through improving communication and hearing aid use in a public health service such as the National Health Service.</p>

                  <p>This will be a randomised controlled, open feasibility trial with embedded economic and process evaluations delivered in audiology departments in two UK cities. We aim to recruit 84 patients (and up to 84 significant others) aged 18 years and over, who report moderate or less than moderate benefit from their new hearing aid. The feasibility of a large-scale study and the acceptability of the ACE intervention will be measured by recruitment rates, treatment retention, follow-up rates and qualitative interviews.</p>

              <p>Age-related hearing impairment is a major worldwide public health issue for ageing populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is reported as the third most common chronic condition affecting approximately 328 million (91%) middle-aged and older adults,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> over 10 million adults in the UK alone.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> By the age of 70, 70% will have a mild or worse hearing impairment, progressively worsening with age.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hearing impairment is commonly associated with reduced quality of life and well-being<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> including depression<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and anxiety,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> social isolation,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> poor social interactions,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> cognitive dysfunction,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> increased risk of developing dementia and reduced emotional, behavioural and general social well-being.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, disability in these domains is often experienced by normally hearing significant others (SOs) living with hearing-impaired people.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Hearing impairment therefore represents an enormous burden on society and the economy.</p>
              <p>In high-income countries, the most common treatment is to fit a hearing aid.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Despite strong evidence that hearing aid use is associated with reductions in hearing disability noted above,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 19–21</xref> hearing aid use is remarkably low.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> It is estimated that up to 30% of UK adult hearing aid owners do not use them regularly or at all.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 24–26</xref> International studies support these data.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 27–29</xref> Cost implications for the National Health Service (NHS) are significant as they provide 80% of UK hearing aids,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> fitting &gt;300 000 new devices each year of which an estimated 20 000–120 000 are unused. Even with global advances in technology, fitting protocols and outcome measurements,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> there is little evidence that NHS hearing aid use and the expected gains in benefit and quality of life have improved over the last decade<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 25</xref> and treatment continues to focus primarily on technology.</p>
              <p>A recent systematic review of additional treatment found very low quality evidence that self-management and service delivery interventions may be of benefit in auditory rehabilitation.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, the authors found no studies that examined the effect of these sorts of interventions on hearing aid use.</p>
              <p>Reasons for hearing aid non-use are complex.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Research has identified psychosocial factors important for successful aural rehabilitation including personal and societal attitudes to hearing-impairment<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> patient involvement in decision making<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34–37</xref> and expectations of benefit and communication success in a range of communication situations.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> Key barriers and facilitators to successful hearing aid use have been identified as being related to expectations of benefit and meaningful participation in everyday life.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> The WHO’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> provides a functional description of difficulties (related to these expectations) experienced by hearing-impaired people and their hearing communication partners, for example, avoidance of difficult listening situations that lead to ‘activity limitations’ and ‘participation restrictions’.</p>
              <p>One intervention that is designed to reduce these limitations and restrictions is the Active Communication Education (ACE) programme (the focus of this paper). The ACE trains participants to develop solutions to specific difficult communication scenarios that commonly lead to their avoidance of or reduced participation in important activities. The effectiveness of ACE as an <italic>alternative</italic> intervention to a hearing aid has been evaluated and two small studies demonstrate ACE benefits in improving communication function and hearing-related quality of life.<sup>43 44</sup> ACE effectiveness as an <italic>adjunct</italic> to hearing aid fitting has not been evaluated, although there is some weak evidence that supports its use in this context,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> that is, long-term improvements in using communication strategies being associated with hearing aid users.</p>
              <p>A systematic review of group communication programme effectiveness conducted in 2005,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> revealed just nine small and methodologically poor studies. The review reported weak evidence for short-term benefits related to reduced hearing disability; improvements in quality of life; hearing aid use and communication function<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> when interventions were delivered in concert with a hearing aid. The authors concluded that there was a clear need for large sufficiently powered randomised controlled studies to determine short-term and long-term benefits of adult communication rehabilitation group interventions as an adjunct to hearing aid fitting. Such a study has yet to be completed. Evidence that postdates this 2005 review does little to change the situation providing only weak additional evidence for moderate gains in hearing loss-related quality of life for communication-based group interventions.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> There are indications that group rehabilitation programmes like ACE have the potential to realise economic gains for service providers. For example, Abrams<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> estimated that a hearing aid plus a 4-week group rehabilitation programme reduced the treatment cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by more than half; the cost of implementing the rehabilitation programme was &lt;6% of the total rehabilitation cost per patient. Even so, with no strong evidence that such interventions delivered as an adjunct to hearing aid fitting are clinically worthwhile, they are not routinely offered in public or private hearing healthcare sectors in the UK.</p>
              <p>In summary, there is some low-quality evidence that ACE and similar programmes improve communication function and quality of life and these outcomes may be enhanced when delivered in conjunction with a hearing aid. Communication programmes involve a substantial commitment on the part of participants and those who run and pay for them. Recent evidence shows that it is effective and feasible to deliver ACE as an alternative intervention in Australia and Sweden.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 48–50</xref> There is now a need to establish whether reported clinical and economic benefits of ACE and communication programmes like ACE can be achieved in the context of NHS hearing aid provision. This protocol for The ACE to HEAR study (ACEto improve HEARing) is intended to deliver ACE to unsuccessful or struggling new NHS hearing aid users, 3 months postfitting, in order to assess whether a large RCT designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ACE in improving hearing aid benefit within the UK NHS is feasible.</p>

Baseline data will be summarised by trial arm, using descriptive statistics for continuous data (mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, number missing) and counts and percentages for categorical data. Recruitment rates will be reported monthly and overall, and by site. The flow of participants through the trial will be detailed in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials flow diagram and referral, consent and attendance rates will be summarised overall and by site using counts, percentages and 95% CIs.</p>
                <p>The number of ACE sessions attended will be summarised alongside any SOs who attended the sessions. Summaries will be provided overall, by site/clinic and by whether follow-up appointments were made as single or block booking.

SD will be presented with 80% CIs to inform future sample size calculations. The proportion of participants at the floor and ceiling of each measure, at each time point, will be reported along with the standardised response mean (SRM) to measure the sensitivity of each questionnaire to detect change. The SRM will be calculated as mean change in scores or values divided by the SD in change scores.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Questionnaire completion times (from self-report) will be summarised as a consideration for instruments going into the full-scale evaluation.

We will purposively select participants to ensure a mix of those with good/poor hearing aid outcomes (measured at the fifth and final ACE session and equivalent control arm time point, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for outcome measures) as well as ensuring we include some participants who dropped out of the sessions/study, ensuring a wide range of views are collected. Control arm participants will include those who have dropped out from the study where possible, allowing us to explore reasons for this. SOs will be interviewed as part of a dyad with the participant. Semi-structured interviews will explore the acceptability of the ACE (eg, venue, timing, content), its perceived impact (reflecting on hearing aid outcomes) with ACE intervention arm participants; and views on study processes (eg, recruitment, outcome measures and timing) with ACE intervention and control arm participants.</p></list-item></list>

                <p>Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed (with NVivo-11) by the research team led by CJ, using the Framework approach,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> which is particularly useful for analysing qualitative data in a pragmatic yet systematic way, where theoretical development is not needed.

                <p>A full cost-effectiveness analysis will not be conducted as this is a feasibility trial, thus the study is not powered to detect significant differences.</p>
                <p>The costs of implementing the ACE intervention will be estimated and the potential resource implications versus usual care will be explored. Resource use will be summarised by resource use type (eg, GP appointments, outpatient appointments) and appropriate unit costs to be applied to each resource use type will be identified. These will be sourced from a combination of local costings and national databases.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
</p>
                <p>The costing approach will take a broad analytical perspective accounting for NHS costs and for those observed by patients, although this cost will be presented separately. It is anticipated that additional resources used in the ACE intervention arm will largely be NHS staff time and travel/time for patients and SOs, patients and SOs use of primary and secondary NHS care, any private treatments attended, whether related to their hearing or for any other reason, changes to medication and employment or recreational activities. A draft resource use questionnaire based on these anticipated additional resources was designed for this study. The questionnaire will be developed further and tested during the feasibility trial to ensure that all relevant and necessary data can be collected to establish a reliable and valid tool with which to capture resource use for a future full economic evaluation.</p>
                <p>Methods to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the ACE intervention versus treatment-as-usual alone in terms of QALYs will be explored. No health-related quality of life assessment tool is currently sufficiently sensitive to all populations, and in the field of hearing health, there has been limited research to identify the most effective tool. In the UK, NICE advocates the used of the EQ-5D for generating QALYs, although it is acknowledged that this is not always the most sensitive tool for particular populations for whom the majority of its dimensions may not apply.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> In the US analysis of a 4-week rehabilitation programme noted above,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> the SF-36 was used to generate QALYs rather than the EQ-5D, with the SF-36 showing a reduction in the cost per QALY in favour of the intervention. For the present feasibility trial, both assessments will be used to elicit QALYs and a comparison will be made between the outcomes of the two measures. This will enable a decision to be made as to which tool would be most appropriate in the full-scale trial.</p>
                <p>The feasibility work will also be used to help to identify any patterns of missing data and any issues relevant for sensitivity analysis, which will influence statistical plans for dealing with imprecision and other uncertainties in the full RCT. For example, data can be bootstrapped to account for the expected skewness evident in economic cost data. The data collected as part of this feasibility study will be used to inform subsequent pretrial modelling.</p>

                <title>Adverse events</title>
                <p>Risks within this study are considered to be minimal. It is considered highly unlikely that the ACE intervention arm will suffer any adverse consequences as a result of receiving the ACE plus treatment-as-usual. Nevertheless, interviews with ACE participants, the ACE facilitator and ACE questionnaire data will be used to monitor this eventuality.</p>

                <title>Trial monitoring and oversight</title>
                <p>Due to the low risk nature of this trial, approval has been obtained to set up one independent steering and monitoring committee to undertake the roles traditionally undertaken by the Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee. Regular meetings of a Study Management Group will take place to oversee the progress of the study and review recruitment. We will establish a Project Advisory Panel (PAP) with between two and four hard of hearing adults or hearing spouses that will meet a minimum of five times over the duration of the project. The PAP is a group of patients, service users, carers and lay members of the public whose role is to support and advise the Study Management Group on all aspects of the study’s progression and management.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Three patient and public involvement (PPI) activities informed the development of this application. First, a funded public engagement event about public perceptions of hearing impairment was held at the Thackeray Medical Museum in Leeds. This event helped to inform the research question. Participants identified a need for wider availability of treatments additional to hearing aids and that non-technological interventions for hearing-impaired people were a priority. Delegates identified communication education as a useful addition to hearing aid use for many hearing-impaired people and their family members. This feedback informed the study design in the following way: the choice of an interactive communication-based intervention rather than an informational one; the need to ensure that routine practical information about hearing aids and hearing impairment is delivered consistently and checked after fitting.</p>
                <p>Second, a focus group was held to consult with service-users on the proposed research question, study design and intervention delivery. Four participants were asked to discuss (a) study information and consent procedures, (b) factors that might encourage or discourage their participation in the proposed study such as the burden of the intervention, (c) types of communication scenarios that are important to them, (d) factors that might motivate them to be more active communicators. The outcomes informed our recruitment strategy to maximise interest, commitment and recruitment rates. The group’s views helped develop study information sheets and operational components of delivering ACE.</p>
                <p>Third, the charity Hearing Link, who have extensive experience of PPI and managing and delivering group interventions of this type, were consulted about involving public and patients in operationalising and delivering ACE. Patients and service users and carers are involved in the conduct of this study as active members of the PAP.</p>
                <p>We will present the findings of this study in patient forums, Trust bulletins and PPI activities including newsletters and public interest groups who work and support older adults with hearing impairment.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This will be the first RCT of this type of group communication programme in the context of a public health service and as an adjunct to hearing aid fitting. The impact of this study will ultimately be realised by a larger fully powered RCT designed to determine the effectiveness of the ACE intervention in improving hearing aid benefit for hearing aid users within the NHS GP referral for a hearing aid pathway in the UK. The outcomes of this study will inform such a RCT.</p>
              <p>The feasibility study will be deemed successful if:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Seventy per cent of recruitment targets attained for all research components.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Study consent/retention rates and proposed sample sizes, indicate delivery of the full RCT is plausible within a 5-year study period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ninety per cent of ACE groups of five to seven consented participants formed within the intervention window with participants attending three of five sessions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Economic, acceptability, outcome measure and fidelity evaluation data successfully collecte</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participants, SOs and audiologists evaluate acceptability of the ACE and RCT positively.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
              <p>(Measures with over 10% missing data maybe modified/replaced prior to the main trial).</p>
              <p>The criteria for success will result in one of following outcomes:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>stop: full-scale RCT not be feasible in NHS setting;</p></list-item><list-item><p>continue: feasible with modifications;</p></list-item><list-item><p>continue: feasible with no modifications, close monitoring;</p></list-item><list-item><p>continue feasible as is.</p></list-item></list>
