                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>ARID1A (AT-rich interactive domain containing protein 1A) loss-of-function mutations have been reported in gynecological cancers, including rarer subtypes such as clear cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies indicate that <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutant cancers display sensitivity to ATR inhibition while tumors without <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutations may be sensitive to Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibitors in combination with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Primary Objective</title>
                  <p>To determine whether the ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib, has clinical activity as a single agent and in combination with the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in patients with ARID1A â€˜lossâ€™ and â€˜no lossâ€™ clear cell carcinomas and other relapsed gynecological cancers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Study Hypothesis</title>
                  <p>ARID1A deficient clear cell carcinoma of the ovary or endometrium is sensitive to ATR inhibition, while the combination of ATR and PARP inhibition has activity in other gynecological tumors, irrespective of ARID1A status.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Trial Design</title>
                  <p>ATARI (ENGOT/GYN1/NCRI) is a multicenter, international, proof-of-concept, phase II, parallel cohort trial assessing ceralasertib activity as a single agent and in combination with olaparib in ARID1A stratified gynecological cancers. Patients with relapsed ovarian/endometrial clear cell carcinoma with ARID1A loss will receive ceralasertib monotherapy (cohort 1A). Relapsed ovarian/endometrial clear cell carcinoma patients with no ARID1A loss (cohort 2) or patients with other histological subtypes (endometrioid, carcinosarcoma, cervical) (cohort 3) will receive combination therapy (olaparib/ceralasertib). Treatment will continue until disease progression.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title>
                  <p>Patients with histologically confirmed recurrent clear cell (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis related), endometrioid (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis related), cervical (adenocarcinomas or squamous), or carcinosarcomas (ovarian or endometrial) are eligible. Patients progressing after â‰¥1 prior platinum with evidence of measurable (RECIST v1.1) radiological disease progression since last systemic anticancer therapy and prior to trial entry are eligible. Previous ATR or PARP inhibitor treatment is not permissible.</p>

                  <title>Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results</title>
                  <p>Accrual is anticipated to be complete by the second quarter of 2022, with reporting of results by the fourth quarter of 2022. Overall accrual targets and reporting timelines are dependent on individual cohort progression to stage 2.</p>

              <p>Cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers represent the fourth, sixth, and eighth most commonly diagnosed malignancies among women globally.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite high initial response rates to treatment with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, many patients relapse. The majority of patients that relapse will receive multiple lines of therapy; despite these, diminishing treatment free intervals are common, as is the development of resistant disease, indicating a great unmet need among these patients.</p>
              <p>Ovarian, endometrial, and cervical carcinomas have several clinicopathologically distinct histological subtypes, with patients diagnosed with recurrent/metastatic clear cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, or cervical cancer displaying the worst outcomes. Recurrent/metastatic ovarian clear cell carcinoma and endometrial clear cell carcinomas are associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>To date, a number of therapeutic strategies have been trialed in an attempt to improve the outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian clear cell carcinoma. The NiCCC (ENGOT-0V36) clinical trial, in which patients with clear cell carcinoma were randomized to receive nintedanib, an oral vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor or standard of care chemotherapy, failed to demonstrate a statistically significant progression free survival or overall survival benefit.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Another therapeutic avenue of interest is immune checkpoint blockade. Phase II studies of programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed death ligand 1 inhibitors have noted durable responses in patients with clear cell histology.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The programmed death ligand 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda, MSD) in ovarian clear cell carcinoma is currently being evaluated (NCT03425565).</p>
              <p>Loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> (AT-rich interactive domain containing protein 1A) leading to a loss of protein expression are a frequent observation in both ovarian and endometrial carcinomas of clear cell and endometroid histology (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). ARID1A along with its paralog ARID1B are components of the cBAF complex.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Loss of ARID1A has been shown to result in aberrant cell cycle control.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> ARID1A is recruited to double strand DNA breaks via its interaction with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR). Recruitment of ARID1A to double strand DNA breaks facilitates efficient processing of DNA ends, producing single stranded DNA which becomes coated in replication protein A, thereby sustaining the DNA damage signal and promoting cycle arrest.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A number of novel therapeutic strategies are currently being trialed for ARID1A defective cancers, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (NCT03682289), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors (NCT03842228), and bromodomain containing protein 4 (NCT03297424) inhibitors, alongside ATR inhibitors (NCT03682289).</p>

              <p>ATR is a serineâ€“threonine kinase that plays an essential role in the DNA damage response, detecting single stranded DNA, a common intermediate formed when replication forks stall.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Williamson et al previously demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of ATR selectively kill tumor cells with defects in the ARID1A. This novel synthetic lethal effect was evident in ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines with naturally occurring endogenous <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutations, tumor cell line xenografts, and tumor cell line xenografts derived from <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> mutant endometrial cancer.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Mechanistically, it has been shown that the topoisomerase enzyme, TOP2A, is localized to DNA in an ARID1A dependent manner and in the absence of ARID1A function, complex chromosomal structures which form during DNA replication which are normally resolved by TOP2A, fail to be processed prior to mitosis.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> ATR inhibition in ARID1A defective cells thus activates DNA damage pathways, increases complex chromosomal structures such as anaphase bridges, large scale genomic rearrangements and ultimately causes cell death.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>The <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic>ness phenotype is not a feature of ovarian clear cell carcinoma; tumors of this subtype do not frequently carry mutations in homologous recombination associated genes, are resistant to platinum based chemotherapy, and lack the genomic scars characteristic of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency. Nevertheless, as previously discussed, ARID1A deficient cancers, such as ovarian clear cell carcinoma, display evidence of an impaired DNA damage response and sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In vitro, silencing of ATR has been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effect of PARP inhibitors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In part, this synergistic interaction has been attributed to the abrogation of ATR mediated cell cycle checkpoints in response to the DNA damaging effects of PARP inhibitors.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, ATR inhibition has been shown to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> mutant cancer cells through both impeding BRCA1 independent loading of <italic toggle="yes">RAD51</italic> at DNA double strand breaks and restoring degradation of stalled replication forks.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>The ATARI clinical trial (ATr inhibitor in combination with olaparib in gynecological cancers with ARId1A loss or no loss, NCT04065269) is the first clinical trial which aims to test the hypothesis that ARID1A defective ovarian and endometrial clear cell carcinomas are more sensitive to ATR inhibition. To date, trials aiming to exploit the specific vulnerabilities of ARID1A defective tumors have stratified patients according to their mutation status. However, in ATARI, based on the work of Khalique et al, loss of protein expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry, will be used to stratify patients, followed by retrospective mutation analysis.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Building on the preclinical data which demonstrates synergy between ATR and poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibition, the combination will be tested in patients with evidence of ARID1A expression (ie, assumed to be wild-type for <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic>).</p>

                <title>Trial Design</title>
                <p>The ATARI clinical trial is an international, academic sponsored phase II clinical trial in which patients with ovarian and endometrial clear cell carcinoma, along with other rare gynecological tumors, are treated with the ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib (AstraZeneca), with or without the PARP inhibitor, olaparib (Lynparza, AstraZeneca) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>The intention is to recruit patients from 18 centers in total (up to six per country) in the UK, France, and Canada. ATARI is sponsored by the Institute of Cancer Research, with central coordination led by the ICR Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU). International participation is coordinated via ARGACY-GINECO (France) and Princess Margaret Hospital Consortium (PMHC) in Canada.</p>
                <p>All patients have histological confirmation of clear cell carcinoma by central review following registration and prior to trial entry. Assessment of ARID1A status occurs centrally via immunohistochemistry using archival or fresh tissue biopsies obtained at registration.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Tumors sequenced outside of ATARI, with confirmed ARID1A loss of function mutation, may be eligible for trial entry without repeat immunohistochemistry assessment if testing is performed in an appropriate laboratory (GCLP or CLIA accredited).</p>
                <p>Cohort 1A patients are those with clear cell carcinomas (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis-related) and demonstrable ARID1A loss. Cohort 1A patients receive ceralasertib monotherapy (160â€‰mg tablets twice daily on days 1â€“14 in a 28 day cycle). If no activity is observed in this cohort, cohort 1B will open, with the same patient population receiving ceralasertib plus olaparib in combination (160â€‰mg ceralasertib tablets once daily on days 1â€“7 and 300â€‰mg olaparib tablets twice daily continuously in a 28 day cycle). Patients with clear cell carcinomas (ovarian, endometrial, or endometriosis related) with no ARID1A loss enter cohort 2 and patients with other relapsed gynecological subtypes enter cohort 3, irrespective of ARID1A status. Both cohort 2 and cohort 3 patients receive combination therapy (160â€‰mg ceralasertib tablets once daily on days 1â€“7 and 300â€‰mg olaparib tablets twice daily continuously in a 28 day cycle).</p>
                <p>Each cohort will recruit patients independently, with 10 patients per cohort included in the formal interim analysis at the end of stage 1. If &gt;1 responses are observed, an additional 19 patients will be recruited into the cohort in stage 2. Cohorts 1A/1B, 2, and 3 will be evaluated separately at stage 1 and Stage 2.</p>
                <p>In all cohorts, trial treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision that continued treatment is not in the best interest of the patient. Patients are assessed at D1 of each cycle (safety bloods, toxicity assessment) with additional visits at C1D7, C1D15, and C2D15. Tumor imaging and response assessment occurs every 8 weeks.</p>
                <p>The trial is funded by AstraZeneca, with additional support provided by the Lady Garden Foundation, and is endorsed by Cancer Research UK.</p>

                <p>The translational component of ATARI aims to generate data that could help develop how ATR inhibitors are used in the context of clear cell carcinomas and other gynecological cancers. Sequencing of DNA extracted from archival tissue and optional pretreatment and post-progression biopsies where available, will be performed to investigate genetic determinants of ATR inhibitor response and resistance. Plasma samples will be collected from all patients for the duration of study enrollment to evaluate whether biomarkers of ATR inhibitor response can be detected in circulating tumor DNA. Two targeted sequencing panels will be employed to capture known genetic determinants of both ATR inhibitor and PARP inhibitor resistance in circulating tumor DNA.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>ATARI is the first clinical trial aiming to determine if the preclinical data showing a synthetic lethal interaction between the tumor suppressor gene <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ATR</italic> translates into improved outcomes for patients specifically with ovarian and endometrial clear cell carcinoma. The utility of ARID1A protein expression together with mutation status will help determine those patients with functional loss of ARID1A and thus will act as a framework for future clinical trials. The inclusion of the olaparib/ceralasertib combination therapy arm, based on preclinical hypotheses, will investigate whether the two classes of DDR inhibitors have the potential to provide clinical activity worth further exploration. The cohort of non-clear cell, rare gynecological cancers provides the opportunity to assess the combination of ATR and PARP inhibition in a further cohort of patients with limited treatment options. Results from the translational work within this trial will aid both the validation of known biomarkers and identify novel biomarkers of ATR inhibitor response and resistance. The results of the ATARI trial will provide the first indication of whether there is clinical activity of ATR inhibitors in clear cell carcinomas and other rare gynecological cancers according to ARID1A status. These results will help shape future trials and have the potential to change the standard of care in the future for women with rare gynecological cancers.</p>
