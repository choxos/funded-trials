                  <p>This study is designed to determine whether a full randomised controlled
trial (RCT) examining the clinical effectiveness and safety of total knee
replacement surgery with or without a tourniquet is warranted and
feasible.</p>

                  <title>Method and analysis</title>
                  <p>Single centre, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded RCT. A computer-generated
randomisation service will allocate 50 participants into one of two trial
treatments, surgery with or without a tourniquet. The primary objective is
to estimate recruitment, crossovers and follow-up of patients. All patients
will have an MRI scan of their brain preoperatively and day 1 or 2
postoperatively to identify ischaemic cerebral emboli (primary clinical
outcome). Oxford Cognitive Screen, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and
Mini-Mental State Examination will be evaluated as outcome tools for
measuring cognitive impairment at days 1, 2 and 7 postoperatively. Thigh
pain, blood transfusion requirements, venous thromboembolism, revision
surgery, surgical complications, mortality and Oxford knee and five-level
EuroQol-5D scores will be collected over 12 months.
<italic>Integrated qualitative research study</italic>: 30 trial
patients and 20 knee surgeons will take part in semistructured interviews.
Interviews will capture views regarding the pilot trial and explore barriers
and potential solutions to a full trial. <italic>Multicentre cohort
study</italic>: UK National Joint Registry data will be linked to
Hospital Episode Statistics to estimate the relationship between tourniquet
use and venous thromboembolic event, length of hospital stay, risk of
revision surgery and death. The study will conclude with a multidisciplinary
workshop to reach a consensus on whether a full trial is warranted and
feasible.</p>

              <p>Arthritis of the knee can cause pain and restrict activities of daily living. Total
knee replacement (TKR) surgery is a surgical procedure aimed at resolving the
symptoms of end-stage knee arthritis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> TKR
surgery is typically undertaken with the aid of a tourniquet. A tourniquet acts as
an occlusive device around the thigh with the aim of reducing blood flow distally.
In the UK, over 90% of TKRs are performed with a tourniquet.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Anecdotally, surgeons believe using a tourniquet provides
a bloodless field to improve the operative field of view.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Many surgeons also believe using a tourniquet improves the
quality of the cementation of the knee implants<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> by reducing bone bleeding and allowing better interdigitation of the
cement into the porous bone.</p>
              <p>Previous systematic reviews have concluded that the use of tourniquets did not reduce
intraoperative or postoperative blood loss<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
and were associated with significant complications including venous thromboembolic
events (VTEs),<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> wound infection, bruising and
nerve palsy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7</xref></p>
              <p>In TKR surgery, a tourniquet causes both arterial and venous stasis for the duration
it is applied. It is therefore unsurprising that the use of a thigh tourniquet might
increase the risk of postoperative VTE.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
However, VTE may not be the only thromboembolic risk associated with using a
tourniquet. Research has demonstrated that systemic emboli can occur when the
tourniquet is deflated with up to a 60% prevalence of echogenic material in
the circle of Willis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Emboli may reach
the systemic circulation through the pulmonary capillaries or the opening of other
pulmonary vessels.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The prevalence of
postoperative cognitive impairment after TKR is high with reports in the literature
varying from 41%–75% at 7 days to 18%–45% at 3 months,
and this may in part be explained by cerebral emboli if they are occurring following
the release of a tourniquet.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Although studies have demonstrated that tourniquets do not substantially reduce blood
loss and may increase complications, a review of these studies, by Alcelik
<italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, identified significant design flaws,
including issues with randomisation, blinding and the absence of clearly defined
outcome measures. Furthermore, no controlled studies have addressed or quantified
one of the most potentially serious risks associated with tourniquet, which are
cerebral emboli, and any resultant cognitive impairment.</p>
              <p>There may be problems with running a trial that involves recruiting patients who,
once it is explained, may not be prepared to accept the potential risks of surgery
with a tourniquet. Equally, surgeons may be not willing to change surgical practice
for a randomised trial.</p>
              <p>We designed a feasibility study, which includes three separate but integrated
projects: (A) pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), (B) integrated qualitative
research study and (C) retrospective multicentre cohort study.</p>
              <p>The objective of the safety and feasiblity evaluation of tourniquets for total knee
replacement surgery (SAFE-TKR) study is to establish whether a full
RCT evaluating tourniquets in knee replacement surgery is warranted and
feasible.</p>

                    <p>The primary clinical outcome will be evidence of new acute ischaemic
brain lesions on MRI. The total number and volume of acute brain lesions
detected on MRI per patient will be recorded. Presurgery MRIs will be
obtained no more than 60 days before surgery, and
postsurgery MRIs will be obtained up to 2 days after surgery.
Diffuse-weighted MRI is the most powerful tool for diagnosing acute
ischaemic brain lesion caused by cerebral microembolism providing high
level of sensitivity and specificity.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> The MRIs will all follow a
standardised protocol including fast spin-echo fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery sequences and diffusion-weighted spin
echo-echo planar imaging. The diffusion-weighted sequence will consist
of an initial T2-weighted acquisition followed by a second acquisition
with the application of diffusion-sensitising gradients in the three
orthogonal directions. Lesions will also be described according to the
vascular territory (anterior, middle, posterior cerebral arteries or
vertebrobasilar arteries), side and type (cortical vs subcortical or
deep grey matter). A planimetry of each lesion will be performed by
using a grid overlay (using Image Processing and Analysis in Java
software, National Institutes of Health) and by calculating
lesion volume by multiplying the number of involved grids by the slice
thickness and slice gap. Attack rate (presence of new lesions/number of
patients) will also be calculated. A new lesion will be defined as a
focal hyperintense area detected by the fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery sequence, corresponding to a restricted diffusion signal in the
diffusion-weighted imaging sequence.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Scans will be read and evaluated by two experienced
consultant radiologists blinded to the timing of the imaging, allocated
intervention and the neurological status of the patient. Even

decline.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref></p>

Patients and research associates collecting outcome measures will be blinded to

tests (typically either day 2 or day 7) after discharge from hospital
will have these administered by a trained research associate visiting them at
home or an agreed location. Patients will receive a follow-up telephone call at
6 weeks to record any VTEs since surgery. OKS, EQ-5D and complications
questionnaire will be posted to the patient at 6 and 12 months. We will
use techniques common in long-term cohort studies to ensure minimum loss to
follow-up, such as collection of next of kin contact addresses and telephone
numbers, mobile telephone numbers and email addresses. A maximum of three
attempts will be made acquire outcome data at each time point.</p>

Baseline data will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms
and to highlight any characteristic differences between those individuals in the
trial, those ineligible and those eligible but withholding consent. Exploratory
analyses using regression techniques will be used to assess change in total
volume of acute brain lesions in the two treatment groups and investigate the
relationship between cognitive test scores and total volume of acute brain
lesions. Linear regression will also be used to estimate the proportion of the
variation in total volume of acute brain lesions that may be explained by change
in cognition score between baseline and first postoperative assessment. To
further investigate the extent to which cognition score is a surrogate for total
volume of acute brain lesions, we will use logistic regression to predict
treatment group from change in the total volume of acute brain lesions. The
relationship between cognitive symptoms and the MRI data will also be evaluated
using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping, where MRI intensity changes are
associated to cognitive deficits using either classification scores (deficit or
not) or continuous measures of cognition.</p>

representatives. The TSC will have an independent chairperson. At least two
formal TSC meetings will be held—one before the trial starts and one
before recruitment to the trial completes. As this is a small feasibility study,
there will not be a data monitoring committee. AEs and serious AEs will
be monitored by the investigators. AEs will be assessed for causality within
24 hours of notification and patients followed up as per protocol. The
trial may be stopped prematurely if mandated by ethics committee, a major
unexpected safety concern arises or funding ceases. Any proposed changes to the
protocol will first be reviewed by the TSC and, if approved, it will be
submitted to the trial sponsor, funding body and local research ethics
committee. All approved protocols will be marked by a version number and date.
Requests for access to the final dataset will be overseen by the TSC. Reasonable
requests will then be given access to a full anonymised dataset.</p>

              <p>The National Joint Registry (NJR) is a population-based registry of joint
replacements in the UK and covers both the NHS and private sectors. From April 2003
to December 2003, the NJR collected data on the use of tourniquets for TKR surgery
in England and Wales. At this stage, there were 406 hospitals listed within the NJR
system (NHS hospitals, independent sector hospitals and treatment
centres—both NHS funded and privately funded) and of these, 384 returned data
(ie, 94%). The NJR dataset also contains many other key variables that are
known to affect mortality, implant survivorship (revision rate) and the risk of VTE
(1) use and type of VTE prophylaxis (such as low molecular weight heparin,
aspirin and intermittent calf pump), (2) type of implant used, (3) use of
cement and (4) basic patient demographics including age, body mass index

part of the minimum dataset standard for knee replacement surgery: April 2003 to
December 2003. We will analyse only data from primary cemented TKRs. Tourniquet
use along with other routinely collected NJR baseline variables—age at
time of surgery, sex and ASA classification—will be analysed to
measure for independent effects on all cause revision. A tourniquet will be
classed as used if even for a selective period of the procedure such as
cementation. Sociodemographics, comorbidities, VTEs, cerebrovascular accident
(CVAs or stroke) and length of hospital stay will be obtained by using patient
identifiers (NHS number, gender, date of birth, postcode, procedure code and
local patient identifier code) from the NJR to link the data to the Hospital
Episode Statistics (HES) database. The HES data will provide details of
VTE, sociodemographics, comorbidities and hospital length of stay for the TKR.

no tourniquet) for the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>baseline characteristics (age, BMI, ASA, comorbidities, type of VTE
