                  <p id="Par2">Surgical units were recruited and randomised in batches to receive a hospital-level education intervention designed to reduce anastomotic leak, either before, during, or following data collection. All consecutive patients undergoing right colectomy were included. Online learning, patient risk stratification and an in-theatre checklist constituted the intervention. The study was powered to detect an absolute risk reduction of anastomotic leak from 8.1 to 5.6%. Statistical efficiency was optimised using an incomplete stepped wedge trial design and study batches analysed separately then meta-analysed to calculate the intervention effect. An established collaborative group helped nurture strong working relationships between units/countries and a prospectively designed process evaluation will enable evaluation of both the intervention and its implementation.</p>

              <title>Background
</title>
              <p id="Par11">Improvement of surgical safety is a global healthcare priority with significant potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. The most important complication of colorectal surgery is anastomotic leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This can occur when a joint made between two ends of the bowel, e.g. following the removal of part of the bowel, fails to seal properly resulting in leakage of bowel contents into the peritoneal cavity, infection, sepsis or even death. The ESCP sAfe Anastomosis proGramme in CoLorectal SurgEry (EAGLE) study is an international, pragmatic, cluster randomised trial of a quality improvement intervention designed to reduce anastomotic leak following a common operation called right colectomy (removal of the right side of the large bowel, to treat bowel cancer or benign disease, and connect small bowel to remaining colon), by implementation of an education programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Previous research has shown that specific risk factors that may be identified pre- and intra-operatively increase the risk of anastomotic leak after right colectomy, and variation in surgical practice can harm patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The EAGLE intervention promotes pre- and intra-operative operative risk calculation and harmonisation of surgical practice.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Large-scale quality improvement interventions generate a multitude of challenges that demand a robust study design and the ability for the design to adapt for delivery in different environments and social contexts. The EAGLE trial adopted an innovative batched stepped wedge design aimed at achieving good uptake and statistical efficiency. In this paper, we expand on the features of this design and reflect on lessons learned about the implementation of randomised evaluations of quality improvement programmes on an international scale.</p>

                <title>Summary of the EAGLE trial</title>
                <p id="Par14">Any surgical units that routinely perform both elective and emergency right colectomy in adult patients were eligible to enrol on the study. A surgical consultant, surgical trainee, an anaesthetist and a nurse principle investigator were required as a minimum in each local team (cluster). The primary objective was to reduce 30-day anastomotic leak rate following right colectomy. Clusters were randomised in a series of batches or phases approximately every 2Â months, provided at least 18 clusters were ready (batches varied in size). In each batch, clusters were randomised 1:1:1 to three different sequences, with data collection in two distinct 2-month calendar periods (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The sequences differed in terms of the timing of implementation of the intervention, and in the periods when data were collected. In the terminology of cluster randomised trial design, each batch consisted of an incomplete, three-sequence stepped wedge design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the trial as a whole was an example of a batched (incomplete) stepped wedge design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We expand further on these concepts below. The plan for analysis, briefly, was to analyse each batch separately and pool (meta-analyse) the estimates of intervention effect (further details of the analysis plan are provided in the published protocol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Incomplete stepped wedge study design timeline. Example timeline for a single phase or batch in the trial. The figure shows the incomplete dog-leg study design. Sequence randomisation takes place when clusters have enrolled and are ready to begin the study. This model is repeated multiple times with âtime 0â being reset for each new batch. Note: new patients are collected for 2Â months in each data collection period with outcomes followed up to 30Â days after</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7318_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par15">The hospital-level intervention required all surgeons to complete online education modules and then with their surgical teams to implement the âESCP Safe Anastomosis Interventionâ. The intervention was comprised of three components: pre-operative risk stratification, harmonisation of surgical technique and an intra-operative âESCP Safe Anastomosis checklistâ. Data collection involved identification and enrolment of all consecutive patientsââ¥â18Â years undergoing right colectomy with or without anastomosis in the defined data collection period, and follow-up until 30 postoperative days. As this was a hospital-level educational intervention, patient-level consent was not necessary in most jurisdictions. EAGLE was prospectively registered, IRAS ID:272,250; ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04270721 and the full protocol is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>

                <title>Choosing elements for quality improvement</title>
                <p id="Par16">EAGLE was tailored specifically to tackle differences identified in patient outcomes and improve overall anastomotic leak rate. Previous research including European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP) prospective audits demonstrated patient characteristics and intra-operative factors that increased the likelihood of anastomotic leak as well as differences in patient outcomes depending on whether they were operated by a general or colorectal surgeon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Directly addressing the lessons learned in existing studies, the EAGLE Protocol Working Group created the EAGLE programme to âlevel upâ care by quality improvement. The EAGLE intervention adopts first, an objective patient risk calculator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to identify patients at increased risk and enable surgeons to reconsider anastomosis and/or a defunctioning ileostomy (to divert bowel contents away from the join and into a bag on the abdominal wall, to prevent internal contamination while an anastomosis is healing). Second, the training modules ensure the best evidence is presented to all surgeons; general or colorectal, to harmonise operative practice and reduce differences in technique. Third, the intra-operative checklist enables factors, identified by the anaesthetist, theatre staff or surgeons, that arise during the operation to be incorporated in final decision-making for the anastomosis.</p>

This network helped promote and extend the study as the group had already delivered results and publications from previous work and retained the collaboration of many reputable establishments. In addition, the ESCP network allowed EAGLE to access a patient population, in which rates of anastomotic leak are established and would be comparable; notably, the 2015 snapshot audit reported an 8.1% anastomotic leak rate following right colectomy inâ&gt;â3000 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>

                <title>Batched stepped wedge design</title>
                <p id="Par19">Large clinical trials are notoriously complex to deliver and can have prolonged timelines. Surgical researchers are increasingly interested in methodological developments in randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. EAGLE planned to recruit 333 clusters (surgical units) and needed an approach that would allow clusters to on-board the trial as soon as they were ready, to avoid delays during which enthusiasm could start to wane. Stepped wedge trials typically involve all clusters commencing at the same time, though the possibility of separating clusters in a stepped wedge trial into distinct batches has recently been proposed and formalised to mitigate the problem of delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Each batch in a batched stepped wedge design can commence at different times, and effects of calendar time are adjusted separately within each batch, but with all batches contributing to the estimation of the intervention effect. In practical terms this allows investigators to focus recruitment of clusters in any given batch, taking optimal advantage of clustersâ availability to participate, while still accruing the overall statistical power needed to answer the research question.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The EAGLE protocol suggested indicatively that 7 batches of around 48 clusters each might be run, but the design and approach to analysis (meta-analysis across batches) gave us the flexibility to have batches of varying sizes. The make-up of a batch was determined largely by the order in which clusters enrolled, but again the design and meta-analytic approach gave us the flexibility, if we wanted it, to focus the recruitment of clusters to different batches in different global regions, for example. The sample size target (see below) was based on the total number of clusters and total number of surgical procedures across all batches.</p>

              <sec id="Sec8">
                <title>Statistical efficiency</title>
                <p id="Par21">An incomplete stepped wedge design was chosen in order to improve statistical efficiency by reducing both the number of clusters and the burden of individual-level data collection over all clusters necessary to achieve the required power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The particular incomplete design adopted for each batch of the EAGLE trial was a âdog-legâ design with three randomised sequences and two periods of data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] as demonstrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the first sequence the intervention is implemented before any data collection takes place, and data are collected in the first period only. In the second sequence data are collected in both periods, and the intervention is implemented between these two periods. In the third sequence the intervention is not implemented until after data collection, and data are collected in the second period only. All clusters receive the intervention within 28Â weeks.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The EAGLE trial was designed to detect what was judged to be a clinically important, absolute reduction in anastomotic leak rate from 8.1 to 5.6% (relative risk reduction 30%), based on the leak rate in previous research as above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In our sample size calculation we assumed an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 and a mean identification rate of 10 procedures per 8-week data collection period, and on this basis calculated an overall âdesign effectâ of 0.9 for our cluster-randomised dog-leg design relative to an individually-randomised, single-period, parallel-groups design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This design effect is an inflation factor (or in this case a deflation factor) that can be applied to the number of clusters required to achieve the specified power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The design effect is less than 1.0 in this case because of the efficiency offered by having both pre- and post-intervention data collection from the same clusters in the second sequence. Thus we determined that we needed 333 clusters with data on a total of 4440 surgical procedures in order to achieve 80% power at the 5% significance level. This calculation included a correction to allow for variable cluster size (for further details of the sample size calculation, see the published protocol) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">We also calculated that if we had used a more conventional, parallel groups cluster randomised design, with data collection in both periods in all clusters, we would have needed 358 clusters with data on 7,160 surgical procedures in total, thus demonstrating the superior efficiency of the dog-leg design.</p>

Stepped wedge cluster randomised trials demand a particularly rigorous approach to case ascertainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All participating EAGLE clusters were contacted after batch completion to report the number of sequential eligibleÂ patients in a randomly-selected 2-week sample of their data collection periods. Figures were compared with the cases reported electronically and any inconsistencies were investigated with the whole period being re-checked, any missed cases added or erroneous cases removed. Additionally, data accuracy was assessed at three clusters per randomisation sequence (approximately 30% clusters in each batch), selected using a random number generator. Each cluster nominated someone to complete the data accuracy exercise, resubmitting ten key data points for up to the first ten consecutive patients in a single data collection period.</p>

They also had the power to recommend to the TSC that the entire trial be stopped early, or that a single ongoing batch be terminated.

                <title>Effects of and resilience to COVID-19</title>
                <p id="Par30">EAGLE recruited and randomised the first batch of hospitals in December 2019, as âphase 1â, and the second in February 2020, âphase 2â, prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic rapidly shut down global surgical services and a decision was made to suspend the EAGLE study, just five weeks after launch, on 13<sup>th</sup> March 2020. As pandemic waves reached different countries at different times, some clusters continued to progress local approvals and as the first wave retreated, clusters were asked their readiness and capacity to restart the EAGLE programme. âPhase 1â resumed on 27<sup>th</sup> July 2020 with a mix of hospitals derived from phases 1 and 2 that had indicated readiness. Clusters who could not yet participate joined later batches.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Clusters in âphase 1â that had implemented the intervention but then paused due to COVID-19 were offered a 2-week ârefresherâ intervention period for teams to review e-modules and intervention components before embarking on post-intervention data collection. Several clusters reported structural or organisational changes related to the pandemic and EAGLE adapted to ensure inclusivity despite these circumstances. One hospital that had previously performed both elective and emergency colorectal surgery was re-structured with its sister hospital to separate emergency operating at one site and elective operating at the other, but with a single, cross-site surgical team. On resumption of the study, local approvals were amended to include both sites as a single cluster. Conversely, in another site where there were two entirely separate surgical teams, each team was randomised as a separate cluster.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Although the interruption to the first batches impacted on the conduct of the trial and thus potentially the interpretation of the data in these batches, this impact was contained and did not compromise later batches, illustrating a more general robustness in the batched approach to design. When the trial data are analysed it may be necessary to perform a sensitivity analysis excluding phases 1 and 2.</p>

                <title>Team structure</title>
                <p id="Par33">The EAGLE team comprised separate Protocol Writing and Education Committee groups to drive forward the study design and the educational resources independently. The Operations Committee was convened to deliver the study with âMeta-coordinatorsâ liaising between the central team and âCoordinatorsâ who were responsible for day-to-day liaison with collaborators from individual clusters, loosely divided into geographical groups of hospitals or by language (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>EAGLE team structure showing relationships between committees</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7318_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par34">EAGLE Coordinators worked with local Principal Investigators (PIs) to ensure that relevant local approvals were realised. Any regional or national ethical approvals were shared with other members of the same jurisdiction to minimise duplication of work. Resources and approvals were disseminated by close communication between PIs, coordinators and meta-coordinators.</p>

                <title>Trial strengths</title>
                <p id="Par35">EAGLE has proved a highly effective study design to deliver a complex quality improvement intervention in a wide range of settings across multiple study batches. Translation of resources and batching of clusters has enabled the study to navigate geographic, language and varied pandemic landscapes. The streamlined outcomes and design with incomplete cross sections offered high data completeness with low investigator burden. The trial was powered to efficiently detect reduction of a significant, measurable outcome. Finally, regardless of whether the primary outcome is achieved, the trial delivered a framework for education and operating team communication to hospital teams in all study sequences.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par36">Implementing the design in batches had a number of practical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], including enabling sequential participation of different clusters through the course of the trial. The use of an incomplete rather than a complete design in each batch had a theoretical advantage in terms of the quantity of data required for the trial, but there were also disadvantages.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The staggered start dates for data collection and introduction of the intervention meant that collaborators, e.g. Surgical Trainee Principal Investigators could miss participating in the study itself despite garnering the appropriate approvals, because the lead-in time after randomisation could be up to 20Â weeks. This affected trainees or other collaborators moving between hospitals/departments, particularly in sequence 3. The risks with such a long lead in time include reduced motivation and engagement by the time study activities begin; however, this may also be seen in the context of studies that recruit many clusters to start at the same time, as those recruited first may have lost motivation by the time enough teams are prepared to start. Where long delays mean collaborators have changed departments or hospitals, the local team also needs to recruit new core team members who may not be as familiar with the study.</p>
                <p id="Par38">A further risk associated with long lead-in times before pre-intervention data collection is the risk that participants will, in the meantime, access educational materials from elsewhere. This will, at worst, attenuate our estimate of the effect of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par39">EAGLE sequence 3 collaborators must also rely on internal rather than external motivation to complete e-learning, (since there was no post-intervention data collection for this group therefore core EAGLE team members would have less reason to urge surgeon colleagues to complete the modules). While this would not affect the studyâs primary objective (as no post-intervention data collection planned), it would reduce the dissemination of evidence-based education content which is designed to be delivered at every EAGLE participating cluster.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The e-modules contained extensive evidence-based content for surgeons that were presented in English. Most surgeons in the ESCP are accustomed to working in English however the resource was offered to all surgeons at participating hospitals and this monolingual resource may have excluded selected surgeon users. In some countries (South Korea, Romania), surgeons formed working groups to undertake the e-modules together. A lead surgeon could translate and interpret the modules, and cross the language barrier for colleagues with more limited English.</p>
                <p id="Par41">One further drawback is that this study did not examine the longer-term effects of the intervention. Individual surgeons or surgical teams could slip back into older less evidence-based practice, team members will inevitably change, and without deliberate maintenance of the practice change, any beneficial intervention effects may be lost. There is a strong case for a follow-up cohort study to assess longer-term adherence and patient outcomes, should the study show a patient benefit.</p>

                <title>Process evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par42">To ensure EAGLEâs results can be understood, a prospectively designed process evaluation is being undertaken. The parallel process evaluation will demonstrate how the education resources have reached learners (engagement), to what extent patients have received, or been exposed to, the EAGLE Safe Anastomosis Programme in the post-intervention groups (implementation), and help identify factors that have promoted or distracted intervention implementation. This will allow the projectâs outcomes to be examined, to delineate motivators and barriers for the intervention and to decipher any intervention failure from an implementation failure. This analysis can enhance a studyâs overall results and avoid drawing false conclusions of failure (or success) in either aspect of study delivery.</p>

              <p id="Par43">EAGLEâs robust but flexible trial design allowed sequential recruitment and completion of the study across geographical locations in spite of the pandemic. EAGLEâs collaborative group originating in the ESCP network, helped nurture strong working relationships with resource sharing to reduce duplication. The primary outcome analysed in conjunction with the process evaluation will ensure a rich understanding of the intervention and the effects of the study design.</p>
