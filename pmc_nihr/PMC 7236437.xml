                  <p id="Par1">Supervised cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation may be safe and beneficial for people with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in groups 1 (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and 4 (chronic thromboembolic disease), particularly as a hospital in-patient. It has not been tested in the most common PH groups; 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease), or 5 (other disorders). Further it has not been evaluated in the UK National Health Service (NHS) out-patient setting, or with long-term follow-up. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention with psychosocial support compared to best practice usual care for people with PH in the community/outpatient setting.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm RCT with embedded process evaluation aims to recruit 352 clinically stable adults with PH (groups 1–5) and WHO functional class II-IV. Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 20 intervention and <italic>n</italic> = 20 control) and practitioners (<italic>n</italic> = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par44">Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a debilitating condition causing dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations, dizziness, and chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many affected people are anxious about, and avoid, physical activity. Depression is common, and quality of life (QoL) can be poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are five diagnostic groups: Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Group 2 PH due to left heart disease; Group 3 PH due to lung diseases or hypoxia; Group 4 chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH); Group 5 PH due to other disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Drug treatment and pulmonary endarterectomy may help people with PAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and CTEPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], respectively, but benefit is often limited. For people with PH secondary to cardiac or pulmonary disease (groups 2 &amp; 3), there are no treatments of proven benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">Exercise rehabilitation appears to be safe and may help people with PAH and CTEPH, particularly when undertaken as a hospital in-patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Recent recommendations support a conservative approach, under the careful supervision of appropriately skilled practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, exercise rehabilitation has not been tested in those with the most common forms of PH (groups 2 &amp; 3), or in an out-patient setting in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For people living with chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), without co-existing PH, exercise rehabilitation is recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the British Thoracic Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], supported by a considerable evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Exercise rehabilitation can improve fitness in these populations, and increase ability to ‘self-manage’, often reducing health and care utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible, that exercise may also help people in other PH groups with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">A 2017 Cochrane review of exercise rehabilitation for PH identified six RCTs (N = 206 mainly people with PAH or CTEPH) with short follow-up (3–15 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Low quality evidence showed that exercise rehabilitation programmes increased six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance by 60 m, compared to usual care (95% CI 30 m to 90 m), without any serious adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The SF-36 physical component score improved by 4.63 points (95% CI 0.80 to 8.47), but this was not considered clinically important. Few studies have tested exercise rehabilitation for PH secondary to cardiac and pulmonary disease (groups 2 &amp; 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Rationale for a trial</title>
                <p id="Par47">In-patient exercise rehabilitation may have short-term benefit on exercise capacity in selected people with PAH or CTEPH. However, it is not known if these benefits extend to people in PH groups 2, 3, &amp; 5, if exercise rehabilitation delivered in an NHS out-patient setting is effective, or if there are any long-term health benefits or harms. To date there have been no high-quality, multi-centre RCTs to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of supervised exercise rehabilitation with psychosocial support compared to best-practice usual care delivered in the UK NHS out-patient setting.</p>

Primarily, local secondary care disease registers and hospital discharge data (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision [ICD-10]) will be screened. In addition, people with less common PH aetiology (who may not be captured through other routes), and those with a high probability of PH based on echocardiographic findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], will be identified in specialist nurse/medical clinics.</p>

At this face to face appointment, prior to randomisation, eligibility will be confirmed, and consent taken by an appropriately trained member of the clinical or research team. Specifically, consent will be sought for the following; 1) trial participation, 2) review of medical notes by responsible individuals, 3) collection, storage and use of personal identifiable information by authorised individuals, 4) access to long-term health and care information via NHS Digital and other NHS bodies, and 5) permission to contact next of kin.</p>

It is highly adaptable to allow personalisation to lower or higher ability participants, whilst ensuring safety and efficacy. The SPHERe exercise intervention combines conventional gym-based aerobic exercise with ‘functional fitness training’.

As such, SPHERe will draw on social cognitive approaches to behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], including scrutiny of multiple interactions between environment, personal factors and behaviours. Based on behaviour change techniques and the COM-B framework, three basic aspects of peoples’ lives will be addressed: capability (psychological capability through education and planning, and physical capability through supervised practice), opportunity (providing support and guidance through the different components of the programme as well as exploring external opportunities (physical and social)), and motivation (through refection and discussion of health beliefs, illness representations, monitoring of progress and exploring emotional reasoning including possible feelings of anxiety, low mood and fear) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There will be a focus on increasing participants’ awareness of their priorities, through an investigation of the pros and cons of changing a specific behaviour (self-management e.g. fear avoidance of exercise) and assisting them to develop a specific plan to change (planning, goal setting). Other components of the programme will include pacing of activities, managing setbacks, stress and stress management as well as long term behaviour change. The SPHERe practitioners will be trained in motivational interviewing to assess patients’ current beliefs and encourage behaviour change. Comprehensive SPHERe manuals have been developed to guide participants and practitioners through each topic including case studies, working examples and visual aids.</p>

It will, therefore, be essential for participants to access disease specific education. Equally, living with PH involves management of symptoms, experiences and challenges that are common to all aetiologies of PH. SPHERe participants will access both generic and disease specific group education sessions (with non-trial cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation patients), provided by clinical staff at all SPHERe centres, as part of existing cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation services. All participants (regardless of PH group) will attend generic sessions, provided as standard clinical practice by existing clinical staff, on: 1) managing breathlessness; 2) breathing control and relaxation; 3) anxiety and depression; and 4) activity pacing and energy conservation.</p>
                  <p id="Par72">Disease specific topics, which may include medication, sputum clearance, managing cardiac symptoms, risk factors, smoking cessation, oxygen therapy etc., provided routinely by clinical staff, will be accessed as relevant. For people with PH groups 2 &amp; 3, this specialist advice/education will be available as standard through the cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. Prior to enrolling in SPHERe, PH groups 1, 4, &amp; 5 will have had discrete and extensive education with practitioners at local and national specialist clinics, as per their routine clinical treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par78">Disease specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will be measured with the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This is widely used as a clinical and research tool in PH, displaying good construct validity and reproducibility. The full scale is 65 items consisting of a 25-item symptoms scale (scored 0–25), a 15-item functioning scale (scored 0–30) and a 25-item QoL scale (scored 0–25). A total score and scores for each of the three sub-scales (symptoms, functioning, QoL) are produced; for all scales, a low score indicates a better status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par79">Health utility will be assessed with the EQ-5D-5 L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], a validated, generic HRQoL measure consisting of five dimensions, each with five levels of response. Each combination of answers can be converted into a health utility score. It has good test-retest reliability, is simple to use, and gives a single preference-based index value for health status that can be used for cost-effectiveness analysis. Anxiety and depression will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], a 14-item screening questionnaire from which an anxiety and depression subscale can be derived. Sub-score values &gt; 5 points identify increased symptoms of anxiety and/or depression; a total score &gt; 9 is considered indicative of psychological distress. Generalised self-efficacy scale will be assessed with a 10-item psychometric scale designed to assess optimistic self-beliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life; these relate to key targets of the behavioural component of the SPHERe intervention. We will capture fatigue using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a nine-item questionnaire validated for evaluating disabling fatigue and previously used in PH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A total score is derived from all nine questions; a higher score indicates a greater impact of fatigue on everyday activities.</p>

Medication class, drug, dose and frequency of all regular medication will be recorded as well as ‘time to clinical worsening’: defined as one of; PH related death; listing for/completed lung transplant; hospitalisation for PH; clinical worsening leading to initiation of new PH treatment; decreased WHO functional class and ≥ 15% decrease in 6MWT distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].

Participants will complete resource use questionnaires in person or by post at four and 12 months, to collect resource use data associated with the interventions. Participants will be provided with a resource use diary as an aide memoire to help record resource use between four and 12 months. At the end of the follow-up period, a copy of medical records for the participant will be requested from their GP. This will provide information on GP consultations and include copies of any hospital discharge letters allowing accurate costing of in-patient care costs.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par84">The primary outcome will be distance walked measured using the ISWT at 4 months post-randomisation. As there are no directly applicable ISWT data with which to calculate a sample size, or previously defined worthwhile effect sizes for IWST in people with PH, 6MWT data have been used to estimate the sample size. The 6MWT distance, unlike the alternative approach of using a standardised mean difference (SMD), has the advantage that it is meaningful to participants and grounded in clinical reality.</p>
                <p id="Par85">The baseline pooled 6MWT distance in current studies of exercise rehabilitation for PH is 414 m (SD 91) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Whilst a useful starting point, these data indicate a comparatively fit group of people with PH (younger, group 1 PH). Based on a sample from one cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation service at UHCW NHS Trust, typically, people with PH walk around 300 m in the 6MWT. Conventionally, the minimally clinically important difference for PH studies is 30 m on 6MWT or an SMD of 0.33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patient partners suggested that a larger difference was needed to make this treatment worthwhile. Therefore, sample size is predicated on showing a mean difference of 45 m in 6MWT distance. This equates to a standardised mean difference of 0.5; conventionally a moderate effect size.</p>
                <p id="Par86">To achieve 90% power at 5% significance level, to show a difference in 6MWT distance of 45 m, with a standard deviation of 90, data from 170 people are needed. Allowance has been made for clustering effects by site in the intervention arm using Moerbeek’s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and an unbalanced randomisation. Therefore, an unequal allocation (1.15:1 for intervention vs control) was determined based on the following assumptions: a mean cluster size of 12 at follow-up, an intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) of 0.03 and same group variance. The ICC is an overall estimation of the site and practitioner effect, leading to an estimated design effect of 1.33, although a negligible practitioner effect in this trial is anticipated. Accordingly, the group sample sizes were calculated separately, given the power of 90% and a significance level of 5%. An 80% retention rate is expected at 4 months. Therefore, 246 participants (132 in intervention) will be recruited to allow for 20% loss to follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The primary aim is to show an overall effect size for all PH groups without considering participant mix. Based on published data for prevalence of PAH and CTEPH, however, most participants will have PH groups 2 or 3. Sufficient data will be collected to assess outcome in a pooled group of people with group 2 or 3 PH as a secondary analysis. Approximately 70% of the total sample size will be people with group 2 or 3 PH. To ensure power of 90% power, for this sub-group, the sample of 246 will inflated to 352 participants (189 intervention, 163 control). This will be the total sample for the trial which will ensure sufficient power for the main analysis as well as the sub-group analysis. There is some uncertainty about the final sample size because of the need to include 246 people with group 2/3 PH in the overall population and an ambition to include a minimum of 20 people each from PH groups 1, 4, &amp; 5.</p>

Data will be summarised and reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines for RCTs, using intention-to-treat analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Hierarchical linear regression models will be used to estimate the treatment effects (95% confidence intervals), adjusted for important patient-level covariates and centre effect. Estimation of, and adjustment for practitioner effects will be included. If there is negligible practitioner and centre effect, then the usual linear regression will be used for the analysis. Categorical data will be assessed in a similar way, using logistic regression models. The main analyses will be intention to treat and will assess the impact of compliance on outcomes using a CACE (complier average causal effect) analysis. For the intervention group, full compliance will be considered as attending at least 75% of the supervised exercise sessions. In addition, probabilities for achieving the desired effect size in each of the PH groups will be presented using the magnitude based inference approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]..</p>

Pre-specified sub-group analyses will examine the interaction of treatment assignment with the groupings of PH. Analysis will be conducted using formal tests of interaction. This trial is not powered to identify interactions, thus, whilst pre-specified, these analyses should be considered as no more than exploratory. However, the effect size for pooled PH groups 2 &amp; 3 will be presented as a separate analysis. Main outcomes will also be presented by diagnostic group (minimum 20 people contributing data) to inform decision makers and guidance developers interested in specific PH groups. To maximise data value, data from published trials (identified in an updated systematic review) assessing the same outcomes in RCTs of out-patient/community outreach interventions for specific PH group, will be included.

The primary perspective will include NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) costs. However, patient direct and indirect costs will also be included in a secondary broader societal perspective. Primary care and referral events will be captured both from health records and from participants, using a triangulation and adjudication approach to promote robust estimates of resource use. Participants will also report PSS and personal direct and indirect costs. Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and national hospital reference costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] will be used as principal unit cost sources.

These health state values will be used to estimate QALYs at the patient level, over 1 year, using the trapezoidal rule. The EQ-5D-5 L will be used as the overall HRQoL outcome due to specific concerns about the sensitivity to change of other measures such as the SF-36, in this population. The EQ-5D-5 L is likely to be more responsive to change than the 3 L, and hence is preferred as a clinical outcome. Significant adverse events will be captured summatively in the HRQoL estimation. Decision modelling will be considered beyond the end of the trial if outcomes have not converged.</p>
                <p id="Par92">It is anticipated that bivariate regression of costs and QALYs (with bootstrapping of models) will be used to generate incremental cost per QALY estimates and credible intervals, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, and value-of-information analysis. With regard to normality, invoking the central limit theorem avoids the problems that non-Gaussian link functions generate for the analysis. However, if distributions are very unusual, cost and QALYs will be conflated in a net benefit analysis evaluated at different thresholds of willingness to pay, reducing the analysis to a univariate regression problem.</p>

A purposively selected subset (10%) of recordings will be analysed, with a checklist to assess fidelity and help understand which areas generated discussion. Intervention fidelity will be assessed using the tenets highlighted by Mars et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>

Any significant issues will be referred to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) which will meet twice yearly and constitute a group of experienced personnel and trialists, ‘lay’ representatives, and an independent Chairperson. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) consisting of independent experts with relevant clinical research and statistical experience, will meet twice yearly to ensure data integrity and participant safety.</p>

Any AEs related to SPHERe will be recorded and reported to the relevant oversight committees. In this population, serious adverse events (SAE) are expected. Hospital admissions data will be collected through self-report and GP records, and deaths via NHS Digital. SAEs that have no causal relationship with the intervention will not be reported to oversight committees. Causality and expectedness will be confirmed by the CI with clinician support. SAEs deemed to be unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related to the trial interventions will be notified to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) within 15 days. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded within 24 h of the investigator being made aware.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p id="Par98">The SPHERe intervention and trial were developed during the grant funding application process and subsequently during the pre-pilot feasibility phase. Patient and public involvement was pivotal at every stage. A three-stage process was followed as per MRC guidance: 1) systematic literature review; 2) expert opinion, stakeholder engagement and consensus meetings; 3) intervention piloting, acceptability and refinement. Lay partners and co-applicants were fully integrated into every stage of trial development, taking an active role in refining intervention components and reviewing the application. A lay co-applicant currently sits on the trial management group (TMG), initially meeting monthly and subsequently quarterly, and has a pivotal role in steering the conduct of the trial. She reviewed the ethics application to ensure that trial documentation e.g. participant information leaflet, was user appropriate. Lay partners have been actively involved in trial publicity and media and will help with the dissemination of findings through appropriate channels i.e. social media, lay conferences, public engagement events, service provider events, newsletter articles. Lay partners also sit on the TSC as verified independent members. Lay co-apps and partners are supported by the chief investigator (CI), trial management team, and through the peer support of lay partners on existing clinical trials. Comprehensive training and support was provided by WCTU.</p>

              <p id="Par99">Pulmonary hypertension is life-limiting and can have a substantial impact on QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Amongst numerous debilitating symptoms, exertional breathlessness and fatigue prevent completion of many activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For PH groups 2&amp;3 in particular, there is a distinct lack of targeted therapies and treatment options.</p>
              <p id="Par100">Exercise rehabilitation is routinely offered to people with many forms of heart and lung disease, but due to a lack of empirical data, is not currently provided for people with PH. The SPHERe study aims to address this evidence gap. It is the first multi-centre clinical trial to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised out-patient exercise rehabilitation intervention compared to best-practice usual care, delivered in the UK NHS, for people in all PH diagnostic groups.</p>
              <p id="Par101">Results from the SPHERe study will inform many areas of clinical practice. Firstly, clinicians and rehabilitation practitioners will gain invaluable insight into the specific exercise rehabilitation requirements of people with PH. Secondly, they will have definitive answers as to the clinical efficacy of NHS out-patient exercise rehabilitation programmes for this diverse population. Thirdly, commissioners will be able to appraise the cost-effectiveness of such programmes and inform commissioning strategies accordingly. Finally, people with all forms of PH will be able to get an appreciation for the potential benefit or harm of out-patient exercise rehabilitation and make informed decisions as to their future participation in physical activity and exercise programmes. Should the trial find that exercise rehabilitation is beneficial to health-related outcomes, the SPHERe supervised and home-based exercise rehabilitation resources will be made freely available to rehabilitation practitioners and people with PH.</p>
