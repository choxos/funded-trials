                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a pleiotropic cytokine with both injurious and protective functions, which are thought to diverge at the level of its two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. In the setting of acute injury, selective inhibition of TNFR1 is predicted to attenuate the cell death and inflammation associated with TNF-α, while sparing or potentiating the protective effects of TNFR2 signalling. We developed a potent and selective antagonist of TNFR1 (GSK1995057) using a novel domain antibody (dAb) therapeutic and assessed its efficacy in vitro, in vivo and in a clinical trial involving healthy human subjects.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We investigated the in vitro effects of GSK1995057 on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) and then assessed the effects of pretreatment with nebulised GSK1995057 in a non-human primate model of acute lung injury. We then tested translation to humans by investigating the effects of a single nebulised dose of GSK1995057 in healthy humans (n=37) in a randomised controlled clinical trial in which subjects were subsequently exposed to inhaled endotoxin.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Selective inhibition of TNFR1 signalling potently inhibited cytokine and neutrophil adhesion molecule expression in activated HMVEC-L monolayers in vitro (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001, respectively), and also significantly attenuated inflammation and signs of lung injury in non-human primates (P&lt;0.01 in all cases). In a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of nebulised GSK1995057 in 37 healthy humans challenged with a low dose of inhaled endotoxin, treatment with GSK1995057 attenuated pulmonary neutrophilia, inflammatory cytokine release (P&lt;0.01 in all cases) and signs of endothelial injury (P&lt;0.05) in bronchoalveolar lavage and serum samples.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects approximately 190 000 patients per annum in the USA, and is associated with mortality rates of up to 40%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> To date, no effective pharmacological therapies, which target the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ARDS, have been discovered.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The development of ARDS is characterised by immune cell-mediated injury to the lung,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> associated with the release of inflammatory cytokines and proteases. The uncontrolled local inflammatory response in ARDS contributes to alveolar-capillary barrier damage and the exudation of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space, which manifests as non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, which is central to the pathogenesis of ARDS, is mediated by the interaction of primed and activated neutrophils with the lung microvascular endothelium.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Preclinical and clinical studies have identified tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as a key effector molecule in ARDS and also sepsis; a common cause of ARDS.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> However, results from clinical trials of parenteral non-selective TNF-α targeting antibodies in sepsis have been variable with most failing to demonstrate a significant survival benefit<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>; at least one trial suggesting evidence of harm at higher doses<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; and one trial suggesting an improvement in hospital survival and organ dysfunction in patients with elevated baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>Recently, it has become evident that the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α diverge at the level of its two cellular receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Whereas numerous studies support the role of TNFR1 in mediating cell death signalling and inflammation,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> the role of TNFR1 in the generation of vascular leak and neutrophilic inflammation remains controversial.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> In contrast, it has recently been suggested that TNFR2 signalling may be important in attenuating the apoptotic activity of TNF-α, and in mediating important survival and proliferation signals<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> through activation of apoptotic regulators (eg, cIAP1 and 2) and the non-canonical nuclear factor κB pathway, respectively.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Interestingly, TNFR1-deficient mice are protected from lung injury, sepsis and other acute organ injuries, whereas TNFR2-deficient mice are consistently more susceptible to injury in these models.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23–26</xref> These studies indicate that selectively antagonising TNFR1, while sparing TNFR2 signalling, could be therapeutically advantageous. We therefore developed a short-acting, fully human domain antibody (dAb) fragment that selectively antagonises TNF-α signalling through TNFR1, but not TNFR2.</p>
              <p>dAbs represent the smallest functional antigen-binding units of human antibodies (10–13 kDa), are derived from single variable regions of either heavy or light chain sequences of human IgG and are sufficiently stable to allow nebulisation directly to the lungs.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A homology model structure and amino acid sequence of GSK1995057 are shown in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 1</xref>, together with binding characteristics to both human and cynomolgus monkey TNFR1-Fc fusion proteins. When administered directly to the lungs of mice either concomitantly or after challenge with acid instillation or ventilation with large tidal volumes, murine TNFR1-targeting dAbs attenuate the development of pulmonary oedema, arterial hypoxaemia and inflammation.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> Here we present the first report of an inhaled variable heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) chain TNFR1 dAb antagonist (GSK1995057) administered directly to the lungs of cynomolgus monkeys and humans, and explore the underlying mechanism of action using in vitro human tissue assays.</p>

                <p>The assessment of permeability of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC-L) monolayers was undertaken using an electrical cell impedance sensor technique. Once electrical resistance achieved steady state, cells were incubated for 1 hour in the presence of GSK1995057 or dummy dAb (10 nM) or vehicle control for 1 hour prior to stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/mL). Neutrophil transmigration assays were performed using neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers. Neutrophil transmigration through confluent HMVEC-L incubated with GSK1995057 or dummy dAb (10 nM) or vehicle control for 1 hour prior to stimulation with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) was measured using CytoSelect Leukocyte Transmigration assay (Cambridge Biosciences) and endothelial ligand cell surface expression was assessed using HMVEC-L after 4 hours of treatment.

                  <p>The clinical trial was a randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of inhaled GSK1995057 in healthy subjects. The study consisted of 2 parts within a ‘fused’ protocol operated across two different clinical units, recruiting a total of six cohorts. The dose-escalating cohorts in part 1 were conducted to confirm preliminary safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GSK1995057 and were conducted at the PAREXEL International Clinical Pharmacology Research Unit, Harrow, UK. This part of the study was conducted in a single-blind manner to allow appropriate, real-time assessment of safety. Subjects in cohort 5 of part 1 received a single inhaled dose of GSK1995057 in addition to BAL sampling at approximately 30 min after dose to confirm BALF levels of GSK1995057.</p>
                  <p>Subjects in part 2 of the trial were randomised to receive a single nebulised dose (26 mg) of GSK1995057 1 hour prior to receiving a nebulised challenge of 50 µg of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. This part of the study was carried out at Celerion Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Belfast, UK. The BAL procedure was performed 6 hours after LPS inhalation (7 hours after dosing GSK1995057) and the primary endpoint of the trial was BALF neutrophil count with BALF and plasma cytokine, chemokine, epithelial and endothelial biomarkers as secondary endpoints. The dose of GSK1995057 and timing for BAL was derived from data obtained from the dose-finding study in cynomolgus monkeys also presented in this manuscript.

                  <p>The clinical trial was designed to recruit enough subjects to provide data from 36 subjects available for analysis (18 for placebo, and 18 for GSK1995057). While the sample size was based on feasibility, subject numbers were determined to ensure at least 80% power to detect a 65% decrease in BALF neutrophil counts based on mean effect sizes observed in monkey LPS challenge studies. An interim sample size re-estimation (blinded to investigator site team) was undertaken when BAL neutrophil counts from 16 subjects (eight in each study arm) were available for statistical analysis. This confirmed the estimates used to assess the statistical power of the planned sample size, and therefore no change to the sample size was made. Distributional assumptions were assessed by visual inspection of residual plots. Normality was examined by normal probability plots, while homogeneity of variance was assessed by plotting the residuals against the predicted values for the model. Two sample t-tests were used to evaluate the effects of GSK1995057 on biomarkers from BALF samples. Mixed model repeated measures using random effects was used to evaluate the effects of GSK1995057 on biomarkers from serum samples using SAS V.9.3. Baseline values of the biomarker were included as covariates in the analysis of biomarkers from serum samples. Data are shown as geometric mean and SE.</p>

                <p>To investigate the hypothesis that TNFR1 mediates neutrophilic inflammation in the lung, we assessed the impact of selective TNFR1 antagonism using GSK1995057 on neutrophil transmigration and endothelial permeability in a human in vitro cell system. Using the CytoSelect Leukocyte Transmigration assay, we observed that pretreatment of HMVEC-L monolayers with GSK1995057 significantly reduced the transendothelial migration of neutrophils towards the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>; P&lt;0.05). GSK1995057 also reduced TNF-α-mediated endothelial permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>; P&lt;0.001), and modulated the expression of key ligands for neutrophil–endothelial interaction, preventing the TNF-α-induced increases in HMVEC-L surface expression of E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (P&lt;0.001 in all cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C–E</xref>), as well as decreasing the concentrations of the soluble forms of these molecules, which are markers of endothelial injury (P&lt;0.05 in all cases; see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). TNFR1 antagonism also reduced the release of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 by TNF-α-stimulated HMVEC-L (P&lt;0.01 in all cases; see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 3</xref>).</p>

                <p>We investigated further the effects of a single aerosolised dose of GSK1995057 on pulmonary inflammation in a non-human primate model of acute lung injury. Twenty-five cynomolgus monkeys received either nebulised vehicle control, nebulised GSK1995057 (0.043 mg, 0.45 mg or 4.7 mg) or an instillation of fluticasone propionate (positive control; 1.2 mg) via the intratracheal route, 1 hour prior to nebulised LPS (400 µg) challenge. Nebulised GSK1995057 was well tolerated in monkeys and no adverse effects associated with dosing were observed (data not shown). The primary endpoint was the number of neutrophils in the BALF at 6 and 24 hours after LPS exposure. BALF neutrophil counts were markedly suppressed at 6 hours for all three doses of GSK1995057, and at 24 hours for the higher dose levels (0.45 and 4.7 mg (P&lt;0.01 in all cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>)). In support of this finding, the BALF concentration of neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase was also reduced in the GSK1995057-treated animals (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 4A</xref>). A reduction in BALF monocyte-macrophage numbers was also observed at 24 hours, reaching significance with the highest and middle doses of GSK1995057 (P&lt;0.01, online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 4B</xref>). In agreement with our in vitro studies, pretreatment with GSK1995057 reduced the BALF concentration of alpha-2-macroglobulin, a marker of alveolar-capillary barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>) and von Willebrand factor, a biomarker of endothelial injury/activation (vWF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>).

Cynomolgus monkeys received nebulised GSK1995057 (0.043, 0.45 or 4.7 mg), vehicle control, or an intratracheal instillation of fluticasone propionate (FP) (positive control; 1.2 mg), 1 hour prior to nebulised lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4 mL of 100 µg/mL) challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at 6 and 24 hours after LPS challenge. The effects of inhaled GSK1995057 (0.043, 0.45 or 4.7 mg dose) are shown on BALF neutrophil counts, and BALF concentrations of the alveolar-capillary permeability marker alpha-2-macroglobulin and the biomarker of endothelial activation/injury von Willebrand factor (A–C). Panels (D–F) show the effects of GSK1995057 on BALF concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, respectively. Data shown are geometric means±SEM (n=3 monkeys in the FP group, n=5 in the 4.7 mg GSK1995057 and vehicle groups, and n=6 in the 0.45 and 0.043 mg GSK1995057 groups). Data analysed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01; ***P&lt;0.001.</p>

                <p>Having demonstrated that selective TNFR1 antagonism with GSK1995057 reduced neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation, microvascular permeability and endothelial cell activation/injury in complementary in vitro and in vivo models, we undertook a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the effects of nebulised GSK1995057 in an LPS-induced model of acute lung injury in healthy human volunteers. Previous clinical investigations with intravenous GSK1995057 identified a pre-existing host antibody response in some human subjects that increased the risk of mild infusion reactions following intravenous dosing.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> As a result, only healthy subjects prospectively demonstrated to be seronegative for these pre-existing antidrug antibodies were eligible for participation. Following a dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and target engagement of nebulised GSK1995057 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figures 5–7</xref>), healthy human subjects were randomised (1:1) to receive a single nebulised dose (26 mg) of GSK1995057 or placebo (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table 2</xref> for details of investigational products), administered 1 hour prior to the inhalation of LPS (50 µg), with BALF collected 6 hours after LPS challenge (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01587807). The LPS challenge schema is outlined in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 8</xref>, and the full study schedule is shown in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table 1</xref>. The primary endpoint of the study was the BALF neutrophil count 6 hours after LPS exposure (7 hours after dosing of GSK1995057).</p>
                <p>Thirty-seven healthy subjects were enrolled. One subject in the placebo group was excluded from cell count analyses, due to technical failure of automated cell counting. Since the sample was otherwise viable, protein biomarker results from this subject were included in the analyses, but an additional subject was recruited to the placebo group to provide additional cell count data. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram for the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>. There were no differences in baseline demographic parameters between the groups randomised to receive placebo or GSK1995057 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>). No serious or unexpected adverse events occurred in either group. The table of adverse events is shown in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table 3</xref>.</p>

                    <p>Effects of GSK1995057 in a human experimental model of acute lung injury. Healthy human subjects (n=37) were randomised (1:1) to treatment with GSK1995057, or vehicle control, 1 hour prior to inhalation of 50 µg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 6 hours after LPS inhalation. The effect of GSK1995057 on BALF neutrophil count is shown with (A) and without (B) a single biological outlier who displayed an exaggerated increase in BALF neutrophils (&gt;3 times IQR, and outside the upper quartile). BALF cytology in this subject was abnormal with the presence of foamy macrophages, excessive mucus and debris, and lytic/apoptotic neutrophils; however, the subject was clinically well and had a transient increase in temperature (38.2°C) after LPS inhalation, but no clinically significant adverse events. Panel (C) shows the effect of GSK1995057 on BALF concentration of the endothelial activation/injury biomarker von Willebrand factor.

                </fig>
                <p>In keeping with our in vitro and animal model studies, GSK1995057 significantly reduced the BALF concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 following LPS administration (P&lt;0.01 in all cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4D–F</xref>), as well as reducing BALF concentrations of the mononuclear cell chemokines MIP1α, MIP1β and MCP-1 (P&lt;0.001 in all cases; online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 9A–C</xref>). Furthermore, GSK1995057 also reduced the BALF concentration of vWF after LPS challenge (P&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>). This occurred in the absence of alterations in the BALF concentrations of the alveolar epithelial injury/activation markers SP-D and CC16; data not shown. These data again support the concept that GSK1995057 reduces pulmonary inflammation via modulation of neutrophil–endothelial interactions. We observed no differences in the BALF concentrations of the alveolar-capillary barrier permeability marker alpha-2-macroglobulin between placebo and GSK1995057-treated subjects (data not shown). Of note, however, the dose of LPS used in the human clinical trial was much lower than that used in the animal study where amelioration of LPS-induced permeability by GSK1995057 was observed (50 µg in humans vs 400 µg in animals). The increase in serum C-reactive protein 24 hours after LPS challenge was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with GSK1995057 (P&lt;0.001; online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 10</xref>), which was consistent with effects on the systemic acute phase response. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that inhaled doses of GSK1995057 reached the lung and subsequently, to a lesser extent, the systemic compartment (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure 6</xref>).</p>

              <p>Here we demonstrate that GSK1995057 reduced pulmonary inflammation in non-human primate and human models of ARDS, and confirm a mechanistic link between TNFR1 signalling and neutrophil/endothelial interactions. The observation that GSK1995057 significantly blunted neutrophil migration through endothelial monolayers in vitro suggests an important role for TNFR1 in mediating neutrophil–endothelial interactions, possibly by regulating the cell surface expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM and VCAM. In patients with ARDS, neutrophil infiltration into the lungs is further augmented by a compromised alveolar-capillary barrier brought about by the action of proinflammatory mediators.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Consistent with previous reports,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 33</xref> we showed that TNF-α contributed to increased endothelial permeability and found that GSK1995057 prevented this increase, suggesting that TNFR1 signalling (rather than TNFR2 signalling) mediates TNF-induced endothelial permeability.</p>
              <p>In some patients with ARDS, it may be sufficient to deliver short-acting therapeutics directly to the lungs; however, factors influencing the pulmonary delivery and disposition of antibodies or antibody fragments are complex,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> with limited precedence in humans. We therefore sought to determine whether nebulised GSK1995057 could be delivered to lungs efficiently, and whether the effects observed in in vitro assays could be recapitulated in vivo. To test this, we used the well-established model of lung LPS challenge to trigger a clinically relevant and complex inflammatory response to model subclinical tissue injury.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref> In monkeys exposed to a single inhaled LPS challenge, pretreatment with nebulised GSK1995057 significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, levels of proinflammatory chemokines, markers of endothelial injury and alveolar-capillary leak in a dose-dependent fashion. These data are consistent with a single report of the effects of full IgG anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibodies in similar non-human primate models,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and suggest an important role for TNFR1 signalling in the control of neutrophilic inflammation in vivo. Moreover, the data suggest that like other inhaled antibody approaches, low doses of inhaled GSK1995057 may deliver the same or more potent effects in the lung as higher doses of parenterally administered antibodies.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Finally, we sought to translate our findings with GSK1995057 to human subjects through the conduct of a clinical trial in which healthy subjects were exposed to a low dose of inhaled LPS following a single nebulised dose of GSK1995057. Consistent with our investigations in monkeys, healthy subjects pretreated with GSK1995057 experienced less neutrophilic lung inflammation, and signs of endothelial injury in response to LPS challenge than subjects who received placebo. Subjects pretreated with GSK1995057 also showed signs of reduced systemic inflammation. Taken together, these studies highlight the therapeutic potential of GSK1995057, and the involvement of TNFR1 signalling in inflammation and tissue injury responses in primates and humans.</p>
              <p>The current study has limitations. While BAL protein increased 24 hours after LPS challenge in monkeys, and GSK1995057 pretreatment attenuated this response, a similar GSK1995057 treatment effect was not apparent in human BAL taken 6 hours after LPS challenge in the clinical trial. BAL protein levels were not significantly increased in humans at 6 hours after LPS challenge, suggesting limited alveolar-capillary leak in response to pulmonary LPS challenge at this early time point. We were unable to assess the contribution of TNFR2 signalling in these studies, primarily due to a paucity of specific biomarkers associated with the TNFR2 pathway. Although we were unable to include a non-selective/pan-TNF-α inhibitor antibody as a comparator in our clinical trial, the observed effects of GSK1995057 on neutrophilic infiltration appear similar to the effects of the long-acting anti-TNF-α antibody adalimumab in the same model.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Although neutrophil infiltration is a hallmark of ARDS pathophysiology, neutrophils are also likely to be important contributors to lung immunity, particularly in infectious causes of ARDS, and therefore the impact of therapies that modulate neutrophilia will need to be assessed carefully, in a stepwise manner. This small trial also only investigated a single, relatively high dose of GSK1995057 in male subjects. Further work to explore dose–response relationships in both men and women is required to support generalisability. However, data from the investigation in monkeys suggest GSK199507 may be efficacious at much lower nebulised doses, further supporting the utility of low doses of inhaled dAbs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. Finally, in our studies, GSK1995057 was administered prior to the LPS challenge, which may impact the translation of our findings to patients since most patients with ARDS would be treated after the initial injury. However, at this early stage of investigation, confirming primary pharmacology of this novel selective TNFR1 antagonist in a clinically relevant model was an important step in determining the potential of this therapy in ARDS. Moreover, since the evolution of ARDS is often predictable,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and ongoing injury, for example, at the onset of mechanical ventilation, is also likely to occur,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> our studies support the potential utility of GSK1995057 for prophylaxis or early treatment of ARDS.</p>
              <p>In summary, our data suggest that selective antagonism of TNFR1 using an inhaled dAb may offer therapeutic benefit in patients with ARDS, a common and devastating condition that currently has no effective disease-modifying therapy. While the clinical effectiveness of this approach in established disease is yet to be tested, a phase IIa clinical trial of a TNFR1-targeting dAb in patients is currently under way.</p>
