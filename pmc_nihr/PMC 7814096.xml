              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Up to 80% of stroke survivors have difficulties using their affected arm in daily activities,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> which often persist in the longer term, impacting on the ability to engage social roles and on autonomy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> There is a need for further high quality evidence to support interventions to improve arm function after stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Repetitive functional task training has shown promise for improving arm function,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and therefore further trials of this type of intervention are particularly important. The Robot-Assisted Training for the Upper Limb after Stroke (RATULS) randomized controlled trial, the largest of its kind to date (<italic>n</italic> = 770), was published recently.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Participants were randomized to receive robot-assisted training, an enhanced upper limb therapy programme (where repetitive functional task practice focused on personal goals), or usual care.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> There was little evidence of a difference in the primary outcome of arm activity limitation (i.e. success in attaining pre-specified improvement in the Action Research Arm Test<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> score at three months) between randomization groups. However, participants who were randomized to receive the enhanced upper limb therapy programme performed significantly better in a number of secondary outcomes when compared to those who received usual care. Clinically important benefits at the end of the three month intervention period were observed in measures of impairment (Fugl-Meyer Assessment Motor Score),<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> activities of daily living and mobility (Stroke Impact Scale).<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Additionally, there were statistically significant improvements which were not considered clinically important, as the confidence intervals did not include values that are currently deemed to be Minimum Clinically Important Differences. These statistically significant improvements were in measures of arm function (Action Research Arm Test), hand function (Stroke Impact Scale),<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and activities of daily living (Barthel Activity of Daily Living Index)<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> – with the latter continuing to 6 months follow-up. Participants randomized to receive the enhanced upper limb therapy programme also performed significantly better than those randomized to receive robot-assisted training in measures of activities of daily living at three months (Stroke Impact Scale<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and Barthel Index<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>) but these improvements also did not reach the threshold for being considered clinically important.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It is important that the development and fidelity of interventions are fully reported to enable the results of a trial to be interpreted, and for the intervention to be replicable in routine clinical practice or future research. However, stroke rehabilitation trials often fall short in terms of reporting these aspects.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The development and description of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme followed the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) framework,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and the planned delivery of the intervention (TIDieR items 1–11) has been reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The aim of this paper is to report the intervention fidelity (TIDieR item 12) and a descriptive analysis of the types of personal goals selected and the proportion achieved.</p>

                <p>The aim of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme was to enable participants to achieve their personal goals by engaging their stroke-affected arm in functional activities, using appropriate everyday objects, linked to their goals. The enhanced upper limb therapy programme was designed to be meaningful, engaging and challenging, yet achievable.</p>
                <p>This programme aimed to provide therapy sessions three times per week for 12 weeks (36 sessions total). Sessions were up to one hour, which included 45 minutes of face-to-face therapy for each participant (target 27 hours in total). An overview of the design of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215520953833">Figure 1</xref>. A senior therapist (physiotherapist or occupational therapist) undertook the initial therapy session and reviewed the participant every four weeks. Other therapy sessions were delivered by a physiotherapy assistant. At the start of their first session, participants were invited to identify personally relevant goals, which were not pre-specified other than that they should comprise a functional task involving the affected arm. Participants were advised, based on previous work, to select no more than four goals at each review session (up to 12 across the enhanced upper limb therapy programme).<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The goal selection process was not formalised but undertaken according to the senior therapist’s clinical judgement. In each session, participants practised functional activities to work towards their goals. Activities could be whole or part task practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Part task practice was undertaken when a participant had difficulty with a specific part of a task, as it enabled them to concentrate on this particular aspect while working towards completing the task as a whole. The order in which activities were practised, the time spent on each, and the rate of progression were at the discretion of the senior therapist or physiotherapy assistant and participant. Participants were encouraged to undertake as many repetitions as possible within each session. There was no set target for the number of repetitions.</p>

                <p>At therapy session 12 (end of week 4) and 24 (end of week 8), progress towards goals was reviewed. If a participant had achieved a goal, a new goal was selected. If a participant found a goal or activity too challenging or experienced other problems, an alternative goal and activity were chosen. At the final therapy session, practice continued and progress towards goals was reviewed with a senior therapist. Part of this session was also dedicated to providing feedback to the participant about progress over the course of the programme and advice about maintaining arm function in the longer term.</p>
                <p>Transport was arranged for participants to attend all therapy and review sessions by the local study co-ordinator if required.</p>
                <p>Training was provided to the senior therapists and physiotherapy assistants who delivered the enhanced upper limb therapy programme, with updates and ongoing training throughout the trial. In addition, three manuals provided guidance on intervention delivery (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269215520953833">supplementary material</ext-link>). The first described the purpose, principles and structure of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme as well as staff roles and responsibilities, the second provided guidance on how to structure each session (including assessment, ‘warm up’ and stretching, demonstration and education, progression, monitoring compensatory movements and feedback). The third manual provided examples of soft tissue stretches prior to task practice, and an overview of commonly selected goals. The most commonly selected goals from our previous arm rehabilitation studies were prepared as examples to facilitate goal selection<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr21-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (i.e. washing, dressing, eating and drinking activities), with accompanying step-by-step flowcharts to guide and progress practice of functional tasks, each with whole-task and part-task options.</p>

                <p>A bespoke proforma was completed by the trial senior therapists and physiotherapy assistants for each participant to document the content of their enhanced upper limb therapy programme (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0269215520953833">supplementary material</ext-link>). The following were recorded: session attendance; duration of session; duration of face-to-face therapy within a session; number of repetitions per task practised in each session; goals selected and type of task practice (whole or part task); and goals achieved.</p>
                <p>In terms of repetitions, for whole task practice, completion of the whole task counted as one repetition, that is, from the start position to a ‘return to the start position’ or to completion of the task (if different from the start position). For part task practice, completion of the component of the part task counted as one repetition.</p>
                <p>Details about the goals selected were recorded at the initial therapy session and at the four and eight week review sessions. Information about whether a participant had achieved their goals (recorded as ‘Yes’/ ‘No’ according to the senior therapist’s clinical judgement) was collected at the four, eight and 12 week review sessions. A formal goal attainment scale was not used.</p>
                <p>To monitor intervention provision, summary data about the enhanced upper limb therapy programme were reviewed and reports about fidelity were sent to study centres every six months. This was followed by a discussion with the coordinating centre team about their performance.</p>

All 374 goals in the productivity category related to household management, with 206/374 (55%) of goals being in the category of ‘cleaning’ and 125/374 (33%) goals in the category ‘cooking’. In the ‘leisure’ category the most popular subcategory was ‘correspondence’ (92/180 (51%)). The ‘other’ category predominantly comprised of impairment-based upper limb goals with ‘range of movement’ being the most commonly chosen goal in that category 413/661 (62%). Range of movement was the second most commonly chosen goal overall. A total of 163/661 (25%) goals within the ‘other’ category comprised of generic reach, grasp, pick-and place activities which were not specified sufficiently to be allocated to any particular Canadian Occupational Performance Measure subcategory. There was insufficient information to subcategorize 26/661 (4%) of ‘other’ goals.</p>

                <p>A median of 12 goals [IQR 9–12] were selected per participant during the 12 week enhanced upper limb therapy programme. Of the 2664 goals selected, goal achievement data were recorded for 2501 (94%). In total, 1287/2501 (51%) of goals were achieved, ranging between 47% and 100% for each Canadian Occupational Performance Measure subcategory (<xref rid="table3-0269215520953833" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A median of 5 goals [IQR 2–7] were achieved per participant. Of the three most commonly chosen goals, 234/587 (40%) related to eating and drinking, 196/390 (50%) related to range of movement and 141/242 (58%) related to dressing were achieved.</p>
                <p>To better understand who were most or least successful in achieving their personal goals with the enhanced upper limb therapy programme, the impact of baseline Action Research Arm Test score and time since stroke on goal selection and goal achievement was explored.</p>
                <p>Goal achievement varied according to baseline Action Research Arm Test score and time since stroke (<xref rid="table4-0269215520953833" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Those participants who had the lowest baseline Action Research Arm Test score (0–7) and who were recruited more than one year after stroke had the lowest goal achievement with only 167/616 (27%) goals being achieved. Of the goals related to self-care (which includes personal care and functional mobility), only 23% were achieved in this group. In contrast, participants in all three baseline Action Research Arm Test score categories who were less than three months after stroke achieved between 73% and 88% of their goals.</p>

              <p>We have described the fidelity, types of goals selected and proportion achieved, of a repetitive functional task practice intervention for stroke survivors with moderate to severe arm activity limitation, which was used in the NIHR HTA RATULS randomized controlled trial. The RATULS trial reported clinically important and statistically significant benefits in a number of secondary outcomes when compared with usual care (i.e. arm impairment, activities of daily living and mobility).<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first description of an intervention aimed at improving arm activity after stroke that comprises a detailed account of adherence (i.e. the number of sessions attended; session duration; duration of face-to-face therapy; goals selected and type of task practice (whole or part task); the number of repetitions of tasks and goals achieved), undertaken within a large multicentre randomized controlled trial of this type. Stroke rehabilitation trials often fall short in terms of reporting the details of the interventions provided, however the description of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme complies with the current recommendations.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>As treatment parameters were provided as described in the protocol and study manuals, fidelity to the enhanced upper limb therapy programme in the RATULS trial was high. This indicates that it is possible to standardize the delivery of a complex intervention of this nature, whilst allowing therapists to tailor the specific intervention parameters to the needs, goals and characteristics of individual participants – a prerequisite for person-centred rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The high level of fidelity also confirms that it was possible for this complex intervention to be delivered by physiotherapy assistants, who were trained in the intervention delivery and supervised by experienced therapists. In addition to adherence, moderating factors are also thought to influence fidelity, including intervention complexity, facilitation strategies (e.g. training, therapy manuals), quality of delivery (e.g. monitoring and feedback for therapists) and participant responsiveness (i.e. their engagement in the intervention).<sup><xref rid="bibr29-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Training and therapy manuals, as well as guidance and feedback were provided to therapists, but these factors were not formally analysed. However, the views of trial participants and healthcare professionals about the factors that affected the implementation of the trial were explored in a process evaluation that was conducted alongside the RATULS trial, and these findings have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In addition, participant responsiveness may have been influenced by fatigue, which is common post stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The RATULS process evaluation indicated that some participants found the intervention physically and cognitively tiring, but despite this, participants generally appeared motivated to further their recovery by engaging in this treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The three most commonly chosen goals selected by participants in this study were eating and drinking, improving range of movement and dressing, and this information may be helpful for clinicians working with stroke patients with moderate to severe arm activity limitation. Despite the specification that goals should comprise a functional task involving the affected the arm, improving range of movement was commonly chosen. This finding is likely to reflect the level of severe arm impairment in our study population and the difficulty of setting goals around functional activities for these participants. The overall proportion of goals achieved was low (51%), but further exploration showed that participants who were less than three months after stroke did achieve the majority of their goals. In contrast, many participants with severe activity limitation of the affected arm (Action Research Arm Test 0–7) who were more than three months post stroke, had difficulty achieving their goals, in particular those related to self care (including personal care and functional mobility). This may be explained by a number of potential factors in addition to paresis, including spasticity and contractures,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> as well as learned non-use,<sup><xref rid="bibr35-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> which may have become established in this subgroup. These factors, including other co-existing impairments (e.g. cognitive impairment) were assessed clinically as they informed the goal setting process, but were not formally measured as part of the trial, and therefore could not be included in the analysis and interpretation of the findings. Compared to a pilot study (3 sites; <italic>n</italic> = 55) that evaluated a similar enhanced upper limb therapy programme, the types of goals selected were similar but the overall proportion of goals achieved was much higher at 92%.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However in that study, participants were within two weeks post stroke with a higher level of arm function and therefore had a more favourable prognosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Most other repetitive task training studies do not report data on goal selection or achievement, so comparisons cannot be made. In the context of treatment for arm spasticity, a review of five studies found that 46% of goals related to symptoms or impairment and 54% related to activities, with between 27% and 72% of goals relating to active function and mobility being achieved.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Achieving goals depends on a number of inter-related factors, including: the method for selecting goals and recording their achievement, as well as the appropriateness of therapeutic input (in terms of content and dose) in relation to the participant’s abilities and needs. Goal setting is currently considered to be integral to best practice in stroke rehabilitation and is recommended in national clinical guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The evidence that this approach improves clinical outcomes is limited however, and there appears to be no consensus about the optimum approach.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> It was decided not to use a formal goal setting method (e.g. the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> or the Goal setting and Action Planning framework<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>) in the RATULS trial, as we endeavoured to reflect clinical practice in the UK.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> It was challenging to set meaningful, functional goals that are achievable with stroke patients with severe arm activity limitation. The prognosis for those with severe arm impairment who are three months or longer after stroke, when spontaneous recovery tends to slow down,<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> is generally unfavourable. These participants were included in the RATULS trial as there was evidence that they might benefit from the biomechanical advantage of robot-assisted training,<sup><xref rid="bibr42-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> which enabled participants to engage in repetitive practice, whilst having the weight of their affected arm supported by the device. Some patients with severe impairment and little chance of upper limb recovery may select aspirational rather than achievable goals, which may enhance motivation – but may also lead to unrealistic expectations, and difficulty adjusting to the residual consequences of stroke. A key component of goal setting is managing expectations, but the way in which goal setting was undertaken in this study was not documented, which was a limitation. Additionally, participants may have made some progress towards achieving their goals, but the dichotomous recording of goal achievement in this study meant that partial goal achievement would have been recorded as ‘No’, which was a further limitation. Further work is needed to identify how to optimise goal setting from the perspectives of patients and therapists, especially for those with severe arm impairment and an unfavourable prognosis, to ensure that goals are meaningful and achievable.</p>
              <p>A further factor related to goal achievement is the therapy dose, on which the literature is currently unclear.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Dose is a multi-factorial concept which includes the frequency, intensity, duration and timing of an intervention. Often, studies of dose in rehabilitation trials focus on therapy time only, however, in the RATULS trial we have been able to report the actual use of therapy time. The optimum amount of additional therapy time needed to improve arm activity limitation after stroke is the subject of debate. A 2014 meta-analysis found strong evidence that an additional 17 hours of physiotherapy significantly improved a range of outcomes, including arm function, basic ADL and quality of life after stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A 2014 Cochrane overview and a 2016 Cochrane systematic review reported that repetitive task training improved upper limb function, but there were no significant differences in outcomes between a dose of at least 20 hours compared with smaller doses.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> A number of more recent randomized controlled trials of upper limb therapy post-stroke have also been neutral for their primary outcome.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><xref rid="bibr44-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr45-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr46-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr47-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr48-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> These trials planned to deliver between 10 and 45 hours of additional upper limb therapy, with four trials aiming to deliver an additional 30 hours or more.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> It has been suggested that the amount of therapy time provided to both intervention groups (robot-assisted training and enhanced upper limb therapy) in the RATULS trial was too low,<sup><xref rid="bibr49-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bibr50-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> even though benefit was seen for a number of secondary outcomes at the end of the three month intervention period when the enhanced upper limb therapy programme was compared with usual care. Three studies have reported benefits of high amounts of therapy time (i.e. 300 hours<sup><xref rid="bibr51-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and 90 hours<sup><xref rid="bibr53-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>) in upper limb therapy for chronic stroke patients – with less severe initial arm activity limitation – however, none of these studies had a lower dose or usual care comparator. Whilst these results are interesting, these interventions require further evaluation in robust, adequately powered randomized controlled trials to demonstrate their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Results from studies which aimed to determine the optimum dose in terms of repetitions have been inconsistent and inconclusive so far. A Phase II single-blind, randomized, repetition dose response study evaluated a task-specific upper limb rehabilitation intervention comprising up to 32 hours of practice for stroke survivors at least six months after stroke with mild to moderate arm impairment.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Eighty-five participants were randomized to undertake either 3200, 6400, 9600, or individualized maximum repetitions. All groups improved but there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship between the number of repetitions and outcome. Our findings also suggest that the relationship between the number of repetitions undertaken and the proportion of goals achieved is unclear, as the number of repetitions completed by those with the lowest proportion of goals achieved (i.e. those who were more than 12 months post stroke with Action Research Arm Test scores 0–7) is not dissimilar to that completed by those with the highest proportion of goals achieved (i.e. anyone less than 3 months post stroke irrespective of their Action Research Arm Test scores). Further research is needed to analyse this relationship. The lack of relationship between number of repetitions and outcome raises the question about what is being repeated in a repetition, and whether this actually facilitates skill acquisition. In addition to duration and number of repetitions, the content and scheduling of therapy also need to be considered. A 2010 systematic review of task-orientated training to improve arm and hand performance after stroke identified that the following skill acquisition components were associated with better outcomes: clear functional goals, variety, distributed practice (where the amount of rest exceeds the amount of practice), random practice (where activities are practised in random order), context-specific practice (where the practice environment simulates real-life) and feedback.<sup><xref rid="bibr55-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> Our enhanced upper limb therapy programme included clear functional goals with task variety and random practice, however the distribution between practice and rest, and the type and timing of feedback were not protocolised nor recorded. Whilst context-specific practice was attempted, the hospital environment inevitably imposed some limitations. These aspects could be considered for future studies.</p>
              <p>This study has a number of strengths and limitations, in addition to those already discussed. Generalization of the findings from this study to the general stroke population with moderate to severe arm activity limitation is limited by the finding that RATULS trial participants were younger than the average stroke population in the UK (60 years vs 75 years) and comprised more males (61% vs 50%).<sup><xref rid="bibr56-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> The fact that individuals with moderate to severe arm activity limitation were recruited up to five years after stroke meant that a considerable proportion of participants had a poor prognosis for recovery.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, outcomes may have been influenced by self-practice, undertaken by participants outside of formal trial intervention sessions. Although self-report forms indicated a similar high level of self-practice for all randomization groups across the study period,<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215520953833" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> information about content and dose of self-practice was not collected. Therefore it is not possible to comment on the impact of this potential confounding factor. The strengths of this study are that training, documented in study manuals, was provided in delivery and recording of the enhanced upper limb therapy programme, which could be replicated in clinical practice or further developed in future studies.</p>
