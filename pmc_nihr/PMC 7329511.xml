              <p id="Par39">E-Freeze is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine if a policy of freezing embryos, followed by thawed frozen embryo transfer, results in a higher healthy baby rate when compared with the current policy of transferring fresh embryos. Couples undergoing their first, second or third cycle of in vitro fertilisation at fertility centres in the UK were randomised to either fresh or frozen embryo transfer. This paper describes the statistical analysis plan for the main trial, including the analysis principles, definitions of outcomes, methods for primary analysis, pre-specified subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par40">This statistical analysis plan conforms to the published guidelines on the content for statistical analysis plans in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and was finalised prior to completion of recruitment to the trial. Any deviations from this plan will be described and justified in the final report of the trial.</p>

              <title>Background Information</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par41">In vitro fertilisation (IVF) involves several steps. Initially, hormones are used to stimulate a womanâs ovaries to produce eggs, which are harvested surgically. Next, embryos are created in the laboratory by mixing eggs with sperm produced by her partner. In conventional IVF, these are grown in culture for a few days before being replaced within the uterus by a process known as fresh embryo transfer. Spare embryos are usually frozen with a view to transfer at a later point in time - especially if the initial fresh transfer does not result in a pregnancy. Despite improvements in technology, IVF success rates remain low with an overall live birth rate of 25% per treatment. Additionally, there are concerns about health outcomes for mothers and babies conceived through IVF, particularly after fresh embryo transfer, including maternal ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and perinatal morbidity.</p>
                <p id="Par42">It is believed that high levels of ovarian hormones during ovarian stimulation could create a relatively hostile environment for embryo implantation whilst increasing the risk of OHSS. It has been suggested that electively freezing embryos with the intention of thawing and replacing them within the uterus at a later stage (thawed frozen embryo transfer) instead of fresh embryo transfer, may lead to improved pregnancy rates and fewer complications. However, at the time of developing this study, the evidence in support of an elective frozen embryo transfer policy was inadequate to justify such a radical change in practice. In addition, there are risks identified both for mother and babies in pregnancies as a result of frozen embryo transfer.</p>
                <p id="Par43">The E-Freeze trial aims to determine if a policy of freezing embryos, followed by thawed frozen embryo transfer, results in a higher healthy baby rate when compared with the current policy of transferring fresh embryos. The target sample size of the trial was 1086 couples undergoing their first, second or third cycle of IVF treatment at fertility centres in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>

                <title>Objectives of the trial</title>
                <p id="Par44">The primary objective of the trial is to determine if a policy of freezing embryos, followed by thawed frozen embryo transfer, results in a higher healthy baby rate when compared with the current policy of transferring fresh embryos. However, so as not to preclude the possibility that the latter results in a higher healthy baby rate than the former, our primary objective is evaluated by presenting two-sided confidence intervals.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The secondary objectives of the trial are to compare the number of complications associated with IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment and pregnancy, and the cost-effectiveness from a health service and broader societal perspective.</p>

                <title>Sample size and power</title>
                <p id="Par101">The proposed primary outcome for this trial is novel and is not currently reported by IVF clinics or national regulatory bodies. This means that a number of assumptions have been made in order to determine the expected event rate in the control arm (receiving current standard treatment), which may in turn result in a degree of imprecision in the estimate.</p>
                <p id="Par102">The most recent data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which collects data on all IVF cycles from all clinics in the UK, show that 25% of all women undergoing one episode of IVF treatment involving a fresh embryo transfer have a live birth, and 20% have singleton live births. These figures are for women of all age groups, not necessarily for women fulfilling the inclusion criteria for this trial in terms of the number of good-quality embryos in their IVF cycle. No data are available on the healthy baby rate (live singletons born between 37 and 42âweeks, with appropriate weight for gestation), the primary outcome for this study. For our trial population we anticipate that the control arm event rate is likely to be &lt;â25%, possibly as low as 17%.</p>
                <p id="Par103">To provide relevant information on the event rate expected in the control arm, we surveyed ten IVF centres that expressed an interest in the study, collecting data on the number of live births in women under the age of 42 years undergoing their first IVF treatment in 2012. The average live birth episode rate from this survey was 31% with a 95% confidence interval of 25% to 37%. Accurate data on the healthy baby rate in those with at least three good-quality embryos were not available. Although the live birth rate is expected to be higher in women with at least three good-quality embryos (likely to have a better prognosis), we anticipate that the healthy baby rate in our trial population will be towards the lower end of the confidence interval, around 25%, taking into account the higher risk of preterm delivery and babies who are small for gestational age, following IVF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par104">The following assumptions have been made for the sample size calculation: we have assumed a healthy baby rate of between 17% and 25% in women eligible for the trial (age under 42âyears with three good-quality embryos) undergoing standard care (fresh embryo transfer). Taking into account the extra time, effort and potential expense involved in freezing embryos and the delay in embryo transfer of up to 3 months, a panel of clinicians across the UK agreed that the strategy of freezing embryos would be considered effective if the percentage of women having a healthy baby is increased by at least 8% in absolute terms. With 90% power and using a two-sided 5% level of statistical significance, we will need to randomise a total of 1086 couples (543 in each group) in order to be able to detect an absolute difference of 8% from 17% to 25% and 9% from 25% to 34% in the healthy baby rate, between fresh embryo transfer and transfer of thawed frozen embryos. The difference detectable differs slightly depending on the event rate in the standard care group, which will be reviewed periodically by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).</p>
                <p id="Par105">It is a regulatory requirement for clinics in the UK to report live birth outcomes (including number, weight and gestation) after all embryo transfers i.e. there will be no loss to follow up. Therefore, we have not taken into account loss to follow up for these sample size calculations. Couples who withdraw consent to use data already collected will be defined as post-randomisation exclusions, and their outcome data will not be included - however, based on extensive experience, withdrawal rates are also expected to be very low, and so these have not been taken into account in the sample size calculations.</p>
                <p id="Par106">It is anticipated that a proportion of those consented may not reach randomisation (not having three good-quality day-3 embryos or requiring all embryos to be frozen for medical reasons), therefore a larger number will need to be consented. As there are no valid data to support the exact proportion, this will be monitored by the DMC.</p>

                <p id="Par107">Randomisation will be performed after the creation of embryos, 3 days post egg collection. This will minimise the time interval from randomisation to intervention, as embryos are either transferred at the cleavage or blastocyst stage. Once all eligibility criteria are established (including ensuring that three or more good-quality embryos are available), women will be randomised (allocation ratio 1:1) to a strategy of either:

Participants will be randomised using a minimisation algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with a random element to balance across the following factors: fertility clinic; womanâs age at start of treatment (&lt;â35âyears, 35 to &lt;â40âyears, â¥â40âyears); primary/secondary infertility; self-reported duration of infertility (&lt;â12âmonths, 12 to &lt;â24âmonths, 24 to &lt;â36âmonths, 36 to &lt;â48âmonths, 48 to &lt;â60âmonths, â¥â60âmonths); method of insemination (IVF, ICSI or a combination of both) and number of previous egg collections (0, 1 or 2âcycles).

A difference of at least three standard errors in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting or modifying the study prematurely. Unless modification or cessation of the trial is recommended by the DMC, the TSC, investigators, collaborators and administrative staff (except those who supply the confidential information) will remain ignorant of the results of the interim analysis.

              <p id="Par215">Since we are following up women from prior to pregnancy until after pregnancy, this raises the question of the most appropriate denominator for outcomes that can only occur in particular pregnancy states. There will be some outcomes that cannot be reported for some women (e.g. miscarriage for women who do not become pregnant, birthweight of babies for women who had a miscarriage). In order to perform the analyses for all outcomes on the ITT analysis population, to maintain the randomised groups and avoid bias, these will not be considered as missing data and for these outcomes all women will be included in the denominator. This means that regardless of whether a pregnancy or live birth occurs, the woman will be included in the denominator once for all outcomes. Where this is a perinatal outcome, but there is no baby in whom the outcome can occur, the woman will still be included once in the denominator.</p>
              <p id="Par216">Outcomes will be summarised with counts and percentages for categorical variables, means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, or median and interquartile range for other non-normally distributed continuous variables.</p>

Analyses will be adjusted for all minimisation factors where possible (i.e. fertility clinic, womanâs age at the time of start of treatment (i.e. ovarian stimulation), primary/secondary infertility, self-reported duration of infertility, method of insemination and number of previous egg collections). Fertility clinic will be fitted with a randomly varying intercept in the model, and all other factors as fixed effects. Both crude and adjusted risk ratios will be presented, but the primary inference will be based on the adjusted estimates.</p>
              <p id="Par218">For neonatal secondary outcomes, the unit of analysis in the ITT analysis will be the mother. In cases of multiple pregnancy where the infantsâ outcomes differ, the worst outcome will be reported.</p>

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to investigate if there is a post-embryo transfer difference in the means of the two treatment groups, adjusting for baseline. To avoid bias, maximise the power of the study and adhere to the ITT principle, the missing-indicator method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] will be used to replace missing baseline scores. This method replaces all missing baseline observations with the same value and an extra indicator variable is added to the model to indicate whether the value for that variable is missing.

CACE analysis assumes that the proportion of would-be non-compliers in the fresh embryo transfer arm (i.e. couples in the fresh embryo transfer group who would not have complied had they been randomised to frozen embryo transfer) is the same as the proportion of non-compliers in the frozen embryo transfer group. It also assumes that the event rate among the non-compliers in the frozen embryo transfer arm is the same as the event rate among the would-be non-compliers in the fresh embryo transfer group. Applying these two assumptions, the unadjusted event rate for the primary outcome will be calculated for the would-be compliers and would-be non-compliers in the fresh embryo transfer arm. The unadjusted CACE risk ratio plus 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcome will be calculated using the event rates for compliant groups only (i.e. the observed compliers in the frozen embryo transfer arm and the would-be compliers in the fresh embryo transfer arm).
