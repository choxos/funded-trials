                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Multiple myeloma has been shown to have substantial clonal heterogeneity, suggesting that agents with different mechanisms of action might be required to induce deep responses and improve outcomes. Such agents could be given in combination or in sequence on the basis of previous response. We aimed to assess the clinical value of maximising responses by using therapeutic agents with different modes of action, the use of which is directed by the response to the initial combination therapy. We aimed to assess response-adapted intensification treatment with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) versus no intensification treatment in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who had a suboptimal response to initial immunomodulatory triplet treatment which was standard of care in the UK at the time of trial design.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The Myeloma XI trial was an open-label, randomised, phase 3, adaptive design trial done at 110 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. There were three potential randomisations in the study: induction treatment, intensification treatment, and maintenance treatment. Here, we report the results of the randomisation to intensification treatment. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had symptomatic or non-secretory, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, had completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. For the intensification treatment, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days or no treatment. Patients were stratified by allocated induction treatment, response to induction treatment, and centre. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival, assessed from intensification randomisation to data cutoff, analysed by intention to treat. Safety analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49407852, and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, number 2009–010956–93, and has completed recruitment.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 15, 2010, and July 28, 2016, 583 patients were enrolled to the intensification randomisation, representing 48% of the 1217 patients who achieved partial or minimal response after initial induction therapy. 289 patients were assigned to CVD treatment and 294 patients to no treatment. After a median follow-up of 29·7 months (IQR 17·0–43·5), median progression-free survival was 30 months (95% CI 25–36) with CVD and 20 months (15–28) with no CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 0·60, 95% CI 0·48–0·75, p&lt;0·0001), and 3-year overall survival was 77·3% (95% Cl 71·0–83·5) in the CVD group and 78·5% (72·3–84·6) in the no CVD group (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·67–1·43, p=0·93). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events for patients taking CVD were haematological, including neutropenia (18 [7%] patients), thrombocytopenia (19 [7%] patients), and anaemia (8 [3%] patients). No deaths in the CVD group were deemed treatment related.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Intensification treatment with CVD significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and a suboptimal response to immunomodulatory induction therapy compared with no intensification treatment, but did not improve overall survival. The manageable safety profile of this combination and the encouraging results support further investigation of response-adapted approaches in this setting. The substantial number of patients not entering this trial randomisation following induction therapy, however, might support the use of combination therapies upfront to maximise response and improve outcomes as is now the standard of care in the UK.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">The aetiology and progression of multiple myeloma are driven by the accumulation of acquired genetic events that affect clonal competition within the bone marrow microenvironment.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Tumour cell diversity increases as genetic lesions accumulate, and the disease progresses from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to myeloma, leading to substantial subclonal heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis. Applying induction treatment designed to eliminate susceptible clones might provide selective pressure for the expansion of resistant clones, resulting in early or late relapse. Combination chemotherapies designed to maximise tumour cell death and eliminate resistant clones can improve clinical outcomes compared with single-agent chemotherapies. Depth of response has been identified as an independent prognostic factor, making the eradication of minimal residual disease an important therapeutic endpoint.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Strategies to deepen response after induction therapy include the use of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (in those eligible) and the use of post-transplant consolidation therapy. Although the optimal timing for achieving maximum response is unclear, in our previous study, Myeloma IX,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> patients with complete response before transplantation had better progression-free survival and overall survival than patients without complete response, supporting an argument for early achievement of deep responses and the use of pre-transplant intensification rather that post-transplant consolidation.</p>
              <p id="para30">This association raises the question as to whether monitoring response during induction therapy and switching to an alternative chemotherapy regimen in poor responders could increase the rate and depth of response and improve clinical outcomes. This study is the first to prospectively evaluate such a response-adapted approach to induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The purpose of the trial was to determine whether treatment intensification with a bortezomib-based regimen improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with suboptimal response after immunomodulatory-drug–based induction therapy, which was standard of care in the UK at time of trial design.</p>

                  <p id="para60">Potential strategies to deepen response after induction therapy for patients with myeloma include the use of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (in those eligible) and the use of post-transplant consolidation. Although the optimal timing for achieving maximum response is unclear, we found in our previous study, Myeloma IX, that patients with a complete response before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation had better progression-free and overall survival than patients with a less than complete response. This supports an argument for early achievement of deep responses and the use of pre-transplant intensification rather than post-transplant consolidation. Little data is available concerning strategies for deepening response in transplantation-ineligible patients. We searched PubMed (July 15, 2019) for trials examining a response-adapted intensification strategy, using the search terms “myeloma” and “intensification”, without language restrictions, for clinical trials published before 2019 and excluding those relating to the introduction of autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation or those lacking response adaptation. We identified one previous phase 2 study reporting the use of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone intensification administered to eight patients who failed to achieve more than a partial response to two cycles of cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone induction therapy. Five (63%) of eight deepened their response. To our knowledge the strategy of early response-adapted therapy has not been previously studied in a randomised trial and we sought to investigate this in Myeloma XI.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">We found a significant improvement in response and progression-free survival associated with the use of proteasome inhibitor-based intensification therapy for patients who achieved only a minimal or partial response to immunomodulatory triplet induction for newly diagnosed myeloma patients, although no difference in overall survival occurred.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">Our results support the concept that resistance to initial therapy is based on the specific therapy used and can be overcome by switching to a chemotherapy regimen with an alternate mechanism of action. In the event of a suboptimal response to immunomodulatory agent-based induction therapy, switching to a proteasome inhibitor-based combination improved response and progression-free survival. Taken together our data suggest that if agents of several different classes are available and can be tolerated in combination they should be used together upfront as is now the standard of care in the UK. If not, agent class should be switched rapidly in the absence of a deep response with the aim of response intensification to prolong progression-free survival.</p>

                <p id="para120">Eligible patients for the overall study were at least 18 years of age and had newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, based on paraprotein in serum or urine, bone marrow clonal plasma cells or plasmacytoma, and myeloma-related symptoms or organ or tissue impairment. Eligible patients for the intensification randomisation reported here additionally had to have completed their assigned induction therapy as per protocol (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) and achieved a partial or minimal response. Patients were excluded at trial entry if they had other previous or concurrent malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes, previous treatment for myeloma (excluding local radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, and corticosteroids), grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, acute renal failure (unresponsive to up to 72 h of rehydration, characterised by creatinine &gt;500 μmol/L or urine output &lt;400 mL per day, or requiring dialysis), or active or previous hepatitis C infection. The study was approved by the national ethics review board (National Research Ethics Service, London, UK), institutional review boards of the participating centres, and the competent regulatory authority (Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, UK), and was done according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice as espoused in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations. The study was not originally designed as an adaptive trial however good recruitment and the emergence of data on novel combinations led to trial adaptation.

Following a protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, and after the recruitment of 1512 patients, patients considered eligible for transplantation were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to CTD, CRD, or carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KCRD). A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the six variables measured at trial entry. These changes were made to add a new induction treatment research question to this adaptive design study and were approved by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee and Trial Steering Committee. Patients considered ineligible for transplantation at trial entry were randomly assigned (1:1) to induction with either attenuated CTD or attenuated CRD. A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the six variables measured at trial entry.</p>
                <p id="para140">Patients with a suboptimal response to induction treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CVD) or no CVD.

A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories. Following a protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, and after recruitment of 615 further patients under protocol version 5.0, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to lenalidomide or observation. A similar minimisation algorithm with a random element was used to avoid chance imbalances in the same three variables with the same categories but with the addition of KCRD to the induction treatment options.

Briefly, in transplantation-eligible patients, induction therapy with CTD, CRD, or KCRD continued for at least four cycles in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum response or intolerance was observed. In transplantation-ineligible patients, attenuated CTD or attenuated CRD continued for at least six cycles in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum response or intolerance was observed. Attenuated versions of induction included lower doses of dexamethasone and a lower starting dose of thalidomide. For all patients, bisphosphonates were recommended until progressive disease and thromboprophylaxis was recommended for at least the first 3 months of treatment as per International Myeloma Working Group recommendations. Growth factor support and prophylaxis for pneumonia, varicella, fungal infection, and tumour lysis syndrome were allowed as per local practice.</p>
                <p id="para180">Transplantation-eligible patients receiving KCRD proceeded to high-dose melphalan and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients receiving immunomodulatory-based triplets (CTD <italic>vs</italic> CRD) followed a response-adapted approach with induction treatment intensification: those with complete response or very good partial response (assessed according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria) proceeded to transplantation in the transplantation-eligible pathway, whereas transplantation-ineligible patients proceeded directly to maintenance randomisation.</p>
                <p id="para190">Transplantation-eligible and transplantation-ineligible patients allocated to induction treatment intensification received cyclophosphamide (500 mg daily orally on days 1, 8, and 15), bortezomib (1·3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> subcutaneously or intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11), and dexamethasone (20 mg daily orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12) up to a maximum of eight cycles of 21 days in the absence of progressive disease, until maximum response or intolerance was observed. Full details of the dose reduction schedules are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 4)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para200">For maintenance therapy, 100 days after autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation or once a maximum response was achieved for transplantation-ineligible patients, patients initially received lenalidomide or were observed without lenalidomide therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sep 14, 2011, and after recruitment of 442 patients, patients were allocated (1:1:1) to receive lenalidomide, lenalidomide plus vorinostat, or observation. After recruitment of 615 more patients, a further protocol amendment on June 28, 2013, allocated patients to receive lenalidomide or observation in a 2:1 ratio, and the lenalidomide plus vorinostat group was discontinued.

Comparisons of these events were made for induction and maintenance comparisons only. Paraprotein, serum-free light chain, and urinary light chain excretion were assessed at least every 2 months for the first 2 years and then at least every 3 months until disease progression.</p>

The hypothesis of the induction intensification randomisation was that CVD treatment could improve progression-free survival and overall survival compared with no CVD in adult patients with newly multiple myeloma. The overall study includes PFS and overall survival as co-primary endpoints for each randomisation. However, for the intensification element of the study only PFS was powered.</p>
                <p id="para280">For PFS in the transplantation-eligible pathway, the trial was designed to show a 9-month increase in median progression-free survival in the CVD group (median 35 months) compared with the no CVD group (median 26 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0·74) when a total of 361 progression-free survival events had been observed. This calculation assumed the time-to-event was exponentially distributed and that recruitment would last 4 years with a further 4 years of follow-up, a two-sided 5% significance level, and 80% power. A recruitment target of 476 patients randomly assigned (1:1) to CVD or no CVD in the transplantation-eligible pathway was specified, allowing for 5% dropout. For progression-free survival in the transplantation-ineligible pathway, the trial was designed to demonstrate a 6-month increase in median progression-free survival in the CVD group (median 14 months) compared with the no CVD group (median 20 months, HR 0·70) when 337 PFS events had been observed. This calculation was based on similar assumptions but with a two-sided 5% significance level and 90% power. A recruitment target of 380 patients randomly assigned (1:1) to CVD or no CVD in the transplantation-eligible pathway was specified, allowing for 5% dropout. No power calculations were specified for the overall survival endpoint and analysis was triggered by induction analysis. The trial was designed assuming 47% of patients would be eligible following suboptimal response in each treatment pathway.

We made comparisons between the allocated groups using the Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the minimisation stratification factors, excluding centre, and stratified by treatment pathway, to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. Subgroup analysis was prespecified for the presence or absence of individual adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, cytogenetic risk status, and induction treatment. We did a likelihood ratio test for heterogeneity of treatment effect using Cox models identical to those used for the main analysis, with the inclusion of terms for the subgroup in question and the appropriate interaction terms. The reported test for heterogeneity for subgroup analysis corresponds to a one degree of freedom test for two category subgroups and a two degrees of freedom test for three category subgroups, etc. The number and proportion of participants in each response category was summarised descriptively and exact 95% CIs calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. We summarised toxicity, in terms of adverse events, descriptively.</p>

The parameter t* (ie, the area under the survival curve up to a time horizon) in the restricted mean survival time estimation, the expected progression-free period in this study, was chosen to be 64 months, because this was the maximum follow-up for all patients in the study.

Reasons for exclusion before intensification randomisation included withdrawn consent (n=302), ineligibility (n=37), proceeded directly to autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=62), proceeded directly to maintenance therapy (n=25), progressive disease (n=78), and death (n=130). Slightly higher attrition occurred in the transplantation-ineligible pathway than transplantation-eligible but no difference in attrition between patients treated with lenalidomide or thalidomide-based induction was observed. The number of patients achieving partial or minimal response to each induction triplet entering the CVD randomisation were 200 (60%) of 333 in the CTD group, 167 (61%) of 276 in the CRD group, 118 (34%) of 345 in the attenuated CTD group, and 98 (37%) of 263 in the attenuated CRD group.</p>

              <p id="para420">Subgroup analyses of progression-free survival and overall survival according to baseline characteristics were consistent with the results in the overall population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). In all subgroups, progression-free survival consistently favoured CVD versus no CVD irrespective of sex, age, induction therapy, and response at CVD randomisation. At initial randomisation, genetic risk had been evaluated in 260 (45%) of 583 patients (129 CVD; 131 no CVD). 150 (58%) of the 260 evaluable patients had standard risk, 80 (31%) had high risk, and 30 (12%) had ultra-high risk. The benefit of CVD versus no CVD in terms of progression-free survival was also seen across cytogenetic risk groups, including those with standard risk (HR 0·45, 95% CI 0·28–0·73), high risk (HR 0·40, 95% CI 0·21–0·76), and ultra-high risk (HR 0·18, 95% CI 0·06–0·49; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 13</xref>) with no significant heterogeneity between subgroups (p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·71) and numerically smaller HRs in the high risk and ultra-high risk cohorts, although the numbers of patients were small, particularly in the ultra-high risk cohort.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Subgroup analysis of progression-free and overall survival</p><p>(A) Progression-free survival.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para430">This study showed that additional therapy with CVD improved the depth of response for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with a suboptimal response to an immunomodulatory drug triplet combination, leading to marked improvements in progression-free survival compared with patients not receiving CVD intensification but without any difference in overall survival. The depth of response was very good partial response or better in 42·6% (95% CI 36·8–48·4) of patients treated with CVD. Median progression-free survival improved by 20 months in transplantation-eligible patients (HR 0·50, 95% CI 0·36–0·68) and 12 months in transplantation-ineligible patients (HR 0·73, 95% CI 0·52–1·02). Overall survival did not differ; however, median overall survival was not reached in either group at the time of analysis and after additional follow-up this endpoint will be reanalysed.</p>
              <p id="para440">The absence of overall survival difference might have been confounded by the use of therapy after relapse, for example, which was not pre-specified. Outcomes in the no CVD group might also have been affected by subsequent treatment within the trial. Although progression free survival improved with lenalidomide versus observation in all patients in the maintenance randomisation, patients receiving no CVD appeared to have an even greater benefit than those who had CVD or were not randomly assigned (no CVD HR 0·26 [95% CI 0·17–0·40] <italic>vs</italic> CVD HR 0·48 [0·30–0·76] <italic>vs</italic> not randomly assigned HR 0·49 [0·43–0·57] p<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0·011).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para450">The benefit of CVD therapy in terms of progression-free survival was consistent across subgroups and persisted after autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in transplantation-eligible patients. The response rates after transplantation for the CVD and no CVD patients show that autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation alone can improve suboptimal initial response, but this can be significantly further improved by the use of pre-transplant intensification. The beneficial effect of CVD intensification on PFS appeared to be independent of cytogenetic risk status assessed centrally (with central results not fed back to local centres). These results are consistent with previous studies that suggest an additional benefit for proteasome inhibition particularly in the t(4;14) or del(17p) subsets of disease.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p id="para460">Statistically, evidence suggested that the hazard for not receiving CVD was not constant over time and, therefore, that the proportional hazards assumption was violated. This effect appeared more marked in the transplantation-ineligible pathway. Therefore, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, the restricted mean survival time method was used to confirm the results from the Cox regression analysis. This analysis confirmed the progression-free survival benefit associated with early exposure to CVD in transplantation-ineligible patients, possibly reflecting the effects of subsequent and later-line therapies in this patient subgroup.</p>
              <p id="para470">From a biological perspective, our results are consistent with the concept that resistance to initial therapy is based on the specific therapy used. This resistance can be overcome by switching to a chemotherapy regimen with an alternate mechanism of action. We found that the adverse prognostic effect of poor initial response can be overcome and is not an inherent feature of the cancer itself but rather of the therapy administered. Analysis of patients within the trial achieving stable disease or progressive disease to immunomodulatory triplet induction who all received CVD intensification will explore this concept further and will be published separately. Additionally, in long-term follow-up, we plan to investigate the differences between achieving complete response or very good partial response to initial induction in contrast to only achieving it after CVD intensification. Minimal residual disease analysis was also done and this data will be presented separately.</p>
              <p id="para480">In contrast to our use of induction intensification, two studies have examined the use of post-transplant consolidation. In the Stamina BMT CTN 0702 study,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> patients were treated with initial therapy at investigators discretion followed by randomisation before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation to one of three strategies: transplantation followed by lenalidomide maintenance, two autologous stem cell transplants followed by lenalidomide maintenance, or transplantation followed by post-transplant consolidation with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) and then by lenalidomide maintenance. No difference in progression-free survival or overall survival was identified between randomisation groups. In the EMN02 study,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> patients were enrolled before commencing treatment and treated with four cycles of CVD induction before being randomly assigned to autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (one or two transplants depending on centre) or four cycles of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisolone. There was a subsequent randomisation between two cycles of VRD or no consolidation. All patients received lenalidomide maintenance. In this study, post-transplant VRD consolidation before lenalidomide maintenance improved progression-free survival compared with maintenance alone (HR 0·78; p=0·045). The preliminary overall survival results indicated comparable 3-year overall survival with (86%) and without consolidation (87%). One of the key differences between studies was the initial induction therapy administered. In Stamina BMT CTN 0702, maximum response to induction therapy was more likely to have been achieved before autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation due to a lack of fixed duration of induction therapy. Similar to our study, patients had a median of 5 months (range 2–14 months) between initial therapy and registration and around 15% of patients had received more than one previous regimen, suggesting therapy changes in patients with a suboptimal initial response. In contrast, patients in EMN02 received a fixed four cycles of CVD given in 21-day cycles, equating to 3 months of therapy. Taken together, these two studies support the conclusions of our study and suggest that maximising treatment response, either before or after transplant, is an important endpoint of therapy.</p>
              <p id="para490">One limitation of the Myeloma XI study might be the induction regimens used, CRD or CTD combinations followed by a proteasome-inhibitor-based intensification regimen. The trial was designed in this manner owing to the UK standard of care at the time with no access to bortezomib either alone or in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. However, the outcomes for patients in the Myeloma XI trial do not substantially differ from other novel combinations. In the IFM 2009 study,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> 700 transplantation-eligible patients were randomly assigned to either three cycles of VRD followed by autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and two cycles of VRD or VRD for eight cycles without autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. The study<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> supported the use of upfront autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, with the median progression-free survival being longer for patients who received RVD and transplantation compared with those who received RVD alone (50 <italic>vs</italic> 36 months, HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·53–0·80, p&lt;0·001), although overall survival was similar in both treatment groups. The results obtained in Myeloma XI are not dissimilar. For example, the median progression-free survival from CVD randomisation (ie, not including the duration of previous induction cycles) was 48 months for those receiving CVD consolidation in Myeloma XI compared to 50 months from the start of induction for those who received VRD plus autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in IFM 2009 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). VRD is not widely reimbursed outside of the USA, where the combinations used in this study remain pertinent. Furthermore, even in the setting of VRD, a proportion of patients do not respond well and so the findings of Myeloma XI would support personalising therapy by adding additional agents of a different class to induction in the absence of a deep initial response. About half of the patients in the Myeloma XI trial with partial or minimal response after induction therapy discontinued the study before intensification randomisation for various reasons and are, therefore, not included in the analysis presented here. These reasons included progressive disease and death, but also off-study treatment. Although further details for each individual patient withdrawing consent were not collected, we believe these withdrawals might have been driven by investigator and patient discomfort with delivering intensification to patients with responses very close to very good partial response but not quite meeting it or, conversely, not delivering intensification to patients with a response of only minimal response to initial induction. The substantial number of patients not reaching trial randomisation supports the use of combination therapies upfront to maximise response and improve outcomes, and these are now standard of care in the UK with the combination bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone.</p>
              <p id="para500">Taken together our data suggest that, in the case of suboptimal response to initial treatment, agent class should be switched rapidly with the aim of response intensification. Although patients who do not respond to the induction therapy might still benefit from autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> these data support the maximisation of response before transplantation, given that the depth of response is associated with improved outcomes.</p>
