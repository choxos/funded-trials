                  <p>Although the painful and disabling features of early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) have an inflammatory basis and could respond to corticosteroids, corticosteroids are a risk factor for scleroderma renal crisis. Whether or not they should be prescribed is therefore highly contentious. Our aim was to examine safety and efficacy of moderate-dose prednisolone in early dcSSc.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>PRedSS set out as a Phase II, multicentre, double-blind randomized controlled trial, converted to open-label during the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients were randomized to receive either prednisolone (∼0.3 mg/kg) or matching placebo (or no treatment during open-label) for 6 months. Co-primary endpoints were the HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) at 3 months. Over 20 secondary endpoints included patient reported outcome measures reflecting pain, itch, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and helplessness. Target recruitment was 72 patients.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thirty-five patients were randomized (17 prednisolone, 18 placebo/control). The adjusted mean difference between treatment groups at 3 months in HAQ-DI score was −0.10 (97.5% CI: −0.29, 0.10), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.254, and in mRSS −3.90 (97.5% CI: −8.83, 1.03), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.070, both favouring prednisolone but not significantly. Patients in the prednisolone group experienced significantly less pain (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.027), anxiety (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.018) and helplessness (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.040) than control patients at 3 months. There were no renal crises, but sample size was small.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>PRedSS was terminated early primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and so was underpowered. Therefore, interpretation must be cautious and results considered inconclusive, indicating the need for a further randomized trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) is painful, disabling and disfiguring because of (often rapidly progressive) widespread skin thickening [<xref rid="kead012-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and musculoskeletal involvement. Recent publications have bench-marked this pain and disability [<xref rid="kead012-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="kead012-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], increasing awareness of the need to address quality of life issues as well as survival in patients with early dcSSc.</p>
              <p>At present there is no effective disease modifying treatment for early dcSSc. Guidelines advocate immunosuppression [<xref rid="kead012-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="kead012-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which may confer modest benefit [<xref rid="kead012-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be an option in highly selected cases [<xref rid="kead012-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="kead012-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A key question is whether corticosteroids should be prescribed. In favour of corticosteroids is that the symptoms that have a major negative impact on the everyday lives of patients with early dcSSc (tight, painful, itchy skin, and loss of function due to contractures and musculoskeletal involvement) have an inflammatory basis [<xref rid="kead012-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, corticosteroids are a risk factor for renal crisis [<xref rid="kead012-B10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>] of which patients with early dcSSc are already at high risk, especially when anti-RNA polymerase III positive [<xref rid="kead012-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Against this background, the aim of the PRednisolone in early diffuse SSc (PRedSS) trial was to examine safety and efficacy of moderate-dose prednisolone in patients with early dcSSc. Specific objectives were to evaluate whether moderate-dose prednisolone reduced pain and disability, and improved skin score, and whether prednisolone was safe with particular reference to renal function.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>PRedSS set out as a Phase II, multicentre, double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) but was converted to open-label after blinded treatment with prednisolone or placebo became untenable during the Covid-19 pandemic. The trial protocol is described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="kead012-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The study was approved by the North West–Greater Manchester South Research Ethics Committee. All participants gave written informed consent.</p>
                <p>After a screening visit, patients were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Randomization (ensuring allocation concealment) was 1:1 to either enteric-coated prednisolone or matching placebo capsules (one active capsule = 5 mg prednisolone), stratified by anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl70) antibody positivity. Stratification for anti-RNA polymerase III positivity (the ideal option) was not feasible because not all participating centres had access to rapid testing for anti-RNA polymerase III.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Patients from 14 UK centres were recruited. The main inclusion criteria were adults (age &gt;18 years) with early dcSSc (skin involvement extending proximal to the elbow or knee, or involving trunk and within 3 years of onset of skin thickening). Exclusion criteria are listed in <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, available at <italic toggle="yes">Rheumatology</italic> online.</p>

                <title>Treatment</title>
                <p>Patients received, for 6 months, ∼0.3 mg/kg of prednisolone or less (or placebo equivalent): weight &lt;50 kg = 10 mg; &gt;50 kg but &lt;60 kg = 15 mg; &gt;60 kg but &lt;80 kg = 20 mg, &gt;80 kg but &lt;100 kg = 25 mg; &gt;100 kg = 30 mg. If a patient experienced adverse effects thought likely related to trial treatment, then the dose could be reduced. Trial treatment was additive to background treatment, including immunosuppressant therapy. A proton pump inhibitor and a calcium and vitamin D supplement were co-prescribed with the trial treatment. At the 6-month (final) visit, the treatment code was broken.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The co-primary outcome measures (examined at 3 months, to maximize patient retention up until the primary end point, and also because any symptomatic improvement in response to prednisolone was likely to occur within a short time frame) were functional ability as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) [<xref rid="kead012-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) [<xref rid="kead012-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="kead012-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The HAQ-DI [<xref rid="kead012-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] is self-administered (advantageous in the Covid-19 era) whereas the mRSS involves palpation of the skin by the examining clinician.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>This is discussed in full elsewhere [<xref rid="kead012-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], including the power calculation, which indicated that 60 patients (30 per arm) would give 82% power. We aimed to recruit 12 more patients allowing for a 17% attrition.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis to include all randomized patients with baseline data and at least one follow-up. Continuous outcomes were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) to assess differences between the treatment arms. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and handled within the MMRM approach, which remains valid given such a mechanism. Each model included the fixed categorical effects of treatment (prednisolone <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> placebo), time point (6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months), whether a patient was anti-topoisomerase positive, and baseline score as well as the interactions of all fixed terms with time point. A general unstructured covariance matrix (six parameters) was used for the error terms. The models were fitted using restricted maximum likelihood and employed Kenward–Roger degrees of freedom adjustment [<xref rid="kead012-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
                <p>The primary analysis focus was the contrast (adjusted mean difference in HAQ-DI and mRSS scores) between trial arms at 3 months using an adjusted two-tail 2.5% significance level. Secondary outcomes were exploratory in nature, each employing an unadjusted two-tail 5% significance level.</p>
                <p>We conducted a sensitivity analysis by repeating the primary analysis for two different periods (i.e. ‘pre’ and ‘during’ lockdown) to help determine the extent to which the trial may have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/IC version 15.1, (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>

                <title>Covid-19 impact on methods</title>
                <p>On 23 March 2020 the code was broken on all 11 patients currently on trial treatment (10 of whom were on immunosuppressant therapy and therefore deemed at high risk from Covid-19 if also on prednisolone) and to halt further recruitment. Ten continued on/completed the trial on an open-label basis. Because double-blind prednisolone was not going to be a viable option in the short to medium term, approvals were obtained to re-open PRedSS as an open-label study (11 August 2020). A request for extension funding to continue recruitment was declined. PRedSS closed to recruitment in February 2021.</p>

              <p>Patients were recruited into the double-blind RCT between 15 December 2017 and 23 March 2020 or into the open-label phase between 11 August 2020 and 31 January 2021. Twenty-five patients were randomized during the double-blind phase (13 to prednisolone) and 10 during the open-label phase (four to prednisolone). Therefore 17 were randomized to prednisolone and 18 to placebo or to no treatment (‘control patients’). <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, available at <italic toggle="yes">Rheumatology</italic> online, shows patient progression through the study. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table S3</xref>, available at <italic toggle="yes">Rheumatology</italic> online, shows the number of participants and the frequency (%) of missing outcome data.</p>

                <p>There were a total of 44 adverse events from 15 participants, 22 in the prednisolone group and 22 in the control group. There were four serious adverse events in two control participants: one patient suffered a myocardial infarction and haematoma secondary to edoxaban, and the other developed pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiac failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. There were two cases of new hypertension, both in patients on prednisolone, and two cases of worsening of existing hypertension, both in control participants. There were no cases of scleroderma renal crisis, no serious infections and no new diabetes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PRedSS was a casualty of the Covid-19 pandemic and was halted early. The major limitation of the study was that the 35 patients recruited (of whom 10 were open-label) fell short of the target of 72, rendering results inconclusive.</p>
              <p>At 3 months, trajectories for both co-primary endpoints (the HAQ-DI and the mRSS) favoured prednisolone, although there were no statistically significant differences between groups and the estimated benefit of prednisolone on functional ability, as gauged by the adjusted mean HAQ-DI at 3 months, was small (−0.10). The assessment of the mRSS was hampered with the move away from face-to-face follow-up assessments necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and open-label assessments had the potential of observer bias. Bearing in mind these limitations, the estimated benefit of prednisolone on the adjusted mean mRSS at 3 months was moderate (−3.9) with a minimally clinically important difference of −5 [<xref rid="kead012-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] lying within the confidence interval.</p>
              <p>The large number of secondary outcomes (over 20) means that interpretation of these results should be even more cautious. However, it is worth noting the benefits of prednisolone over placebo at 3 months in pain and in helplessness (and also in anxiety). Treatment with prednisolone appeared safe. Specifically there were no renal crises, although patient numbers were small and it is also possible that longer durations of prednisolone therapy might increase renal crisis risk.</p>
              <p>PRedSS provides valuable information to take forward to a future clinical trial. First, a double-blind trial of prednisolone is complex, due to the need to adjust corticosteroid dose during intercurrent illness and therefore increasing the likelihood of code-breaks, particularly during the Covid-19 era. Second, remote visits are feasible, reducing the need for patients to travel to hospital (a major advantage during the Covid-19 era) because (i) we have shown that the patient reported outcome measures in PRedSS were acceptable to patients in terms of ‘questionnaire burden’ and (ii) skin score can now be self-assessed through development of the Patient self-Assessment of Skin Thickness in Upper Limb (PASTUL) questionnaire [<xref rid="kead012-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Third, our experience with PRedSS will inform power calculations and likely recruitment rates for a future study. And so although PredSS has not provided a definitive answer as to whether or not corticosteroids should be prescribed in patients with early dcSSc, it provides critical insights for future studies addressing this important clinical question, and perhaps also provides support for the view of many clinicians that it is not unreasonable to prescribe short-term moderate dose prednisolone for symptom control, always remembering the importance of careful monitoring of blood pressure and renal function.</p>
