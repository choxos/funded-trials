                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with an elevated vaginal pH and the presence of abnormal offensive discharge. It is common, often recurrent, and the most effective treatment regimen is unknown. ‘Metronidazole <bold>V</bold>ersus lactic ac<bold>I</bold>d for <bold>T</bold>reating bacterial v<bold>A</bold>ginosis’ (VITA) is a UK-based randomised controlled trial assessing clinical and cost-effectiveness of topical lactic acid gel compared to oral metronidazole antibiotic for treating second and subsequent BV episodes. Few BV trials report on women’s preferences for treatment in the context of their own experiences.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>This qualitative study investigated the acceptability and tolerability of the two treatments. During the trial, semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken between January—May 2018. A total of 33 women diagnosed with BV were consecutively sampled then interviewed from six sites across England. Thematic analysis was guided by the acceptability of health interventions framework. Potential causes of BV and its impact on women’s lives were explored in addition to women’s treatment preference and perceived treatment effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Although women felt antibiotics treat BV effectively, and were associated with longer time periods between episodes, they generally preferred using the lactic acid gel because of ease of use, once daily application and less side-effects. Women would recommend the lactic acid gel to others for mild cases of BV but to take antibiotics when more severe. The risk of antibiotic drug resistance was a common concern. Self-help medicating or self-decision to not treat was also evident due to prior experience of poor outcomes from treatment. Triggers of BV were attributed to personal hygiene habits–soaps used to wash the vagina and sexual practices such as unprotected sex.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Acceptability and preference for topical lactic acid gel or oral metronidazole tablets in the treatment of recurrent BV was affected by personal choice relating to <italic>affective attitude</italic>, <italic>burden</italic>, <italic>ethicality</italic>, <italic>intervention coherence</italic>, <italic>opportunity costs</italic>, and <italic>self-efficacy</italic>. These differed depending on ease of use, tolerability and past experiences, but not necessarily based on perceived drug effectiveness. Knowledge of a patient preference for topical lactic acid gel therapy despite lower perceived effectiveness may be useful for clinicians when making treatment decisions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs in the lower genital tract and is often persistent with a high prevalence, varying from 20–50% amongst women of reproductive age. It has been described as ‘a common condition of unknown aetiology’ [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and as ‘a microbiological and immunological enigma’ [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. BV’s microbial imbalance [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is characterised by homogenous discharge, vaginal pH greater than 4.5, positive amine test and presence of clue cells microscopically [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but BV can also be asymptomatic. This vaginal condition may cause gynaecological and obstetric complications, and contributes to the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Risk factors include African origin, low socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, douching, new sexual partners and recent multiple partners [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ‘polymicrobial nature of BV and its propensity for recurrence make treatment a challenge’ [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Treatment options are associated with a high rate of microbiological and symptomatic recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] irrespective of treatment used. At present, oral antibiotics such as metronidazole or clindamycin are regarded as first-line treatment for BV [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224964.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] although they may only clear symptoms transiently. [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many studies have also assessed the efficacy of lactobacilli probiotics administered intravaginally but with inconsistent results [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another treatment option is topical lactic acid gel, available without prescription, which is promoted to restore vaginal pH balance and natural bacteria. However this is not included in current UK guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and has not been adequately evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec006">
                <title>Treatment acceptability</title>
                <p>In addition to clinical efficacy, Devaux, Castela [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] suggest that factors to consider when selecting therapy include: patient treatment preference, the effect on the quality of life and the acceptability of treatment. Kazdin [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] defined treatment acceptability as ‘treatment that is acceptable when it is appropriate to the problem, fair, reasonable and non-intrusive to the patient’ but it must also include the degree to which the person thinks it may be effective [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Greater treatment acceptance is associated with higher adherence, better compliance and improved persistence [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To this end, acceptability has become a key consideration in the design, evaluation and implementation of healthcare interventions [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, very few studies [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] have qualitatively explored acceptability and tolerability of different BV treatment options.</p>

                <title>Clinical trial</title>
                <p>This paper reports on the qualitative phase of a national multi-centre trial entitled <italic>‘Metronidazole</italic>

At the time of recruitment for interview, six of the 22 participating NHS sites were recruiting women to the VITA study. Participant inclusion criteria included women aged 16 years or above; with clinical diagnosis of BV based on patient-reported symptoms of unpleasant (typically fishy) odourised discharge (with or without positive microscopy from swab test according to local site practice); a history of one or more episodes of BV within the previous two years which resolved with treatment; willing to take their own vaginal samples; avoidance of vaginal douching during treatment; and avoid sexual intercourse or use effective contraception for the seven-day duration (condoms were not considered safe due to interaction with lactic acid gel). Those not eligible included women who were pregnant; breastfeeding; trying to conceive; or on other oral or topical antibiotics or antifungals. Risks to participating included possible side effects of drugs. Women were briefed that if the medication they were given did not work, further drugs could be prescribed. When seen at their local general practice (GP) surgery or genitourinary medicine (GUM) sexual and reproductive health clinic, participants were asked to take their own genital samples of vaginal discharge for microbiological analysis of BV. Women were randomised to oral metronidazole antibiotic tablets at a dose of 400mg, twice daily, 12 hours apart, for seven-days (control) or 5ml of intravaginal lactic acid gel (which is colourless and viscous) administered through an intravaginal tube and inserted into the vagina, once daily before bed, for seven-days (intervention). Participants obtained their allocated study treatment from any dispensing pharmacy as any licensed brand of metronidazole or lactic acid gel could be used. Following the initial visit, women were followed-up for resolution of their symptoms at two-weeks, three-months and six-months. Online questionnaires, optional diaries as aide-memoire and self-sampling kits were completed at home.</p>
                <p>The aim of this predefined sub-study, as outlined in the trial protocol [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], was to use qualitative research methods to explore a diverse group of women’s experiences of the acceptability of treatments and preferences for treatment, what factors they perceived to contribute to the development and recurrence of BV, and how BV made them feel physically and emotionally.</p>

                <p>This study has been reported in accordance with the 21-item ‘Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research’ recommendations by O’Brien, Harris [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lead author, JAW, an experienced qualitative researcher, was responsible for interview recruitment, data collection and analysis.

                <p>Consecutive sampling of women who had completed the course of treatment and opted in to be approached for interview were identified. It was therefore not pre-determined how many women from each trial arm would accept an interview. Women received an email invitation for an interview from JAW and if there was no reply, two reminder emails were sent, a week apart. They were also reminded that participation was voluntary and they were free to withdraw from the interview or study at any time [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interview recruitment continued until data saturation. There were no direct benefits for taking part in the trial, except a £15 Amazon gift voucher for completing a two-week post-intervention online questionnaire.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted over the telephone, by JAW, between January—May 2018 whilst the trial was still ongoing. Data was collected in English and interviews were scheduled at least two-weeks after completing the seven-day course of treatment. We asked women about their preferences, and the advantages and disadvantages of either treatment. Women were encouraged to talk about their recent episode and previous episodes of BV including symptoms, triggers and the impact of BV had on their lives to provide contextual background (see interview guide -Appendix 1). Women were made aware of the useful nature for us to ‘hear their voices’ in adjunct to collecting their clinical results and questionnaires at different time points. Consent was given in writing at the trial recruitment stage and again verbally at the start of each phone-call, including consent for audio-recording using an encrypted Dictaphone. Interviews were transcribed by one of the two independent transcribers hired by the University of Warwick.</p>

                <p>Participants were told that JAW is a health science researcher (non-clinician), experienced in qualitative assessment, particularly in-depth interviews on sensitive topics. Throughout the data collection process, JAW adhered to researcher self-reflexivity around personal opinions and any experiences or preconceptions about the research. On reviewing the interviews prior to analysis, JAW emailed participants to ask for clarifications where necessary. JAW had no prior relationship with any of the participants.</p>

Codes were based on interview questions and subsequent emergent themes, checked by FG via inter-coded reliability for inferences and interpretation of data. A mini-report of the first ten transcripts were analysed and shared with the wider trial team for discussion whilst data collection continued. Word spotting of descriptive adjectives assisted in summarising all contextual data describing BV symptoms. We present participant quotes labelled by their age and allocated treatment group.</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p>Comparative analysis followed, where we used data to relate findings to seven constructs in ‘The acceptability of health interventions framework’ by Sekhon, Cartwright [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as the comparator. It comprises of seven multi-faceted constructs: <italic>affective attitude</italic> (how they feel about the intervention); <italic>burden</italic> (perceived effort required); <italic>ethicality</italic> (good fit with their value system); <italic>intervention coherence</italic> (how they understand the intervention); <italic>opportunity costs</italic> (benefits, profits, values to engage); <italic>perceived effectiveness</italic> (perceived as likely to achieve its purpose) and; <italic>self-efficacy</italic> (confidence that they can perform the behaviour required to participate). This framework fits well with our research topic on treatment acceptability, as the constructs reflect the extent to which people receiving a healthcare intervention, consider it to be appropriate, based on their anticipated or experiential cognitive and emotional responses. We consider each construct within our data from women’s’ prospective, concurrent and retrospective perspectives on BV treatments.</p>

              <p>In this study, the biomedical treatment preferences of 33 women were exposed based on their trial participation and historical medication experience. Opinions were formed based around side-effects, perceived effectiveness, treatment outcomes, and lifestyle factors. First, we describe demographics, response rate and adherence.</p>

                <title>Participant demographics</title>
                <p>We analysed interviews from the 33 women, aged 21–51 years old (average age of 32 years), from diverse ethnic backgrounds: eleven identified as Black Caribbean, nine as White, five as Black African, three as Mixed-race, two as Asian, one as Indian, one as Pakistani, and one as Chinese. Our sample was representative of most ethnicities across the six sites, whereby White and Black Caribbean, were also predominant. Our sample did not include Bangladeshi and Black Other. They were recruited from an NHS GP surgery or GUM clinic at six study sites in differing geographic locations in the West Midlands (19), the North (1) and the South East of England (13). Only six sites had been recruited onto the trial at this stage. Sexual orientation was not specifically requested, but from the interview data, we know women with both male and female partner(s) were included. Most women had experienced on average one-three episodes of BV, but 11 women had experienced BV more than three times. In our sample, 20 women had been randomised to the trial arm (oral lactic acid gel) and 13 women to the control arm (antibiotic tablets). Data saturation was not reached at the target sample of 20 women, so interviewing continued to a total of 33 participants at which time saturation had been reached.</p>

The reasons for 19 of the women not being interviewed were: four did not answer their phones at the agreed time (even after a second attempt the next day at the same time), 13 women never replied to email invites, one woman decided not to take part in the interview, and another withdrew from the study.</p>

                  <p>All of the women were confused about how and why they get BV recurrently. Most identified noticeable contributing triggers that impacted on recurrence. The most frequently perceived trigger that women associated with BV were sexual practices–unprotected sexual intercourse (for example, not using condoms), multiple sexual partners, and male semen post-ejaculation. All women attributed being sexually active to BV recurrence, if they were in or out of a relationship with a person(s) of the same or opposite sex and practising safe or non-safe sex.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Of those women who felt there was an association between their sexual behaviours and BV, four women believed this caused a disturbance or imbalance in their vaginal pH levels due to possible bacterial transfer.</p>
                  <disp-quote>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The use of contraceptive coils such as Intrauterine device (IUD) (copper or hormonal implant, Mirena branded), menstrual cycle and application of tampons and not changing tampons regularly or forgetting to hand wash pre-application were all viewed as contributors to the condition. Hygiene practices that were deemed to trigger BV, such as the type of soap product used by the sexual partner on their ‘intimate areas’; bathing in perfumed bubble bath water; using ‘cheap’ shower gels; cleaning with an antiseptic solution such as Dettol®; or activities such as douching were described by almost all women as detrimental to the development of BV.</p>

                  <p>Most women had received advice about personal hygiene to prevent BV from a health professional in the past. Some had been recommended or prescribed dermatological soaps to wash with, such as Cetraben® or aqueous emollient creams. Women felt showering with a spray, using tepid tap water and a pH balance sensitive soap were preferential to bathing in fragranced soap. Soap brands used were Sienna X®, Sanex Zero%®, Aveeno®, Lush®, and Dove®. Numerous women were concerned that their body-wash products may <italic>“still feel like it might be passing down there [vagina]” (V23</italic>, <italic>aged 23</italic>: <italic>antibiotic tablets)</italic>. Almost half of the women said they do not use soap inside of their vagina, only water. Washing habits varied from several times per day due to religious beliefs or to remove BV discharge, or commonly twice per day or every few days to weekly (to ‘preserve the natural body oils’). Two women did not have access to a shower at their residence and used a bath or container to wash. Another said she washes her hair separately to her body, so any shampoo chemicals do not contaminate her bath water.</p>
                  <p>As a result of poor treatment effects from pharmaceutical drugs, more than half of the participants had attempted self-help medicating before, during or after being prescribed treatment for BV. This ranged from buying over-the-counter liquid lactic acid gels or waxy bullet-like pessaries either from a pharmacy or online (two brands mentioned were Canesbalance® or Balance Activ). The cost of these lactic acid gel treatments varied from £8–20 which was deemed unaffordable. The advice sought from online forums “<italic>of women miserable because BV has ruined their life” (V8</italic>, <italic>aged 25</italic>: <italic>antibiotic tablets)</italic> included their suggested home remedies such as steaming, washing with apple cider vinegar or inserting bio-live active natural yoghurt cultures (organisms) into the vagina.</p>

                  <p>As a treatment option, intravaginal lactic acid gel administered once per day, before sleeping, was overall very acceptable as it was described as ‘easy to administer/apply’ ‘without a problem’ and ‘easy to use’. Out of the 20 women randomised to the lactic acid gel, 17 described the tube applicator as comfortable to use.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Few problems were described in relation to lactic acid gel usage and most women had no difficulties in using the applicator or following the instructions (to lie flat on their backs at night). There was a general consensus that it was straightforward ‘to squeeze out’. Other reasons for advocating the lactic acid gel was due to its convenience:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic>“Oh</italic>, <italic>I think it’s just kind of easier</italic>, <italic>it’s more convenient</italic>. <italic>I just don’t like taking pills</italic>, <italic>so I think the lactic acid gel was a better way</italic>.<italic>” (V15</italic>, <italic>aged 30</italic>: <italic>antibiotic tablets)</italic></p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>However, one woman did worry whether the tube was empty as the angle needed to administer was ‘tricky’, causing her to struggle when squeezing out all remaining lactic acid gel. She suggested that the design of the tube could be improved by making “<italic>the tube a bit longer” (V6</italic>, <italic>aged 28</italic>: <italic>lactic acid gel)</italic> and she felt therefore more hygienic. Some women had prior experience of using shop-bought pessaries so were already familiar with vaginal application. Mostly everyone wore panty-liners at night during the course of treatment in case of possible seepage.</p>

                  <p>There were no side-effects associated with the lactic acid gel, except one woman said she had increased itching which she linked to the lactic acid gel rather than a symptom of BV. Another woman implied that because of the time of the day the lactic acid gel had to be applied, she forgot to use it on one occasion, as she fell asleep.</p>

                  <p>Several women illuminated that their symptoms cleared up during using the lactic acid gel, but the majority recalled the BV recurred within one to two weeks of completing treatment as they started presenting with the same symptoms post-treatment. They concluded that the lactic acid gel <italic>“didn’t really work” (V37</italic>, <italic>aged 26</italic>: <italic>lactic acid gel</italic>) and <italic>“Yeah</italic>, <italic>it hasn’t worked</italic>, <italic>it wasn't very good at all</italic>, <italic>to be honest with you… it just didn’t clear it</italic>, <italic>it’s still there…” (V24</italic>, <italic>aged 37</italic>: <italic>lactic acid gel)</italic></p>

                  <p>Another woman said, she felt she could not drink water as usual before bedtime, in fear she would need to urinate during the night (after inserting the lactic acid gel) and was, therefore, nervous it may all come out. Two women felt the tube had too much liquid in, which caused one of them to think:</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>There was disagreement about whether the lactic acid gel stayed in or leaked out. Only one woman described the lactic acid gel as ‘gushing out’ when she stood up straight after application (not following the instructions). Women were advised to not engage in sexual intercourse during the lactic acid gel treatment which for some, made it a very inconvenient form of treatment.</p>

                  <p>Overall, antibiotics were generally not acceptable to women with BV because of the frequency they had to be prescribed. However, metronidazole was considered an effective first-line prescribed treatment, particularly for ‘intense’ cases of BV.

The ability to buy the lactic acid gel without prescription was important to them as there is a stigma attached to going to the GUM clinic for antibiotics for BV. It also gave women the freedom to buy lactic acid gel pessaries/tubes when it suited them, rather than taking time off work for a GP appointment or visit to the GUM clinic, possibly a long wait time.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Women with recurrent BV found both treatment options: intravaginal lactic acid gel and oral metronidazole acceptable but favoured antibiotics as the most effective treatment option when the symptoms were severe, as this was perceived as having a more sustained effect. Yet in contrast, many women still preferred using the lactic acid gel, regarded as an easy, once per day application with few side-effects. Although adequate for mild cases of BV, the effectiveness of the lactic acid gel was a concern. However, the perceived rates of recurrence after using the lactic acid gel and antibiotic regimens varied between individuals.</p>
              <p>Preference for the lactic acid gel was based on pro-factors such as, application straight to the site of the BV, offering instant soothing; concerns that frequent use of antibiotics would lead to resistance; and the availability of the lactic acid gel without prescription, even when this involved paying for it. The effort required to take the antibiotic tablets twice per day and alter social behaviours, such as drinking alcohol, played a significant role in shaping acceptability attitudes. This was often based on individual’s ideas around the practical advantages and disadvantages of each treatment, rather than whether it would actually work <italic>(burden)</italic>. How the BV made women feel, why they were prepared and willing to try the treatment again or for the first time <italic>(affective attitude)</italic>, and what they had to change as a result such as lifestyle practices or behaviours <italic>(opportunity cost)</italic> had a considerable influence on their decisions. Women’s treatment preferences did not always come down to effectiveness as these were often related to the woman’s value system and beliefs, and the possible consequences of treatment <italic>(ethicality)</italic>. All of which can be considered by the clinician prescribing the next course of treatment at the next episode.</p>
              <p>Both treatments reduced discharge and the associated odour to some degree, sometimes within a day of starting medication. Our data suggest that women were able to take the medication according to the instructions, with only some intrusion into their daily lives <italic>(self-efficacy)</italic>. All women held some level of understanding about how the lactic acid gel or antibiotic tablets worked to cure the BV <italic>(coherence)</italic>.</p>
              <p>All of the women described optimism for the lactic acid gel as a future alternative or replacement treatment for metronidazole. It was proposed that using both treatments back-to-back may be beneficial at keeping the BV at bay or by using the lactic acid gel as a precautionary preventative prophylaxis over prolonged periods, even when there was no clinical diagnosis of BV. The decision to not treat was also evident amongst several women who felt poor prior treatment outcomes lessened their confidence in a cure. The hope that the condition would just go away without treatment was popular. However, they also recognised that a point was often reached at which the BV became unmanageable, when treatment in whatever form was sought and led to the emotional and physical despair reported by every woman in this sub-study. Treatment preference was therefore down to personal choice, which differed depending on drug accessibility and current lifestyle, and was not necessarily focused on effectiveness. Since the trial is still ongoing (July, 2019) the comparative effectiveness of the lactic acid gel and metronidazole are still unknown to the research team.</p>
              <p>The multifaceted nature of BV’s aetiology makes the management of acute and recurrent symptoms complicated as women’s experiences in the current study attest. Our data highlight how women with symptomatic BV have tried prescribed and self-medicated treatment options multiple times. They oscillated between which treatments they prefer, as neither lactic acid gel nor metronidazole antibiotic tablets were seen as having particularly sustained outcomes, with symptoms described as never really going away.</p>
              <p>The characteristics of BV such as offensive smell and abnormal vaginal discharge that so impact on women’s lives are consistent with findings from other qualitative studies [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224964.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We similarly found that the impact recurrent BV had on women’s lives goes beyond the bacterial symptomatology and leads to emotional trauma. In parallel, an increase in paranoia and reduced self-esteem affected women’s’ work and personal relationships due to the physical, emotional and social burden of living with recurrent BV [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is a complex interaction of multiple components: the vaginal microbial ecosystem and the human host which is modulated by a woman’s behaviour and environment, which further complicates the overall ‘BV cause equation’ [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A qualitative study documenting Swedish women’s BV life experiences and management of symptoms, also found that BV influences quality of life including reduced intimacy, changes in relationships and frustration around recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Research into African American women with BV found that lifestyle behaviours such as douching, bathing and using vaginal cleaning agents were significantly associated with BV due to the disruption of vaginal flora [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Whilst women in the current study did not report these specifically, descriptions around hygiene practices as probable triggers were identified. In addition, the frequent use of self-help remedies to counteract BV was also identified in our participant group. Payne, Cromer [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported the potential for hormonal contraceptives to protect against BV, yet this was at odds with several women in our study, who felt there was in fact a correlation between BV and their copper coil in causing BV.</p>
              <p>In a study by McGowan, Gomez [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reasons for not accepting the lactic acid gel were messiness and leakage. This was seldom reported in our study, as lactic acid gel was regarded as ‘easy to use’ and non-irritating which is consistent with results from Coggins, Blanchard [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In our sample, women who did not prefer the lactic acid gel primarily attributed this to having to remember to insert it at night. Our results are congruent with Bilardi, Walker [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who described how women in Australia were frustrated and dissatisfied with current treatment regimens for BV, in particular antimicrobials, leading women to take ineffective non-evidence-based therapies [<xref rid="pone.0224964.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Our study findings extend the existing literature by hearing from an ethnically diverse group of women about their treatment experiences and views of BV which are valuable for practice and will help to contextualise the trial results when available. As most women had experienced various treatments, they were able to make comparisons for themselves and these prospective, concurrent and retrospective accounts gave richness to the narratives captured. However, this did mean that their experiences of different treatments sometimes merged together. They found it hard to differentiate between the most recent or previous medication (which may have been the same or different) as they were often taken so close together.</p>
                <p>Although we aimed to interview women within two-weeks post-treatment, some interviews were delayed up to five-weeks (due to participant availability) therefore women’s recall may have become less accurate. We did not have sufficient data to undertake comparisons between demographic groups or on socioeconomic variation.</p>
                <p>This paper has not been influenced by the quantitative results of the ongoing trial.</p>

              <sec id="sec041">
                <title>Future implications</title>
                <p>At present there is inconclusive evidence about what treatment regimen is most effective for women with recurrent BV. Our interview study would suggest, in this situation, women should be given the choice by their clinician of which treatment they prefer and/ or works best for them given their past personal experience. However, when the VITA trial results are available, this may change. If lactic acid gel is found to be the more effective treatment option, we know many women would welcome this as many prefer it. If antibiotics are found to be most effective, in many instances, women are likely to still want to use lactic acid gel because some women are hesitant to keep using antibiotics on a recurrent basis. To achieve better informed and shared decision-making about treatments, health professionals need an understanding of what women think about the use of antibiotics or topical lactic acid gel (as this may affect adherence to treatment and BV recurrence) in weighing up the pros and cons of treatments with women. Future qualitative studies are fundamental as there are still gaps related to BV, lifestyle and sexual orientation.</p>
                <p>Approaches to tackling this common and debilitating condition need to take account of the individual’s prior experiences and retrospective acceptability by reflecting on constructs such as self-efficacy, ethicality and intervention burden, to find the best ‘treatment fit’ for each woman. Further research that considers acceptability and tolerability of BV drug options by individual preference and perceived treatment effectiveness will be necessary, if lactic acid gel is to be recommended in future treatment guidelines for clinicians to follow.</p>
