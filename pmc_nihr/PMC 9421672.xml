                  <p>On average, aspects of mental health improve following behavioural weight management programmes, yet this is not the case for all participants. It is important to identify those at risk of harm to provide more effective psychological support.

                  <p>In the Weight loss Referrals for Adults in Primary care trial, 1,267 adults with body mass index ≥28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were randomized to brief intervention, or WW (formerly weight watchers) for 12-weeks or 52-weeks and followed for 5 years. We used linear and multinomial regression to explore the association between participant characteristics and changes in depression and anxiety (measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale). Where possible, the impact of missing data was investigated using multiple imputation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Higher baseline anxiety was associated with decreases in anxiety symptoms and increases in depression symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Higher baseline depression was associated with decreases in depression symptoms and increases in anxiety symptoms from baseline to follow-up. The magnitude of the associations was small. No further characteristics were consistently associated with changes in mental health.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>Evidence suggests that baseline depression and anxiety may indicate how depression and anxiety symptoms change during and after attending WW. Measurement of depression and anxiety at the start of a behavioural weight management programme and subsequent monitoring may facilitate timely psychological support if a deterioration in mental health is identified. Further research in large and diverse participant samples is required to clarify the findings.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Behavioural weight management programmes are recommended by national guidelines across the world [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A recent systematic review found that, on average, programmes have small benefits for some aspects of mental health (e.g., depression and self-esteem) and do not appear to negatively impact any aspect of mental health at the end of the intervention [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, it is likely that this is not the case for all participants. It is important to identify those at risk of worsening mental health during and after behavioural programmes to provide more effective support for these participants [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>We can seek to identify those at risk of psychological harm during and after a behavioural weight management programme by investigating how participant characteristics are associated with changes in mental health. Various baseline participant characteristics may be associated with changes in mental health, including age, gender, education, habit strength, and self-regulation. Despite much research investigating how these characteristics are associated with weight changes during and after behavioural weight management programmes [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], there is a scarcity of research investigating the association with mental health changes [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previous research has identified paid work, social support, and self-determination, among others, to be associated with quality of life and wellbeing during and after behavioural weight management treatments [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no research has investigated the association of participant characteristics with changes in adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety), therefore making it difficult to identify those at risk of detrimental impacts on mental health.</p>
              <p>Some participant characteristics are considered modifiable by the behavioural programme, such as habit strength, dietary restraint, and self-regulation. These are often targeted by behavioural weight management programmes in order to reduce risk factors for disease and improve health outcomes [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous research has shown that early changes in modifiable participant characteristics during a behavioural programme are associated with subsequent improvements in health behaviours (e.g., emotional eating, dietary adherence) and weight loss [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], yet it is unclear how early changes in participant characteristics are associated with changes in mental health. Investigating how changes in participant characteristics during the early stages of a behavioural weight management programme relate to subsequent changes in mental health may inform the development of future programmes. For example, if decreases in dietary restraint are associated with worsening mental health, then programmes could be adapted to mitigate this risk. This may involve changes to programme content, provider training, or referrals to external support.</p>
              <p>Previous research has investigated a small number of participant characteristics in samples unrepresentative of the general population of adults with obesity (i.e., exclusively hospital patients or those with type 2 diabetes) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is important to include a diverse range of participant characteristics potentially associated with mental health to broaden our understanding and increase the odds of identifying those at a greater risk of harm. Previous research has also lacked clarity of detail in the research methods used, resulting in difficulty in replicating study methods and comparing findings [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Specifically, previous research has often not clearly stated the timepoint at which the participant characteristics were assessed (e.g., baseline or early changes) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Overall, we identified a scarcity of research investigating how participant characteristics are associated with changes in adverse mental health outcomes (i.e., depression and anxiety) during and after behavioural weight management programmes. We aimed to assess how baseline participant characteristics are associated with changes in mental health in participants of a behavioural weight management programme to identify those at most risk of worsening mental health. We also assessed the association of early changes in participant characteristics with changes in mental health to inform the development of future programmes. We did not have specific, directional hypotheses relating to which participant characteristics may be associated with changes in mental health due to the lack of existing literature to inform such hypotheses. As such, this secondary data analysis is an exploratory study.</p>

                <p>This study is a secondary data analysis of the “Weight loss Referrals for Adults in Primary care” (WRAP) randomized controlled trial. In WRAP, participants were randomized in a 2:5:5 ratio to one of three groups: (1) Brief intervention, (2) 12-week commercial weight management programme (CP12), and (3) 52-week commercial weight management programme (CP52) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The randomization sequence was generated by the trial statistician and programmed into the database by the research manager; research staff and participants were blinded to the sequence. The commercial weight management intervention was provided by WW (formerly weight watchers). Ethical approval was received from the NRES Committee East of England Cambridge East and local approvals from the NRES Committee North West Liverpool Central, the NRES Committee South Central Oxford, and the West Midlands-Coventry and Warwickshire Research Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent for their participation in the trial. This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN82857232; ISRCTN64986150). Further information on trial methods is reported elsewhere [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Eligible participants were identified and recruited by local primary care practices across England, and all study participants gave written informed consent. Adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater, residing in the UK, were eligible for inclusion. Individuals were excluded if they had a planned or current pregnancy in the next two years, previous or planned bariatric surgery, currently followed a weight-loss programme, were non-English speaking or had communication needs precluding them from understanding the study or intervention materials, or were GP-defined inappropriate for participation. Further details of participant eligibility criteria can be found elsewhere [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants randomly assigned to attend WW were provided with either 12 or 52 vouchers, dependent on group assignment, for weekly local WW meetings. WW meetings are group-based behavioural weight management programmes operating on a rolling basis and led by a nonspecialist trained in weight loss and nutrition. Participants were provided with a unique code to access the digital tools for either 12 or 52 weeks accordingly. The WW digital tools are an online service that includes access to support materials (e.g., recipes, videos, and community area) and tracking tools. Participants assigned to the brief intervention control group were read a scripted booklet introduction by research staff and were given a 32-page printed British Heart Foundation booklet containing self-help weight-management strategies [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

Programme attendance was calculated by WW as participants were provided booklets of vouchers to attend meetings, and WW reported how many vouchers were used. Data related to vouchers issued during a specific time period were not recorded due to a computer system error (pertinent to 63 participants); as the only difference between those with and without data was the referral date, missing data was considered to be missing at random. Due to the lack of relevant literature to inform the selection of exposure variables to investigate, we determined exposure variables using investigator expertise with the aim of assessing a broad range of potentially associated characteristics.</p>

                  <p><italic>Sensitivity Analyses</italic>. Participants with missing values were excluded (i.e., complete-case analysis), assuming data are missing at random conditional on covariates in the model. A sensitivity analysis was performed using multiple imputation by chained equations, which also assumes data are missing at random but provides increased precision compared with complete-case analysis. For sensitivity analyses, we imputed data for variables with ≥5% missing data by multiple imputation by chained equations; variables with ≥25% missing data were excluded from sensitivity analyses.</p>
                  <p><italic>Additional Analyses Not Included in the Original Statistical Analysis Plan</italic>. Changes in depression/anxiety were continuous outcomes in the primary analyses. Since changes can be positive or negative, the precise nature of any exposure/outcome association may not be obvious using this approach. Therefore, we also fitted multinomial regression models to further illuminate the interpretation of the results of the primary analysis. We fitted these models for the primary analysis showing consistent associations across all timepoints (i.e., baseline participant characteristics) and did not fit these models where there were no consistent associations to be interpreted (i.e., early changes in participant characteristics). Estimates from the multinomial regression models were reported as relative risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI).</p>
                  <p>A minimal important difference (MID) for change in the hospital anxiety and depression scale score has not been determined in a population of adults with overweight and obesity. The minimal important difference in alternative populations (adults with cancer, cardiovascular disease, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) has most commonly been defined as a change of 2 points [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, we categorized changes in depression/anxiety as “decrease in symptoms” (≤−2), “no change in symptoms” (−1.99 to 1.99), or “increase in symptoms” (≥2) in the multinomial regression models. As in the primary analysis, these models were adjusted for randomized groups, and robust standard errors were calculated to allow for clustering by general practice.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We aimed to identify whether participant characteristics at baseline or early changes in characteristics were associated with changes in symptoms of depression and anxiety during and after a commercial weight management programme. We found that those reporting higher baseline anxiety were likely to experience decreases in anxiety symptoms and increases in depression symptoms up to 5 years from baseline, whereas those reporting higher baseline depression were likely to experience decreases in depression symptoms and increases in anxiety symptoms up to 5 years from baseline. No further characteristics were consistently associated with changes in mental health.</p>
              <p>Study findings should be interpreted with consideration to the distinct difference between statistical significance and clinical significance. Statistically, baseline depression and anxiety were associated with very small changes in depression and anxiety up to 5 years from baseline, though these changes were smaller than the MID. The MID represents the smallest change that is perceived by participants to be important, suggesting that the associations found may not represent meaningful change to those attending the weight management programme.</p>
              <p>Our findings suggest that baseline depression and anxiety may indicate future mental health needs; in particular, those reporting higher baseline depression or anxiety symptoms may benefit from ongoing monitoring to identify early any deterioration in mental health. However, we are unsure of the mechanisms underpinning these findings. For example, we are uncertain why those with higher baseline anxiety would experience reductions in anxiety yet increases in depression symptoms. We suggest that qualitative research may help to better understand why participants appear to simultaneously experience an improvement in one aspect of mental health while experiencing a decline in another aspect of mental health. It is also possible that the findings may be explained by regression to the mean, which is a common phenomenon in which individuals reporting a score at the extreme end of a scale are likely to show a change towards the centre of the scale [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The high proportion of missing data in this study increases the likelihood that regression to the mean may influence study findings as the sample may not represent the true population distribution [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Future research may wish to explore the patterning between anxiety and depression symptoms to better understand this relationship, and qualitative research may help to elicit an understanding of why these changes occur by exploring the potential factors that influence mental health. In addition, the large number of analyses increases the risk of type 1 error, so it would be important to replicate the associations we have reported in other studies.</p>
              <p>Previous research has sought to identify factors associated with changes in positive mental health outcomes (e.g., quality of life and wellbeing [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), yet to our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the factors associated with negative aspects of mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety). In previous research, factors found to be associated with quality of life and wellbeing included paid work, social support, self-determination, small weight loss, and an active lifestyle [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The findings of the current study differ with symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline found to be the only characteristics consistently associated with changes in depression and anxiety symptoms during and after WW. Comparisons of the current study findings with previous research must be considered with caution due to differing study eligibility criteria, outcomes of interest, and exposures assessed for association. For example, the participant eligibility criteria of previous research greatly differ as studies focused on those at risk of type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], women only [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], those with obesity waiting for bariatric surgery [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and excluded participants with psychological conditions [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>More research is needed to assess how participant characteristics are related to changes in depression and anxiety symptoms in a range of different participants, with trials including large samples with broad diversity in characteristics to enable these investigations. While we recognize that the current findings are not conclusive and more research is required, we suggest a cautious approach to minimize the risk of possible harm to the mental health of programme participants. Therefore, trialists and healthcare practitioners may consider measuring depression and anxiety more regularly to implement preventive care if a decline in symptoms is identified; any changes in measurement frequency should involve consultation with patient and public involvement representatives to ensure that participant burden is considered and that the proposed changes are deemed acceptable.</p>
              <sec id="sec2_9">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study assessed a broad range of potentially associated participant characteristics at baseline as well as early changes in characteristics. A formal statistical analysis plan for the a-priori aims was approved by all study authors before commencing analyses, minimizing the potential of being influenced to seek significant findings rather than guided by the predetermined research aims and rationale. We conducted an additional analysis to inform the interpretation of the results, which strengthened the meaningfulness of the conclusions.</p>
                <p>The study was limited by the proportion of missing data, particularly at longer-term follow-up visits (online suppl. Table <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Despite this, the WRAP trial reports a smaller attrition rate than is common in weight-loss trials [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and best efforts were made to transparently and clearly report missingness. A high proportion of missing data increases the risk of sample bias and may reduce study generalizability. Where possible, we investigated the impact of missing data on the results using multiple imputation. In future trials, engagement strategies should be considered to improve participant retention at study follow-up visits. Furthermore, some characteristics, such as ethnicity, had limited variability, meaning that they were unable to be investigated for their potential association with changes in mental health.</p>
                <p>A recent secondary data analysis of the WRAP trial found that follow-up participant samples may not represent the true range of mental health experiences; those reporting poorer mental health at baseline were less likely to attend study follow-up visits, although the magnitude of associations was small [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Study findings should be interpreted with consideration of this.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Evidence suggests that baseline depression and anxiety symptoms may be indicative of how symptoms of depression and anxiety change during and after a commercial weight management programme. Specifically, higher levels of anxiety symptoms at baseline were associated with decreases in anxiety and increases in depression symptoms, while higher levels of depression symptoms at baseline were associated with decreases in depression and increases in anxiety symptoms. We did not identify any further characteristics to be consistently associated with changes in depression and anxiety symptoms. Measurement of depression and anxiety symptoms at the start of a behavioural weight management programme and subsequent monitoring may facilitate timely psychological support if a deterioration in mental health is identified. Further research in large and diverse participant samples is required to clarify the findings and determine the underpinning mechanisms.</p>
