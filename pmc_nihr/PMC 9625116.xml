                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In the UK, during the study period (April to July, 2021), all contacts of people with COVID-19 were required to self-isolate for 10 days, which had adverse impacts on individuals and society. Avoiding the need to self-isolate for those who remain uninfected would be beneficial. We investigated whether daily use of lateral flow devices (LFDs) to test for SARS-CoV-2, with removal of self-isolation for 24 h if negative, could be a safe alternative to self-isolation as a means to minimise onward transmission of the virus.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial in adult contacts identified by COVID-19 contact tracing in England. Consenting participants were randomly assigned to self-isolation (single PCR test, 10-day isolation) or daily contact testing (DCT; seven LFD tests, two PCR tests, no isolation if negative on LFD); participants from a single household were assigned to the same group. Participants were prospectively followed up, with the effect of each intervention on onward transmission established from routinely collected NHS Test and Trace contact tracing data for participants who tested PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period and tertiary cases arising from their contacts (ie, secondary contacts). The primary outcome of the study was the attack rate, the percentage of secondary contacts (close contacts of SARS-CoV-2-positive study participants) who became COVID-19 cases (tertiary cases) in each group. Attack rates were derived from Bernoulli regression models using Huber-White (robust) sandwich estimator clustered standard errors. Attack rates were adjusted for household exposure, vaccination status, and ability to work from home. The non-inferiority margin was 1¬∑9%. The primary analysis was a modified intention-to-treat analysis excluding those who actively withdrew from the study as data from these participants were no longer held. This study is registered with the Research Registry (number 6809). Data collection is complete; analysis is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 29 and July 28, 2021, 54‚Äâ923 eligible individuals were enrolled in the study, with final group allocations (following withdrawals) of 26‚Äâ123 (52¬∑6%) participants in the DCT group and 23‚Äâ500 (47¬∑4%) in the self-isolation group. Overall, 4694 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (secondary cases), 2364 (10¬∑1%) in the self-isolation group and 2330 (8¬∑9%) in the DCT group. Adjusted attack rates (among secondary contacts) were 7¬∑5% in the self-isolation group and 6¬∑3% in the DCT group (difference of ‚Äì1¬∑2% [95% CI ‚Äì2¬∑3 to ‚Äì0¬∑2]; significantly lower than the non-inferiority margin of 1¬∑9%).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>DCT with 24 h exemption from self-isolation for essential activities appears to be non-inferior to self-isolation. This study, which provided evidence for the UK Government's daily lateral flow testing policy for vaccinated contacts of COVID-19 cases, indicated that daily testing with LFDs could allow individuals to reduce the risk of onward transmission while minimising the adverse effects of self-isolation. Although contacts in England are no longer required to isolate, the findings will be relevant for future policy decisions around COVID-19 or other communicable infections.</p>

From Aug 22, 2021, vaccinated contacts and individuals younger than 18¬∑5 years were no longer required to isolate, but unvaccinated adult contacts were required by legislation to self-isolate for 10 days from the date of their last exposure to the case.

                  <p id="para40">We searched Ovid MEDLINE, with no language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials published from database inception up to Jan 12, 2022. We used a combination of MeSH and free-text terms including those for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 combined with terms for lateral flow testing (eg, ‚Äúlateral flow‚Äù or ‚Äúrapid test*‚Äù or ‚Äúantigen* test*‚Äù or ‚Äúdaily adj3 test*‚Äù). We found no existing trials on the use of daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing as an alternative to self-isolation for contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases among the general population. Two previous feasibility and acceptability studies performed by the study team have demonstrated the potential benefits of daily testing of adult contacts of COVID-19 cases using either a single PCR test or a test-to-enable approach using daily LFD tests plus one PCR test as part of the contact tracing process in England. However, these studies were not designed to assess the risk of onward transmission.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">To our knowledge, we present the first randomised controlled trial in a general population of close contacts of COVID-19 cases to assess whether daily LFDs with 24 h exemption from self-isolation for essential activities following each negative LFD result is a safe alternative to self-isolation. By ascertaining the proportion of contacts of PCR-positive study participants who became tertiary cases in each group, we showed that daily contact testing (DCT) was a safe alternative to self-isolation regarding onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a difference in attack rates of ‚Äì1¬∑2% among contacts of secondary cases, indicating non-inferiority of DCT. Consistent with this finding, the number of observed tertiary cases per secondary case was 0¬∑14 in the DCT group and 0¬∑16 in the self-isolation group. Attack rates among contacts of DCT participants who had received two vaccine doses (&gt;14 days before recruitment) also showed non-inferiority compared with self-isolation-participants, suggesting that DCT would be of value among fully vaccinated people. Compliance with testing was high, with 80% of DCT participants submitting at least one LFD result.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a large impact on individuals and society. Developing public health interventions that mitigate both viral transmission and the wider impacts on health, wellbeing, prosperity, and society, including those arising from self-isolation, is essential. Our study demonstrates the potential benefits of daily testing while minimising the need for self-isolation. A cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted in English secondary schools and colleges conducted at the same time as this study found supervised daily LFD tests to be non-inferior to self-isolation for control of COVID-19 transmission in those settings, although the study did not measure secondary transmission. In December, 2021, based on evidence from both our study and the school-based study, the UK Government introduced daily lateral flow testing for fully (two-dose) vaccinated contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases as an alternative to isolation. Assessment of the impact of this policy change on onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 would provide further, real-world, evidence of the benefits and any potential harms of this strategy when used at national level.</p>

              <p id="para90">Strategies that target self-isolation more effectively to contacts who become infected, while allowing those without infection to continue with essential activities, would help individuals and society to return to greater normality while continuing to reduce onward transmission. Improving case ascertainment through the identification of asymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and presympromatic individuals could help to target isolation most effectively and, potentially, improve adherence to self-isolation guidance.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Asymptomatic, rapid antigenic testing using lateral flow devices (LFDs) for SARS-CoV-2 was widely available in the UK during the course of our study,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with low cost, rapid turnaround times, and delivery outside of a routine laboratory environment.

                <p id="para110">This study was a two-arm, non-blinded, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial using a non-inferiority margin of 1¬∑9%. This margin was derived from a previous, much smaller, pilot study<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> in which tertiary attack rates were 6¬∑3% in the DCT group and 8¬∑2% in the general population. Lower tertiary attack rates in the DCT group were the opposite of what was expected, but the study team considered that a 1¬∑9% higher percentage positive for DCT compared with self-isolation would indicate that DCT could be considered, in terms of infection control consequence, as not being inferior to self-isolation in the current study. Adults (‚â•18 years) who were vaccinated or unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, identified as contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and living in England, were offered participation in the study (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2‚Äì10</xref>). Participants were not eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: symptomatic at recruitment; under travel-associated quarantine; participating in a workplace DCT programme; resident in a prison or social care institution; a contact of a case with a variant of concern (between April 29 and June 7, 2021, only; removed after this date to ensure generalisability for the delta variant); or did not provide an email address. Participants were also excluded if no postage address was provided. If a participant had duplicate registrations (with an alternative contact tracing identification number) within 3 days from first registration, the duplicate registration was excluded.</p>
                <p id="para120">Individuals were recruited through the routine NHSTT contact tracing process and selected sequentially. Information on eligibility criteria was self-reported. Self-reported age, postcode, travel criteria, and whether they were a contact of a case with a variant of concern were confirmed using data collected by NHSTT during contact tracing. Recruitment was performed daily from April 29, 2021, until the sample size was reached (July 28, 2021), with eligible contacts invited to take part via recruitment phone calls or via SMS or emails containing a link to self-register online. There was no limit on daily recruitment; however, due to intermittent limitations in the number of study kits available, enrolment was restricted on June 26‚Äì29, July 3‚Äì12, and July 19‚Äì26, 2021. A subset of participants were interviewed after completing testing or self-isolation as part of a nested qualitative component to the study, which is reported elsewhere.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>

Simple randomisation without stratification was performed using an unpredictable allocation sequence at the point of consent based on a computer system-generated timestamp for each participant, with allocation generated by the study team and concealed from individuals performing recruitment.

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">Demographic data were collected at recruitment using a secure electronic questionnaire (Snap 11 Professional; Snap Surveys, London, UK) and downloaded twice daily to produce lists for test kit postage and messaging. Kits were posted via NHSTT home delivery channels. Within 24 h of recruitment, participants with a valid mobile number or email address were informed of their assigned study group and sent a link to a short, voluntary, anonymous baseline questionnaire. On day 7, a link was sent with a completion-of-study questionnaire. Reminder messages were sent after 48 h.</p>
                <p id="para160">Participants in both groups were asked to take a self-sample for PCR on the day of kit arrival and return it by post. DCT participants were provided with seven Innova LFD tests (Innova SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test; (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology, Fujian, China), which were widely used in the UK at the time of the study; participants were required to self-process tests using combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs.

Reported results were submitted to the national results database in compliance with infectious disease notification regulations. On reporting their first negative LFD test, DCT participants were assigned a flag in the NHSTT contact tracing system to prevent isolation checks and access to self-isolation support payments. A second PCR swab was requested for DCT participants on receipt of an LFD-positive result or on the day of their last LFD test (if all previous LFD tests were negative). All participants were legally required to self-isolate for 10 days if PCR-positive. No formal restrictions were placed on study participants in the DCT group during periods free from self-isolation; however, participants were advised to minimise contact and undertake only essential activities.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para170">The primary outcome was the attack rate, defined as the percentage of secondary contacts (close contacts of SARS-CoV-2-positive study participants) who became COVID-19 cases (tertiary cases) in each group. The aim was to establish whether DCT was non-inferior to self-isolation, using a non-inferiority margin of 1¬∑9% of the difference in percentages (self-isolation minus DCT).</p>
                <p id="para180">Secondary objectives of the study were to establish the feasibility and acceptability of each strategy by measuring uptake and compliance with testing, ascertaining the proportion of positive results, and describing the concordance of PCR and LFD results. These secondary outcomes will be reported separately in full. A further prespecified secondary outcome, described in the present report, was the number of days of exemption from isolation enabled by DCT. The present report also describes findings from the end-of-study questionnaire, which inquired about participant behaviours during the study period and participants' confidence in test accuracy. Results from an in-depth qualitative study performed with a subset of participants are published separately.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">With allowance for attrition and testing compliance, 40‚Äâ000 participants were required to generate 3170 secondary contacts based on a two-sided non-inferiority sample size calculation with a significance level of 0¬∑05, power of 80%, ratio of group sizes 1:1, design effect of 1¬∑2, and a non-inferiority margin of 1¬∑9%, using the ARTBIN<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> package in Stata (version 16.1). At the study midpoint, the sample size was inflated to 50‚Äâ000 to account for a lower-than-anticipated detection of SARS-CoV-2 in primary contacts, suspected to be related to vaccination.</p>
                <p id="para200">Data submitted to the study LFD portal and recruitment portal were analysed as of Aug 14, 2021, with PCR data analysed as of Sept 8, 2021. Data were analysed in Stata (version 15) and R Studio (version 4.0.5). Recruitment data were enriched using routinely collected NHSTT contact tracing data and deterministically linked to PCR results from national laboratory surveillance, study LFD results, and the national LFD result portal, and to immunisation data from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) using a combination of identifiers. PCR results from all participants were restricted to tests with a specimen date in the 90 days before recruitment (to adjust for extended PCR positivity) to 14 days after recruitment. Fully vaccinated and one-dose vaccinated individuals were defined as those vaccinated more than 14 days before recruitment. When NIMS vaccination status was unknown, self-reported vaccination status was used.</p>
                <p id="para210">Attack rates were derived from participants (primary contacts) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in the 2 days before and 14 days after recruitment (secondary cases). Participants were deterministically linked to case episodes in the NHSTT case management system, and their named close contacts identified. Potential transmission events were defined as contact records matched to a subsequent case record with symptom onset (test date if asymptomatic) between 2 days and 14 days (inclusive) after the exposure date. When the contact was in the household, the date of symptom onset (test date if asymptomatic) of the exposer was taken as the exposure date. When multiple case‚Äìcontact exposures could have resulted in transmission, rules-based prioritisation (preferring household exposures and most recent exposures) identified a single most likely potential transmission event. The attack rate was the proportion of contacts of participants (secondary contacts) that were identified as potential transmission events, leading to tertiary cases. Bernoulli regression models using Huber-White (robust) sandwich estimator clustered standard errors were used to account for the inflation due to participants being grouped within households. These were calculated in R (version 4.0.5) using the glm.cluster command from the miceadds package<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and the predictions and margins commands from the margins package. The primary analysis was a modified intention-to-treat analysis excluding those who actively withdrew from the study as data from these participants were no longer held (as per the public-facing data agreement). Those who did not submit a test were included in the analysis. The simplest unadjusted model used group as the only covariate. The second unadjusted model added household exposure and its interaction with group, while the third unadjusted model instead added vaccine status (zero or one doses; two doses) and its interaction. Adjusted versions of these models were obtained by adding household exposure, vaccine status, and ability to work from home. Interactions were tested for significance by Wald tests with a significance level of 0¬∑05. Sensitivity analyses restricted to (1) DCT participants who submitted LFD results to the study portal and self-isolation group participants who did not report LFD results to the study portal (as a proxy for compliance) and (2) the first household member recruited (to account for allocation to the same group for multiple household members), and with both restrictions, were performed. Alternative mixed effects models with household as random effect were performed and an independent unadjusted masked analysis was also performed. Full code can be provided on request.</p>
                <p id="para220">For both behavioural questionnaires, proportions were calculated among participants who provided a least one response to a question, and were compared using œá<sup>2</sup> tests. The second behavioural questionnaire was analysed as three groups: participants in the self-isolation group; participants in the DCT group who tested positive on LFD (hereafter referred to as DCT positive-test subgroup); and participants in the DCT group who did not test positive on LFD (hereafter referred to as DCT no-positive-test subgroup).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para360">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact on health and society, it is important to make efforts to reduce transmission. Although self-isolation of confirmed cases and their contacts can be effective, it is also disruptive for society and causes adverse impacts for individuals, given the practical, financial, and psychological challenges associated with sustained and repeated self-isolation. Our study was completed before the removal of all social restrictions in England. At the time, data were needed to develop innovative approaches to limit self-isolation to those infected with SARS-CoV-2, while allowing those without infection to return to greater normality.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Although previous studies had shown that DCT was acceptable to participants,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> these studies were not powered to assess the potential transmission risk to others.</p>
              <p id="para370">Here we present results of the first randomised controlled trial in a general population of close contacts of COVID-19 cases comparing standard self-isolation with DCT (with 24 h exemption from self-isolation after a negative LFD result). By ascertaining the proportion of contacts of PCR-positive study participants who became tertiary cases in each group, we demonstrated that DCT was a safe alternative to self-isolation regarding onwards transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a difference in attack rates of ‚Äì1¬∑2% among contacts of secondary cases, indicating non-inferiority of DCT. Consistent with this finding, the number of observed tertiary cases per secondary case was 0¬∑14 in the DCT group and 0¬∑16 in the self-isolation group. Attack rates among contacts of DCT participants who had received two vaccine doses (&gt;14 days before recruitment) also showed non-inferiority compared with self-isolation participants, with an adjusted difference between DCT and self-isolation groups (self-isolation as baseline) of ‚Äì1¬∑6%. This finding suggests that DCT would be of value among fully vaccinated people. Although there was some imbalance in the study groups due to household clustering, a sensitivity analysis restricted to the first person recruited also showed that DCT was non-inferior to self-isolation. Other sensitivity analyses adjusting for non-reporting of LFD results supported the plausibility of DCT non-inferiority.</p>
              <p id="para380">Although our study did not set out to change behaviour, individuals in the DCT group who reported only negative test results did not report significantly more contacts than those who were self-isolating, with the majority of contacts reported by participants in both groups being household contacts. It is possible that DCT might perform differently in the absence of social restrictions, when cases are likely to have a higher number of close contacts beyond the household.</p>
              <p id="para390">Compliance with testing was high in our study, with around 80% of DCT participants submitting at least one LFD result, higher than the 70¬∑2% observed in the pilot study.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Furthermore, 74¬∑0% of self-isolation participants and 79¬∑2% of DCT participants had at least one PCR test during the study, higher than the 40% return rate reported in a previous study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para400">DCT participants living in more socioeconomically deprived areas and those from minority ethnic backgrounds were less likely to report an LFD result, aligning with previous findings.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The ineligibility of DCT participants for isolation support payments might have resulted in lower compliance among participants in lower socioeconomic groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Before introducing any DCT policy, it will be important to engage with disadvantaged communities to further understand and address barriers to testing and reporting.</p>
              <p id="para410">The average number of close contacts reported was low (2¬∑7 contacts per case), consistent with the national experience.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Around 80% of secondary cases (participants who tested positive by PCR) provided details of their contacts to NHSTT, which was similar to figures for overall compliance with the contact tracing programme.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> During the study period, 30‚Äì50% of contacts notified to NHSTT in England were non-household contacts.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> This figure was substantially higher than the proportion of non-household contacts reported in the study for both groups (around 12%), with the number of non-household contacts per case nearly equivalent between groups. This lower number of non-household contacts might indicate increased caution, as described in a qualitative analysis,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> or ascertainment bias towards being early in the isolation period. Study participants were aware of their contact status before becoming cases and therefore might have had different behaviours to the general case population, which includes cases who were not previously aware of their contact status. Although additional freedom was offered to DCT participants, individuals in the DCT group were still advised to limit contact and that they should engage only in essential activities. Behavioural data suggest that DCT participants limited their contact with others and remained cautious in their behaviours despite enjoying additional freedom.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> For example, 57% of DCT participants reported having much less contact with people they did not live with in the last 7 days, compared with the week before, with only 11% of DCT participants reporting having much or slightly more contact. By contrast, around 80% of participants in both the self-isolation group and the DCT positive-test subgroup reported much less contact with non-household contacts, with compliance with self-isolation similar to estimates from a study conducted by the Office for National Statistics.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para420">The study was undertaken as part of real-life management of contacts of COVID-19 cases, providing evidence of the impact that a DCT policy would have, if introduced. More than 2 years since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic continues to have a substantial impact on individuals and society. Developing public health interventions that mitigate both viral transmission and the wider impacts on health, wellbeing, prosperity, and society, including those arising from self-isolation, is essential. This study shows the potential benefits of daily testing while minimising the need for self-isolation.</p>
              <p id="para430">The legal duty to self-isolate if testing positive for COVID-19 was removed in England from Feb 24, 2022,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and widespread public access to free PCR and LFD tests was removed on April 1, 2022, although free asymptomatic testing remained in place for some settings and groups until removed on Aug 31, 2022.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Public health guidance has remained in place during this time,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> encouraging those with symptoms or who have tested positive for COVID-19 using a test they have paid for to minimise contact with others, stay at home and work from home if possible, and exercise judgement about their personal risk and risk to others, particularly vulnerable individuals. Although testing rates and adherence to self-isolation substantially reduced in the weeks following the removal of the legal duty,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> a sizeable minority appear still to be taking steps to reduce the risks of COVID-19 transmission.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> LFD tests remain a valuable way that individuals can assess their infection status, and paid-for LFD tests are widely available. Although current public health guidance does not include the recommendation for individuals to test daily, the data presented in this paper support DCT as a viable strategy for future pandemic scenarios.</p>
              <p id="para440">The key strengths of this RCT include its large size, the real-life setting using existing contact tracing systems, and validity of the transmission measure due to the use of named contacts identified by their exposers. There are, however, some limitations. We relied on self-notification of close contacts, which could lead to underascertainment, particularly of non-household contacts. These limitations are also limitations of the existing contact tracing system. Furthermore, it was not possible to assess the risk of transmission beyond named close contacts. The attack rates should be considered minimum estimates because only contacts who access testing can subsequently be identified as a case and because, to avoid mismatching, the process to identify transmission was highly specific. Despite freedoms allowed, DCT participants were still advised to minimise contact and national restrictions were in place at the time of our study, which might have reduced likelihood of onward transmission. There was a skew in the DCT group towards individuals who were able to work from home, which again would limit opportunities for non-household transmission. Differences in the number of contacts within workplaces and non-household settings could not be fully explored in this work because of national COVID-19 restrictions in place during the study period. Findings might not be generalisable to children; however, other work has investigated DCT in schools.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para450">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated innovation in infectious diseases diagnostics, with an expansion of self-testing and high-volume rapid asymptomatic testing with the aim of reducing transmission. These approaches to testing could, in future, enable more dynamic monitoring of transmission patterns. Community engagement and participation in self-testing has been variable. Therefore, there is a need to develop rapid evaluation approaches that are co-produced with communities to ensure effective testing policies in future pandemics and epidemics.</p>
