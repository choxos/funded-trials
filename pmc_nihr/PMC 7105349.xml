                  <title>Context</title>
                  <p>GDF15 is a stress-induced hormone acting in the hindbrain that activates neural circuitry involved in establishing aversive responses and reducing food intake and body weight in animal models. Anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting are common manifestations of glucocorticoid deficiency, and we hypothesized that glucocorticoid deficiency may be associated with elevated levels of GDF15.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To determine the impact of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) and glucocorticoid replacement on circulating GDF15 levels.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Results</title>
                  <p>We measured circulating concentrations of GDF15 in a cohort of healthy volunteers and Addison’s disease patients following steroid withdrawal. Significantly higher GDF15 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was observed in the Addison’s cohort, 739.1 ± 225.8 pg/mL compared to healthy controls, 497.9 ± 167.7 pg/mL (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The effect of hydrocortisone replacement on GDF15 was assessed in 3 independent PAI cohorts with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia or Addison’s disease; intravenous hydrocortisone replacement reduced GDF15 in all groups. We examined the response of GDF15 to increasing doses of glucocorticoid replacement in healthy volunteers with pharmacologically mediated cortisol deficiency. A dose-dependent difference in GDF15 (mean ± SD) was observed between the groups with values of 491.0 ± 157.7 pg/mL, 427.0 ± 152.1 pg/mL and 360 ± 143.1 pg/mL, in the low, medium and high glucocorticoid replacement groups, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>GDF15 is increased in states of glucocorticoid deficiency and restored by glucocorticoid replacement. Given the site of action of GDF15 in the hindbrain and its effects on appetite, further study is required to determine the effect of GDF15 in mediating the anorexia and nausea that is a common feature of glucocorticoid deficiency.</p>

            <p>GDF15 (then called MIC-1) was first identified in 1997 as a novel transcript from a macrophage cell line and classified as a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, in humans, GDF15 is widely expressed with highest levels seen in placental trophoblasts followed by kidney, bladder, prostate, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, liver, and adipose tissue (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). GDF15 has been proposed as a marker of cellular stress with elevated circulating levels observed in a number of physiological and pathological states (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Conditions where increased circulating GDF15 have been reported include but are not limited to pregnancy, exercise, aging, renal failure, cardiac failure, chronic inflammatory disease, neoplasia, and mitochondrial diseases as well as cytotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Aligned with the view that GDF15 represents a marker of cellular stress, increased expression and secretion of GDF15 has been demonstrated when the cellular integrated stress response (ISR) pathway is activated (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) suggesting that GDF15 represents an endocrine arm of the cellular ISR. Key advances in our understanding of the functional biology of GDF15 have come from the observations that (i) overexpression of GDF15 in mice resulted in weight loss and reduced energy intake (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); (ii) GDF15 knockout mice have increased body mass and energy intake compared to wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>); and (iii) GDF15 seemingly mediates these effects on energy intake and body mass through the hind brain (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Subsequently, glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL) was identified as the ligand binding component of the heterodimeric receptor for GDF15 (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref>). GFRAL expression is highly specific to the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the hindbrain where it is required to mediate the weight lowering effects of GDF15. There is compelling evidence in rodents and non-human primates that manipulation of the GDF15-GFRAL pathway induces an anorectic effect (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref>). At present, evidence supporting the anorectic potential of GDF15 in humans is largely limited to observational studies. Increased GDF15 in a range of cancer types has been reported to associate with weight loss and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>). Similar associations have been observed in cardiac failure where higher GDF15 serves not only as a biomarker for mortality risk but there is an inverse relationship seen between GDF15 and body mass index (BMI) (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In chronic kidney disease (CKD), GDF15 is also predictive of mortality. Higher levels of GDF15 have been reported in dialysis patients who had protein energy wasting, while among CKD patients increasing tertiles of GDF15 are associated with decreasing BMI (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therapeutically targeting the GDF15–GFRAL axis has gained considerable attention in the management of anorexia and cachexia associated with cancer and other chronic diseases (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
            <p>However, it is not clear why a stress induced hormone such as GDF15 should primarily reduce energy intake. It has been proposed that GDF15 may have evolved originally to provide a signal to the organism that a harmful toxin has been ingested, with the brainstem-derived signal serving in the acute setting to reduce continued ingestion and in the longer term to avoidance upon future encounters (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In support of this hypothesis is genetic (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and biochemical (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) evidence in humans implicating GDF15 in the pathogenesis of the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, including hyperemesis gravidarum. Further, at least at pharmacological doses, recombinant GDF15 induces a conditioned taste aversion in rodents (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, the emetic potential of GDF15 was recently illustrated in response to administration of the peptide to musk shrews (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that GDF15 has aversive properties and this may underpin its effect on energy intake.</p>
            <p>Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is a rare condition with a reported prevalence of between 100 to 140 cases per million and represents a potentially life-threatening illness that is characterized by the impaired ability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Glucocorticoids are produced and secreted under the control of adrenocorticotropin and regulate a number of basal and stress-mediated physiological responses that include inflammatory, metabolic, and hemodynamic processes (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) while mineralocorticoids are under the regulation of the renin–angiotensin system and play a key role in fluid and electrolyte balance (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Although a number of different etiologies are responsible, patients with PAI share common clinical features attributable to deficiency of the respective steroid hormones (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To date, there are no reports on the effect of glucocorticoid deficiency on circulating GDF15. Among individuals diagnosed with PAI symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are reported in greater than two-thirds of those affected and responsive to hormone replacement (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In some instances, the severity of such symptoms has led to the misdiagnosis of PAI as anorexia nervosa (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) or presented as intractable vomiting (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We hypothesized that GDF15 would be increased in the setting of glucocorticoid deficiency and may contribute to the nausea/vomiting/anorexia phenotype frequently observed in adrenal insufficiency. To explore this, we measured circulating GDF15 in volunteers with PAI and pharmacologically induced glucocorticoid deficiency and determined its response to glucocorticoid replacement.</p>

This was a randomized cross-over, single-blinded trial including subjects with Addison’s disease who received in random order intravenous hydrocortisone infusion in isotonic saline in a circadian pattern or the same volume of isotonic saline for 22 hours, at least 2 weeks apart. Dosing of the hydrocortisone infusion was adapted from Kerrigan et al (32). The intravenous hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef) infusion was initiated from 0900h at starting at a dose of 0.024 mg/kg/h before being decreased gradually to achieve a dose of 0.008 mg/kg/h by 0000h, at which point the dose was increased to 0.03mg/kg/h and maintained until blood sampling at 0700h. Daily replacement doses of hydrocortisone were withdrawn for 17 hours prior to initiation of the infusion. Subjects omitted their usual fludrocortisone dose (when prescribed) the day before and during each intervention. Ten subjects (4 women and 6 men) with Addison’s disease with a mean ± SD age of 46.6 ± 9.4 years, BMI of 25.6 ± 2.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a median disease duration of 23.5 years (min–max, 1–33) were included in the study.

              <p>Our hypothesis that glucocorticoid may modulate GDF15 levels was based on two previous lines of evidence. First, glucocorticoids have been reported to reduce GDF15 gene expression (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Second, glucocorticoids have well established antiemetic properties, which are used clinically, particularly in the context of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both of which are known to cause elevations in circulating GDF15 (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Despite a paucity of research relating to the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting in adrenal insufficiency, it is well established that these symptoms are responsive to glucocorticoid replacement (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that circulating GDF15 levels are increased in patients with PAI temporarily deprived of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. In 3 independent cohorts, we demonstrated that short-term physiological glucocorticoid replacement in patients with different forms of PAI led to a reduction in circulating GDF15. Importantly, the relationship between glucocorticoid replacement and GDF15 appears to be dose dependent. Interestingly, GDF15 has been reported to have a diurnal rhythm with a peak at ~0000h and nadir at ~1200h (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Might this be entrained by the normal circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion? The findings in our study indicate that GDF15 levels were significantly lower when cortisol levels were artificially maintained at ~400 nmol/L (similar to physiological “peak” levels) vs ~150 nmol/L (similar to physiological “nadir” levels) is at least compatible with this hypothesis. The time lag between peak cortisol and the nadir of GDF15 would be expected if cortisol is having an effect on GDF15 gene expression. Further insight may be gained from the measurement of circulating GDF15 levels in human populations with disrupted circadian rhythms.</p>
              <p>Although we did not directly address the issue in these studies it is interesting to speculate whether GDF15 might play a role in the well-established effects of glucocorticoids on appetite and energy intake outside the setting of adrenal insufficiency, including, for example, in states of endogenous or pharmacological glucocorticoid excess (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These effects of glucocorticoids accumulate with time. However, a limitation of our studies is that we only studied acute manipulations of glucocorticoids and for ethical reasons we could only study patients with short-term withdrawal of therapy. An additional limitation of our studies is that we did not formally address the contribution of mineralocorticoid deficiency to GDF15 levels and the CAH cohort continued to take prescribed mineralocorticoid replacement during the study. However, it is worth noting that anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting are characteristic features of untreated isolated adrenocorticotropin deficiency, a condition that selectively lowers glucocorticoid (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) rather than mineralocorticoid levels.</p>
              <p>Despite pharmacological replacement of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies, concerns remain regarding quality of life, cardiometabolic and bone health among patients affected by PAI (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In clinical practice there is considerable heterogeneity in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement regimens used to treat PAI (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). These observations fuel interest in determining the optimal glucocorticoid replacement strategy of patients with PAI (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) as the current empiric approaches particularly to glucocorticoid dosing cannot account for the many factors which influence hormone action at its target tissue. Our study did not extend to exploring the tissue/s from which increased circulating GDF15 was produced. In principle GDF15 may be considered as target tissue derived circulating biomarker of glucocorticoid exposure. In practice, however, the utility of GDF15 as a biomarker of tissue exposure to glucocorticoid is likely hampered by the fact GDF15 is also influenced by a wide range of physiological and pathological states. This was exemplified in one participant in the pharmacologically induced glucocorticoid deficiency cohort (Participant no. 6 (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>)) who did not modulate their GDF15 level in response to increasing doses of hydrocortisone unlike the other participants.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that circulating GDF15 levels are elevated in untreated PAI patients compared to matched healthy controls and that glucocorticoid replacement corrects the elevated GDF15 levels. GDF15 responds to glucocorticoid replacement in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation of the causal nature of the relationship between glucocorticoid deficiency, elevated circulating levels of GDF15 and symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting is warranted. Such studies should be facilitated in the near future by the availability of humanized monoclonal antibodies designed to block GDF15 action.</p>
