                <p><italic>Introduction</italic>. We describe our experience of using the Medical Research Council framework on complex interventions to guide the development and evaluation of an intervention to prevent obesity by modifying infant feeding behaviours.<italic> Methods</italic>. We reviewed the epidemiological evidence on early life risk factors for obesity and interventions to prevent obesity in this age group. The review suggested prevention of excess weight gain in bottle-fed babies and appropriate weaning as intervention targets; hence we undertook systematic reviews to further our understanding of these behaviours. We chose theory and behaviour change techniques that demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in altering dietary behaviours. We subsequently developed intervention materials and evaluation tools and conducted qualitative studies with mothers (intervention recipients) and healthcare professionals (intervention deliverers) to refine them. We developed a questionnaire to assess maternal attitudes and feeding practices to understand the mechanism of any intervention effects.<italic> Conclusions</italic>. In addition to informing development of our specific intervention and evaluation materials, use of the Medical Research Council framework has helped to build a generalisable evidence base for early life nutritional interventions. However, the process is resource intensive and prolonged, and this should be taken into account by public health research funders.

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>While the aetiology of obesity has been simplified to an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure over a prolonged period, the psychological, social, physiological, environmental, and other factors causing this imbalance are complex [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A complex problem does not always necessitate a complex intervention, but complex interventions, targeting multiple causal factors and the interactions between them, may be necessary [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Complex interventions are often not systematically developed, specified, or reported [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Following a systematic process in the development and evaluation of a complex intervention may help in understanding the processes underlying any observed intervention effects and for whom and in which settings interventions work, to inform and improve the development, evaluation, and implementation of future interventions.</p>
              <p>To address some of the complexities in defining, developing, and evaluating complex interventions, a number of frameworks have been proposed. These include Intervention Mapping [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], RE-AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Precede-Proceed [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Logic Models [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More recently, the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions originally published in 2000 [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and updated in 2008 [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] has been recommended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The 2000 MRC framework suggested a model based on the phases conventionally used in the evaluation of new drugs—from initial preclinical research through to postmarketing surveillance [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The updated 2008 MRC framework provides a more flexible, less linear model of the process with greater attention to early phase piloting and development work [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>The aim of this paper is to describe our experience of using the 2008 MRC framework to develop and evaluate a theory-based, behavioural infant feeding intervention aimed at preventing childhood obesity, including benefits and challenges of using this framework.</p>

                  <p><italic>Review of the Epidemiological Evidence for Early Life Risk Factors Contributing to Childhood Obesity</italic>. The review highlighted the importance of excess energy intake resulting in excess weight gain during infancy [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], formula-feeding, and poor weaning practices in the development of obesity [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Randomised trials in small-for-gestational age and preterm infants showed that greater dietary energy content increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease in later life [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 2004, the World Health Organization and other international bodies reduced the recommended average energy requirements (AER) for infants by around 15 to 20% [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and these energy requirements form the basis of the Baby Milk intervention. Babies who are fed formula-milk are more likely to show rapid weight gain during infancy than breastfed babies [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], possibly as a result of higher energy intake. In addition their mothers have a number of demographic characteristics that are associated with obesity risk (lower age, education, and socioeconomic status) and hence the intervention targets formula-fed babies (54% at 1 week age and 77% at 6 weeks age in UK [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) through their mothers.</p>
                  <p><italic>Systematic Review of Parent's Experiences of Bottle-Feeding. </italic>Having identified formula-fed babies as a high-risk group and excess energy intake amongst this group as a potential target for intervention, we sought to increase our understanding of the behaviours associated with excess energy intake by conducting a systematic review of the quantitative and qualitative literature around parents' experiences of bottle-feeding [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The review suggested that mothers who bottle-fed experienced negative emotions such as guilt, anger, worry, uncertainty, and a sense of failure. This emphasised the need for our intervention to be delivered with empathy and in a collaborative participant-centred style. Mothers reported receiving little information on bottle-feeding and did not feel empowered to make decisions. Mistakes in feed preparation and frequent formula-milk changes were common.</p>
                  <p><italic>Systematic Review of Determinants of Early Weaning. </italic>We undertook a systematic review of the determinants of early weaning and inappropriate introduction of cow's milk to increase our understanding of why parents do not follow infant feeding recommendations [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Strong evidence was found for six maternal determinants of early weaning: young age, low education and socioeconomic status, absence/short duration of breastfeeding, smoking, and lack of information or advice from healthcare providers. The results of this review mirror the much larger body of evidence on determinants of breastfeeding [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of these determinants, improving the advice and support given by healthcare providers appeared to be the area most amenable to intervention in the short term.</p>
                  <p><italic>Systematic Review of Interventions to Prevent Obesity in Young Children. </italic>A 2011 Cochrane review on interventions to prevent obesity in children and adolescents identified 55 studies [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Only eight of these were targeting children aged 0–5 years and these studies showed the largest intervention effects, but none were specific to infancy. A search for “childhood obesity prevention” trials listed on registers of active and archived controlled trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">http://www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>) was conducted and nine trials in this age group were identified [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However none of them targeted energy intake from formula-milk, the focus of the baby milk intervention.</p>

                <sec id="sec2.1.2">
                  <title>2.1.2. Identifying/Developing Appropriate Theory</title>
                  <p>A number of psychological factors (e.g., beliefs and emotions) and environmental factors are involved in learning new behaviours and changing existing behaviours. Theories or models provide an overarching framework for the psychological and environmental factors that explain behaviours to be targeted by an intervention. As there were no behavioural interventions specifically targeting formula-milk feeding, this stage included a review of the literature on psychological theories and behaviour change techniques that had shown some success in improving dietary behaviours. </p>
                  <p><italic>Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). </italic>We identified Bandura's social cognitive theory [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as a useful theory to inform mediators along the hypothesised causal pathways of intervention effects. The theory has been shown to predict other dietary behaviours, including fruit and vegetable intake in children [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and has been used to develop interventions to improve breastfeeding practices [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and dietary behaviours in adults [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
                  <p>The key constructs of SCT are as follows.</p>
                  <p><italic>Perceived Self-Efficacy</italic>. This refers to a person's belief or confidence in their ability to successfully perform a specific task or behaviour. High perceived self-efficacy is related to a feeling of being “<italic>in control</italic>” and a belief that “<italic>I will be able to continue to perform the behaviour even in the face of difficult obstacles or stressful situations.</italic>” </p>
                  <p><italic>Outcome Expectancies</italic>. These are person's thoughts or beliefs about the results or consequences of certain behaviour. Outcome expectancies can be either positive or negative and may be related to physical, social, and self-evaluative outcomes, that is, outcomes related to physical health, feedback from others, and feelings about oneself.</p>
                  <p><italic>Sociostructural Factors</italic>. Environmental factors are referred to as sociostructural factors. These include all the factors outside of the person that might affect their ability to perform the target behaviour but are not necessarily beyond the person's control. An example of a sociostructural facilitator might be a local support group. A sociostructural barrier might be a grandparent or child minder unwilling to follow recommendations. Hence, the identification of barriers and facilitators for performance of the behaviour are techniques used in the intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                  <p><italic>Implementation Intentions (IIs). </italic>While SCT is promising in terms of strengthening motivation, it has been shown that good intentions do not always translate to behaviour change; hence we added implementation intentions (IIs). IIs have been shown to bridge the gap between motivation and action [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. They commit an individual to a specific course of action when certain environmental conditions (barriers or facilitators) are met. The environment therefore acts as a cue to action and helps the individual to achieve their goal. IIs are “if…then…plans” specifying when, where, and how the person will act on their intentions and perform the behaviour and link the behaviour to specific cues [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
                  <p><italic>Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs). </italic>While theories provide a framework to understand how behaviours targeted in the intervention change, behaviour change techniques (BCTs) constitute the active content of interventions. We selected behaviour change techniques (BCTs) informed by the theoretical basis of our intervention (SCT and IIs) with evidence of effectiveness in changing dietary behaviours [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We used Abraham and Michie's taxonomy [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to define the BCTs and operationalize them as intervention strategies in the intervention protocols (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The intervention aims to encourage parents to reduce the amount of formula-milk feeds, recognise infant satiety cues, not to respond to nonhunger related fussiness by feeding, wean babies onto a healthy diet, and recognise if their babies are gaining excess weight. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3"> Table 3</xref> summarises the contacts during which core intervention contents are used.</p>
                  <p><italic>Qualitative Studies. </italic>Following initial development of the intervention, qualitative studies were conducted to assess the acceptability and feasibility of intervention delivery and appropriate changes to the intervention materials were made. Psychologists, dieticians, and doctors were interviewed and in addition, interviews and focus groups were conducted with relevant stakeholders-mothers (recipients of the intervention) and healthcare providers (health visitors and midwives who would deliver the intervention). An iterative process was used to refine the intervention [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. One example of how this work informed intervention development is that “healthy growth” rather than “obesity prevention” was emphasised in the resources and communication messages. Furthermore, mention of breastfeeding being best was removed as mothers said this was not appropriate for a formula-feeding intervention. The studies also highlighted the need for repeated contacts delivered in an empathic, nonjudgemental, client-centred communication style and supported by written materials.</p>

                  <p>A causal modelling approach [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was used to link behavioural determinants causally through behaviour to physiological variables and health outcomes.

                  <p>While validated measures existed to assess most variables along the causal pathway, we had to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess changes in the key behavioural determinants targeted by the intervention (maternal attitudes, SCT constructs targeted by the intervention, and milk feeding behaviour) [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The questionnaire showed good reliability (% agreement above 70% for 51/57 items, Kappas 0.37–1) and reasonable validity (% agreement above 66% for 39/57 items) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas 0.51, 0.79, and 0.90 for self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and intention, resp.). Development of the questionnaire also influenced our thinking about intervention content.</p>

                  <p>Once developed, all the intervention materials were piloted by the intervention facilitators (trained to deliver the intervention) to ensure that the intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver. An extensive training manual and a two-day training programme in the evidence base underlying the intervention, theories, behaviour change techniques, intervention strategies, and communication skills, including demonstration and practice with individual feedback, were piloted and adapted. For example, we initially developed long versions of intervention protocols, however, during piloting, it became clear that it was difficult for intervention facilitators to use these and we developed shorter versions with key aspects of delivery. We piloted and refined checklists for each contact with intervention and control participants to be used by the intervention facilitators to assess and promote fidelity of intervention delivery (i.e., consistent delivery across facilitators and time). For the control group participants (attention control), in order to avoid contamination, we designed protocols with questions for each contact which were organised around broad themes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                  <p>A 1-year pilot study (March 2011–March 2012) among 78 participants provided the opportunity to engage with local providers of postnatal and primary care services in order to optimise methods for recruitment, to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the trial measures, estimate expected retention rates, and plan the resources needed for an explanatory RCT. We did not analyse the results of the pilot feasibility study separately as it continued into the full trial.</p>

                  <title>2.2.2. Estimating Recruitment and Retention</title>
                  <p>Our initial strategy to identify participants was to approach parents who were formula-feeding their baby before eight weeks of age via postnatal (midwives) and community health professionals (health visitors). To this end we spoke with midwives, infant feeding coordinators, and health visitors at their team meetings. Although this did not prove a very effective route for recruitment, partly due to the time pressures and conflicting priorities that these health professionals are faced with, it did help to raise awareness of the study and allowed us to collect information on ways to optimise recruitment and retention. For example, we extended the age of recruitment to 14 weeks, expanded our recruitment area, and offered easily accessible local clinics and/or home visit appointments.</p>
                  <p>After investigating a number of other strategies to identify participants including posters in health centres and children's centres, pharmacies, charity groups, and a local press release, we successfully applied for ethics approval for named members of our own research team to approach bottle-feeding mothers on postnatal wards directly. Since all babies are seen by their GPs for a six-week check, we also approached GPs for help with recruitment. In addition, participants were identified through the central health electronic database where a record of whether mothers were breastfeeding or bottle-feeding was made by their health visitor and a recruitment leaflet mailed to them. This multilevel approach from different professionals at different times during the first three months of infant age seemed to work well and indicated feasibility of recruitment. We did not offer any financial incentives but this could be a more effective way of recruiting, especially the hard-to-reach group and could be considered in future studies. Ongoing data on retention was monitored and barriers to retention identified.</p>

In order to assess true “intervention” effects, we decided the control group should get the same attention as the intervention group (attention control) and offered standard advice. Due to the paucity of research in this area, in addition to assessing whether the intervention was effective, we conducted a process evaluation to improve our understanding of the determinants of infant feeding behaviours, potential causal mechanisms underlying any intervention effects observed, implementation of this complex intervention, and contextual factors [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>

                <title>3.1. Main Findings</title>
                <p>Use of the 2008 MRC framework has helped develop a theory- and evidence-based intervention, to specify a proposed causal pathway to change infant feeding behaviour and growth outcomes, to pilot the intervention and study procedures in order to address the main uncertainties, and to design an explanatory RCT evaluation. Careful attention to the design of the RCT means the results not only will generate evidence about the effectiveness of a replicable intervention but also will allow us to begin to elucidate the processes by which change is achieved (or why it is not). Evaluations that take account of complexity of interventions could explain outcomes better even in the absence of intervention effectiveness [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>

The greater emphasis on piloting and feasibility testing in the revised MRC framework is a strength as, in our experience, intervention content and materials, evaluation tools, and recruitment strategies were significantly improved through this process.</p>

                <title>3.4. Limitations of This Study/Framework</title>
                <p>Using the MRC framework posed a number of challenges, the biggest being the time and resources needed. Significant resources go into the development of pharmacological and other biomedical interventions, but the development of public health interventions which do not involve the generation of intellectual property does not receive such funding. This should be something funding bodies need to consider if public health interventions are to follow the same rigorous development and evaluation process that is used in drug development. With the current model of funding, it is very difficult for researchers in most countries to use the framework due to the timescales and resources required. Consequently the evidence base may be skewed towards “high income” countries where resources for development work may be more readily available. It could be argued that the process could be shortened and some of the stages omitted, especially if the evidence-base for what is likely to work is strong. Future evidence synthesis could focus on whether studies using the MRC framework are more effective than those not using it or using other frameworks.</p>
