                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Automated systems for ventilator management to date have been either fully heuristic rule-based systems or based on a combination of simple physiological models and rules. These have been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in simple to wean patients. At present, there are no published studies that evaluate the effect of systems that use detailed physiological descriptions of the individual patient.</p>
                  <p>The BEACON Caresystem is a model-based decision support system that uses mathematical models of patientsâ physiology in combination with models of clinical preferences to provide advice on appropriate ventilator settings. An individual physiological description may be particularly advantageous in selecting the appropriate therapy for a complex, heterogeneous, intensive care unit (ICU) patient population.</p>

                  <p>Intenive Care weaning (iCareWean) is a single-blinded, multicentre, prospective randomised control trial evaluating management of mechanical ventilation as directed by the BEACON Caresystem compared with that of current care, in the general intensive care setting. The trial will enrol 274 participants across multiple London National Health Service ICUs. The trial will use a primary outcome of duration of mechanical ventilation until successful extubation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Optimising mechanical ventilator management has been the focus of much research, seeking to decrease ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury, ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory muscle atrophy and patient discomfort.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Increased duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged weaning increases the number of these complications with a vicious cycle that leads to increased morbidity and mortality and associated economic costs.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Protocols and computerised tools aiming to reduce length of mechanical ventilation might therefore be beneficial.</p>
              <p>Weaning protocols and nurse-lead ventilator management is routinely used in the intensive care setting.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Such approaches have been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, standardising this process is important, and the quality and quantity of nursing care are a critical factor in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Standardisation of care through automation or bedside decision support continues to be driven by novel technological innovation, some of which is already established in clinical practice.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5</xref> However, to date, much of this has been predicated on clinical guidelines rather than using detailed physiological descriptions of the individual patient.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref> A Cochrane review of weaning trials with current systems concluded that their use may reduce duration of weaning, but highlighted that the population was predominantly composed of those who are âsimple to weanâ.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The patient populations of these studies were characterised as without additional lung pathology and were predominantly ventilated for periods of less than 48âhours.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Consequently, it remains to be investigated whether decision support systems can reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with more than a few hours of âroutineâ postoperative intubation. The BEACON Caresystem is a model-based decision support system that uses mathematical models of patientsâ physiology in combination with models of clinical preferences to provide advice on appropriate ventilator settings.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An individual physiological description may be particularly advantageous in selecting the appropriate therapy for a complex, heterogeneous, intensive care unit (ICU) patient population. The BEACON Caresystem is the commercial version of the INVENT system, which has been retrospectively evaluated in postoperative cardiac patients and patients with severe lung disease, and prospectively evaluated in providing advice on correct levels of inspired oxygen.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â13</xref> To date, the commercial system has been evaluated over short durations of time from 4 to 8âhours to establish whether physiological measurements are improved.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> No previous studies evaluating outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation have been performed.</p>
              <p>Here, we describe a single-blinded multicentre randomised control trial evaluating management of mechanical ventilation as directed by the BEACON Caresystem compared with that of current care in the general intensive care setting.</p>

                <title>Description of the BEACON Caresystem</title>
                <p>At the core, functionality of the BEACON Caresystem is a set of physiological models including models of pulmonary gas exchange, acidâbase chemistry, lung mechanics and respiratory drive.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The BEACON Caresystem tunes these models to the individual patient so that they accurately describe the current physiological measurements. Once the models are tuned, they are then used by the system to simulate the effects of a change in ventilator settings. The results of these simulations are then used to calculate the clinical benefit of changing the ventilator settings by balancing the competing goals of mechanical ventilation using mathematical models of clinical preference.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Appropriate ventilator settings imply a balance between quantified preferences of several competing clinical goals. For oxygenation, the preferred values of inspired oxygen fraction are weighed against the need to prevent hypoxaemia. For settings of ventilation volume, pressures or frequency, the risk of lung trauma is weighed against the need to prevent acidosis. For settings of support in spontaneously breathing patients, the risk of respiratory muscle atrophy on over support is weighed against the excessive work of breathing and potential of respiratory muscle fatigue on under support. Quantification of these risks is used to calculate a total score for any possible ventilator strategy. The system then calculates advice so as to change ventilator settings to improve this score.</p>
                <p>The BEACON Caresystem functions as an âopen-loopâ system. This means that the advice provided by the system is presented to the clinician. The ventilator settings are then changed by the clinician, and the patientâs response to these changes is automatically registered and used by the BEACON Caresystem to retune the physiological models and repeat the process of generating new advice.</p>
                <p>The BEACON Caresystem provides advice on ventilator settings including the following. Values for maximal advice steps are given in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

                  <title>Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT)</title>
                  <p>During weaning from mechanical ventilation, the BEACON Caresystem monitors the levels of Pressure Support (PS) and Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). When these levels are reduced to values below clinical guideline thresholds,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the BEACON Caresystem automatically monitors variables evaluating spontaneous breathing criteria. If these remain within limits and for a duration determined by international guidelines,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the system prompts the user to assess the appropriateness of extubation and provides a checklist to help. The primary function of the BEACON Caresystem with regards weaning is to reduce levels of support where possible; it does not suggest an active SBT or extubation. As such, the decision to extubate is according to standard clinical practice for both arms of the study, meaning that at any time the clinical team can perform an active SBT or extubate the patient without confirmation from the system. Reintubation is documented by the research team and the participant enters a standard care pathway, which involves the deactivation of the BEACON Caresystem. The participant is then followed up until the end of the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>
                  <p>The protocol ends with transfer or discharge from ICU or death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical considerations</title>
                <p>Sample size was determined by a power analysis of duration of mechanical ventilation. Extrapolation of the 2016 ICU admission data from two London-based NHS hospitals provided a sample size of 548 patients over an 18-month period. In these patients, mean total duration of mechanical ventilation measured in days was 7.2, with an SD of 7.0 days. A study population of 137 patients in each randomisation group would allow detection of a 2âday or 30% improvement in the duration of mechanical ventilation in the BEACON Caresystem group assuming a similar improvement in SD, with an Î± level of 0.05 and power of 0.8. A 2âdays or 30% reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation is similar to that used previously.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
                <p>Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured across the protocol duration and comparison made by independent samples t-test, or appropriate non-parametric testing if not normally distributed. Complementary analysis will be performed using Kaplan-Meier curves.</p>
                <p>The study is not sufficiently powered to allow subgroup analysis for the groups specified in the randomisation strategy.</p>
                <p>An independent data safety monitoring committee will be established as part of the study, with this committee responsible for defining stopping criteria. Safety data will be looked at after the first 80 patients have been recruited, with an interim analysis performed following 50% recruitment.</p>

                      <p>The risks of changing each of the ventilator settings have been considered individually. Low values of inspiratory pressure or volume can result in reduction of minute ventilation and increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> and consequently a fall in arterial pH. To assess this, CO<sub>2</sub> is monitored continuously by the BEACON Caresystem using capnography. High values of inspiratory pressure can result in lung damage. Peak inspiratory pressure is monitored continuously by the BEACON Caresystem, and all mechanical ventilators provide alarms at high values. Low values of respiratory frequency have no apparent detriment other than those specified in reduction of volume. High values of respiratory frequency can result in air trapping. The maximum step in respiratory frequency is limited to 3 breaths/min if the current frequency is â¥18 allowing the onset of trapping to be identified clinically.</p>

                      <p>Although there are small long-term risks associated with increasing inspiratory oxygen due to absorption atelectasis or oxygen toxicity, the major acute risk of changes in inspired oxygenation is arterial hypoxaemia. If the current SpO<sub>2</sub> â¤92%, then the maximum reduction in FiO<sub>2</sub> is limited to 2%. In addition, pulse oximetry is monitored continuously by the BEACON Caresystem during the study and an alarm sounded if levels are â¤90%.</p>

The majority of the trial population lack the capacity to consent. Therefore, participant information sheets and advice are requested from a third party acting as a consultee; in most cases, this person will be a personal consultee, who is someone who knows the person lacking capacity and is able to advise the researcher about that personâs wishes and feelings in relation to the project and whether they should join the research. However, where the personal consultee is not available, the researcher may nominate a professional person to assist in determining the participation of a person who lacks capacity. A nominated professional consultee will be appointed by the researcher to provide advice regarding the patientâs suitability to participation in the research. In the event that a personal consultee is identified after the nominated professional consultee advice has been obtained, the above process for personal consultee declaration will be followed. A patient information sheet will be distributed immediately following the patient being identified as eligible for the study. If a surviving patient regains capacity, they will be approached by the research team to obtain their consent to continue in the study. If the patient refuses consent or withdraws, the intervention will be stopped but the regular/expected medical care will still be provided. Without consent, no additional information about the patient will be collected for the purposes of the study. However, to maintain integrity of the randomised trial, all information collected up to that time will still be used and analysed as part of the study.</p>

              <p>This paper presents the study protocol of single-blinded multicentre randomised control trial evaluating management of mechanical ventilation as directed by the BEACON Caresystem compared with that of standard care in the general intensive care setting. To test the hypothesis that following advice from the BEACON Caresystem will reduce time to successful extubation, patients are randomised to care including advice from the system, or standard care. In addition, as secondary outcomes, the study will investigate whether application of the advice changes the time spent in control ventilation modes, the number of changes made to the ventilator, the use of medication such as sedative or neuromuscular blocking agents, the changes in clinical procedures such as reintubation or tracheostomy and clinical and physiological status of the patient. Although not powered to detect differences between groups, it will also investigate the length of stay at the ICU and patient mortality.</p>
              <p>This study is the next step in evaluation of the advice of the BEACON Caresystem. A large number of studies have been performed validating the physiological models included in the system, as summarised in,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and studies of short duration have been performed evaluating the physiological response to application of advice.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> This use of the system over the whole duration of ICU stay allows for assessment of more meaningful clinical outcomes, relating to the time spent on mechanical ventilation. In addition, the study includes only patients intubated for a minimum of 24âhours, meaning that short-term postoperative patients who may have rather uncomplicated intubation periods are not included.</p>
              <p>The study includes limitations. The study was powered on duration of mechanical ventilation rather than duration to successful ventilation, this being the historical data available during study design. The study is not powered to detect changes in mortality, and does not follow-up on the patients after transfer from the ICU. In the context of this study, successful extubation is defined as the lack of need for non-invasive ventilator support for 48âhours after extubation, rather than successful rehabilitation of the patient subsequent to their ICU stay.</p>
              <p>The results of this study compare care provided with the systemâs advice with current clinical practice at study sites. As there is no standard of care or usual method of weaning in the UK, this study does not compare the systemâs advice with that of best practice defined by clinical guidelines. To avoid comparing two interventional changes, no attempt will be made to standardise care in the control arm according to best practice.</p>
              <p>As patients are studied for many days, it is not possible to store continuous waveform data for all patients at all times. Systematic analysis of patient-ventilator asynchrony will not therefore be possible.</p>
              <p>This study excluded patients if ventilated for &lt;24âhours. In doing so, patients ventilated post surgery defined previously as simple to wean are not included. This should not imply that the patients studied here are necessarily difficult to wean, but rather that they represent a broad cross section of mechanically ventilated patients not simply recovering from the effects of anaesthesia.</p>
              <p>In addition, it is important to note that substantial training has been provided to all sites in the use of the BEACON Caresystem and the same clinical team treat patients for both the control and intervention arm. It is possible then that both training and use of the system influence routine care, potentially biasing study results.</p>
              <p>This paper describes the study protocol of a randomised control trial evaluating the advice of the BEACON Caresystem in a general medical ICU population. This protocol represents an important step evaluating the use of advice over the whole of the ICU stay, and only in patients intubated greater than 24âhours. The results will indicate whether the BEACON Caresystem is a useful tool in optimising ventilation strategy.</p>
