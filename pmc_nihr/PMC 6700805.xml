                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) affects up to 4% of the general population. Symptoms include frequent, loose, or watery stools with associated urgency, resulting in marked reduction of quality of life and loss of work productivity. Ondansetron, a 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, has had an excellent safety record for over 20 years as an antiemetic, yet is not widely used in the treatment of IBS-D. It has, however, been shown to slow colonic transit and in a small randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study, benefited patients with IBS-D.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This trial is a phase III, parallel group, randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled trial, with embedded mechanistic studies. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 400) meeting Rome IV criteria for IBS-D will be recruited from outpatient and primary care clinics and by social media to receive either ondansetron (dose titrated up to 24 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Throughout the trial, participants will record their worst abdominal pain, worst urgency, stool frequency, and stool consistency on a daily basis.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary endpoint is the proportion of “responders” in each group, using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. Secondary endpoints include pain intensity, stool consistency, frequency, and urgency. Mood and quality of life will also be assessed.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Mechanistic assessments will include whole gut transit, faecal tryptase and faecal bile acid concentrations at baseline and between weeks 8 and 11. A subgroup of participants will also undergo assessment of sensitivity (<italic>n</italic> = 80) using the barostat, and/or high-resolution colonic manometry (<italic>n</italic> = 40) to assess motor patterns in the left colon and the impact of ondansetron.</p>

              <title>Background and rationale</title>
              <p id="Par37">Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which affects around 10% of the population, accounts for 1.8 million consultations per year in primary care in England and Wales. Around one third of these patients meet criteria for IBS with diarrhoea (IBS-D). Symptoms include frequent, loose, or watery stools with associated urgency, which can severely limit socialising, travelling, and eating out. This can lead to a marked reduction in quality of life and loss of work productivity. When patients with IBS are asked to rank symptoms in order of importance, erratic bowel habit is rated first, followed by abdominal pain and, for those with diarrhoea, urgency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This can often be associated with incontinence, which is socially debilitating, but often under-reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">Current treatments for patients with IBS-D such as loperamide reduce bowel frequency, but do not improve abdominal pain, and often lead to constipation. The lack of effective treatments results in frequent referrals to secondary care, and such patients represent a significant proportion of gastroenterology outpatients.</p>
              <p id="Par39">A previous meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] showed that the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs) alosetron and cilansetron benefited such patients, improving stool consistency, and reducing both frequency and urgency of defaecation. However, these drugs had serious side effects, including constipation in 25% of patients and, rarely, ischaemic colitis (1 in 700). Alosetron was initially withdrawn and now is available in the USA only, through risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and is not available in Europe. Cilansetron never came to market, while ramosetron, another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is only available in Japan where it is licensed for IBS-D, with several good-quality trials confirming its benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Ondansetron is a widely used 5HT<sub>3</sub>RA that, unlike alosetron, has not been associated with ischaemic colitis. A pilot randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial showed that 5 weeks of ondansetron was effective in improving diarrhoea and urgency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently we do not understand exactly how it works, nor can we predict the individual dose required for optimum effect, which varies widely. One key effect we found, also seen with other 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], was a marked reduction in urgency, which may be important in improving quality of life in patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Potential mechanisms of action of 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists</title>
                <p id="Par41">The 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs slow colonic transit, an effect we found particularly marked in the left colon and the rectosigmoid region of patients with IBS-D, but the underlying mechanism was unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Previous studies of the impact of 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs on human colonic motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showed that the 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs alosetron and cilansetron increased peri-prandial frequency of colonic contractions, and mean amplitude of contractions in the left colon. We hypothesise that 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs increase retrograde sigmoid motility, perhaps enhancing “brake” function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which would be a novel mode of action. In our pilot study we showed the decrease in urgency correlated directly with the reduction in faecal protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but whether this represents a true causal relationship or just an epiphenomenon is unclear. Faecal proteases have been shown to be increased in IBS-D and, at least in animal models, cause hypersensitivity to rectal distension via activation of protease activated receptors type 2 (PAR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We have shown that most faecal proteases are endogenous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], representing pancreatic enzymes that have escaped degradation by colonic bacteria. We hypothesise that slowing gut transit reduces faecal protease, by allowing time for bacterial degradation, and that this may also contribute to the beneficial effects of ondansetron. This might also improve the anal soreness that is commonly reported by patients with IBS-D. Bile acids have also been shown to sensitise the rectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and elevated faecal bile acids have been identified by several groups in patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Slowing transit may increase the time for bile acid deconjugation by colonic bacteria, and therefore enhance absorption, but how important this is in reducing rectal sensitivity, compared with the effects on faecal proteases, is unclear.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist sensitivity</title>
                <p id="Par42">We have also shown that individuals vary widely in their responsiveness to ondansetron, explaining why trials using fixed doses of 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs result in severe constipation in some patients. When patients were allowed to have dose titration we found that constipation was rare, occurring in only 2% of patients. However, the required dose of ondansetron ranged from 4 mg on alternate days to 8 mg three times a day (t.d.s.). The reasons for this variation are unclear but recent evidence suggests that responsiveness to 5HT<sub>3</sub>RAs might be linked to polymorphisms in the genes controlling 5HT synthesis. Serotonin availability in the rectal mucosa is thought to be determined by the activity of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH-1), which produces serotonin in enterochromaffin cells. A recent small study showed that TPH-1 mRNA levels in rectal mucosa (and thus presumably serotonin synthesis rate) were approximately doubled in responders to another 5HT<sub>3</sub>RA, ramosetron, compared with non-responders, and that this was linked to the TPH-1 genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. TPH-1 rs211105 minor allele G was found in 44% of non-responders, but only in 4% of responders, indicating that possessing the major allele increases responsiveness to the drug. It was also associated with worse diarrhoea, possibly because of the greater 5HT synthesis.</p>

                <title>Investigational agent</title>
                <p id="Par43">Ondansetron is a potent, highly selective 5HT<sub>3</sub>RA, which blocks 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptors in the gastro-intestinal tract and in the central nervous system. Ondansetron is currently licenced for use in adults and children for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and for the prevention and treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting. Constipation is an unintended side effect of ondansetron, which was first shown to slow colonic transit 30 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our pilot study, 120 patients were recruited to a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of ondansetron treatment for IBS-D. Patients were randomised to receive ondansetron (2 mg per day up to 8 mg t.d.s) followed by placebo or placebo followed by ondansetron. Patients began on drug A for a period of 5 weeks, then underwent a washout period of 2–3 weeks, and then commenced drug B for 5 weeks. The primary outcome measure for the study was the difference in average stool consistency in the last 2 weeks of treatment of ondansetron versus placebo, and this showed a highly significant improvement with active treatment. We also showed significant benefits for both urgency and stool frequency, with associated slowing of whole gut transit. Despite having limitations, the results of this pilot study were very encouraging, supporting our clinical experience of the benefits of ondansetron.</p>

              <title>Objectives</title>
              <p id="Par44">The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of ondansetron in patients with symptoms of IBS-D, including urgency, looseness of stool, frequency of defaecation, and abdominal pain. The trial also aims to understand further the mode of action of ondansetron in these patients. More specifically, we will examine the role of rectal sensitivity and compliance, faecal bile acids and proteases, post-prandial sigmoid motility, and genetic variation of serotonin synthesis, both in terms of symptom generation in IBS-D and in responsiveness to ondansetron. This will be achieved by performing mechanistic studies within the clinical trial to determine if changes in symptoms are correlated with changes in these biomarkers.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par45">TRITON is a multi-site, parallel group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with embedded mechanistic studies within selected sites. Our aim is to determine the superiority of ondansetron compared with placebo. In total, 400 patients with IBS-D will be randomised 1:1 to receive either ondansetron or placebo. Both treatments will be administered in oral doses of between 4 mg every third day and 24 mg daily for 12 weeks. Dose titration will be undertaken in the first 2 weeks of the trial to avoid constipation, which at a standard dose occurs in one quarter of patients. The primary outcome will be assessed over the 12 weeks post randomisation. Secondary and safety outcomes will be measured up to 16 weeks following randomisation.

If stools become hard or there is no bowel movement on day 2, they will be asked to stop the drug for 1 day and recommence at a lower dose changing from 4 mg daily to 4 mg on alternate days. If stools still remain hard or infrequent, patients will be asked to reduce their dosage to 4 mg every third day.

The effect of ondansetron on whole gut transit will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 400), using radio-opaque markers and an abdominal x-ray as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. High-resolution manometry will be performed at baseline and after 8–11 weeks of treatment at two centres (<italic>n</italic> = 40) to assess whether ondansetron decreases the number of high-amplitude propagating contractions and increases the percentage time occupied by cyclical retrograde propagated contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Barostat assessment will be performed at baseline and after 8–11 weeks of treatment at four centres (<italic>n</italic> = 80, some of whom may also undergo manometry), in order to assess if ondansetron increases rectal compliance and decreases sensitivity (manifested as increased pressure thresholds for pain and urgency). Serum will be sampled to genotype patients for polymorphisms in the <italic>TPH1</italic> gene (<italic>n</italic> = 400), and correlation tested between these and the mucosal 5HT and TPH-1 mRNA obtained from high-rectal biopsies (<italic>n</italic> = 80), final ondansetron dose, and responder status, to see whether this predicts sensitivity and/or response to ondansetron. Finally, stool sample analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 400) will be used to assess whether ondansetron reduces total faecal bile acid and tryptase concentrations, and correlation will be tested between these and any changes in urgency.</p>

                  <p id="Par83">Potential trial candidates will attend their first visit for registration and consent by the PI or delegate. If required, further tests to exclude diagnoses other than IBS-D will be arranged. These include a SeHCAT scan, serum C4 level, or a 1-week trial of a bile-acid binding agent to assess for bile acid malabsorption (unless done within the last 5 years), and colonoscopy (unless done within 2 years, or 5 years if they also currently have normal calprotectin) to assess for microscopic colitis. Baseline serum blood tests, vital signs, demographics (date of birth, gender, ethnicity, and smoking history) and an ECG will be obtained. Current medications will be reviewed, and those unable to discontinue drugs likely to alter bowel habit will be unable to enter the trial. Patients on QT-prolonging drugs and cardiotoxic drugs will be reviewed by the PI for suitability for the trial, as ondansetron may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmias. Eligible and consenting patients are registered and allocated a unique trial ID and data collected will be link anonymised.</p>
                  <p id="Par84">All patients will be asked to complete a 2-week daily diary recording stool frequency, the consistency of each stool (using the BSFS), worst abdominal pain (on a scale of 0–100), worst bowel movement urgency (on a scale 0–100), and if they have used loperamide that day. In addition, patients have the option to be sent two automated text messages each day. The first will ask the patient if they have passed a stool of consistency 6 or 7 on the BSFS. They will need to reply with either a yes or no. The second text message will ask what their worst abdominal pain score was that day. The patient must respond with a number from a scale of 0–100 (where 0 is no pain and 100 is the worst imaginable pain).</p>

Patients will then be randomised and given a 6-week patient diary and the trial medication in accordance with their blinded randomisation allocation. Patients will be asked to record the following on a daily basis: stool frequency, consistency of each stool, worst abdominal pain experienced that day, worst bowel movement urgency, number of trial medication capsules taken, and whether they have used loperamide that day. Every week the diary will ask whether they feel that they have had satisfactory relief from their IBS symptoms that week. If they agree, the patient will continue to receive two text messages each day for the next 6 weeks, asking if they have passed a stool of a consistency of 6 or 7 that day, and what their worst abdominal pain was that day.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">During the first 2 weeks patients will be contacted every 2 days by the local site team to discuss bowel habit. The dose of ondansetron or placebo will then be titrated as required. Additional guidance on dose titration will be given to each trial site in a standard operating procedure, and to the patient in a dose titration instruction leaflet. A check for serious adverse events (SAEs) will be performed during each telephone call. The steady dose to be taken forward for the remainder of the trial will be confirmed in week 2, although this may be altered during the 12 weeks if required, to avoid constipation.</p>

Randomisation lists containing kit allocation will be generated by the safety statistician at the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) and sent to the clinical supply company, which will produce the kits and the code-break envelopes. Management of kit codes on the kit logistics application, which is linked to the 24-h randomisation system, will be conducted by the CTRU safety statistician in addition to maintaining the back-up kit-code lists for each site.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par121">Our pilot study has shown that ondansetron provides an opportunity to help patients with IBS-D, not only with diarrhoea, but also with urgency, frequency of defecation, and bloating. When patients with IBS-D are asked about their concerns, erratic unpredictable bowel habit and urgency in particular, are rated as having the greatest impact on quality of life, so improvement in urgency and stool frequency may be of considerable value. However, abdominal pain is a key part of IBS, so we have used the combined FDA-recommended outcome measure, which includes both reduction in pain and improvement of diarrhoea as our primary endpoint, rather than just stool consistency, as in the pilot.</p>
              <p id="Par122">This larger clinical trial aims to confirm the effectiveness of ondansetron in managing IBS-D and, by mechanistic assessments, shed light on both the pathophysiology of the condition and the mode of action of ondansetron in this population. With greater understanding of the condition, we hope this will allow the design of better treatments in the future.</p>
              <p id="Par123">Current alternatives to 5HT3RA include loperamide and the recently introduced eluxadoline. There are only a few very small trials of loperamide in IBS-D, which clearly show its effectiveness in controlling diarrhoea but not pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Anecdotally, patients often report constipation following loperamide use, and this is associated with bloating and discomfort. Eluxadoline is a combined μ-opioid agonist and δ-opioid antagonist shown to increase the proportion of responders from 5.7% on placebo to 11–13.8% in a dose-response study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the main effect was on stool consistency with no obvious effect on pain. Unfortunately, this drug has been associated with acute pancreatitis, which is an unacceptable side effect for most patients with IBS so the search for alternative safe treatments remains important.</p>
              <p id="Par124">If ondansetron is effective in our trial, it could easily be widely adopted since it is an inexpensive, safe, and generic drug. By providing an effective treatment, it could not only reduce patient symptoms, but also reduce healthcare costs associated with repeated referral and unnecessary investigations.</p>
