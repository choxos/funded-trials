                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Regorafenib demonstrated efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Lack of predictive biomarkers, potential toxicities and cost-effectiveness concerns highlight the unmet need for better patient selection.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Patients with <italic>RAS</italic> mutant mCRC with biopsiable metastases were enrolled in this phase II trial. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI was acquired pretreatment and at day 15 post-treatment. Median values of volume transfer constant (K<sup>trans</sup>), enhancing fraction (EF) and their product KEF (summarised median values of K<sup>trans</sup>× EF) were generated. Circulating tumour (ct) DNA was collected monthly until progressive disease and tested for clonal <italic>RAS</italic> mutations by digital-droplet PCR. Tumour vasculature (CD-31) was scored by immunohistochemistry on 70 sequential tissue biopsies.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Twenty-seven patients with paired DCE-MRI scans were analysed. Median KEF decrease was 58.2%. Of the 23 patients with outcome data, &gt;70% drop in KEF (6/23) was associated with higher disease control rate (p=0.048) measured by RECIST V. 1.1 at 2 months, improved progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.72), p=0.02), 4-month PFS (66.7% vs 23.5%) and overall survival (OS) (HR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.63), p=0.02). KEF drop correlated with CD-31 reduction in sequential tissue biopsies (p=0.04). <italic>RAS</italic> mutant clones decay in ctDNA after 8 weeks of treatment was associated with better PFS (HR 0.21 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.71), p=0.01) and OS (HR 0.28 (95% CI 0.07–1.04), p=0.06).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major health burden with significant morbidity and mortality despite recent improvements in its management owing to better screening and therapeutic options.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> CRC is known to be a biologically heterogeneous disease characterised by the activation of several angiogenic and oncogenic pathways.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with known anti-angiogenic, antistromal and anti-oncogenic activities,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> has demonstrated single agent efficacy in patients with treatment refractory metastatic CRC (mCRC).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The use of regorafenib in the clinic is however hampered by the modest efficacy in an unselected patient population, a significant side effect profile and the high drug costs. Consequently, identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to regorafenib is critical for treatment stratification and appropriate patient selection such that treatment benefits could be optimised.</p>
              <p>Several efforts are currently ongoing to define gene signatures<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and biomarkers of response to anti-angiogenic drug in CRC and other cancers<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; however, validation of these biomarkers will only determine their use in clinical practice. While recent studies using tissue<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and plasma<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> have attempted to elucidate the response and resistance mechanisms to regorafenib, the search for a clinically useful biomarker has been largely unsuccessful. A growing body of preclinical evidence suggests strong anti-angiogenic and pro-apoptotic effects of regorafenib<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> with clinical data demonstrating that drug activity is independent of the tumour’s mutational status.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These findings strengthen the hypothesis that additional mechanisms other than oncogenic blockade are responsible for the antitumour activity of this drug. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI may have a useful role in evaluating tumour vascular heterogeneity and early anti-angiogenic effects<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>; moreover, its parameters volume transfer constant (K<sup>trans</sup>), enhancing fraction (EF) and initial area under the gadolinium concentration time curve over 60 s (IAUGC<sub>60</sub>) have been correlated with microvessel density and in some tumours with degree of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> By contrast, diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) offers useful information that reflects tumour cellularity and increase in its quantitative parameter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) has been associated with tumour cell death and necrosis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> At least two preclinical studies demonstrated that regorafenib was able to significantly suppress tumour vascularity when quantified by DCE- computed tomography (CT) and MRI modalities respectively in human colon carcinoma xenograft models.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 20</xref></p>
              <p>In this prospective phase II trial of patients with <italic>RAS</italic> mutant mCRC treated with single agent regorafenib, we hypothesised that (1) an early anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative activity of regorafenib might be detected by multiparametric DCE-MRI on day 15 of the treatment, (2) the depth of anti-angiogenic response detected by a significant drop in DCE-MRI quantitative parameters might correlate with clinical efficacy, (3) analysis of sequential tissue and liquid biopsies could be integrated into the biomarker discovery process and shed insights into mechanisms of response to regorafenib.</p>

                <p><italic>PROSPECT-R</italic> trial (clinical trials.gov number (NCT03010722)) is a phase II, open label, non-randomised study of regorafenib in patients with <italic>RAS</italic> mutant, chemorefractory mCRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Patients who were at least 18 years old and had a WHO performance status (PS) of 0–1 were deemed eligible if all conventional treatment options including fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and at least one anti-VEGF drugs (later trial protocol was amended due to changes in availability of anti-VEGF agents due to funding restrictions in UK) were exhausted; they had metastatic tumour amenable to biopsy and repeat measurements with DCE-MRI. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by National Institutional review boards (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency: 15983/0249/001–0001). All participants were required to have mandatory pretreatment biopsies (six cores targeted towards the MRI identified index lesion), biopsies at 2 months (if response or stable disease by RECIST V.1.1 criteria (six cores)) and at the time of progression (6–12 cores from two suitable progressing metastatic sites). Three out of six cores were snap-frozen; one core was used to establish patient- derived organoids and two cores were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE).</p>

All patients were also required to have pretreatment mandatory core biopsy, followed by a core biopsy at 2 months if they had SD or PR. Patients were monitored by CT scans every 2 months until the time of PD and if clinically feasible, they had biopsy of one or two progressing lesions from PD sites.

Patients with suitable metastatic disease (defined as lesions at least 2 cm in diameter) and no contraindications to MRI underwent multiparametric MRI studies including matched DCE and DW; images were acquired &lt;7 days prior to therapy and at day 15 post-treatment. Treatment consisted of regorafenib 160 mg once daily on a schedule of 3 weeks on and 1 week off until progression or intolerable side effects.

              <title>Digital-droplet PCR</title>
              <p>The QX200 digital-droplet PCR (ddPCR) system (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, California, USA) was used, and all reactions were prepared using the ddPCR supermix with no dUTPTP for probes. All PCR reactions were performed as duplex PCR using the relevant digital PCR assays for the wild-type and the mutation in question. Droplets were generated using the QX200 droplet generator according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The PCR reaction was performed in a C1000 Touch Thermo Cycler (Bio-Rad) using the following protocol: 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s and 55°C for 1 min, then 98°C for 10 min. Droplets were read in the QX200 droplet reader and analysed using the Quantasoft software V. 1.6.6.0320 (Bio-Rad). Fractional abundance (FA) was defined as follows: FA % = (N<italic>mut/</italic>(N<italic>mut</italic> + N<italic>wt</italic>))×100), where N<italic>mut</italic> is the number of mutant events and N<italic>wt</italic> is the number of WT events per reaction. The number of positive and negative droplets was used to calculate the concentration of the target and reference DNA sequences and their Poisson-based 95% CI. ddPCR analysis of normal control plasma DNA (from cell lines) and no DNA template controls were always included. Samples with very low positive events were repeated at least twice in independent experiments to validate the obtained results as previously described.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

                <p>The immunohistochemical expression of microvascular density (CD31; clone ab28364, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; dilution 1:50), cell proliferation (Ki-67; clone ab16667, Abcam; dilution 1:100) and cell apoptosis (Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) (5A1E) ab9664S, Abcam; dilution 1:100) was examined on consecutive 4 µm FFPE sections of the neoplastic cores. Reactions were performed using the automated Benchmark XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Basel, Switzerland). Appropriate positive and negative controls were run concurrently.</p>
                <p>For assessment of tumour microvascular density, CD31-positive microvessels were quantified and reported as the average number in 10 random fields at ×200 magnification. Ki-67 labelling index was assessed as the average number of proliferating cells in 10 random fields at ×200 magnification. Caspase-3 evaluation was categorised as positive or negative.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p>The DCR was defined by the sum of complete responses + partial responses + stable diseases using RECIST V.1.1. PFS was measured from start of treatment to date of progression or death from any cause. OS was defined as time from start of treatment to death of any cause. Patients without an event were censored at last follow-up. Response according to KEF (K<sup>trans</sup> (non-zeros) × EF) was defined as a drop of &gt;70% from baseline while change in CD31 biomarker levels from baseline was calculated as ((8 weeks−baseline)/baseline] ×100. CD31 change from baseline was explored on a continuous scale and was also dichotomised using the median value.</p>
                  <p>Response according to KEF parameter and the dichotomised CD31 change from baseline were cross-tabulated with the RECIST measured DCR. χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact tests were employed to explore whether there is an association between them and DCR. Logistic regression was employed to produce ORs and 95% CIs. The PFS and OS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were generated for each group. The log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to obtain HRs and 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was tested with the use of Schoenfeld residuals.</p>
                  <p>In our study, despite relatively small study cohort, the changes in K<sup>trans</sup> and KEF values were noticeably larger (eg, &gt;50% reduction in mean and median KEF). Based on results of the 23 analysable patients evaluated by DCE-MRI in our study, our patient sample size by post hoc analysis (based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test) demonstrated 100% power to detect this difference at a level of significance of 0.05.</p>

The ROC curve analysis performed for the KEF showed that a 69.21% reduction from baseline had 100% specificity and overall accuracy of 69.57%; for pragmatic reasons, a minimum KEF product reduction of 70% was chosen (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix table A3</xref>). Matched tissue analysis revealed a strong concordance between a drop in KEF and mean vascular density of tissue, as measured by CD31 count obtained pretreatment and at 2 months in patients with tissue and MR parameter data available (p=0.04) (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix table A4</xref>).</p>

Patients with &gt;70% drop in KEF (8/27; two patients did not undergo the 2-month scan due to treatment-related toxicities and thus were excluded from the final analysis as per the study protocol) were found to have higher DCR (6/6 vs 0/6, p=0.05) at 2 months (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix table A5</xref>), better PFS (HR 0.16 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.72), p=0.02), better PFS at 4 months (66.7% vs 23.5%) and better OS (HR 0.08 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.63), p=0.02). For the group with &gt;70% drop in KEF, 6-month and 12-month OS were 100% (95% CI NE) and 75% (95% CI 12.8% to 96.1%), respectively compared with 27.6% (7.2%–53.2%) and 13.8% (1.0%–42.5%) in the &lt;70% drop in KEF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A,B</xref>; see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix figure A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix table A6</xref>). In order to address the relative improvement in efficacy with or without KEF drop, we compared the outcomes of all the patients who achieved DCR; PFS was found to be 5.6 vs 4.2 months (HR 0.30 (95% CI 0.06 to 1.49), p=0.140) and OS was 15.2 vs 5.8 months (HR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.06), p=0.057) in this analysis. Interestingly, when the same analysis was repeated with the cut-off chosen by ROC analysis (69.21%), PFS (HR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.91), p=0.038) and OS (HR 0.11 (95% CI 0.01 to 1.01), p=0.051) were found to be statistically significant despite small numbers.</p>

                <p>A previously well-conducted study comprising 208 regorafenib-treated patients demonstrated an association between high neutrophil, high platelet, low lymphocyte count and/or high neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio with prognosis.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Due to the stringent inclusion criteria of our study, our data distribution did not allow to use the same cut-off used in the study by Del Prete and colleagues and median values were used instead. Notwithstanding small numbers and patient selection based on trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, no significant correlation with efficacy was found with any of the above-mentioned factors (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix tables A8</xref> and A9).</p>
                <p>Moreover, other clinical factors such as PS and number of previous lines of treatment and toxicity were also compared with efficacy in a univariate analysis. Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with previously reported data<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and are summarised in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">appendix tables A10</xref> and A11.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This proof-of-concept phase II translational research study was designed to assess the feasibility of combining imaging, morphological and plasma biomarkers in order to best stratify patients more likely to derive benefit from regorafenib in refractory mCRC. Our study provides the first clinical evidence that regorafenib efficacy is driven by its early anti-angiogenic activity.</p>
              <p>It is widely accepted that DCE-MRI can assess tumour vascular function<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; however, establishing common methodology remains challenging due to the practicalities of technical implementation across different MR platforms and the choice of mathematical models for data analysis. In this study, we have used DCE-MRI acquisition and data analysis in line with international expert recommendations.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While a large body of evidence supports the notion that perfusion MRI can be helpful in assisting dose selection and enriching patient populations more likely to respond in early-phase clinical trials, most studies have defined an observable anti-angiogenic drug effect based only on the limits of DCE-MRI measurement repeatability rather than also considering the clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, as metastases show variable degrees of necrosis and non-enhancement before treatment and drug-induced vascular pruning also leads to marked decrease in enhancement within tumours, measuring only the median K<sup>trans</sup> value is less sensitive to change due to averaging of the voxel values. For these reasons, we calculated the EF and the product of K<sup>trans</sup> from the enhancing voxels with EF (KEF), which better reflects proportional reduction of vascularity within tumours.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>In this study, we have evaluated DCE-MRI in a well-defined study population, thus minimising the bias that may result from patient heterogeneity. The selected DCE-MRI parameter threshold applied for patient stratification is based on both a prior knowledge of the measurement repeatability of our technique<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and clinically validated endpoints of PFS and OS. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study showing that KEF, a product of K<sup>trans</sup> and EF, can be used as a parameter of DCE-MRI with high clinical specificity. The KEF measurement was able to identify clinically meaningful responders as early as 2 weeks into treatment with regorafenib with 100% specificity.</p>
              <p>The major strength of this study is that it was possible to validate the findings of MRI detected regorafenib-induced suppression of tumour vascularisation by matched tissue analysis using immunostaining of the endothelial marker CD31. We demonstrated that patients with a significant drop in CD31 score on 2-month biopsy had a better PFS and OS. These findings further emphasise the fact that drug activity is due to its anti-angiogenic properties.</p>
              <p>It is established that genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of tumour heterogeneity allow functional expansion of previously dormant subclones under the selective pressure of chemotherapy in CRC cells.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This provides a strong biological rationale for the use of regorafenib given its broad multikinase antitumour activity. However, the diversity of mechanisms of action of this drug makes it equally challenging to identify predictive biomarkers of clinical utility. Biomarker analysis of CORRECT trial data demonstrated that benefit from regorafenib was independent of the <italic>RAS</italic> pathway mutational status of the tumour, suggesting primarily an anti-angiogenic mechanism of action, and that liquid biopsy could be reliably used to characterise clonal mutations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We investigated if the circulating tumour genotype could be used as a biomarker of sustained anti-angiogenic activity to regorafenib by tracking known <italic>KRAS</italic> clonal mutations and performing serial plasma analysis by highly sensitive ddPCR methodology, at clinically relevant time points. A drop in FA was observed in all patients at 4 weeks suggesting a degree of initial anti-angiogenic activity in keeping with an initial drop in radiological parameters; however, this effect was sustained in only a proportion of patients at 2 months. This group of patients with persistent drop at 2 months demonstrated better efficacy with regorafenib suggesting that sustained angiogenic activity was required in order to achieve maintained benefit from therapy. Consistent with the findings from previous studies,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 31</xref> we demonstrated that ctDNA can be used for tumour genotyping, but beyond this we proved that it can also be used to monitor efficacy from regorafenib in patients showing initial benefit from the therapy.</p>
              <p>Acknowledging the limitations due to small numbers of patients in our study, we propose that these findings should be validated in larger cohort of patients treated with anti-angiogenic therapies. Due to logistical barriers, it may however not be possible to conduct large-scale trials scrupulously designed and statistically powered to address questions of biomarker analysis. The interpretation of our findings thus need to be contextualised; for example, regorafenib is currently unavailable free of charge to patients in the UK so the use of biomarkers described in this study could significantly reduce the duration of therapy in patients’ unlikely to derive benefit. It is conceivable that the health economic assessment might be more favourable with appropriate predictive biomarkers such as those we have identified. While the search for a positive predictive biomarker may help better application of precision medicine, in a more non-resource-constrained funding environment, based on our findings, patients could be spared from significant drug-related side effects, which again would have health economic benefits.</p>
              <p>In summary, the depth of angiogenic response measured by DCE-MRI and validated by matched tissue immunohistochemistry analysis correlates with clinical efficacy. The circulating tumour genotype is a potential marker of sustained anti-angiogenic response to regorafenib in patients with known clonal mutations.</p>
