                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is uncertainty about the advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with abdominal hysterectomy, particularly the relative rate of complications of the two procedures. While uptake of laparoscopic hysterectomy has been slow, the situation is changing with greater familiarity, better training, better equipment and increased proficiency in the technique. Thus, a large, robust, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) is needed to compare contemporary laparoscopic hysterectomy with abdominal hysterectomy to determine the safest and most cost-effective technique.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A parallel, open, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised controlled, expertise-based surgery trial with integrated health economic evaluation and an internal pilot with an embedded qualitative process evaluation. A within trial-based economic evaluation will explore the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with open abdominal hysterectomy. We will aim to recruit 3250 women requiring a hysterectomy for a benign gynaecological condition and who were suitable for either laparoscopic or open techniques. The primary outcome is major complications up to six completed weeks postsurgery and the key secondary outcome is time from surgery to resumption of usual activities using the personalised Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function questionnaire. The principal outcome for the economic evaluation is to be cost per QALY at 12 months’ postsurgery. A secondary analysis is to be undertaken to generate costs per major surgical complication avoided and costs per return to normal activities.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study was approved by the West Midlands-Edgbaston Research Ethics Committee, 18 February 2021 (Ethics ref: 21/WM/0019). REC approval for the protocol version 2.0 dated 2 February 2021 was issued on 18 February 2021.</p>
                  <p>We will present the findings in national and international conferences. We will also aim to publish the findings in high impact peer-reviewed journals. We will disseminate the completed paper to the Department of Health, the Scientific Advisory Committees of the RCOG, the Royal College of Nurses (RCN) and the BSGE.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hysterectomy is common, with 1 in 10 women undergoing the procedure in their lifetime, mostly for benign conditions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> A total of 30 000 women undergo a hysterectomy every year in the UK for benign indications such as abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref></p>
              <p>The procedure is associated with high rates of patient satisfaction and improvement in quality of life (QoL) but serious complications can arise.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The morbidity arising from hysterectomy imposes a burden on women and the ubiquity of the procedure uses a substantial amount of scarce healthcare resources.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–9</xref> Currently, most hysterectomies are performed by laparotomy, through a vertical or transverse incision because this traditional method is thought to minimise intraoperative complications but the increased trauma of an abdominal incision can prolong recovery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This may be especially true in overweight and obese women, where morbidity is greater from mobility restrictions and wound infection.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Several randomised controlled trial (RCTs), mostly small and of low or moderate quality, have compared the surgical approach to hysterectomy for benign disease. The 2015 Cochrane review identified 25 trials (2983 women) comparing laparoscopic and abdominal hysterectomy.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Laparoscopic hysterectomy was found to have significantly more urinary tract injuries (bladder or ureter) but the available evidence was of low quality. The largest RCT included in this review was conducted over 15 years ago, when laparoscopic hysterectomy was in its infancy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Smaller, but more recent trials of laparoscopic hysterectomy, have shown a trend towards a lower major complication rate.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> The Cochrane review<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> identified no differences in the costs or outcomes apart from return to normal activities, which was shorter in the laparoscopic hysterectomy group by 14 days on average.</p>
              <p>The uptake of laparoscopic hysterectomy is increasing with greater familiarity and increased proficiency in the technique aided by improved training and better surgical equipment.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Patient’s values and preferences, especially around speed of recovery may also be driving this trend.</p>
              <p>A systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies of hysterectomy, found laparoscopic hysterectomy to be the least cost-effective but the authors felt that conclusions were difficult to draw due to variation in study design, follow-up times and the QoL measurement used.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Thus, we designed a large RCT to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with open abdominal hysterectomy for women with a benign gynaecological condition.</p>

                <p>The study is designed as a parallel, open, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised controlled, expertise-based surgery trial with integrated health economic evaluation and an internal pilot with an embedded qualitative process evaluation to assess the ability of the study to recruit and randomise.</p>

                <title>Trial setting</title>
                <p>Recruitment to the LAparoscopic Versus Abdominal (LAVA) study will take place in gynaecology departments (general and relevant specialist clinics including menstrual disorders and pelvic pain clinics, hysteroscopy and colposcopy services) in up to 50 National Health Service (NHS) Hospitals within the UK.</p>

                <title>Identification of participants</title>
                <p>Eligible women will be identified by a member of the clinical team responsible for the direct care of the potential participant in outpatient gynaecology clinics and preoperative assessment clinics in each recruiting centre. The LAVA study will be introduced by a member of the clinical or research team, with full counselling about the trial (including provision of information about the qualitative process evaluation).</p>

                  <p>An economic evaluation alongside the RCT will explore the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with open abdominal hysterectomy based on a primary outcome of quality-adjusted life-years and secondary outcomes such as major surgical complications avoided. The analysis will adopt the perspective of the health service. All resource use will be collected prospectively and unit costs attached. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be carried out.</p>

                  <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                  <p>Our research has been developed with involvement of members of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Women’s Voices group, the Hysterectomy Association and the Birmingham Women’s Hospital Hysterectomy Focus Group. A total of 945 women responded to our patient and public involvement (PPI) survey. Major complications were ranked as the most important outcome for the trial to assess, with return to usual activities considered the second most important outcome (ranked in the top three most important outcomes in the BSGE survey). A measure of the speed and quality of recovery (QoR) was also considered one of the most important outcomes to measure after major complications and improvement in QoL in the PPI survey.</p>
                  <p>Two focus groups felt the burden placed on women from administering outcome questionnaires at 24 hours’ postsurgery and the frequency of dissemination postoperatively proposed was acceptable. Indeed, the consensus view was that measuring recovery against preset targets was a good thing (with tools already available on the internet). This frequency of contact was also supported by the PPI survey; 6 weeks 485/945 (51%) and 12 months 514/945 (54%) were the most popular time points.</p>
                  <p>Overall, almost 50% (462/945) of PPI survey respondents were willing to consider taking part in the proposed trial. Excluding the 483 women declining to participate because they had already undergone a hysterectomy revealed that 63% (292/462) of respondents were willing to take part, with the remainder being ‘not sure’.</p>
                  <p>Results of the study will be shared with study participants, staff members at research sites and investigators of other studies related to hysterectomy and benign gynaecological surgery. A formal notification to the ethics committee, Department of Health, key partners and sponsors will be made. Outreach to other key stakeholders (trial networks, health advocates) involved in related trials is planned. The trial team has key individuals to optimise the dissemination of results. With our PPI coapplicants and contacts we will produce effective, contemporary formats for dissemination, for example, the use of video podcasts and social media outlets.</p>

                <p>To enable 90% power to test the non-inferiority hypothesis at a one-sided 2.5% significance level (two-sided 5% level) assuming a 3% margin of non-inferiority and a major surgical complication rate of 6% in the abdominal (control) group requires 2634 participants. The estimate of 6% is taken from a similar previous comparative study.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A 3% margin is justifiable because of the trade-off of potentially swifter recovery with laparoscopic surgery; a view shared by our patient focus group and is substantially less than the 5% difference observed in the previous major trial<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> which led to the continued use of open abdominal hysterectomy.</p>
                <p>An extra consideration is the potential for clustering by surgeon due to the expertise based design<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref> Under the assumption that each of the 50 centres will use 6 surgeons (operating on approximately 9 patients on average during the study), along with an intracluster correlation (ICC) estimate of 0.02, the sample size has been increased by 16% to 3055. This ICC estimate used—in the absence of precise estimates—is considered conservative given the outcome is clinical and of low prevalence, both of which are factors associated with low ICC.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 33</xref> However, even varying these factors up to an ICC of 0.07 or average cluster size of 29, shows we will have at least 80% power to establish non-inferiority in these situations. A final inflation of 6% to account for loss to follow-up brings the final sample size total to 3250 participants. This size of sample would give the ability to detect meaningful differences between groups in our key secondary outcome of time from surgery to resumption of usual activities. Assuming the median recovery time in the abdominal group is between 6 and 9 weeks,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we will have high levels of power (&gt;90%) to detect reductions of 1 week in all cases.</p>

              <p>The LAVA trial protocol was designed in 2019 and amended during 2020 before funding and ethical approval was granted. The trial commenced recruitment in September 2021 but failed to meet its RAG (‘red; amber; green) criteria for site set up and recruitment rate and so for this reason and the recognition by the funder (The NIHR HTA Programme) of insufficient NHS clinical and Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity post the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was closed. The research question remains relevant, given that almost 30 000 hysterectomies are undertaken per year<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 18</xref> and especially now that the laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy is being facilitated further by advances in instrumentation including robotic surgery.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Our research group plans to analyse qualitative and quantitative data acquired from the commencement of the trial to inform future surgical trials and aid future researchers wishing to undertake comparative trials in hysterectomy. We believe that our carefully considered protocol will be of value to future researchers working in the field of optimising clinical outcomes for women undergoing hysterectomy.</p>
              <sec id="s10-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The LAVA trial was larger than all the previous 25 RCTs evaluating laparoscopic and open hysterectomy and of higher quality, addressing the methodological deficiencies of previous trials; namely their power to show a meaningful difference, the validity of outcomes assessment, especially the key outcome of recovery and a failure to account for surgical expertise. In the LAVA trial, we used a novel, validated, personalised recovery tool<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 21 22</xref> and employed an expertise-based design to mitigate against surgical expertise bias.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 22</xref> Third part randomisation was performed balancing important prognostic variables. Due to the differing natures of the intervention it is impossible to blind either the care providers, investigators or participants to their allocated group.</p>

              <sec id="s10-2">
                <title>Potential impact and implications</title>
                <p>Hysterectomy is common, with 1 in 10 women undergoing the procedure in their lifetime, mostly for benign conditions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> The operation imposes substantial morbidity on women, disrupts families and impacts on wider society through utilisation of scarce healthcare resources and lost productivity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–6 15</xref> These burdens could potentially be reduced with safe, less invasive surgery allowing quicker recovery. Currently, most hysterectomies are performed abdominally because this traditional method is thought to minimise intraoperative complications but the increased trauma of an abdominal incision can prolong recovery.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This may be especially true in overweight and obese women, where morbidity is greater from mobility restrictions and wound infection.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>Laparoscopic hysterectomy avoids the need for a large surgical incision speeding recovery for most women but has been associated with serious complications and specialist surgical skills. However, scientific advances in imaging and equipment, has made laparoscopic surgery easier as well as more accessible to general gynaecologists.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 16 17</xref> Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery forms an integral part of modern packages of nursing, anaesthetic and surgical care designed to enhance recovery and allow 24-hour hospital discharge.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>The wider adoption of contemporary laparoscopic hysterectomy has the potential to minimise morbidity, expedite recovery and improve clinical outcomes for women in the short term and longer term. Furthermore, enhanced recovery has the potential to be economically advantageous to the NHS through resource efficiencies and wider society via increased productivity.</p>

                <title>Trial management group</title>
                <p>The trial management group will take responsibility for the day-to-day management of the trial and will include (but is not limited to) the CI, coapplicants, statistician, team leader and trial manager. The role of the group is to monitor all aspects of the conduct and progress of the trial, ensure that the protocol is adhered to and take appropriate action to safeguard participants and the quality of the trial itself.</p>

                <title>Trial steering committee</title>
                <p>The role of the trial steering committee (TSC) is to provide the overall supervision of the trial. Ideally, the TSC should include members who are independent of the investigators, their employing organisations, funders and sponsors. The TSC should monitor trial progress and conduct and advise on scientific credibility. The TSC will consider and act, as appropriate, on the recommendations of the DMC or equivalent and ultimately carries the responsibility for deciding whether a trial needs to be stopped on grounds of safety or efficacy.</p>

                <title>Data monitoring committee</title>
                <p>Data analyses will be supplied in confidence to an independent DMC, which will be asked to give advice on whether the accumulated data from the trial, together with the results from other relevant research, justifies the continuing recruitment of further participants. The DMC will operate in accordance with a trial specific charter based on the template created by the Damocles Group. The DMC will meet at regular intervals that will allow them to effectively monitor the trial unless there is a specific reason (eg, safety phase) to amend the schedule.</p>

                <p>As sponsor, The University of Birmingham will be responsible for deciding whether an amendment is substantial or nonsubstantial. Substantive changes will be submitted to REC for approval. Once this has been received, R&amp;D departments will be notified of the amendment and requested to provide their approval. If no response is received within 35 days, an assumption will be made that the site has no objection to the amendment and it will be implemented at the site.</p>

Following publication of the findings, the final trial dataset will be made available to external researchers on approval from the trial management group and the BCTU data sharing committee in line with standard data sharing practices for clinical trial data sets.</p>
