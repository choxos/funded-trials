                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Chronic neuropathic low back pain (CNLBP) is a debilitating condition in which established medical treatments seldom alleviate symptoms. Evidence demonstrates that high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS) reduces pain and improves health-related quality of life in patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), but evidence of this effect is limited in individuals with CNLBP who have not had surgery. The aim of this multicentre randomised trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS for this population.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial with a parallel economic evaluation. A total of 96 patients with CNLBP who have not had spinal surgery will be implanted with an epidural lead and a sham lead outside the epidural space without a screening trial. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (intervention group) or to sham 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (control group) after receiving the full implant. The SCS devices will be programmed identically using a cathodal cascade. Participants will use their handheld programmer to alter the intensity of the stimulation as per routine practice. The primary outcome will be a 7-day daily pain diary. Secondary outcomes include the Oswestry Disability Index, complications, EQ-5D-5 L, and health and social care costs. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after device activation. The primary analyses will compare primary and secondary outcomes between groups at 6 months, while adjusting for baseline outcome scores. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) will be calculated at 6 months and over the lifetime of the patient.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The outcomes of this trial will inform clinical practice and healthcare policy on the role of high-frequency 10 kHz SCS for use in patients with CNLBP who have not had surgery.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par39">The prevalence of chronic low back pain in adults worldwide is estimated to range from 12 to 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This leads to prolonged disability and time lost from work for those affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Within this group, an estimated 12–15% suffer from chronic neuropathic lower back pain (CNLBP), have relatively greater pain severity and account for more of the costs of this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Neuropathic pain is defined as a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. Commonly used therapies for low back pain are largely ineffective for CNLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for refractory neuropathic pain. SCS is routinely used for people with predominantly neuropathic radicular pain that typically results from, or persists after, spinal surgery (so-called failed back surgery syndrome [FBSS]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. SCS has demonstrated cost effectiveness for this indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, because of a lack of existing evidence and the difficulty in obtaining paraesthesia over the lower back, SCS has not been commonly used for treating patients with back pain who have not had spinal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">High-frequency 10 kHz SCS (Nevro, Redwood, CA, USA) is a recent advance in SCS technology. The current is delivered at a frequency of 10 kHz, as opposed to the 40 to 60 Hz generated by conventional SCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The key advantage of a higher frequency current is its apparent superiority to conventional SCS in targeting residual low back pain following back surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, it does not generate any stimulation-related sensations, known as ‘paraesthesias’ that can become intolerable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An advantage in this absence of paraesthesia is that 10 kHz SCS provides the opportunity for sham-controlled and double-blind studies in the field of SCS, without the need for device modifications.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Our group has conducted an uncontrolled, multicentre, single-arm study in which 72 patients with significant low back pain with or without leg pain were implanted with a 10 kHz SCS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This was a mixed cohort of patients with and without prior spinal surgery. At 24 months, the mean reported visual analogue scale (VAS) score for back pain was 3.3 (SD 0.3) in 65 patients, compared with 8.4 (SD 0.1) at baseline (pre-implant) and 2.7 (SD 0.3) at 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A total of 60% of all patients were responders (&gt; 50% reduction in back pain) at 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. VAS is a psychometric response scale used to measure pain severity between 0 and 10 cm, with 10 cm indicating the worst imaginable pain experienced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similar improvements were observed in leg pain, disability and sleep, with marked reductions in medication intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par43">In a more recent multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), 10 kHz SCS therapy demonstrated superiority to conventional tonic SCS in the treatment of FBSS. A total of 198 participants with both back and leg pain were randomised to 10 KHz SCS or conventional SCS. The 10 kHz SCS decreased the back pain intensity by 67% compared to 44% in the conventional SCS arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This decrease was sustained at 24 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par44">The above-mentioned studies focused on neuropathic back pain in the context of patients with previous spinal surgery. However, a small subset of patients who had not received spine surgery and had received 10 kHz SCS therapy in these studies also experienced pain relief and functional improvements comparable to those of patients with FBSS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">We hypothesised that patients with CNLBP who had no prior spine surgery would benefit from 10 kHz SCS. To evaluate this hypothesis, we initially designed and conducted an open-label, uncontrolled, pilot study in 21 patients with CNLBP and no prior spine surgery. The 10 kHz SCS therapy significantly reduced the VAS for back pain intensity by a mean of 5.59 (SD 1.80) at 12 months in patients with medically refractory low back and with no past history of spine surgery. Of the implanted patients, 90% were classified as responders (i.e. VAS back pain reduction &gt; 50%) at 12 months. We also observed a significant increase in the physical function scores and health-related quality of life at one year post-10 kHz SCS implantation. The mean pain intensity was reduced by 73%, and the disability measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was reduced by 48%. Opioid medication intake decreased by 64%, and the mean EQ-5D quality of life scores improved from 0.16 to 0.47. Remarkably, 75% of patients were able to return to employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This improvement was sustained through the 3-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">To date 10 kHz SCS has not been formally tested against a sham therapy, which is needed to isolate the specific therapeutic effects from those induced by placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Possibly, some of the benefits reported may be nonspecific treatment effects (enhanced by a surgical procedure) or result from reporting bias in either the patient or assessor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We have therefore specifically designed this fully powered, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial of 10 kHz SCS to address this major methodological limitation of previous studies.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par47">Hypothesis: The addition of 10 kHz SCS to usual medical care (intervention group) will provide superior back pain relief, compared to sham stimulation plus usual medical care (control group) for CNLBP.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Aim: The overarching aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS in the treatment of CNLBP with no prior surgery.</p>

                <title>Patient and Public Involvement</title>
                <p id="Par52">We organised three Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) meetings to discuss research design elements that would be acceptable to patients for a condition that has been resistant to conventional medical management. On 8 April 2016 a PPIE event was held at the biannual scientific meeting of the UK Spine Societies (BritSpine). At this event 7 patients and 22 professionals attended a session to provide feedback and advice on this application. On 24 July 2015 Guy’s &amp; St Thomas’ Hospital hosted a PPIE meeting of participants from our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Eleven patients and their relatives attended. In addition, another 10 patients attended a subsequent meeting on 11 November 2016. The outline of the proposed study was presented during both meetings, where the patients were asked to enrol in the study and to give their general thoughts on the study methods. Two experienced facilitators from the local Research and Design Service (RDS) fielded questions on recruitment, comparison treatments, blinding, outcome measures and methods and the dissemination of results. Feedback was collected via assessment sheets, reviewed and incorporated into the study design. Patient and public engagement meetings occur annually through the duration of the study, with an additional dissemination meeting scheduled for the final year.</p>

                  <title>Removal of ‘Temporary Trial’ Phase from Design</title>
                  <p id="Par91">A trial of stimulation is often performed in standard care to eliminate non-responders prior to full implantation This temporary trial of stimulation is performed by implanting the leads and connecting them via a temporary extension to an external battery that the patient can wear for up to 2 weeks. This is a recommendation of the current NICE guidelines and the manufacturer’s device manual.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">RCT evidence does not support the role of temporary screening trials for stimulation in predicting long-term outcomes of the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Positive evidence exists of harm from temporary screening trails, including higher infection rates and the potential elimination of long-term responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our preliminary study on 10 kHz stimulation for patients with low back pain without prior surgery, we noted a trial success rate of 95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This high success rate was credited to more stringent patient selection, based on the characterisation of pain mechanisms and other clearly defined inclusion criteria. By removing the trial phase we reduce the number of procedures that patients undergo from two to one.</p>
                  <p id="Par93">Therefore, we assert that a pre-implantation trial of 10 kHz SCS in this population offers little clinical value and, instead, increases the costs and harms; in the context of the present trial, it would reduce the scientific value of this research.</p>

                  <title>Identification and Description of the Investigational Device</title>
                  <p id="Par94">The Senza™ System, a totally implantable SCS system that is intended to aid in the management of chronic intractable pain, received a European Union (EU) CE Mark in May 2010.</p>
                  <p id="Par95">The Senza System consists of a rechargeable implantable pulse generator (IPG) with 16 output channels. The IPG is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket and is capable of stimulating the spinal cord nerves when used with one or two 8-contact percutaneous leads. The IPG is controlled by a patient remote and/or a clinician programmer.</p>
                  <p id="Par96">Lead(s): The percutaneous lead has eight contacts.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Extension(s): An extension may be used during the permanent implantation procedure, to connect the lead to the IPG.</p>
                  <p id="Par98">IPG: The IPG is a rechargeable stimulator with 16 output terminals. Each of the 16 outputs can be programmed as a cathode or an anode. The IPG is powered by a 3.6 V nominal lithium-ion rechargeable battery. It is capable of stimulating the spinal cord nerves through the electrodes of the leads connected to any combination of the output terminals, using one programmable current source.</p>
                  <p id="Par99">Patient remote control: The patient remote control is a handheld battery operated unit that the participant can use to turn the stimulation on and off and to change the stimulation programs/settings.</p>
                  <p id="Par100">Charger: This charger is used to transcutaneously charge the IPG battery. It is a portable device powered by a rechargeable battery and can be held in one hand.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">Clinician programmer: The clinician programmer is an off-the-shelf laptop installed with proprietary software to allow the programming of the IPG and participant remote control.</p>
                  <p id="Par102">Lead anchors: Lead anchors may be used to secure the leads to the fascia, possibly preventing lead migration and/or lead strain.</p>
                  <p id="Par103">We will be using cascade programming in both groups; this involves four pairs of electrode groups and each pair is switched on for 5 s before the next pair is switched on (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Therefore, in 20 s, the whole lead has been activated and the cycle repeats. The rationale is that this avoids overstimulation, mitigates against small degrees of lead migration and removes any need for reprogramming. During the study, as both groups are programmed identically and reprogramming is not expected, the risk is reduced for unblinding and subsequent bias.

                <title>Device Implantation</title>
                <p id="Par104">Under standard operating theatre practice, all participants will be implanted with the following equipment: 10 kHz Senza IPG and two octopolar (8 contact) leads.</p>
                <p id="Par105">The first of the two leads will enter the epidural space through a lumbar or lower thoracic epidural puncture. The lead will be advanced cranially in the epidural space to reach a final position, where contacts 4 and 5 span the T9/10 disc space shown by Anterior-Posterior fluoroscopy in the anatomical midline as per our pilot experiment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A lateral image will be obtained to ensure the lead is placed posteriorly in the epidural space.</p>
                <p id="Par106">Once satisfactory epidural lead placement is confirmed, the lead will be anchored to the deep fascia or supraspinous ligament and a strain relief loop will be established. The active epidural lead will be tunnelled to a subcutaneous pocket for the battery using an extension if necessary. This subcutaneous pocket is made in the gluteal region via a small skin incision and blunt subcutaneous dissection. This pocket should be large enough to accommodate the IPG, extensions and sham lead. This active lead (AL) will be used to provide therapy to the intervention group. The AL will be connected to the first or top port of the IPG in all participants, and a second sham lead (SL) will be inserted subcutaneously and attached to the second port of the IPG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Impedances to check electrical integrity of the system will be performed at this time. Information will be given about wound care, and the device will remain ‘off’ until the participant’s next visit. Removal of sutures (if necessary) will be done at the implantation site.
<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Position of epidural lead (1), sham lead (2) and implantable Pulse Generator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3831_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par107">Possibly, the SCS will need removal or repair. Reasons for these actions include patient withdrawal from study, infection, hardware failure, lead migration, SCS-related pain, allergy or other adverse reaction to the device or requirement for an MRI scan.</p>
                <p id="Par108">If this occurs, the participant must consent to a further surgical procedure, which is a surgical process similar to that of implantation. With removal, all hardware will be removed, and with repair, the changes made to the SCS components will be determined by which component is unsatisfactory. The risk from these surgeries is similar to that of implantation, with an additional small risk that some of the components may not be safely removed.</p>
                <p id="Par109">All such procedures will be done by the study implanter.</p>

                  <p id="Par116">The screening visit will commence after each participant has been enrolled. During the screening visit, the following will be collected: eligibility assessment, participant demographics, medical history, pain map, pain severity on a 0-100 mm (VAS), painDETECT questionnaire, pregnancy test from all female participants of child-bearing potential, and pain medication usage.</p>
                  <p id="Par117">If a participant reports a painDETECT score lower than 19, they will be discontinued from the study. During the screening visit, participants will be provided with a multi-day diary. Participants will record their VAS back and leg pain scores for 7 days prior to the baseline visit.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and Device Activation</title>
                <p id="Par119">The randomisation and device activation visit will take place between 2 and 4 weeks post-implantation, pending proper wound healing.</p>
                <p id="Par120">Firstly, the following will be performed by blinded study personnel:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par121">Participants will be assessed to determine whether they have experienced any adverse events, and a case report form (CRF) will be completed, as applicable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par122">New x-ray images will be taken to record the lead locations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par123">Participants will be provided with a multi-day diary and instruct to record their VAS pain scores daily for 7 days prior to the 1-month follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par124">The participant’s device and lead will be programmed according to their allocated group; whereas the lead is different, the programming parameters used are identical and can be found in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par125">At this point, the participant enters the ‘follow-up’ phase of the study, with visits at 1, 3 and 6 months. These visit frequencies mirror our standard of care for routine clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="Par126">During these visits, all participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires in addition to bringing their multi-day pain diary:

                <p id="Par137">Any adverse events are monitored and documented in the CRF. An X-ray may be taken if there are any concerns about lead migration.</p>
                <p id="Par138">To check fidelity of blinding, participants and assessors will be asked to guess their treatment allocation at the end of the study. We will monitor potential outcome assessor blinding by asking them to guess each patient’s allocation at the end of each follow-up assessment.

                <title>Medication Usage</title>
                <p id="Par140">All medications prescribed for the treatment of pain will be recorded during the screening visit. Only participants who are on a stable dose of all prescribed pain medications for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and willing to maintain or decrease the dose of all prescribed pain medications are eligible for participation in this study. Any changes to an enrolled participant’s pain medications during the study will be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par141">The addition of pain medications for the relief of surgical discomfort after implant procedures is allowed. Pain medications prescribed for short-term post-operative pain management are not considered an increase in pain medications if the medication is ceased and the medication end date is prior to the date of randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par142">All medications used to treat adverse events (regardless of the reason prescribed) will be documented as interventions on the Event CRF.</p>

                <p id="Par143">For our primary outcome of pain severity VAS (0-100 mm), the Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) proposes a minimally important clinical difference (MICD) of 20 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To detect this MICD and based on a back/leg pain VAS standard deviation of 25 mm, as seen in previous conventional and 10Khz-SCS RCTs set at 90% power and 5% alpha, and a worst case attrition rate of 30% at 6-months follow up, we will need to recruit 96 participants (48 per centre) per group.</p>

Participant flow will be summarised using a flow diagram, which will report recruitment and drop-outs and baseline patient characteristics and outcome scores reported and compared by group. The primary analysis for the primary and secondary outcomes will take an intention-to-treat approach based on a between-group comparison of intervention and control participants with complete data at 6 months, with adjustments being made for the baseline outcome score and centre. In a secondary analysis we will extend the primary analysis model with a repeated measures comparison of groups at all follow-up points. We comprehensively examine patterns and reasons for the missing outcome data and undertake appropriate imputation models to assess the impact of missingness on primary analysis models. Results will be reported for between-group mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Safety outcomes will be reported descriptively by group. No correction of <italic>P</italic> values for multiplicity of testing will be undertaken. However, the primary outcome analysis will be performed before all other analyses, and the <italic>P</italic> values of all subsequent analyses will be interpreted in the context of multiple testing. No interim analyses are planned.</p>

                <title>Economic Evaluation Methods</title>
                <p id="Par149">The economic evaluation aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS plus usual medical care when compared to sham stimulation plus usual medical care. Healthcare resource utilisation, e.g. management of adverse events, interventions, investigations, medication, inpatient hospitalisations, Emergency Department and other health-care related visits, plus out-of-pocket costs and absences from work will be collected for each patient during the study follow-up period. Resources required for the implantation intervention will be recorded within the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par150">Items of resource use will be costed using national averages obtained from national sources (such as the Personal Social Services Research Unit, the British National Formulary and National Health Service (NHS) reference cost databases). Cost components will be combined to derive total patient level costs for the NHS. In addition, non-NHS costs such as productivity loss due to absence from work or patient out-of-pocket expenses will also be quantified to provide a full picture of how the strategies being compared will affect the financial burden imposed by the condition on both the NHS and the patients.</p>
                <p id="Par151">Generic health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data will be collected using the EQ-5D-5 L instrument. Both resource utilisation (costs) and EQ-5D-5 L will be collected at each follow-up visit. A within-trial cost consequence analysis will be carried out to estimate mean resource utilisation, costs, EQ-5D scores and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in each group, together with relevant measures of sampling uncertainty. QALYs will be calculated using the area under the curve approach, with regression-based adjustment for the baseline EQ-5D score.</p>
                <p id="Par152">The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-utility analysis to calculate the cost per additional QALY gained. Base-case analyses will be conducted from the NHS perspective, with additional analyses being conducted from the societal perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to explore the robustness of the results to plausible variations in key assumptions and variations in the analytical methods used. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed to show the probability that the intervention is cost-effective at specific thresholds of cost per QALY gained. The analyst will be blinded to the group allocation.</p>

                  <p id="Par155">We expect the risk of serious adverse events to be rare, and our results from the previous 10 kHz stimulation trial showed the risk of adverse events to be as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par156">Battery pocket pain 8%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par157">Wound infection 3%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par158">Electrode migration 5%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par159">Lead Fracture or malfunction 6%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par160">Headache from epidural puncture 1%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par161">Nerve injury &lt; 1%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par162">Spinal cord haematoma and abscess &lt; 1%</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par163">Unwanted, perceived stimulation &lt; 1%</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par164">Pocket pain is usually self-limiting within 6 months, and electrode migration is mitigated using cascade stimulation programming. Wound infection will necessitate the removal of the device. In some instances the system will require repair or removal. The reasons for this include infection, hardware displacement, pain or discomfort from the device, or device failure. The risks are similar to those mentioned above.</p>

                  <p id="Par167">If this occurs, the participant must consent to a further surgical procedure, and the surgical process is similar to that of implantation. With removal, all hardware will be removed, and with repair, the changes necessary to the SCS components will be determined by which component is unsatisfactory. The risk from these surgeries is similar to that of implantation, with a small risk that some of the components may not be safely removed. All such procedures will be done by the study implanter. Any adverse events are monitored and documented in the CRF.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par176">The results of this study will demonstrate whether the application of 10Khz-SCS in patients with CNLBP is a suitable alternative to conventional medical therapy. Multiple large-scale trials involving the use of SCS thus far have been industry-sponsored without the use of a placebo group. Many studies have chosen not to use a placebo arm with a high probability of unblinding due to the nature of SCS. The methods used in this trial attempt to ensure that unblinding does not take place. The sham lead positioned outside the epidural space ensures energy consumption without neurostimulation, requiring the patient to recharge the device. None of these participants will have had exposure to SCS prior to the trial, so the experience of the therapy will be novel. As this is the first trial to apply these concepts, the results will act as a support for future trials evaluating the efficacy of SCS in other pathologies.</p>
