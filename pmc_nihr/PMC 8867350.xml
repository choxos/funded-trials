                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental health condition associated with high mortality rates and significantly impaired quality of life. National guidelines outline psychotherapeutic interventions as treatments of choice for adults with AN, but outcomes are limited and therapy drop-out high, resulting in calls for new innovative treatments. The Specialist Psychotherapy with Emotion for Anorexia in Kent and Sussex (SPEAKS) research programme sought to develop the SPEAKS intervention avoiding some difficulties inherent in development of earlier interventions, such unclear hypotheses about change processes. SPEAKS focuses on a core hypothesised maintaining factor (emotional experience) with clear proposed model of change. The current feasibility trial aims to provide an initial test of SPEAKS and inform design of a full randomised controlled trial protocol.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study employs a multisite, single-arm, within-group, mixed-methods design. Up to 60 participants (36 therapy completers) meeting inclusion criteria will be offered the SPEAKS intervention instead of treatment-as-usual (TAU). SPEAKS is a weekly psychotherapy lasting nine to 12 months, provided by trained and experienced eating disorders therapists. All other clinical input remains inline with TAU. Acceptability will be assessed using VAS scales and end of therapy interview. Reach and recruitment, such as recruitment yield, will be monitored. To support sample size estimation and economic estimation, data pertaining to eating disorder-related symptoms will be recorded every 3 months, alongside service usage and intervention-specific measures. Videoed therapy sessions will inform model adherence. Additional analyses coding videoed therapy will test SPEAKS change process hypotheses.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness with poor prognosis and the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Early intervention is key, but is impeded by a delay of around 18 months from symptoms emerging to treatment, and with multiple relapses likely.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Caregiving for somebody with severe AN is almost twice as lengthy as for somebody with a physical health disorder (eg, cancer) or other mental health difficulty (eg, psychosis).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thus significant costs exist financially and emotionally to the individual, family and carers, as well as society as a whole, offering a ‘compelling case for change’ in services and treatment (PricewaterhouseCoopers, p.9).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
                <p>Most recent NICE guidelines in the UK recommend that psychotherapeutic interventions be considered for adults with AN.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Yet results from randomised controlled trials indicate that outpatient treatments do not out-perform each other or control comparisons<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref> with weight-restoration achieved by 20% of patients after 1 year.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> AN is highly valued by sufferers resulting in poor treatment engagement and high drop-out rates.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus there is an urgent need to develop innovative interventions that can engage people with AN,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 11 12</xref> while targeting unique factors involved in its development and maintenance.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Emotional experience has long been recognised as a factor in the development and maintenance of AN and is recognised as a promising target area for therapies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and increasingly incorporated into psychotherapy interventions for adults with AN.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–9</xref> However, outcomes remain limited and it is unclear to what extent emotional difficulties are targeted by these interventions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
                <p>This trial comprises part of the Specialist Psychotherapy with Emotion for Anorexia in Kent and Sussex (SPEAKS) programme which aimed to develop and test in a feasibility study an emotion focused intervention for adults with anorexia (the SPEAKS intervention). This research programme sought to overcome several key difficulties with the development and application of some earlier interventions, such as unsuccessful targeting of variables or lack of clarity on how change is achieved. The SPEAKS programme proposes focussing on a core clearly defined model with one key putative maintaining process (emotional experience in AN) and following an ‘interventionist-causal model approach’.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> By developing a new model of the development and maintenance of AN drawn from integration of quantitative and qualitative research, it seeks to ensure an emotions’ focus.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The SPEAKS intervention hypothesises a clear and testable change process to be targeted in therapy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; thus affording the ability to examine proposed mechanisms of change enabling further evidence-based development and refinement of the model. This body of work involved close partnering with stakeholders including those with current and past experience of AN, families, therapists and service managers.</p>

                  <title>Speaks intervention</title>
                  <p>SPEAKS is an individual outpatient psychotherapy for adults with AN. Participants receive weekly individual sessions of psychotherapy for 9–12 months with two follow-up sessions within 3 months of completion. SPEAKS is intended to be offered face to face in a clinic setting; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic video sessions via on an online platform are provided.</p>
                  <p>SPEAKS is a direct replacement for psychotherapy as usual. Therapists receive fortnightly supervision by supervisors trained in the supervision requirements of SPEAKS. The services at both sites are in the same region of the UK and follow national NHS treatment guidelines. All usual care procedures, including additional interventions such as dietician appointments or inpatient referrals will remain the same, but be reported. People will be removed from the trial if they require immediate inpatient treatment at any point or request removal for any reason, and these data will be reported.</p>

                  <title>Intervention development</title>
                  <p>The development of SPEAKS is consistent with MRC guidance for complex interventions.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> SPEAKS was developed following a clear programme of research to integrate quantitative and qualitative data to achieve an initial model of the presentation (lost emotional self)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and potential necessary elements for therapeutic change (eg, Drinkwater <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, in prep). This resulted in a clear hypothesised change process to be targeted in therapy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> SPEAKS is organised into five phases, with associated mechanisms of change and therapeutic ‘tasks’ (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref> for brief overview). The intervention developers (AO, TL nd HS) applied relevant psychological therapy models to target highlighted mechanisms, resulting in an integrative therapy drawing chiefly from EFT and ST. The therapy thus relies on dialogical self theory, and therapeutic tasks are those well established in EFT and ST, such as ‘chairwork’ interventions to enable ‘parts of self’ to communicate.</p>

It outlines SPEAKS change process, mapping it onto expected ‘phases’ of therapy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). In each phase, associated hypothesised mechanisms are outlined and ‘therapeutic tasks’ described.

Collecting questionnaire data every 3 months is standard practice within the EDS. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, some participants experienced a break in their SPEAKS therapy. In order to ensure that all participants are able to access the full 9–12 months of therapy intended, therapy will be extended for those impacted by a maximum of 3 months. Where relevant, this will be discussed and agreed between therapist and participant. In order to capture end of therapy data for those affected, we will include an extra data collection time point at 15 months just for these participants. The 15 months data collection point will be considered equivalent to the 12 months time point of unaffected participants, with other assessment time points adjusted accordingly to ensure progress is captured every 3 months within therapy.</p>

                <p>Patients will be consecutive referrals meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria to the two sites in South-East England: North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) and Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SPFT). Participants will be identified from waiting lists in the first instance in order of referral. Recruitment will continue until SPEAKS therapists no longer have available spaces and will recommence when further spaces come available. Recruitment ended in February 2021. This was after journal submission, but prior to completion of peer reviews.</p>

                <p>PPI has been in place since the inception of the study before trial funding was sought. An initial Research Design Service PPI Grant covered costs of a consultation series to assess SPEAKS model and trial validity. This informed intervention development, study design and the SPEAKS name. Following trial funding, feedback on key documents such as the plain English summary and participant information sheets (PIS) were obtained via contacts made in this initial consultation. Further, PPI input continues throughout the study via the RSG and in open feedback events at key stages of the study advertised via local charity and support group networks.</p>

                <p>Protocol violations such as hospital admission are recorded as per Trust guidance, and logged in trial records for reporting. Participants admitted to hospital will be withdrawn from the study. All research staff are NIHR Good Clinical Practice (GCP) trained and follow these guidelines for safety reporting procedures. Due to the feasibility design, there are no interim analyses or stopping guidelines; however, therapists monitor participant safety with regular risk assessments and communicate to the research team. Events leading to participants or others experiencing potential or actual serious harm are recorded by the researcher and reported to the PI and sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Decision on expectedness and relatedness to the study intervention will be taken, with further investigation as required. The PI and sponsor will monitor events in case a pattern emerges, taking action if necessary. Clinical risk will be managed within ED service guidelines. Following completion of trial participation, all usual clinical service and NHS Trust SOP continue to apply with post-trial care continuing if clinically indicated. During the trial all usual Trust complaint procedures can be followed.</p>

              <p>This SPEAKS feasibility trial aims to assess acceptability, research and recruitment, sample size estimation and initial economic indications of the SPEAKS intervention for adults with AN Otherwise Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder-AN type. It also tests the hypothesised change process of the SPEAKS intervention.</p>

                <title>Potential implications</title>
                <p>This first test of the SPEAKS intervention will provide initial indication of the feasibility of SPEAKS and inform whether progression to larger trials is appropriate. Change process analyses will provide valuable insights into SPEAKS hypotheses, informing refinement of the intervention, while also contributing to broader evidence-base of relevant change processes for adults with AN.</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p>This feasibility trial is strengthened by multi-site design. Furthermore, sites included are relatively research naïve in delivery of clinical trials facilitating realistic insights into the feasibility of intervention delivery within naturalistic NHS services. Inclusion of consecutive referrals enables broad spectrum of participants across AN and OSFED severity and presentations, increasing generalisability. Robust measures to facilitate adherence to the model are included.</p>

                <title>Challenges</title>
                <p>SPEAKS is an experiential, relational model, designed for face-to-face settings. This trial began in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in therapy sessions moving indefinitely to online video platforms with most participants never meeting their therapist in person. People with AN are often regarded as ‘difficult to engage’ and have high levels of therapy dropout, thus issues of engagement with clinical and research protocols are a challenge even without this context. These factors may affect outcomes or length of delivery.</p>
