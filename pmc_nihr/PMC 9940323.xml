                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Peer support is effective in improving psychological well-being of family caregivers of people with conditions such as dementia, cancer, and brain injury. However, there are limited data on effective psychological interventions for family caregivers of people living with motor neurone disease. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a virtual peer support programme for improving caregiver psychological wellbeing and caregiving related outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a multi-centre parallel group randomised controlled superiority trial. Using a multi-modal recruitment strategy, we will recruit informal caregivers from UK MND clinics, in-patient units, and hospices. We will randomise (1:1, stratified by gender) participants to either a 12-week virtual peer support programme or usual care comprising provision of online information resources publicly available via the MND Association website. Peer support programme elements will be delivered via a secure digital e-platform aTouchAway™ (Aetonix, Canada). Our target sample size is 160 (80 each arm). Our primary outcome is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessed at 12 weeks (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes that will also be assessed at 12 weeks include the Zarit Burden Interview, Pearlin Mastery Scale, Personal Gain Scale, Positive Affect Scale, and the Brief COPE. Outcome assessors will be blinded to allocation. Tertiary outcomes include perceived usability (1 item 9-point Likert scale) and acceptability (semi-structured qualitative interviews) of the peer support programme. Intervention fidelity measures will comprise frequency, type (text, audio, video), and duration (audio and video) of peer support contact downloaded from the aTouchAway AWS server. We will use a mixed-effects linear model to test the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression. We have ethical approval (21/NW/0269) from the North-West Research Ethics Committee, UK.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This single-blinded randomised controlled trial will determine the effect of a virtual peer support programme on caregiver psychological wellbeing and caregiver burden. This study will examine the impact of a virtual peer support intervention on quality-of-life measures in informal caregivers of individuals with MND living in the community.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par28">Across the world, patient care is frequently reliant on informal caregivers to provide care at home. An informal carer is someone who provides unpaid help and support to a dependent person with whom they have a social relationship. The type of informal care delivered is diverse, varying in terms of most responsible diagnosis, multimorbidity, complexity of care, cumulative time spent caring, and the availability of support/information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the UK, an estimated 2.1 million people take on a caring role for a family member or friend every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Motor neuron disease (MND) is a life-limiting neurological disease that has a terminal diagnosis and is characterised by progressive muscle wasting, gradual paralysis, and respiratory failure. Death generally occurs 2 to 5 years from diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rapid and unpredictable physical deterioration demands in addition to coping with distress require ongoing adaption of informal caregivers to assume increasing care responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although assistive technology such as mechanical ventilation supports independent living in the community reducing the need for formal health and support services, informal caregivers can experience an exceptional care burden and are less likely to be able to access existing personal support networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This means psychosocial support needs to be sought elsewhere.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Appropriate psychosocial support is a key enabler for caregivers to maintain their wellbeing and to continue providing care at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Psychosocial interventions include different modalities of psychotherapy and counselling, case management, and structured peer support. Two randomised controlled trials (RCT) conducted in the Netherlands investigated case management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as interventions for family caregivers of people living with MND. Both found minimal impact of these interventions on outcomes such as perceived burden and quality of life. Caregivers of technology dependent people with MND may experience difficulties in accessing interventions that require in-person attendance because of geographic limitations, time constraints associated with caring, economic burden, and unavailability of respite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This in turn increases psychological distress.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Peer-to-peer support is based on the premise that individuals who have lived experience are in a unique position to understand and provide invaluable insight to individuals going through a similar experience in the present. Peer support consists of emotional (e.g. expressions of caring, empathy and reassurance), informational (e.g. advice, suggestions, factual input, and feedback), and affirmational (e.g. affirmation of feelings and behaviours, reassurance that frustrations can be managed) support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The experiential and relational aspect of homophily-driven peer affiliation creates supportive relationships with potential to improve quality of life and wellbeing by decreasing feelings of isolation, improving mood, buffering stress, creating a sense of empowerment, and increasing self-efficacy. Peer support can also serve to inhibit maladaptive behaviours and promote adaptive coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par32">Web-based applications to support informal caregivers have emerged as cost-effective, accessible, and convenient interventions. Informal caregivers perceive online peer-support as a beneficial resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MND is a rare condition and carers may experience loneliness and isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Support from people in similar circumstances can be encouraging. Therefore digital peer-to-peer support is a promising interactive psychosocial intervention that is accessible and convenient for people with high caregiving demands.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par33">The primary trial objective is to determine the effectiveness of a virtual peer-to-peer support programme on psychological distress of informal caregivers of people with MND as measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) which is collected at baseline, week 6 (mid-trial), and week 12 (end of trial participation). Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of the peer support intervention on caregiving outcomes including the effect on caregiver burden, mastery, personal gain, and coping strategies. Tertiary objectives are to determine process outcomes including intervention acceptability, usability, and fidelity.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par34">This is a non-commercial multi-centre, parallel group, single-blinded (outcome assessor) 1:1 randomised controlled superiority trial that aims to determine the efficacy of a 12-week virtual peer-to-peer support programme on informal caregiver psychological wellbeing and caregiver burden. We will include process measures to describe fidelity and qualitative semi-structured interviews to explore intervention acceptability.</p>

                  <p id="Par41">The 12-week virtual peer support programme will be hosted via the secure digital e-platform aTouchAway (Aetonix, Canada). Each participant will be assigned a peer supporter by the research team. Participants will be advised to engage with their peer supporter at a minimum of once a week and utilise all elements of the programme including text messaging, audio/video calling, and group chat features of the aTouchAway app. Participants will also be expected to join a minimum of seven of the 12 weekly synchronous discussion forums.</p>

Training will include four 90-min virtual training sessions covering topics such as responsibilities as a peer supporter, boundary setting, managing risk, empathetic communication, and peer support at end of life, as well as use of the aTouchAway app. A check in/debrief session with the study team will be offered to peer supporters every 4 weeks. Intervention participants will receive a one-to-one introduction to the virtual peer support programme and a resource manual on the peer support intervention.</p>

                  <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                  <p id="Par43">The study does not involve patients as participants and the intervention is considered low risk. Therefore, we do not anticipate the need to discontinue or modify the intervention itself. We do not anticipate serious adverse events resulting from the intervention; however, it is possible that participants may experience psychological distress due to their caregiving situation. In such cases, we will advise the study participant to make a GP appointment. Given the rapidly progressive nature of MND, it is feasible that a caregiver may experience death of the person for whom they provide care. In this event, we will ask the participant if they still wish to continue receiving peer support. Request to make a GP appointment and death of a care recipient will be documented as an adverse event. Peer supporters may experience difficulties or conflict with a study participant and may require reassignment. In additional, unanticipated life events may result in a peer supporter to request to withdraw from the role. We will document these events as adverse events. All peer supporters will be given the opportunity to participate in the semi-structured qualitative interviews exploring their experience as a peer supporter.</p>

                  <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                  <p id="Par44">We will instruct peer supporters to set expectations and boundaries in terms of frequency and timing of contact in accordance with their personal preferences. We will also instruct peer supporters to contact their allocated study participant a minimum of once a week and let the research team know if no contact is received. Participants are provided the same instructions. Peer supporters will have access to a senior clinical member of the research team throughout the programme with whom they can share any concerns about themselves or their assigned participant. The research team will provide a peer supporter debriefing session every 4 weeks to give them an opportunity to discuss any issues in relation to their peer supporter role within the trial and to discuss solutions.</p>

                  <p id="Par45">Participation in other studies is not an exclusion but will be assessed by the research team for appropriateness, i.e. participation in a research trial of another intervention designed to provide psychological support. Participants will not be prohibited from accessing other support resources such as the MND Association Visitor programme or family caregiver drop-in sessions hosted by other organisations. We will only enrol one informal caregiver participant for each individual with MND.</p>

Those participants requiring ongoing support will be signposted to the MND Association Visitors programme and the open educational resources available publicly on their website. Although participants randomised to the peer support programme will have the aTouchAway app disconnected upon programme completion, we will not prohibit informal arrangements to continue a peer support relationship if the peer supporter is in agreement.</p>

                  <title>Outcomes {12}</title>
                  <p id="Par47">The primary outcome is as follows: the study primary outcome is total HADS score at 12 weeks. The HADS is assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks to compare the two treatment groups. The HADS consists of a 14-item self-report scale with seven items on the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and seven items on the depression subscale (HADS-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Each item is scored on a 4-point (0–3) response category scale with total scores ranging from 0 [best] to 21 [worst] for each subscale, with cutoff points of &gt; 7 and &gt; 10 indicating possible or probable anxiety and depression. Two items from the HADS-A and four items from the HADS-D are reversed scored. The HADS was selected as the primary outcome as it has been extensively validated and used previously in numerous caregiver populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], including caregivers of people with MND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Importantly, it has previously been used in studies that evaluated the effect of internet-based interventions designed to mitigate negative mental health outcomes associated with caregiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The HADS is also the primary outcome of a randomised controlled trial on the effectiveness of a blended psychosocial support programme for informal caregivers of individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The HADS has good acceptability, reliability, (Cronbach’s alpha from 0.72 to 0.93), validity, and discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par48">The secondary outcomes are as follows: Pearlin’s stress process model of informal caregiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] informed selection of secondary outcome measures. This model considers various factors which may interact and determine how an individual reacts to the role of caregiving. These are as follows: (1) contextual factors (e.g. sociodemographic characteristics) or variables related to caregiving (e.g. duration of caregiving role); (2) primary stress factors directly related to the health of the care recipient and the degree of the care needed; (3) secondary stress factors beyond the caregiving role such as restriction of social life, difficulties at work, or financial strain; and (4) mediating and moderating factors that can determine how well an individual copes with their caregiver role. Stress factors may be objective (e.g. cognitive impairment) or subjective (e.g. perception of overload). These factors, together with coping strategies, personal mastery, social support, beliefs, and values influence health outcomes such as well-being, depression, anxiety, burden, and may account for variability in the health consequences the caregiver experience.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">We will use the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to assess subjective burden or stress associated with caregiving. The ZBI consists of 22 items with five ordered frequency-related response categories scored 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always). All 22 items are used to calculate a total score that ranges between 0 and 88. A score of ≥ 24 reflects high burden; a score of &lt; 24 indicates low burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We will use the 10-item Positive Affect Scale of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] to measure positive affect. Scores range from 10 to 50; higher scores indicate better psychological well-being. The Pearlin Mastery Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] is a 7-item scale with scores from 7 to 28. We will use this scale to assess caregiver sense of control over life. Individuals with a high sense of mastery believe in their power to influence the environment and bring about desired outcomes; those with low mastery feel less able to control events and circumstances of their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The Personal Gain Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] is a 4-item scale with scores range from 4 to 16. We will this scale to determine discovery of inner strengths through providing care. The Brief COPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] scale is a 28-item scale grouped into three overarching coping styles: problem focused, emotion focused, and avoidant. This scale will be used to assess frequency of various coping strategies. The Caregiver Assistance Scale (CAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] will be used to determine any changes in the level of assistance with daily activities and medical care provided by the informal caregiver. Scores on the CAS range from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating more caregiving assistance. The Caregiving Impact Scale (CIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] will be used to determine the impact of provision of care on the caregivers’ ability to maintain participation in valued activities. Scores on the CIS range from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicating that providing care interferes with caregivers’ abilities to maintain participation in valued activities.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">Additionally, participants randomised to the intervention arm will be asked to rate the usability of the virtual peer-to-peer support programme on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from difficult to easy. Participants will be asked to perform this rating on completion of the 12-week programme. Intervention fidelity will be assessed by (1) determining the extent of participant contribution to the three facets of the peer support programme: synchronous discussion forum, private chat, and asynchronous group chat; (2) evaluating communication activities, i.e. number (text), and number and duration of audio and video calls; and by (3) determining attrition rate and reasons for study discontinuation.</p>

                  <p id="Par51">We will collect demographic and caregiving history from both trial participants and peer supporters. Data will include age, gender, relationship to the person with MND they care for (or cared for in the case of peer supporters), educational level, employment status, previous experience with caregiving, and duration of their caregiving relationship. For trial participants, we will also collect data on the number of informal (unpaid) caregivers for the person with MND they provide care for and the amount (hours) of formal (paid) caregiving received from health and/or social care workers. We will collect the following measures at baseline and at 12 weeks (programme end): HADS, PANAS, ZBI, Pearlin Mastery Scale, Personal Gain Scale, Brief COPE, CAS, and CIS (only at baseline). We will also collect the HADS and the ZBI at 6 weeks (programme midpoint).</p>
                  <p id="Par52">Demographics data and participant-reported outcome measures will be collected using a secure web-based survey platform (Qualtrics). Participants will be sent Qualtrics autogenerated secure questionnaire links at the study time points. Participants not comfortable with e-questionnaires will be provided the opportunity to answer the questionnaires over the telephone with the blinded research officer. If requested, we will also post copies of questionnaires. All data entered into Qualtrics will be exported to the study database hosted on the electronic data capture (EDC) system Castor v.15.81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par53">We will collect the following endpoints at 12 weeks (programme end) from intervention arm participants only: (1) perceived usability of the peer-to-peer support programme using a 1-item 9-point Likert Scale using a Qualtrics autogenerated questionnaire link emailed to intervention participants; (2) acceptability of the peer-to-peer support programme (in a subset of intervention participants and peer supporters) via semi-structured qualitative interviews (digitally recorded and professionally transcribed) using topic guides informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; and (3) usage metrics for both intervention participants and peer supporters will be downloaded from the aTouchAway platform. Usage metrics will comprise the following: (i) the frequency and type (text, audio, video) of peer-to-peer contact each week and overall for the 12-week programme; for audio and video contacts, we will also capture the duration of contact; (ii) the frequency of participation in a synchronous or asynchronous discussion forum; and (iii) discontinuation of the programme before 12 weeks and the week discontinued.</p>
                  <p id="Par54">We will offer the opportunity to participate in a one-on-one telephone semi-structured interview to intervention participants and peer supporters, until we reach data saturation. Maximum variation sampling will be used to ensure a minimum of two participants representing caregiver variables including age (≤ 65; &gt; 65), sex (male; female), and relationship to care-recipient (spouse, child, parent, other). We will offer the opportunity to participate in an interview at the end of a 12-week intervention period to study participants and peer supporters.</p>

                  <p id="Par56">To determine sample size estimates, we used the sample size calculation method used in the previously published De Wit trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The De Wit trial sample size is based on HADS data from a longitudinal study of MND informal caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To test for a medium size effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.5) at 5% level of significance (two-sided) with 80% power would require 64 participants in each arm (128 in total) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To find an adjusted sample size “<italic>N</italic>” from a calculated sample size “<italic>n</italic>” and an estimated attrition rate “<italic>x</italic>”, we used the following formula: <italic>N</italic> = <italic>n</italic>/(1-<italic>x</italic>). We adjusted the sample size for 20% attrition to get a total sample size of 128/(1–0.2) = 160 (80 in each arm). We determined the sample size for the semi-structure qualitative interviews using recommendations for deciding saturation in theory-based interview studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We will recruit a minimum sample of 20–30 participants and 15–20 peer supporters. We will adjust the sample size using a stopping criterion of three consecutive interviews with no additional material to terminate data collection.</p>

The research team will recruit participants directly from the MND clinics of the main study site. Participant Identification Centre sites will provide study recruitment materials (recruitment flyer and the participant information sheet) to potential participants during their attendance accompanying their relative with MND to a virtual or in-person clinic appointment. Consent-to-contact will be collected from family caregivers expressing interest in participation. Interested informal caregivers will then be contacted by the central research team to explain the study, to obtain informed consent, and to collect baseline data. The MND Association and Marie Curie Charity will advertise on their websites, newsletters, and discussion forums. We will also post recruitment notices and study updates on our dedicated Twitter account. We will post trial information on other relevant forums including Health Watch-UK, healthtalk.org, and the King’s College London research volunteer newsletter. We will encourage snowballing recruitment methods. Peer supporters will be primarily recruited from the MND Association Visitors programme and other MND Association awareness campaigns.</p>

                  <p id="Par69">We will conduct analyses on an intention to treat (ITT) basis according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan (SAP) authored by the trial statistician and approved by the trial steering committee prior to database lock. The ITT population will be defined as all participants randomised with at least one post-baseline outcome assessment of the HADS. The per protocol population (PPP) will be defined as all patients meeting the ITT that adequately followed the protocol. Participants deemed to have breached the protocol will be recorded as protocol violators and removed from the PPP. To test the effect of the peer-support intervention on the primary outcome (caregiver psychological distress as measured by the HADS total score), we will use a mixed effects linear model adjusting for the fixed effects of HADS at baseline, group allocation (intervention/control), baseline caregiving assistance scale score, baseline Caregiving Impact Scale scores, number of informal caregivers, age, gender (female/other), and if the patient died during the study before the final follow-up. Participants will be fitted with random effect across both week 6 and 12 HADS measurement. The analysis will be presented as the adjusted mean difference between intervention and control arms with a 95% confidence interval and <italic>p</italic>-value at 12 weeks.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">The ZBI captured post-randomisation at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks will be analysed using mixed effects linear model adjusting for fixed effects as per the primary outcome analysis. Secondary continuous outcomes captured post-randomisation at 12 weeks (Positive Affect Scale, Pearlin Mastery Scale, Personal Gain Scale, Brief COPE total score) will be analysed using linear models with random effect for participant but without the same fixed effects as in the primary analysis model. Binary outcomes such as proportion of participants scoring &gt; 10 in the HADS-A and HADS-D will be assessed using logistic regression models in a similar manner as the primary analysis and presented as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. All tests will be two sided. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant for the primary outcome. We will use Stata (V15 or higher) and R for analyses and graphical representation.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">We will employ a directed content analysis approach for the qualitative analysis, as outlined by Bengtsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Summative content analysis will be performed to contextualize patterns in the data informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

We will assess model residuals for normality. We will perform a bootstrap analysis if the residuals (observed minus predicted value) deviate noticeably from normality. In the event of a very low intervention compliance, a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis for the primary HADS outcome will be considered to investigate the effect on individuals who complied with the intervention.

              <p id="Par88">In this trial, we will investigate the effect of a peer support programme delivered through the e-platform aTouchAway™ on informal caregiver psychological health and caregiver burden. The rapid and progressive nature of the MND cause psychological distress to informal caregivers of individuals and can intensify informal caregiver feelings of helplessness and need for psychosocial support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Digital interventions can provide informal caregivers with remote access to a psychosocial support network and may contribute to a more positive caregiving experience. We hypothesise our 12-week virtual peer support programme will improve psychological health and alleviate caregiver burden.</p>
              <p id="Par89">To tailor the peer support programme in accordance with MND caregiver needs, we have collaborated with the MND Association, caregiver advisory groups and consulted with several informal caregivers over the past two years. Anticipated challenges include time constraints for caregivers to participate in peer support and provide study data as well as low digital literacy. We will facilitate data collection through multi-modal and flexible methods. Digital inclusion will be supported though loaning of 4G enabled Android tablets to those without devices if required. In summary, this trial will provide important data on a digital peer support programme specifically designed as a tool to improve psychological health and support informal caregivers of individuals living with MND.</p>
