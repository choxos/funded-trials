              <abstract>
                <p>Despite increased prevalence of domestic violence and abuse (DVA), victimization
through DVA often remains undetected in mental health care. To estimate the
effectiveness of a system provider level training intervention by comparing the
detection and referral rates of DVA of intervention community mental health
(CMH) teams with rates in control CMH teams. We also aimed to determine whether
improvements in knowledge, skills and attitudes to DVA were greater in
clinicians working in intervention CMH teams than those working in control
teams. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in two urban areas of
the Netherlands. Detection and referral rates were assessed at baseline and at 6
and 12 months after the start of the intervention. DVA knowledge, skills and
attitudes were assessed using a survey at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after
start of the intervention. Electronic patient files were used to identify
detected and referred cases of DVA. Outcomes were compared between the
intervention and control teams using a generalized linear mixed model. During
the 12-month follow-up, detection and referral rates did not differ between the
intervention and control teams. However, improvements in knowledge, skills and
attitude during that follow-up period were greater in intervention teams than in
control teams: β 3.21 (95% CI 1.18-4.60). Our trial showed that a training
program on DVA knowledge and skills in CMH teams can increase knowledge and
attitude towards DVA. However, our intervention does not appear to increase the
detection or referral rates of DVA in patients with a severe mental illness. A
low detection rate of DVA remains a major problem. Interventions with more
obligatory elements and a focus on improving communication between CMH teams and
DVA services are recommended.</p>

              <p>Contrary to popular belief, preexisting mental illness is associated with a higher
risk of DVA victimization. This association is much higher than the association with
mental illness and DVA perpetration (<xref rid="bibr24-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Khalifeh &amp; Dean, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Swartz &amp; Bhattacharya,

(SMI) patients are three times more at risk to be a victim of personal violence
compared to the general population (<xref rid="bibr23-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Kamperman et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in
the general population, men are more often perpetrators of DVA and women are more
often victims. However, in SMI patients this difference is greatly reduced as both
genders are at a high risk of victimization of DVA (<xref rid="bibr5-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Carmo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Jonas et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies have
shown that male SMI patients are more likely to be a victim of DVA compared to the
general population (<xref rid="bibr25-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Khalifeh et
al., 2015</xref>), while they are also less likely to seek help (<xref rid="bibr21-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Huntley et al., 2019</xref>).
Most interventions are focused on female victims of DVA, and very little
interventions are geared toward both genders (<xref rid="bibr32-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Rivas et al., 2019</xref>), consequently creating
a gap in literature and interventions for DVA victims.</p>
              <p>Despite the high risk of victimization, only 10% to 30% of all victims of DVA are
detected in mental health care (<xref rid="bibr20-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2010</xref>). This indicates that a large group of SMI patients
will not receive the care they need. In response, universal DVA screening has been
proposed and studied as a means to address the issue (<xref rid="bibr28-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">O’Doherty et al., 2014</xref>). In their
meta-analysis, <xref rid="bibr28-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">O’Doherty et
al., (2014)</xref> conclude that universal screening increases detection of DVA
at antenatal clinics. However, the findings did not hold in the context of hospital
outpatient screening. They conclude that studies on universal screening so far have
been successful in finding only a modest amount of absolute cases, especially
considering the high prevalence of DVA victimization (<xref rid="bibr47-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p>Reasons for the low DVA detection rates in mental health care vary ranging from a
lack of knowledge about DVA to not finding DVA a priority in the treatment of mental
illness (<xref rid="bibr33-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al.,
2011</xref>). As previously mentioned, males are likely to be considered
perpetrators of DVA, even though their SMI status makes them more vulnerable to
becoming victims. This knowledge gap is problematic as current detection tools are
not sensitive to differences arising from gender (<xref rid="bibr1-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Arkins et al., 2016</xref>). It is important,
therefore, to target both male and female patients when screening for DVA,
especially in the context of mental health care. Another source of concern is that
interventions often target narrowly defined elements of the health care system
instead of operating at a wider systems level. This has been identified as effective
ground for improvement, in response of which interventions have started
incorporating training for all staff in a health care system (<xref rid="bibr13-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Ghandour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Hamberger et al., 2015</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr12-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Moreno et al.,
2015</xref>). Furthermore, previous system-level programs were shown to be both
effective and sustainable by implementing a training course for clinicians about
detection of patients who are victim of DVA, along with the provision of a referral
and care pathway and also include training for DVA professionals on mental health
further along the referral line (<xref rid="bibr10-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Feder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Trevillion et al., 2014</xref>). The training on
mental health for DVA professionals is key to increase a mutual understanding
between mental health care professionals and DVA professionals which would improve
collaboration and ultimately could greatly increase health care for SMI patients
and/or victims of DVA (<xref rid="bibr10-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Feder et
al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr45-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Trevillion et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the possible life-long
consequences of victimization of DVA for people with SMI, the detection and
treatment of DVA needs to be improved by both being sensitive to gender differences
and introducing interventions at a system level. In mental health care so far, no
studies have launched a system-level intervention.</p>
              <p>The current Better Reduction and Assessment of Violence (BRAVE) study is the first
full-scale cluster randomized controlled trial aiming at improving detection and
referrals on DVA in mental health care, using a gender sensitive, system-level
program that targeted community mental health (CMH) teams, and also provided mental
health training for DVA professionals.</p>

              <title>Aims</title>
              <p>We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial using a DVA intervention developed
for this study called the BRAVE intervention. On a system level, our aim was to
compare the detection and referral rates of DVA of CMH teams who received the BRAVE
intervention and those in the control condition who did not. We expected the
detection and referral rates of DVA to increase more in the intervention condition
than in the control condition. On an individual level, we also aimed to determine
whether clinicians in the intervention group showed comparatively higher
improvements in (a) knowledge; (b) perceived knowledge; (c) skills in handling DVA;
and finally (d) attitudes toward DVA.</p>

                <title>Participants and Study Setting</title>
                <p>The trial period was from February 2016 to February 2017 for all Rotterdam teams
and February 2017 to February 2018 for all The Hague teams. Participation in the
BRAVE study was voluntary, and consent was assumed from participation. The
delayed start of The Hague teams was the consequence of organizational changes
among participating CMH institutions in an early phase of the project before
randomization. A typical CMH team consists of 9-14 of diverse mental health
clinicians. The composition of each team varies slightly, but each team employs
a psychiatrist, psychologists, general nurses, social psychiatric nurses, and
social workers. Teams that provided outpatient care to SMI patients 18 years or
older, with ≤ 20% of employees working in more than one team and who had a
functioning electronic patient file (EPF) with at least 12 months of historic
data, were eligible for the study. The included CMH teams had a mean caseload of
195 patients.</p>
                <p>The Medical Ethical Committee (METC) of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands granted ethical approval for this study (approval granted on
10th of June 2015, MEC-2015-409). The study protocol has been published
previously (<xref rid="bibr34-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Ruijne et al.,
2017</xref>). Team managers and the board directors of the participating
institutions provided consent for participation of the CMH teams. Since the
intervention was aimed at the clinician working in CMH teams, the METC did not
find informed consent from patients necessary. The trial has been registered on
the ISRCTN register (number: ISRCTN14115257). This article is reported according

                <p>In this cluster randomized controlled trial, we studied the impact of the BRAVE
intervention in CMH teams on the detection and referral rates of DVA in SMI
patients. CMH teams from the Rotterdam and The Hague area functioned as
clusters. Rotterdam and The Hague are two major and ethnically diverse cities in
the Netherlands. We randomly assigned 24 CMH teams to the BRAVE intervention or
to the control condition with an allocation ratio of 1:1 (Figure A.1).
Randomization was performed with block sizes of 2, using a web-based
computer-generated scheme in ten-ALEA (randomization software version 2.2) by an
independent researcher. The socioeconomic status of the service region of each
included CMH team (dichotomized into high vs. low) was used as stratification
factor. Due to the nature of our intervention, it was not possible to blind the
CMH teams for allocation status.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The BRAVE intervention consists of three parts: (a) a training course for CMH
teams to increase knowledge, attitudes, and skills in managing DVA, (b) a
knowledge, attitudes, and skills training course on mental illness for DVA
professionals, and (c) the provision and implementation of a direct care
referral pathway between CMH services and DVA services for victims of DVA. The
BRAVE intervention is based on the successful LARA intervention (<xref rid="bibr45-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Trevillion et al.,
2014</xref>) and adapted to the Dutch context and circumstances and has

received an eight-hour training course, divided into two four-hour
sessions. The training course is based on two clinical handbooks for
health care for victims of domestic violence and abuse or sexual
violence and amended to fit our patient population (<xref rid="bibr44-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Tobler et al.,
2008</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization,

both male as female victims of DVA and mental health patients. The
training met the standards for courses on DVA of the World
Psychiatry Association (<xref rid="bibr31-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2003</xref>).
The training covered four themes: (a) facts and theories about DVA;
(b) identification and documentation techniques for the assessment
of DVA; (c) safety for both patient as CMH clinician; and (d)
treatment and/or follow-up which consisted of a referral pathway and
proposes strategies to empower and support patients who are victims
of DVA. The training consisted of lectures, documentary media, and
interactive workshops among other similar teaching methods. The
information in the training focused on both male and female victims
and also addressed possible cultural differences participants could
notice in their diverse patient population. Participants were
informed about the mandatory Dutch decision-making process for
referral after DVA is detected or suspected. During the training and
follow-up period we recommended participants to add questions about
DVA to their routine enquiry and report detected cases of DVA in a
special DVA form embedded in the EPF. Additionally, participants
received a referral pathway with the details and contact information
of shelters and DVA services for victims or perpetrators of DVA.
Mean attendance rate per team was 86% (range 67%-100%). After the
training all CMH clinicians in the intervention teams received a
handout of the training and were provided with various documents
with information about local DVA services and ways (e.g., an app,
documents) for reminding them to inquire about DVA with their
patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Knowledge, attitudes and skills training on mental health for

of system-level intervention, instead of exclusive focus on one
element, in this case the CMH teams. To expand the intervention to
the wider system, DVA professionals working in the municipality of
Rotterdam also received four, three-hour workshops about mental
illness during the intervention period. DVA professionals within the
municipality of The Hague, however, declined participation (not to
be confused with the CMH teams in The Hague which participated
fully). The DVA professionals were not part of the randomization
process. This workshop was inspired by the manual for mental health
training for community health workers published by the World Health
Organization (<xref rid="bibr31-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2003</xref>). It consisted of three main
themes: (a) information on mental illness: prevalence, definitions,
and symptoms; (b) the organization of mental health care in the
Netherlands, and (c) Dutch laws and legislation with regard to
health care and mental health care, and communication and the
exchange of information with professionals working in (mental)
health care. Because of a nation-wide reorganization of the
municipal public health service, participation could not be made
mandatory.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Provision and implementation of a direct-care referral

information and tools needed to implement a direct-care referral

mandatory Dutch decision-making protocol on whether to refer
(suspected) victims of DVA, as well as possible DVA institutions to
refer to. The pathway was brought to the attention of the
intervention teams in the following ways: it was included in the
handouts that the intervention teams received after the training,
recalled in bi-monthly newsletters, given to teams on a large
poster, and it was available as smartphone app. The mental health
institutions included in this study all had assigned a DVA advocate
from within each CMH team. The main task of a DVA advocate is to
remind colleagues to ask their patients about DVA and to act as a
consultant regarding questions related to DVA. To improve the
quality of referrals to DVA services and the communication and
collaboration between mental health care and DVA professionals, we
aimed to add a professional to all intervention teams.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Fidelity</title>
                <p>Intervention fidelity for each team was assessed over the course of the
intervention period using a prespecified fidelity scale. Fidelity was assessed
by an independent researcher (KB). Information was collected over the course of
the intervention period during routine visits (centered around support during
training days, provision and restock of paper intervention material, and ad hoc
consultancy on DVA knowledge, attitudes and skills, and updates on the referral
pathway), and from a semi-structured interview by telephone with a
representative of each intervention team at the end of the intervention period.
The fidelity scales scored whether the five core components of the BRAVE
intervention were adequately present. Each item could be scored with either yes
or no (1 or 0). Component 5 consisted of one item which could be scored from 0
“not present” to 3 “weekly.” The components were as follows: (a) a DVA training
course for mental health care professionals (3 items; e.g., “Every team has at
least one manual on DVA”); (b) mental health training course for DVA
professionals (3 items; e.g., “The training includes a short description of the
major mental illnesses”); (c) identification of the components of DVA in routine
CMH practice (6 items; e.g., “The training provided conversation techniques to
enquire about DVA”); (d) integrated referral and care guideline (2 items; e.g.,
“An integrated referral and care guideline is available”), and (e) collaboration
between CMH professionals and DVA-professionals (1 item; “A DVA professional
joins our meetings at least once a month”). Maximum score (17points) reflects
excellent intervention fidelity.</p>
                <p>Fidelity scores ranged from 6 to 11, with a median score of 9.25 points. Overall,
fidelity was limited by the absence of mandatory training of DVA professionals
and of an integrated referral guideline between DVA services and CMH services as
a result of a radical reorganization of all municipal public health services,
including DVA services during the trial period. For the purpose of our analysis,
a median split was used to dichotomize the intervention fidelity score of each
team into high (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6) versus low (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6)

                <p>The primary outcomes were the number of current DVA cases detected and the number
of cases referred per team. To operationalize how many DVA cases were detected
and referred, we searched through the EPFs of patients treated by each
participating team during the 12-month period prior to the intervention, and at
6 and 12 months after the start of the intervention (a total of 24 months,
divided into four times six months). The process of searching and extracting the
outcome measures is described in full in the appendix (Appendix A). In short, an
automatic search query was performed on the patient files and those flagged as
potentially case of DVA were additionally vetted by two independent researchers
(RR and HG) and categorized in either a detected current case of DVA or no DVA.
Detected cases were then categorized as perpetrator or victim and type of
violence (sexual, physical, material or emotional). Violence was stratified to
physical violence if it was described in the EPF as a patient being, for
example, slapped, hit or otherwise physically assaulted, this included
misspellings and synonyms. Violence was marked as sexual if a patient was for
example, raped, or otherwise sexually assaulted. Violence was marked as
emotional if the EPF described a patient for example, being threatened or
stalked. Violence was marked as material if a patient for example, was described
to have been a victim of vandalism or financially exploited. A table with the
words used in the search query can be found in the Appendix (Appendix A; Tables
A.1 and A.2). For exploratory purposes, cases were also examined if they were
referred to a DVA professional, externally discussed (discussed with a DVA
service whether referral is necessary), internally discussed (discussed in a
multidisciplinary setting whether referral is necessary) or no follow-up action
was taken. Thus, detected cases were the sum of all cases in the patient files
classified as such by the researchers and the number of DVA referrals was the
sum of all follow-up actions. Refer to Appendix A for additional details on the
procedure for searching, flagging, and categorizing cases and referrals.
Furthermore, a flowchart depicting the operationalization process of the data
extraction from the EPFs is also included in the Supplement (Figure A.2.).</p>

              <p>The effect of the BRAVE intervention on the rate of DVA cases detected and referred
over the four time points was estimated using a generalized linear mixed model with
logit link and binomial distribution. Our model included intercept, allocation
(BRAVE vs no intervention), time (as a continuous variable), and the interaction
term of allocation with time. A significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05) time ×
allocation term was considered indicative of an intervention effect. The number of
patients detected or referred during the intervention period was used as the
nominator and the number of patients treated during this period was used as the
denominator. We stratified the cases according to the type of violence (physical,
sexual, emotional, and material), and whether the cases concerned victimization,
perpetration or both. Since the use of a structured DVA form in the EPF is
recommended during the BRAVE training, we assessed the rate of completed DVA forms.
By means of sensitivity analysis, analyses were repeated excluding cases of violence
occurring among roommates (i.e., sheltered housing), and adjusted for standardized
baseline rate. We report the OR (odds ratio) of the time × allocation interaction
term including 95% confidence interval and p-value, as well as the estimated rates
at the end of the intervention period (at 12 months). Additionally, we plotted the
estimated mean rates and standard errors over the full intervention period.</p>
              <p>The effect of the BRAVE intervention on the clinicians’ readiness to manage DVA was
estimated using a multilevel generalized linear mixed model. The model included
intercept, allocation (BRAVE vs no intervention), time (three time points modeled as
a continuous variable), and the interaction term of allocation with time. CMH team
membership was included in the model as a level. A significant
(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .05) time × allocation term was considered indicative of an
intervention effect. Assessments were weighted for the inverse of the number of
teams a CMH professional was employed by, for example a CMH professional employed by
two teams was analyzed as member of both teams with a 0.5 weighting factor each
assessment. We assessed the effect of the BRAVE intervention on the BRAVE survey
total score, and on the subscale scores independently. Sensitivity analyses were
performed regarding the CMH clinicians who completed the training, for CMH
clinicians who completed all three surveys, and adjusted for standardized baseline
score. We report the unstandardized regression coefficient of the time × allocation
interaction term including 95% confidence interval and p-value, as well as the
estimated mean scores at the end of the intervention period (at 12 months).
Estimated mean scores and standard errors are plotted over the full intervention
period. Finally, we analyzed the detection and referral rates as well as the BRAVE
survey total score stratifying teams with a high intervention fidelity versus teams
with a low fidelity. Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version
24.</p>

of the BRAVE intervention on the clinicians’ readiness to manage DVA. As shown
in Figure A.4, the overall response rate at all three time points was above 75%.
The inflow and outflow of persons working in the included CMH teams during the
follow-up period ranged from 12.5% to 22.1% for the intervention group and 15.5%
and 15.7% for the control group. The BRAVE intervention resulted in a steeper
and longer lasting increase in clinicians’ readiness to manage DVA. This effect
was apparent from both the total BRAVE survey, and, separately, also on the
subscales. We noticed an increase in readiness following the training, both in
intervention and control clinicians. During the follow-up, skills, attitudes,
and knowledge of the clinicians in the intervention teams continue to increase,
while the skills and knowledge of the clinicians in the untrained teams stagnate
after six months. Overall, effect sizes are small.</p>
                <p>As expected, the results are more profound in the subset of trained clinicians.
Results are similar for clinicians who completed the survey at all three
moments, suggesting the absence of bias caused by the drop-out of various
individual clinicians. Furthermore, we found that the impact of the BRAVE
intervention on the BRAVE survey scores was similar for clinicians in the teams
with high and low intervention fidelity. For information on the respondents: see

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study evaluated the effects of the BRAVE intervention on DVA detection and
referral rates of clinicians working in CMH teams. We found no increase in detection
and referral rates of DVA, despite an overall increase in knowledge, attitudes, and
skills related to DVA. This suggests that the increase in knowledge, attitudes and
skills after the training was not accompanied by changes in clinicians’
behavior.</p>
              <p>A systematic review by <xref rid="bibr49-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Zaher et
al. (2014)</xref> suggested that interventions for improving detection of DVA
have a higher chance to be successful when they consist of several components
namely, (a) multidisciplinary reinforcement sessions for (CMH) clinicians; (b)
additional training for DVA advocates; (c) cues or alerts for (CMH) clinicians
reminding them to be alert for possible DVA; (d) improved access to support and to
referral websites for DVA; and (e) continuous audits and feedback. The BRAVE study
was able to provide multiple training sessions, send out newsletters to the CMH
clinicians, provide CMH clinicians with cues or reminders to ask their patients
about DVA, and provide information about referral websites or services but did not
have the other components described earlier. These missing components provide
initial pointers at why the intervention did not increase DVA detection.</p>
              <p>Earlier studies showed the estimated prevalence of DVA among SMI patients to be 35%
(<xref rid="bibr23-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Kamperman et al.,
2014</xref>). We found a detection rate of only 3% in the intervention teams and
4% in the control teams. These numbers suggest a large degree of structural
underdetection of DVA in CMH teams, despite the BRAVE intervention. Systematic
screening for other problems or diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer)
often does systematically increase detection rates (<xref rid="bibr39-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Clinicians have many
reasons to be hesitant to detect DVA in their patients such as safety concerns for
both the victim as the professional, not finding an opportune moment to discuss DVA,
a lack of available shelters, or because no effective intervention to stop the
problem of DVA after detection, is currently available in the Netherlands (<xref rid="bibr36-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Ruijne et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>Another possible explanation for the absence of an intervention effect might have
been the significant inflow and outflow of clinicians working in CMH teams (ranging
from 30% to 34% over the full intervention period). This might have diluted the
effect of the training course at the team level. Additionally, differences in
management objectives and reorganizations within and between teams might have led to
inconsistencies in the following three aspects of these teams: DVA management, the
professional responsibilities of the CMH clinicians, and the number of DVA
advocates. This could have resulted in a lack of therapeutic engagement, which is a
known barrier for patients disclosing DVA (<xref rid="bibr33-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, only 8
out of 12 DVA advocates in the intervention group were advocates during the whole
intervention period, resulting in a low overall score on the fidelity scale.</p>
              <p>Our main results are similar to most intervention studies on the management of DVA in
health care (<xref rid="bibr49-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Zaher et al.,
2014</xref>). However, a similar intervention conducted in general practices in
the United Kingdom (<xref rid="bibr10-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Feder et
al., 2011</xref>) did find a higher detection and referral rate of DVA in the
intervention group. Like the BRAVE intervention, this intervention also focused on
contact with the patient instead of mandatory screening, and also implemented a DVA
training course for clinicians. There were two key differences however: whereas the
patients in the BRAVE study had contact with several professionals working in a
team, patient contact in general practices is usually limited to contact with the
general practitioner and, the BRAVE study focused on SMI patients while general
practices focus on the general population. Diffusion of responsibility (<xref rid="bibr2-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Beyer et al., 2017</xref>) is
thought to make people feel less responsible for the outcome of group decisions, and
may cause communication problems between CMH teams and DVA professionals. Such
hampered communication could lead to prolonged victimization of DVA or more
emergencies in DVA.</p>

            <sec id="section19-08862605211004177">
              <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
              <p>This study has a number of strengths. First, this study was conducted according to
the study protocol: the CMH teams included in the study cover a large and diverse
part of the Dutch population; during the intervention phase, none of the teams
dropped out; both attendance rates and response rates were high (&gt; 75%); and the
study was conducted in a naturalistic setting which means that the results are valid
both internally and externally. Second, the extraction of data was done
automatically by an independent researcher. All data were analyzed by two
independent researchers. In theory, it is possible that some cases of detected DVA
were missed. However, the initial data extraction was very broad, thereby limiting
the possibility of false negatives. All cases were thoroughly assessed according to
the highest standards, and this was reflected in the high levels of inter-rater
reliability. Third, as researchers we did not intervene with the daily practice of
the teams, ensuring the intervention to take place in a realistic setting.</p>
              <p>A limitation with regards to the implementation was a high turnover of personnel
during the intervention phase. This might have diluted the effect of the BRAVE
intervention during the year of follow-up. A possible limitation that could impact
that could impact the experience of the individual patient is that detection and
referral rates were aggregated on a team level. Thus, it was no longer possible to
attribute personal characteristics, such as the patient’s gender to the detected and
referred cases. However, results from sensitivity analyses on these characteristics
did not suggest an alternative explanation for the found nonsignificance.
Furthermore, since we assessed the primary outcome on a team level, the impact of
individual differences in skills, knowledge, and attitudes of DVA and individual
differences with regards to behavioral change over the course of the intervention
were masked. The training course for CMH clinicians took place only once, which was
apparently not enough to establish a change in behavior. Although we took care in
adapting the training to the specifics of DVA in CMH patients—such as gender
differences and cultural differences—the possibility exists that not all practical
circumstances of clinical care were addressed. However, no omissions were reported
by the attendants and the training course for CMH clinicians was highly appreciated
by the attending clinicians and met the standards for courses on DVA of the World
Psychiatry Association (<xref rid="bibr40-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Stewart
&amp; Chandra, 2016,</xref> 2017). Although the clinicians’ knowledge and
attitudes toward DVA victims did significantly increase in our study, a repeated
training course and more support from a DVA professional in CMH teams might be
needed to change clinicians’ behavior and to increase DVA detection and referral
rates.</p>
              <p>Another limitation was the fact that the BRAVE survey was a self-report
questionnaire, not assessing actual behavior of clinicians in discussing DVA with
their patients (<xref rid="bibr35-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Ruijne et al.,
2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Not being actively involved in the teams as a research team could be seen as a
limitation, as professionals may forget to ask about DVA if they are not reminded on
a daily basis. However, if we want the BRAVE intervention to be successful in
increasing detection rates, the effect of the intervention must be independent of
RCT participation.</p>

            <sec id="section20-08862605211004177">
              <title>Clinical Implications and Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our trial was successfully conducted but unfortunately failed to increase the DVA
detection and referral rate in CMH teams, which highlights the great complexity of
handling DVA in mental health care and the difficulties implementing interventions.
Our results also suggest that improvements in cognition and attitudes do not
necessarily correspond with improvements in behavior and skills (<xref rid="bibr27-08862605211004177" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 1990</xref>). Although
the BRAVE intervention was successful in increasing the clinicians’ knowledge,
attitude, and skills toward DVA, we suggest that to increase DVA detection rates, a
change in behavior or routine while working with patients is needed. For future
research we recommend including more obligatory elements in such interventions, for
example the screening of all new patients during intake interviews or adding a
prompt in the EPF that reminds CMH clinicians to consider DVA in their assessments.
We also strongly recommend improving the collaboration and information exchange
between DVA services and mental health care. A structured way of improving
communication and collaboration could be to add a DVA professional or physician
employed by the DVA services to CMH teams or to add a CMH clinician to DVA services,
which could add flexibility and enables CMH teams to provide care aimed at the
specific needs of the individual.</p>
              <p>Our trial showed that a training program on DVA knowledge, attitude, and skills in
CMH teams can increase knowledge, attitudes, and skills toward DVA. However, our
intervention does not appear to increase the detection or referral rate of DVA in
SMI patients.</p>
