                  <p id="Par1">More than a third of the 65,000 people living with kidney failure in the UK attend a dialysis unit 2–5 times a week to have their blood cleaned for 3–5 h. In haemodialysis (HD), toxins are removed by diffusion, which can be enhanced using a high-flux dialyser. This can be augmented with convection, as occurs in haemodiafiltration (HDF), and improved outcomes have been reported in people who are able to achieve high volumes of convection. This study compares the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF compared with high-flux HD in the treatment of kidney failure.</p>

Adult patients already receiving HD or HDF will be randomised 1:1 to high-volume HDF (aiming for 21+ L of substitution fluid adjusted for body surface area) or high-flux HD. Exclusion criteria include lack of capacity to consent, life expectancy less than 3 months, on HD/HDF for less than 4 weeks, planned living kidney donor transplant or home dialysis scheduled within 3 months, prior intolerance of HDF and not suitable for high-volume HDF for other clinical reasons. The primary outcome is a composite of non-cancer mortality or hospital admission with a cardiovascular event or infection during follow-up (minimum 32 months, maximum 91 months) determined from routine data. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular- and infection-related morbidity and mortality, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. Baseline data will be collected by research personnel on-site. Follow-up data will be collected by linkage to routine healthcare databases — Hospital Episode Statistics, Civil Registration, Public Health England and the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) in England, and equivalent databases in Scotland and Wales, as necessary — and centrally administered patient-completed questionnaires. In addition, research personnel on-site will monitor for adverse events and collect data on adherence to the protocol (monthly during recruitment and quarterly during follow-up).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par47">Kidney failure affects around 65,000 people in the UK, with more than 7000 newly affected people starting kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It ranks among the most severe of the chronic non-communicable diseases — the survival probability at 1, 3 and 5 years is around 90, 70 and 50%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] — and people on dialysis in the UK are admitted to hospital on average around 1.5–2.0 times per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Quality of life (QoL) is also well below that of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">Currently, around 90% of existing dialysis patients are on some form of haemodialysis (HD) or haemodiafiltration (HDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although HD and HDF can be set-up at home, the majority is performed in-centre. HD and HDF cost approximately £25k per patient per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Treating the 25,000 people on HD/HDF costs around £500million of NHS spending each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with a further £75million spent on hospital admissions and £50million on transport to and from dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">HD relies on ‘diffusion’, a process by which molecules at high concentrations in the blood pass across a membrane in an artificial kidney (dialyser) to reach low concentrations in the dialysate fluid. Initially, membranes were designed with small pores to avoid the loss of essential proteins, meaning that only small-sized toxic molecules could leave the blood. As technology advanced, these pores became larger and asymmetrical, allowing larger toxic molecules to leave the blood whilst essential proteins were retained. These “high-flux” membranes are now recommended as standard practice in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. HDF is similar to HD in that it uses diffusion to clean the blood, but at the same time, it uses ‘convection’ — a process that pulls fluid across the membrane, taking any dissolved solutes with it. Pulling large volumes of fluids across the membrane is considered ‘high-volume’ HDF. Adding convection achieves more efficient removal of middle-sized water-soluble molecules, with similar convective clearance of urea and β2 microglobulin. These larger uraemic molecules are thought to be responsible for some of the cardiovascular damage, impaired immunity and other organ damage associated with kidney failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This could explain why meta-analyses of existing randomised controlled trials indicate improved morbidity and mortality across a range of cardiovascular- and infection-related outcomes in patients achieving high-volume HDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">The current standard of care, high-flux HD, is water intensive: each treatment requires approximately 500L of mains water to generate around 120L of dialysate water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Given the exposure of the blood to such large quantities of water, it is important that this water contains safe levels of bacteria and endotoxins. As high-volume HDF involves infusing an additional 20–25L of water back into the patient 3 times per week, 52 weeks per year, the quality of water becomes even more crucial. Technological developments over the past decade now make it possible to produce such water ‘on-line’, i.e. continuously in the kidney unit, with filters built into dialysis machines to ensure it is sterile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This shifts responsibility for water quality to individual kidney units and raises the importance of monitoring water quality if units are to provide a safe HDF service.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The other concern about high-volume HDF is that the removed fluid may contain important solutes and proteins (such as albumin) that are not replaced in the ultrapure substitution fluid. This could have an adverse impact on a patient’s nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par52">Three meta-analyses have compared different forms of HDF with different forms of HD and have drawn differing conclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One found no beneficial effect of HDF on all-cause mortality but included very old studies of HDF regimens very different from current practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; after removing these studies, the relative risk of mortality became 0.82 (95% CI 0.72–0.93) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The other two found no evidence of the effect on all-cause mortality overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the importance of HDF volume had not been appreciated when these trials were conceived and so trial practice varied widely between kidney units from low-volume to high-volume convection. A post hoc analysis of all the three recent major RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found that patients achieving high-volume HDF (defined in the three trials as &gt;25.4L, around 20.3L and &gt;21.9L of convection per treatment) experienced a 39–46% lower risk of all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This pooled data analysis also looked at specific causes of mortality and found similar effect sizes in cardiovascular- and infection-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These findings informed the trial design in two ways:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par53">The intervention was defined as aiming for a substitution volume of greater than or equal to 21L adjusted for body surface area, equivalent to greater than or equal to 23L convection volume in a typical patient needing 2L of ultrafiltration to reach their target weight.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">The events for inclusion in the composite primary endpoint were chosen on the following bases:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par55">○ Non-cancer mortality — cancer would not be biologically expected to be affected by convection and cancer is more reliably captured as a cause of death in UK mortality data, compared with cardiovascular and respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par56">○ Hospital admission due to a cardiovascular event or infection — the pooled analyses of previous RCTs had shown lower deaths due to cardiovascular events and infection in people achieving high-volume HDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and hospital episode data reliably captures events at this high level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par57">Despite the lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, around 15% of patients in the UK were receiving HDF when this trial was being planned, with wide variation in HDF adoption and plans for further adoption between centres (unpublished UKRR data, Oct 2015).</p>
                <p id="Par58">The average phase III efficacy trial in the USA is estimated to cost $19 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which risks restricting this level of evidence generation to treatments with the potential to re-coup such costs. There is therefore a need to find novel ways to generate such evidence more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and in 2015, the National Institute for Health (NIHR) Research Health Technology Assessment in the UK put out a first call for efficient trials. This study, funded through this scheme and using an efficient trial design with linkage for outcomes data, aims to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF compared with high-flux HD in adult patients with kidney failure on maintenance, in-centre HD or HDF at least three times a week.</p>

A health economic evaluation is exploring the cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF during the follow-up period from an NHS perspective. Additional analyses will explore any impact of treatment on residential care. Should differences in any component of the primary outcome between the study groups be evident at the end of trial, resulting in uncertainty over the longer-term cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF, we will develop a decision analysis model to extrapolate cost-effectiveness estimates over patient lifetimes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The High-volume Haemodiafiltration vs High-flux Haemodialysis Registry Trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6357_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par89">A standard operating procedure providing instructions on improving adherence through appropriate choice of dialysis needle gauge and blood pump speed (and therefore attaining the target substitution volume) has been developed by the investigators. Sites will provide the trial unit with reports on compliance monthly during recruitment and three-monthly during follow-up; the trial unit will analyse these data and feedback to the research nurses and PI in each site monthly during recruitment and three-monthly during follow-up. Training in achieving high-volume HDF will be on-going.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Adherence to the protocol will be logged monthly by the clinical team throughout recruitment and 3-monthly throughout the follow-up and submitted to the trial unit. For the purposes of reporting, only the last recorded dialysis session of each month will be examined. The log will include receipt of the allocated modality, attainment of high-volume HDF (if applicable) and water quality testing. Deviation from the protocol has been defined as (a) being off their allocated treatment on the last dialysis session of the month for two consecutive months and (for those allocated to high-volume HDF) (b) no longer aiming for high-volume HDF. This definition recognises that some patients need time to adjust their dialysis prescription and achieve their target substitution volume; indeed, some, despite all best efforts, may never achieve it. It also recognises that patients may have short periods off their allocated treatment due to admission to a hospital or travel with dialysis in another centre.</p>
                <p id="Par91">At the end of the trial, a data extract will also be requested from sites and the UKRR to explore adherence at the dialysis session level.</p>

As a rule, however, middle and high cut-off dialysers cannot be used by participants in either arm of the trial. First, they are not compatible with delivering HDF. Second, they may attenuate any treatment effect of high-volume HDF if they increase the removal of middle molecules when used to deliver HD, as they claim.</p>
                <p id="Par93">Although patients should not be included in the trial if transition to a living kidney donor transplant or home dialysis is scheduled within the next 3 months, patients may receive a kidney transplant or choose to transition to home therapy at any time during follow-up, if this is considered the most appropriate treatment for them in discussion with their clinical team.</p>

This effect size was agreed to be clinically significant at an investigator meeting involving patients and healthcare professionals. We assume, however, that any effect will be attenuated by (i) cross-over between arms (15% HD to HDF and 5% HDF to HD) and (ii) participants being allowed to take part in other trials simultaneously. To optimise recruitment and avoid excluding eligible patients because they are already participating/want to participate in other trials, an additional adjustment has been made. The latter assumes that up to half of patients in both groups will take part in another trial that assigns half of these to an intervention that reduces our composite endpoint (HR = 0.9). We therefore anticipate the proportion experiencing an event on high-flux HD will be 62.5% (37.5% surviving event-free) and on HDF it will be 54.1% (45.9% surviving event-free) giving a revised HR for the H4RT study of 0.79. The number of events required to detect this difference with 90% power and a 5% significance level is 801, which requires 1348 participants in total. The primary analysis will be intention to treat (ITT), and to avoid informative censoring, participants will not be censored at the time of kidney transplantation or transition to home dialysis. Allowing for 10% loss to follow-up for other reasons, we require 1527 participants and will recruit 1550.</p>

During phase 1, specific or wider recruitment obstacles will be identified using a combination of data sources including trial documentation, screening log data, interviews with professionals involved in delivering the trial and patients invited to participate, audio-recordings of recruitment consultations and observations of trial management group (TMG) meetings. If recruitment difficulties are evident across the study or in particular centres, the QRI team will work closely with the TMG/CI to formulate a ‘plan of action’ that intends to improve recruitment and information provision. The components of this plan will be grounded in the findings from phase 1 and may include study-wide, centre-specific or individual recruiter-level interventions to optimise recruitment.</p>

                <p id="Par133">Descriptive statistics will be used to determine whether there are imbalances at baseline between treatment groups and will inform any later sensitivity analyses where appropriate additional adjustment will be performed. Patient-reported outcome scores based on standardised questionnaires will be calculated based on the developers’ scoring manuals and missing and erroneous items will be handled according to these manuals. Continuous measures will be presented as means and standard deviations or medians and ranges depending on their distribution. Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and proportions.</p>
                <p id="Par134">The primary outcome is a composite outcome of non-cancer death or hospital admission for infection or cardiovascular event by a minimum of 32 to a maximum of 91 months of follow-up. We will compare the distribution of time-to-events between the two groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. We will use Cox’s proportional hazards model — or an alternative flexible parametric model if the assumption of proportional hazards is not met — to compare the time-to-events between the two groups with adjustment for stratification variables.</p>
                <p id="Par135">The secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality, non-cancer mortality, cardiovascular mortality and infection mortality will be analysed and reported in a similar manner to the primary outcome. Cardiovascular- and infection-related hospitalisations and MRSA and MSSA infections are all recurrent events and analyses of such outcomes should account for informative censoring due to death. We will therefore use joint frailty models as these simultaneously analyse recurrent events (infections or hospitalisations) and time to death whilst estimating distinct hazard ratios. Appropriate repeated measures regression models for patient-reported outcomes will be chosen based on the distribution of the data and will adjust for stratification variables and values of the outcome at the time of randomisation. A similar repeated measures regression approach will be taken to the following other repeated measure outcomes: time to recover after each dialysis session, haemoglobin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose, calcium levels, phosphate levels, PTH levels, albumin levels and phosphate binder dose.</p>
                <p id="Par136">All analyses will be adjusted for stratification variables and, in the case of patient-reported outcomes, we will also adjust for the value of the outcome pre-randomisation. For all statistical models used, the underlying assumptions will be checked using standard methods. If assumptions are not valid, then alternative methods of analysis will be sought.</p>

                <title>Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b}</title>
                <p id="Par138">We will conduct pre-planned subgroup analyses to investigate any differential treatment effects according to baseline urine volume (a surrogate for residual kidney function), diabetic status, line, weight at baseline, age and the experience of sites in achieving high-volume HDF. Subgroup analyses will be conducted by including an interaction term between allocated treatment and baseline characteristic in regression models then using the likelihood ratio test comparing this model with one excluding the interaction term. Urine volume and age will be included in the model as continuous variables.</p>
                <p id="Par139">A per-protocol analysis will be performed, with patients censored at the time of discontinuation of allocated treatment (including receipt of a kidney transplant, transition to home dialysis, receipt of the alternative form of HD/HDF on the last session of two sequential months and patient choice to come off allocated treatment), with adjustment made for baseline characteristics. Recognising biases inherent to per-protocol analyses when compliance is not random, we will also consider appropriate alternative causal inference approaches to estimate the treatment effect in compliers.</p>
                <p id="Par140">We will also test the sensitivity of the primary analysis to the definition of high-volume HDF (21+L of substitution volume, adjusted for body surface area) by testing two alternative definitions, (a) a lower threshold of 18.9+L of substitution volume, i.e. 10% below the original threshold, and (b) an absolute substitution volume of 21L, i.e. not adjusting for body surface area.</p>
                <p id="Par141">The primary economic analysis will take an NHS perspective in order to minimise the participant burden and increase the efficiency of the RCT. Additional analyses will explore any impact of treatment on residential care. The analysis will include a ‘within trial’ analysis estimating the cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF during the trial follow-up period. The costs associated with high-flux HD and high-volume HDF will be determined by calculating the incremental cost of equipment, staff time and materials/consumables used in performing dialysis. Healthcare resource use, including hospital visits and admissions, GP and community care contacts and medication use will be obtained from linked hospital statistics in England, Scotland and Wales, as necessary, the UK Renal Registry, and patient self-completed questionnaires and evaluated using published unit cost sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par142">QALYs will be estimated from EQ-5D-5L responses and mortality data during follow-up, adjusted for any baseline differences in EQ-5D-5L scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. We will explore reasons for data missingness and, if necessary, data will be imputed using appropriate methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Cost and QALY data will be combined to calculate an incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The primary health economic analysis will estimate whether HDF is cost-effective at the established NICE threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. Uncertainty in the point estimate of cost per QALY will be quantified to calculate confidence intervals around the INMB. The probability that HDF is cost-effective at various ‘willingness to pay’ thresholds and in the pre-specified subgroups described above (e.g. residual kidney function and age) will be assessed using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.</p>
                <p id="Par143">Should differences in any component of the primary outcome between the study groups be evident at the end of trial follow-up resulting in uncertainty over the longer-term cost-effectiveness of high-volume HDF, we will develop a probabilistic decision analysis model to extrapolate cost-effectiveness estimates over patient lifetimes. Further details of the economic analysis will be provided in a publicly available health economic analysis plan.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par157">Outcomes on dialysis are as poor as many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and there is a need to improve treatment options for people with kidney failure who are waiting for, or unsuitable for, kidney transplantation. A promising innovation has been the introduction of an element of convection in the form of HDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Meta-analyses have not, however, established the superiority of either treatment over the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One RCT did report a survival advantage of HDF over HD, but questions have been raised about the validity of this study as 10% of participants were removed from the HDF arm after randomisation due to low blood flows. Low blood flow is known to be associated with higher risk patients, as demonstrated by the baseline differences between the two arms in terms of diabetes and dialysis catheter use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par158">Post hoc analyses of recent trials have therefore looked at the dose of HDF to see if under-dosing might explain the previously null results. In patients who achieve high-volume HDF (varyingly defined, but generally requiring more than 20 L of convection per treatment), lower all-cause mortality was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This appeared to be across cardiovascular and infection deaths. However, as patients had not been randomly allocated to receive high as opposed to low volumes of HDF, what they received will have depended, at least in part, on their physical factors. Unmeasured confounding can therefore not be excluded and these results must be treated with caution, as for any observational analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par159">The H4RT study aims to address these issues by randomly allocating patients to aim for high-volume HDF or receive standard of care (high-flux dialysis). Analysis will be by ITT, with no patients withdrawn from the analysis because they are unable to achieve high volumes of HDF. The primary analysis will also not censor patients at transplant, another criticism of earlier negative trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The efficient design of H4RT (relying on linkage to routinely collect healthcare data for outcomes) has kept the overall costs of this trial just above £2million and explores the opportunities to address clinically important questions in a relatively rare condition without commercial prospects. H4RT will report its findings in late 2025.</p>
