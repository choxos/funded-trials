                <title>Abstract</title>
                <p>Chronic active and slowly expanding lesions with smouldering inflammation are neuropathological correlates of progressive multiple sclerosis pathology. T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume and signal intensity on T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI reflect brain tissue damage that may develop within newly formed acute focal inflammatory lesions or in chronic pre-existing lesions without signs of acute inflammation. Using a recently developed method to identify slowly expanding/evolving lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> from longitudinal conventional T<sub>2</sub>- and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted brain MRI scans, we measured the relative amount of chronic lesion activity as measured by change in T<sub>1</sub> volume and intensity within slowly expanding/evolving lesions and non-slowly expanding/evolving lesion areas of baseline pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions, and assessed the effect of ocrelizumab on this outcome in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis participating in the phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ORATORIO study (<italic>n = </italic>732, NCT01194570). We also assessed the predictive value of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity for clinical multiple sclerosis progression as reflected by a composite disability measure including the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk and 9-Hole Peg Test. We observed in this clinical trial population that most of total brain non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation was derived from chronic lesion activity within pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions rather than new T<sub>2</sub> lesion formation. There was a larger decrease in mean normalized T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity and greater relative accumulation of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume in slowly expanding/evolving lesions compared with non-slowly expanding/evolving lesions. Chronic white matter lesion activity measured by longitudinal T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation in slowly expanding/evolving lesions and in non-slowly expanding/evolving lesion areas of pre-existing lesions predicted subsequent composite disability progression with consistent trends on all components of the composite. In contrast, whole brain volume loss and acute lesion activity measured by longitudinal T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation in new focal T<sub>2</sub> lesions did not predict subsequent composite disability progression in this trial at the population level. Ocrelizumab reduced longitudinal measures of chronic lesion activity such as T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation and mean normalized T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity decrease both within regions of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions identified as slowly expanding/evolving and in non-slowly expanding/evolving lesions. Using conventional brain MRI, T<sub>1</sub>-weighted intensity-based measures of chronic white matter lesion activity predict clinical progression in primary progressive multiple sclerosis and may qualify as a longitudinal <italic>in vivo</italic> neuroimaging correlate of smouldering demyelination and axonal loss in chronic active lesions due to CNS-resident inflammation and/or secondary neurodegeneration across the multiple sclerosis disease continuum.</p>

              <p>While acute multiple sclerosis plaques predominate in patients with early relapsing multiple sclerosis and are the likely substrate of clinical attacks, chronic active or smouldering plaques are more prominent in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="awz212-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kutzelnigg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B15" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>) and may expand as a result of sustained inflammatory processes driven by a rim of iron-laden microglia/macrophages (<xref rid="awz212-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kutzelnigg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B14" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B15" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bramow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B7" ref-type="bibr">Correale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>Pathological studies have shown that smouldering demyelination occurs in a similar extent in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and is associated with incomplete remyelination resulting in irreparable myelin loss (<xref rid="awz212-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bramow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, analysis of the natural history of new multiple sclerosis lesions using 7-T MRI has shown that a persistent phase rim (which may reflect both smouldering inflammation and the presence of iron-laden microglia/macrophages) predicts poor tissue outcome with lower quantitative T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity over time (<xref rid="awz212-B2" ref-type="bibr">Absinta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic>, 2018</xref>). These observations are consistent with the concept of slowly expanding demyelination as a pathological correlate of clinically progressive multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="awz212-B28" ref-type="bibr">Prineas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p>
              <p>Recently, we developed a method for automatic detection of chronic active or slowly expanding/evolving lesions (SELs) on conventional brain MRI as a potential read-out of âsmoulderingâ or chronic active plaques (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). We defined SELs as contiguous regions of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions that show local constant and concentric expansion as assessed by the Jacobian determinant of the non-linear deformation between reference and follow-up scans. SELs were shown to be devoid of T<sub>1</sub> gadolinium (Gd)-enhancement, had a lower mean T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity at baseline and showed a more severe pattern of further progressive decrease in T<sub>1</sub> intensity over time, as compared with non-SEL areas of pre-existing lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). The constant decrease in T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity of SELs was consistent with the expected T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI behaviour of smouldering plaques, as the core of such lesions is typically characterized by severe accumulation of axonal damage (<xref rid="awz212-B20" ref-type="bibr">Kornek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B14" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Thus, SELs may qualify as a potential read-out for progressive accumulation of irreversible neural tissue damage and especially axonal loss (<xref rid="awz212-B34" ref-type="bibr">van Walderveen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B12" ref-type="bibr">Filippi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). These observations are also consistent with pathological and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showing that the magnitude of tissue destruction and, in particular, axonal loss, was reflected by the decrease in T<sub>1</sub>-weighted signal intensity within multiple sclerosis lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B32" ref-type="bibr">van Waesberghe <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B33" ref-type="bibr">van Walderveen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B12" ref-type="bibr">Filippi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Several observational cohort studies suggested that cross-sectional multiple sclerosis lesion burden and longitudinal change in overall lesion counts and volume may predict long-term disability accumulation in patients with PPMS (<xref rid="awz212-B31" ref-type="bibr">Sastre-Garriga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B19" ref-type="bibr">Khaleeli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B29" ref-type="bibr">Rocca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, those studies relied on relatively limited sample sizes and did not address the underlying role of chronic multiple sclerosis lesion activity.</p>
              <p>Here we examined the respective contributions of new acute lesion formation versus chronic lesion activity to the accrual of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume, in the PPMS study population of the ORATORIO trial. We assessed the effect of ocrelizumab versus placebo on the accrual of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume related to chronic lesion activity. Finally, we evaluated whether T<sub>1</sub>-weighted conventional brain MRI measures of chronic lesion activity predicted disability outcomes along the natural history of PPMS disease course in the placebo arm from ORATORIO.</p>

                <p>All analyses were performed in the phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre ORATORIO trial (NCT01194570). ORATORIO study details have been reported previously (<xref rid="awz212-B24" ref-type="bibr">Montalban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Key eligibility criteria included an age of 18 to 55 years, diagnosis of PPMS (2005 revised McDonald criteria) (<xref rid="awz212-B26" ref-type="bibr">Polman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 3.0 to 6.5 at screening. Patients (<italic>n = </italic>732) were randomized (2:1) to receive either ocrelizumab 600 mg by intravenous infusion every 24 weeks or placebo every 24 weeks for â¥120 weeks until a prespecified number of 12-week confirmed disability progression events occurred. After the primary data-cut, patients remained on randomized treatment (controlled treatment phase) until the outcome of the trial was evaluated and patients were eligible for open-label ocrelizumab treatment (open-label extension phase). Patients who completed the controlled treatment phase received randomized treatment for at least 144 weeks and up to 240 weeks. All clinical assessments in the double-blind controlled period of ORATORIO trial were performed 12-weekly. As described in the ORATORIO primary outcome results (<xref rid="awz212-B24" ref-type="bibr">Montalban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), the assessments of 12-week confirmed disability progression endpoints were performed in a time-to-first event analysis, in which disability increase had to be sustained on subsequent visits for at least 12 weeks. A composite measure of disability progression was used in primary intent for the analysis of the clinical predictive value of chronic versus acute white matter lesion activity and brain atrophy. Composite disability progression outcome includes measures of hand/arm function and ambulation speed and provides a more comprehensive capture of change in the totality of disability features (<xref rid="awz212-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bosma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B6" ref-type="bibr">Cadavid <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), especially in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, composite disability progression has recently been used as a primary endpoint in randomized controlled trials in patients with PPMS (<xref rid="awz212-B22" ref-type="bibr">Lublin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and SPMS (<xref rid="awz212-B18" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p>Standardized conventional brain MRI was performed at baseline and Weeks 24, 48 and 120 in the ORATORIO trial. Axial 3 mm T<sub>1</sub>-weighted slices (3D spoiled gradient-echo, repetition time = 28â30 ms, echo time = 5â11 ms, flip angle = 27â30) were acquired pre- and post-Gd injection (0.1 mmol/kg, 10-min post-injection delay). Axial 3 mm T<sub>2</sub>-weighted slices were acquired with 2D fast spin-echo, repetition time = 4000â6190 ms, echo time = 74â91 ms and echo train length = 7â11. The original 1 mm Ã 1 mm Ã 3 mm image resolution was resampled into a 1-mm isotropic space as a first step of the SEL Jacobian analysis detection pipeline (<xref rid="awz212-B25" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>), which was described previously (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Both T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images were used for detection of SELs. The T<sub>1</sub>-weighted signal was normalized using least trimmed squares (LTS) over time for a given patient, followed by tissue-based normalization, where 0 and 1 values represent median T<sub>1</sub> signal intensities of normal-appearing grey and white matter, respectively.</p>

                <title>Identification of overall T<sub>2</sub> hyperintense lesions, T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesions and new focal T<sub>2</sub> lesions</title>
                <p>Overall, T<sub>2</sub> lesions were identified on baseline scans using a semi-manual approach, where an initial automatic segmentation of T<sub>2</sub> hyperintense lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B13" ref-type="bibr">Francis, 2004</xref>) was manually corrected by trained readers. The automatic detection of T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense lesions was performed using a Bayesian classifier that provides probabilistic tissue classification at each voxel based on multi-sequence MRI intensities and on atlas-derived prior probabilities of healthy tissue classes (white matter, grey matter and CSF) and T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense lesion, based on spatial location in a standard template [International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM)] space (<xref rid="awz212-B13" ref-type="bibr">Francis, 2004</xref>). T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesions were identified as the subset of T<sub>2</sub> hyperintense lesions that (i) were more T<sub>1</sub> hypointense than median grey matter based on voxel-level analysis of absolute T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity; and (ii) did not show Gd-enhancement on a post-contrast T<sub>1</sub>-weighted scan. New or enlarging T<sub>2</sub> lesions were identified based on differences in T<sub>2</sub> lesion segmentations at reference and follow-up time points, with post-processing to remove spurious difference due to segmentation variability and misregistration, and on subsequent manual review by trained readers. New or enlarging T<sub>2</sub> lesion detection provides a marker for acute focal inflammation in multiple sclerosis. The algorithm used to detect âenlargementâ in ânew or enlargingâ T<sub>2</sub> lesion segmentation was designed to detect new foci of activity confluent with pre-existing T<sub>2</sub>-lesion, as well as obvious concentric lesion growth during the acute stage of new lesion formation. More subtle and gradual chronic enlargement/evolution within pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions was intentionally not captured.</p>

                <title>Identification of slowly expanding/evolving lesions</title>
                <p>The method for the identification of SELs using the T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images simultaneously has been described previously (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Briefly, SELs are identified (based on MRI scans obtained at baseline and at post-baseline Weeks 24, 48 and 120) as areas of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions of at least 10 contiguous voxels (voxel size is â¼3 mm<sup>3</sup>) showing gradual and constant concentric expansion. Identification of SELs was carried out using a two-stage process. First, the Jacobian determinant of the non-linear deformation field is computed between the reference and follow-up scans, to quantify subtle and gradual change in pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B25" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Contiguous regions of the baseline pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions undergoing local expansion are identified as SEL candidates, which are subsequently heuristically scored, to favour those undergoing concentric and constant change, consistent with gradual inside-out radial expansion. Results pertaining to the analyses of SELs will be presented for all SEL candidates (regions of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesion undergoing local expansion, regardless of heuristic score; âSELsâ), and high-confidence SELs (with a heuristic score â¥0; âhigh-confidence SELsâ) (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). SEL identification and all T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures related to SELs and non-SELs were performed by NeuroRx Research who remained blinded to all study patient-level and treatment assignment information.</p>

                <title>Normalization of T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity</title>
                <p>Prior to measuring T<sub>1</sub> intensity change over time, T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images were normalized in a two-stage process: (i) LTS was used to normalize all subsequent (in time) T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images of a given subject to the baseline T<sub>1</sub>-weighted scan; and (ii) T<sub>1</sub>-weighted images for a given subject were linearly normalized by mapping the median grey matter T<sub>1</sub> intensity at baseline to a value of zero, and mapping the median normal-appearing white matter intensity at baseline to 1. LTS performs linear regression between co-registered sequential scans using the 50% of voxels whose least squares fit possesses the smallest sum of squared residuals (<xref rid="awz212-B30" ref-type="bibr">Rousseeuw <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This has the effect of normalizing intensities within a given subject based only on the subset of voxels that remain relatively unchanged over time.</p>
                <p>The first stage of normalization ensures a common intensity space across time for a given subject, while the second stage provides comparable measures of T<sub>1</sub> intensity change across different subjects.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The statistical analysis of SEL data was exploratory and included all patients from ORATORIO with no missing or non-evaluable MRI scans (SEL analysis population). Mean changes in T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume were calculated as power means of cube root transformed data. No imputation of missing data was performed, except for the analysis of the change of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume, where for patients from the SEL analysis population who did not have any SELs, the SEL-associated T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume and its change from baseline were imputed as zero.</p>
                <p>A Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisherâs exact test for categorical variables were applied to compare baseline characteristics between two treatment groups (ocrelizumab and placebo) for both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and SEL analytical populations.</p>
                <p>Identification of SELs and the change of longitudinal predictive factors were calculated based on data from the first 120 weeks after randomization. To avoid misinterpretation in inferring the direction of causal dependence, clinical outcomes were re-baselined at Week 120 and only data after Week 120 until the end of the controlled period was used to evaluate the effect of chronic lesion activity, acute lesion activity and whole brain atrophy on disability progression outcomes. The survival analysis of predictive factors for clinical endpoints employed Cox regression models, including the predictive factors of interest, and stratified for region (rest of world, US) and age (&lt;45 years, â¥45 years). The comparison of continuous variables by lesion sector (SELs, non-SELs, total T<sub>2</sub> burden and new T<sub>2</sub> lesions) was performed using the Van Elteren test, stratified for treatment group (ocrelizumab, placebo) and baseline T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume category based on tertiles (â¤3.013 cm<sup>3</sup>, &lt;3.013 cm<sup>3</sup> to â¤11.122 cm<sup>3</sup>, and &gt;11.122 cm<sup>3</sup>). Longitudinal analyses of lesion counts and volumes used negative binomial regression and linear mixed models for repeated measures, respectively. Statistical tests were two-sided and conducted at the 5% significance level without adjustment for multiplicity.</p>

                <p>Baseline demographics and MRI characteristics were well balanced between the ITT and SEL analytical populations (<xref rid="awz212-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was a minor imbalance in the mean number of T<sub>1</sub> Gd-enhancing lesions in the ITT population between the ocrelizumab and placebo treatment groups, which is slightly larger in the SEL analytical population. Overall, T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume was higher in the ocrelizumab-treated patients in both the ITT and SEL analytical populations, with the difference being more pronounced in the SEL analytical population.

                <title>Increase in non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume occurs mostly within pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions</title>
                <p>An increase in non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume was seen in both the ocrelizumab arm and the placebo arm, with a reduced T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume increase from baseline to Week 120 with ocrelizumab as compared with placebo (<italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). In the ocrelizumab group, we observed a continued increase in non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume from baseline to Week 120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A), despite a decrease in T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>B) and near absence of new focal T<sub>2</sub> lesion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>C). In the placebo group, T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume increased from baseline to Week 120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>B), and although there was continued formation of new T<sub>2</sub> lesions, the overall absolute increase in non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume was larger by more than 2-fold that of T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume from baseline to Week 120 (<italic>cf.</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A and B). These findings show that T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume increase in the ORATORIO PPMS population was mostly driven by chronic lesion activity in T<sub>2</sub> lesions pre-existing at baseline, with a minimal impact of new or enlarging T<sub>2</sub> lesions in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Chronic brain tissue damage as measured by increasing non-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume may largely occur independently from new T<sub>2</sub> lesion formation, thereby reflecting chronic T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity decrease within pre-existing baseline T<sub>2</sub> lesions, as illustrated by the visual example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>D.

                <p>We have shown previously (<xref rid="awz212-B10" ref-type="bibr">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>) that a proportion of total pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesion volume in the ORATORIO study population could be identified as SEL candidates and high-confidence SELs, while the rest of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions were defined as non-SEL areas. Hence, we introduced a three-compartment model to further advance the understanding of the origin of overall T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation, which may stem either from âchronicâ lesion activity in (i) SELs; (ii) non-SEL areas within boundaries of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F2">Fig. 2</xref>); or (iii) from âacuteâ lesion activity by new/enlarging T<sub>2</sub> lesion formation outside of the baseline T<sub>2</sub> lesion boundaries.

Baseline T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume only predicted clinical progression at the level of upper extremity function defined by a 12-week confirmed â¥20% increase in 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) time [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval, CI): 1.75 (1.08, 2.84); <italic>P = </italic>0.024] (<xref rid="awz212-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>A, G, M and S). T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume re-baselined at Week 120 had no significant effect for any of the disability endpoints but showed a similar pattern of higher hazard ratio for 9HPT progression (data not shown). By contrast, longitudinal chronic lesion activity from baseline to Week 120 as measured by T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume accumulation in (i) total pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions (SELs and non-SELs); (ii) all SEL candidates; (iii) SELs (with a score â¥0); and (iv) non-SELs, significantly predicted clinical progression (from Week 120 to end of study) on 12-week confirmed composite disability progression [12-week confirmed disability progression as measured by EDSS, or 12-week confirmed â¥20% increase in Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) time, or 12-week confirmed â¥20% increase in 9HPT time] [hazard ratio (95% CI): (i) 2.32 (1.38,3.90), <italic>P = </italic>0.001; (ii) 1.98 (1.20,3.28), <italic>P = </italic>0.008; (iii) 1.87 (1.13,3.08), <italic>P = </italic>0.015; (iv) 2.20 (1.32,3.67), <italic>P = </italic>0.003] with consistent numerical trends on all components of the disability burden (EDSS, T25FW and 9HPT) (<xref rid="awz212-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).

                <p>It is important to emphasize that all placebo group analyses performed to evaluate the clinical predictive value of imaging phenotypes were strictly devoid of ocrelizumab influence since the clinical outcome analysis was performed from Week 120 to the end of the controlled period. A switch of all placebo-treated patients to ocrelizumab treatment only happened beyond the end of the controlled period at the beginning of the open-label extension phase, which was not integrated to the current analysis. Hence, all the findings presented are not confounded by unblinding or ocrelizumab treatment-related changes.</p>

                <title>Accumulation of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume in pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions is reduced by ocrelizumab</title>
                <p>While an increase in T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume was seen in both the ocrelizumab and the placebo arm, T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume increase from baseline to Week 120 was reduced with ocrelizumab compared with placebo (<italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A). Accumulation of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume was reduced with ocrelizumab as compared with placebo in both pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesions (<italic>P = </italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and in acute new T<sub>2</sub> lesions (<italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). While the greatest relative effect of ocrelizumab compared with placebo was seen on T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume increase associated with acute new T<sub>2</sub> lesion formation (<italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001), proportionally, this was a minor contributor to overall T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). If we consider SEL and non-SEL regions of pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesion separately, ocrelizumab showed a reduction in T<sub>1</sub> volume increase for both compartments of chronic lesion activity (non-SEL: <italic>P = </italic>0.001, SEL: <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The analysis of the treatment effect over time showed a significant separation favouring ocrelizumab versus placebo in terms of accumulation of T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume as of Week 48 within all SEL candidates, high-confidence SELs (with a score â¥0), and non-SELs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). To confirm that the effect of ocrelizumab on SELs was irrespective of the heuristic threshold for high-confidence SELs, we performed a lesion-level analysis that showed consistent benefits of ocrelizumab with respect to T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume accumulation in SEL candidates above all tested thresholds of heuristic SEL score distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>Since T<sub>1</sub> hypointense volume accumulation analysis, by definition, may not capture potential changes pertaining to lesion voxels maintaining a T<sub>1</sub> intensity superior to the defined T<sub>1</sub> hypointense threshold (median of normal-appearing grey matter), or pertaining to lesion voxels with continued decrease in T<sub>1</sub> intensity beyond this threshold, we also assessed the effect of ocrelizumab versus placebo on chronic lesion activity as measured by the volume-normalized T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity (mean T<sub>1</sub> intensity of the voxels constituting a lesion). The longitudinal analysis of the absolute change from baseline to Week 120 in normalized T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity in SELs showed a reduced decrease in T<sub>1</sub> intensity in ocrelizumab-treated patients (ocrelizumab versus placebo: â0.20 versus â0.24, <italic>P = </italic>0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F4">Fig. 4</xref>B). The same finding was observed in high-confidence SELs (with a score â¥0) (ocrelizumab versus placebo: â0.24 versus â0.28, <italic>P = </italic>0.013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F4">Fig. 4</xref>C), and in non-SEL regions (ocrelizumab versus placebo: â0.05 versus â0.09, <italic>P = </italic>0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awz212-F4">Fig. 4</xref>D).</p>
                <p>In comparison with these chronic lesion activity features of SELs, the overall prevalence of SELs was not impacted greatly by ocrelizumab versus placebo. The proportion of patients with âall SEL candidatesâ detected from baseline to Week 120 was similar in the two treatment arms (ocrelizumab versus placebo: 85.2% versus 83.6%), as was the proportion of patients with high-confidence SELs [with a score â¥0 (73.2% versus 69.0%)]. However, ocrelizumab-treated patients had a lower proportion of total pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesion identified as SEL candidates (median 5.1 versus 7.1%, <italic>P &lt; </italic>0.001) and high-confidence SELs [with a score â¥0 (median 2.5 versus 3.4%, <italic>P = </italic>0.044)], from baseline to Week 120.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our results indicate that in patients with PPMS the increase in overall T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume burden is mostly due to chronic lesion activity leading to the accumulation of tissue damage within pre-existing lesions and that T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity are predictive of clinical PPMS progression. We also showed that ocrelizumab, which is highly effective in silencing acute new lesion formation in early relapsing multiple sclerosis (<xref rid="awz212-B17" ref-type="bibr">Hauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and PPMS (<xref rid="awz212-B24" ref-type="bibr">Montalban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), also reduced the relative volume of SELs and T<sub>1</sub>-weighted <italic>in vivo </italic>measures of chronic lesion activity in SELs and in non-SEL areas of pre-existing lesions in patients with PPMS.</p>
              <p>Although smouldering inflammation with sustained macrophage/microglia activation and secondary neurodegeneration may intrinsically drive ongoing myelin/axonal damage within chronic active multiple sclerosis lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B15" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B2" ref-type="bibr">Absinta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref><italic>,</italic><xref rid="awz212-B3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B8" ref-type="bibr">Dal-Bianco <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), it is also expected that acute multiple sclerosis lesion activity could influence the CNS milieu and indirectly impact the severity of chronic lesion activity features. In the specific context of the ORATORIO trial population, as much as 73.5% of the PPMS population had MRI signs of acute multiple sclerosis lesion activity (T<sub>1</sub> Gd-enhancing lesions and/or new focal T<sub>2</sub> lesions) based on results from the longitudinal analysis of the placebo group from baseline to Week 120 (<xref rid="awz212-B35" ref-type="bibr">Wolinsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, the ocrelizumab-mediated near complete suppression of acute multiple sclerosis lesion formation, as observed especially beyond treatment Week 48, did not prevent a continued concurrent decrease in T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity and increase in T<sub>1</sub> hypointense lesion volume within SEL and non-SEL regions of chronic pre-existing lesions. Those data show that chronic white matter multiple sclerosis lesion activity may evolve largely independently from acute (focal) inflammatory activity. However, the separation of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity between the placebo and ocrelizumab groups was also most prominent beyond treatment Week 48. This observation suggests that the mechanism of ocrelizumab treatment effect on chronic lesion activity may be partially and indirectly explained by its potency to silence acute new lesion formation and by-product release of mediators that may participate in the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages/microglia, the core engine of chronic active lesion pathology (<xref rid="awz212-B15" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study of a large-scale PPMS clinical trial placebo dataset also showed that at the population level T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity predict clinical PPMS progression measured by the composite of the three major physical disability outcomes (EDSS, 9HPT and T25FW) with consistent trends on all components, while the baseline chronic lesion burden measured by total T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume only predicted 9HPT outcome. In contrast to chronic white matter lesion activity, the measures of acute lesion activity did not predict subsequent disability progression in this PPMS clinical trial population. These results are consistent with previous retrospective analyses of observational cohorts (<xref rid="awz212-B31" ref-type="bibr">Sastre-Garriga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B19" ref-type="bibr">Khaleeli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B29" ref-type="bibr">Rocca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) where the effect of acute versus chronic lesion activity was not disentangled. Importantly, longitudinal whole brain volume loss in ORATORIO did not predict composite clinical disability progression or its components, with only a numerical trend with respect to ambulation progression as measured by T25FW. ORATORIO findings further suggest that chronic lesion activity is the major driver of overall accumulation of lesion-related CNS tissue loss, and that recent chronic lesion activity may carry more clinically predictive information than recent brain atrophy or the overall baseline lesion volume, which may principally reflect disease duration and history. However, the overall cumulative burden of chronic lesion activity is obviously related to total multiple sclerosis lesion volume, and it was previously shown in another major PPMS phase III trial population that the rate of whole brain volume loss was strongly predicted by the baseline lesion volume burden but not by other factors [e.g. number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (<xref rid="awz212-B23" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>)]. It was also shown in the latter study that a higher lesion burden predicted brain volume loss in the specific subgroup of patients with no signs of acute lesion activity at baseline (<xref rid="awz212-B23" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). The value of <italic>in vivo</italic> longitudinal T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity in SELs and non-SELs as surrogates for clinical efficacy remains to be investigated and compared with that of measures of acute lesion activity in progressive multiple sclerosis clinical trial datasets using multivariate analysis.</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is that we cannot claim independence of the clinical predictive value of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted <italic>in vivo</italic> longitudinal measures of chronic lesion activity, as (apart for stratification for T<sub>2</sub> volume) our analysis models could not include other potentially relevant predictors due to the small number of clinical events post-Week 120. The confirmation of our findings in other PPMS trial datasets will be important as false positive results cannot be excluded in our exploratory analysis that did not correct for multiple testing. Another limitation is the absence of spinal cord evaluation by MRI, which was not part of the acquisition protocol in this study. The entire dynamic of multiple sclerosis lesion formation and natural history, as well as the potential involvement of smouldering or slowly expanding demyelination at the spinal cord level, remain less characterized in multiple sclerosis pathology. However, it is known that chronic lesions in the spinal cord are more likely to be inactive and less likely to be smouldering compared with brain supratentorial lesions (<xref rid="awz212-B15" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Another limitation is the present incapacity using exclusively conventional T<sub>1</sub>- and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted imaging data to disentangle the contribution of smouldering inflammation versus Wallerian secondary neurodegeneration with respect to T<sub>1</sub> intensity decrease in SELs and non-SELs. A recently initiated study (CONSONANCE; NCT03523858) will further address this question by assessing the association between the SEL phenotype and paramagnetic rims on susceptibility-based MRI or with metabolic changes or axonal/neuronal damage measured by spectroscopic magnetic resonance. Efforts are ongoing to characterize the potential neuro-pathological correlates of SELs in relation to that of paramagnetic rim lesions.</p>
              <p>The origin and natural history of chronic multiple sclerosis lesion activity detected through the SEL phenotype based on longitudinal <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration of chronic lesion expansion or using other definitions, such as the presence of a persistent phase rim, remains to be explored. In particular the dynamics of demyelination and potential remyelination (if at all occurring) cycles remains to be characterized in the context of chronic active white matter lesions, e.g. using magnetization transfer and diffusion-based imaging methods. It is also unknown whether newly formed multiple sclerosis lesions at some point along their lifespan may eventually and secondarily adopt the properties of chronic active lesions such as SELs. Notwithstanding that this is an assumption through generalization of observations from scattered studies, there is a consensus that all newly formed multiple sclerosis lesions are presumably having an âacuteâ phase at inception (<xref rid="awz212-B2" ref-type="bibr">Absinta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref rid="awz212-B16" ref-type="bibr">Guttmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Some of those newly formed multiple sclerosis lesions are also characterized by an early phase rim, due to accumulation of paramagnetic substances possibly corresponding to myelin-breakdown compounds (<xref rid="awz212-B9" ref-type="bibr">Deh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and/or attendant infiltration by blood-derived monocytes/macrophages (<xref rid="awz212-B2" ref-type="bibr">Absinta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>) and their related by-products. In approximately half of those new acute lesions with centripetal contrast enhancement, the early phase rim will vanish while T<sub>1</sub> hypointensity may partially resolve, whereas in the other half, the early phase rim may persist and T<sub>1</sub> signal intensity may continue to decrease (<xref rid="awz212-B2" ref-type="bibr">Absinta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref rid="awz212-B3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Whether some of the newly formed multiple sclerosis lesions and likely those with an early persistent phase rim may convert into chronic active lesions or be chronic active with SEL properties from their inception remains to be explored.</p>
              <p>The observation that the depletion of CD20-expressing cells similarly reduced chronic lesion activity both in pre-existing T<sub>2</sub> lesion areas with (SELs) or without (non-SELs) signs of slow longitudinal expansion raises questions as to the potential identity of the biological mechanisms at play in both compartments. We noted a sizeable difference in the magnitude of T<sub>1</sub>-weighted measures of chronic lesion activity in SEL and non-SEL areas of patients with PPMS, but the lower grade of chronic lesion activity in non-SELs remained significantly reduced by ocrelizumab. These data are consistent with the pathological description (<xref rid="awz212-B14" ref-type="bibr">Frischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) of the presence of inflammatory cellular infiltrates (i.e. CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and HLA-D-positive macrophages and microglia cells) in chronic inactive lesions of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, although at lower density compared with that of âsmoulderingâ or âslowly expanding lesionsâ but at higher density than in the normal-appearing white matter (except for HLA-D-positive macrophages and microglia cells). The results of this work may indicate a potential role of CD20-expressing cells in the chronic inflammatory processes leading to ongoing tissue damage in SELs or chronic âactiveâ lesions as well as in previously termed chronic âinactiveâ lesions or non-SELs as studied herein. Whether a continuum of chronic inflammatory pathology may also affect the normal-appearing brain tissue might be ultimately assessed using more advanced measures of tissue integrity.</p>
