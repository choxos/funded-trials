                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Surgery to remove the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)) is the standard treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. One potential complication of gallbladder disease is that gallstones can pass into the common bile duct (CBD) where they may remain dormant, pass spontaneously into the bowel or cause problems such as obstructive jaundice or pancreatitis. Patients requiring LC are assessed preoperatively for their risk of CBD stones using liver function tests and imaging. If the risk is high, guidelines recommend further investigation and treatment. Further investigation of patients at low or moderate risk of CBD stones is not standardised, and the practice of imaging the CBD using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in these patients varies across the UK. The consequences of these decisions may lead to overtreatment or undertreatment of patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are conducting a UK multicentre, pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial with internal pilot phase to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of preoperative imaging with MRCP versus expectant management (ie, no preoperative imaging) in adult patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease undergoing urgent or elective LC who are at low or moderate risk of CBD stones. We aim to recruit 13 680 patients over 48 months. The primary outcome is any hospital admission within 18 months of randomisation for a complication of gallstones. This includes complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for the treatment of gallstones and complications of LC. This will be determined using routine data sources, for example, National Health Service Digital Hospital Episode Statistics for participants in England. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness and patient-reported quality of life, with participants followed up for a median of 18 months.</p>

              <p>Surgery to remove the gallbladder, known as laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), is the standard treatment for symptomatic gallbladder disease. LC is one of the most common operations undertaken globally, and around 70 000 LC operations are performed annually in England.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p>
              <p>One potential complication of gallbladder disease is that gallstones may pass from the gallbladder into the common bile duct (CBD). Once in the CBD, they may remain dormant, pass spontaneously into the bowel or cause problems such as obstructive jaundice, cholangitis or pancreatitis. If CBD stones are found, current guidelines recommend removal either before or during LC. Therefore, patients requiring LC are assessed preoperatively for their risk of CBD stones using a combination of liver function tests (LFTs) and imaging. If the risk is high, guidelines recommend further investigation and treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref> Further investigation of patients at moderate or low risk of CBD stones is not standardised, and practice across the UK varies. Fewer than 10% of these patients actually have CBD stones.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4 6 7</xref> Consequently, surgeons make different decisions about investigation of the CBD; some surgeons choose to perform diagnostic imaging tests for these patients and others do not. This variation likely results in overtreatment or undertreatment, with significant risks to the patient in terms of morbidity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and costs to the health service.</p>
              <p>A UK-wide audit found that a third of patients undergoing LC, irrespective of risk of CBD stones, had diagnostic imaging to test for CBD stones.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This is most frequently performed with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) before admission for LC; however, some surgeons instead use intraoperative cholangiogram and other intraoperative ultrasound examinations of the CBD. MRCP produces detailed images of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, involves a 1-hour hospital visit and costs the National Health Service (NHS) about £365. MRCP can identify CBD stones but may delay LC, which can have a detrimental effect on HRQoL and can lead to increased problems with gallstones or a more complex LC.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> If a CBD stone is identified during MRCP, extraction is most frequently performed before LC with an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The risks and mortality associated with ERCP are significant,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> as is the cost to the NHS (about £1600). Not having MRCP avoids these risks but can lead to CBD stones remaining after surgery, which may also cause complications. Research is needed to establish whether it is appropriate for patients at low and moderate risk of CBD stones to proceed straight to LC without imaging the CBD with MRCP.</p>

                <p>The sample size of 13 680 has been chosen to test the hypothesis that EM is non-inferior to MRCP with respect to the primary outcome. In estimating the sample size, we have considered the proportion of patients that would be expected to experience the primary outcome, as identified in the CholeS audit (5%–10%) and through exploration of HES data.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This includes patients at high risk of CBD stones. The consensus among clinicians on the study team was that the non-inferiority margin should be set at 1.5%, that is, that the risk of the primary outcome with EM should not exceed 8.5% assuming a risk of 7% after MRCP. A study of 13 680 participants will provide 90% power to test the non-inferiority hypothesis for a 7% event risk with MRCP and 80% power to test the non-inferiority hypothesis for a higher event risk of 8.5%, assuming 2.5% one-sided statistical significance and a 1:2 allocation ratio (MRCP:EM). The 20% sample of participants providing HRQoL data will be stratified by centre. This sample of 2736 participants will have &gt;90% power to detect a small effect size of 0.12 standard deviation between groups on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.</p>

For participants without a qualifying primary outcome event, they will be censored at the time the dataset was compiled. If more than one qualifying event occurs (eg, two hospital admissions for gallstone-related complications), time to the first event will be used. The frequency of each element of the primary outcome and reasons for admission, where applicable, will be described. Secondary outcomes will be compared using a mixed model for continuous outcomes or a generalised linear regression model for binary outcomes, adjusted for prerandomisation measures when available. For secondary outcomes measured at multiple time points, changes in treatment effect with time since randomisation will be assessed by adding a treatment by time interaction to the model and comparing models using a likelihood ratio test. Model fit will be assessed, and alternative models and/or transformations (eg, to induce normality) will be explored where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation for missing data will be explored. Analyses will be adjusted for centre, and treatment differences will be reported with 95% confidence intervals.</p>

However, they are not sufficiently granular to measure the impact on costs of small differences in theatre time or postsurgical length of stay, which might be evident between groups. Therefore, micro-costing may also be used to estimate the incremental costs of LC.

We have also consulted with patient/public contributors regarding proposed protocol amendments, resulting in the introduction of an additional postal/remote consent pathway to optimise recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews with patient/public contributors have also been conducted to explore concerns around study participation and attending hospital during the pandemic. Most participants were in favour of recruitment restarting, helping to inform subsequent decisions around restarting the study. Further patient/public activities have been undertaken to explore additional strategies for optimising recruitment (including the codevelopment of a patient-facing clinic recruitment poster), patients’ experiences/burden of study participation, and layout and content of the Sunflower Study website.</p>
                <p>We will work closely with patient and public contributors to develop a strategy for sharing the study findings with participants, future patients, service users and members of the wider public. This will include consideration of disseminating findings using a range of materials and methods, such as plain language summaries, newsletters, videos, social media, websites and patient support groups.</p>

                <title>Risk of bias</title>
                <p>Participating centres will aim to screen all adult patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease who are scheduled and fit for LC. We expect that the recruited patients will be generalisable to the wider population. Patients allocated to each group will have comparable baseline characteristics as randomisation will take place after consent via a secure website with allocation concealment. Allocations will be stratified by centre to minimise confounding.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome is objective and will be obtained from routinely collected data sources. This is important as participants, clinicians and other hospital staff caring for participants will be unblinded. Attempts to blind participants by undertaking ‘dummy’ MRCP in those randomised to EM would have added significant additional research costs and created logistical issues. Because ‘dummy’ MRCP would cause a similar delay to LC as actual MRCP, it would also prevent the study from assessing the impact of this on outcomes.</p>
                <p>The risk of missing data has been minimised by using routinely collected data for the primary outcome and by undertaking regular review of missing data captured explicitly for the study.</p>
                <p>We do not expect patient-reported outcomes to be at risk of bias, since we do not anticipate that participants will have preferences or expectations about the use of MRCP. We aim to promote uncertainty about the effects of the two interventions by providing information that describes the risks and benefits of each intervention. This information has been reviewed by a public and patient involvement group and informed by the experiences of the QRI researchers.</p>

                <p>Preparation of study documents, site initiation visits and training, day-to-day running of the study and monitoring of centres are managed by the Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit, Bristol Trials Centre. A study executive group is overseeing the study and meets regularly to review milestones. A data monitoring and safety committee meets biannually to review data. An SSC oversees the study and has ultimate responsibility for any decision about its continuation. Membership of the study oversight committees is described in the Acknowledgements section.</p>

                <p>Two substantial amendments have been approved by the REC. The first, in April 2019, added the option of postal consent, and the second, in December 2019, revised some inclusion/exclusion criteria and clarified information relating to withdrawals in line with the Health Research Authority guidance.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The main challenge facing the Sunflower Study is the recruitment target of 13 680 participants. Recruitment started 1 month later than planned in January 2019. The initial focus was to open centres to recruitment, with a target of 36 centres recruiting within phase 1. The study has already exceeded this target. As of 23 August 2020, 48 centres were open to recruitment, and 2040 participants had been randomised. The QRI will be key to optimising recruitment, providing training at investigators meetings and recruitment tips for staff at participating centres.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> With a 48-month recruitment period, it will also be key for the study to keep centres engaged. Initiatives include the use of an active Twitter account, regular recruitment updates and centre targeted emails, biannual newsletters and annual investigators’ meetings. It will also be important to remain aware of other relevant research that could impact on the study. The study team will undertake annual literature reviews.</p>
              <p>The study includes patients who are scheduled for LC as either an elective or urgent procedure. It is important to ensure that both pathways are represented to promote generalisability of the study results, but it is recognised that recruitment of urgent patients is challenging. These patients can be admitted at any time of day and over weekends when research nurses may not be available to approach patients and receive consent. As of 23 August 2020, 77.8% of randomised participants were elective referrals and 22.2% were from urgent admissions. The study is keen to involve surgical trainees in the recruitment process and is participating in the National Institute for Health Research associate Principal Investigator scheme.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> During study training, the local team is encouraged to consider recruitment from the urgent pathway, and the ratio of elective to urgent patients recruited is being monitored. The study feels that surgical trainees will be critical to the successful recruitment of urgent patients. Discussions from an investigator meeting identified that the inclusion criterion, ALT and/or ALP less than 2 ×ULN, was disproportionally excluding urgent patients, and so this was amended to 3× ULN. The impact of this amendment will be monitored.</p>
              <p>For the study results to be generalisable, we aim to recruit both patients classified as being at low and moderate risk of CBD stones. Low-risk patients are defined as those with bilirubin, ALT and ALP all within the normal range of their local Trust. As of 23 August 2020, 67% of randomised participants were classified as being at low risk and 33% as moderate risk.</p>
              <p>Another major challenge will be obtaining routinely collected data from England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Applications to obtain routinely collected data are complex and time consuming, and a different application process is required for each nation. The coordinating centre has considerable experience in completing these applications, but they must be successful and timely for the primary outcome to be determined and health economic analyses to be completed.</p>
              <p>The primary outcome for the study is composed of three elements. The first will compare hospital admissions for treatment of gallstone complications in the 18 months after randomisation. The second and third elements will compare postoperative complications of LC and complications of ERCP. These two elements are important to measure, as there is evidence of increased rates of some complications (eg, biliary leakage) in patients with retained stones post-LC.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This may have relevance to participants randomised to EM. It is also possible that participants are overtreated with MRCP, and any subsequent ERCP, and suffer avoidable complications. These elements will help inform study results and application in practice. The primary outcome will be reported both overall and by each individual element.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>This study was reviewed and given a favourable opinion by Yorkshire &amp; The Humber – South Yorkshire REC on the 10 December 2018 (REC reference: 18/YH/0358). Each participating centre is required to provide evidence of local confirmation of capacity and capability prior to starting recruitment to the study. Informed consent to participate will be obtained from all study participants. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and, if they do withdraw, will be treated according to standard local hospital procedures. Routine data will continue to be collected for withdrawn participants, unless the participant explicitly asks for this data collection to stop.</p>
                <p>The study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and international conferences and will be provided to study participants. A study specific Twitter account will be used to promote the study, provide updates on milestones and disseminate study findings. After study completion and reporting, the technical appendix, statistical code and dataset generated from the study will be available from the corresponding author on request. The request must include a specification of the data requested and justification for that request (ie, a statement of purpose for which the data are required). The data may not be released unless all Bristol Trials Centre and sponsor requirements are fulfilled (eg, protocol, sample size calculation, REC and Health Research Authority approval if appropriate, a collaboration arrangement in place between the sponsor and the external body).</p>
