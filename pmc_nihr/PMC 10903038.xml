                  <p id="Par2">ProMPT-2 is a multi-centre, blinded, parallel three-group randomised controlled trial aiming to recruit 240 participants from UK cardiac surgery centres to either sham cardioplegia supplementation, low dose (6 µg/ml) or high dose (12 µg/ml) propofol cardioplegia supplementation. The primary outcome is cardiac-specific troponin T levels (a biomarker of cardiac injury) measured during the first 48 h following surgery.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The statistical analysis plan describes the planned analyses of the trial primary and secondary outcomes in detail, including approaches to deal with missing data, multiple testing, violation of model assumptions, withdrawals from the trial, non-adherence with the treatment and other protocol deviations. It also outlines the planned sensitivity analyses and exploratory analyses to be performed.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par36">Cardiac and circulatory diseases cause around a quarter of all deaths in the United Kingdom (UK) and coronary heart disease (the most common form of heart disease) was the most common cause of death worldwide in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Close to 25,000 cardiac surgical operations were performed in 2021/2022 in the UK (not including Scotland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the heart is stopped, using a solution called cardioplegia, given directly into the coronary arteries. However, the cardiac muscle can become deficient in oxygen during this time (ischaemia) and injury can occur on the return of blood flow once the heart is restarted (reperfusion injury). In the PROMPT trial, we previously reported evidence that adding a low dose of the general anaesthetic agent propofol (6 µg/ml) to the cardioplegia solution can protect the heart against this ischaemia-reperfusion injury in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or aortic valve replacement surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ProMPT-2 trial aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of supplementing the cardioplegia with a higher concentration of propofol (12 µg/ml), in comparison with the concentrations used in the PROMPT study (6 µg/ml) and sham.</p>
              <p id="Par37">The ProMPT-2 trial is a multi-centre, parallel three-group randomised controlled trial. Participants are randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to either (i) sham supplementation, (ii) low dose propofol (6 µg/ml) or (iii) high dose propofol (12 µg/ml). The study population is adults undergoing first time, urgent or elective CABG surgery at a specialist UK cardiac surgery centre. Full details of the study background and design have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This analysis plan was written and finalised during the 12-month follow-up period for the trial and in advance of any analysis of trial outcomes to minimise reporting bias.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p id="Par38">The objectives of this trial are to estimate (a) the difference between the three groups in the cardiac-specific troponin T (cTnT) response after surgery (as a biomarker of cardiac injury) and whether high-dose propofol reduces cTnT more than low-dose propofol; (b) the difference between groups with respect to a range of other biomarkers (e.g. of renal injury, inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic stress); (c) the frequencies of serious adverse events, and serious adverse reactions in the three groups and (d) the difference between groups in Quality of Life (QoL) at 3 and 12 months following surgery. The study obtained research ethics approval from South Central – Berkshire B Research Ethics Committee and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (IRAS ref: 234266) and is registered with <italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic> (ISRCTN15255199).</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par39">The primary outcome is myocardial injury, assessed through serial measurement of cardiac-specific Troponin T (cTnT) in serum from blood samples collected pre-operatively and during the first 48 hours after chest closure.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Secondary outcomes include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par41">Systemic metabolic stress, as measured by blood lactate (mmol/L)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">Renal function, as measured by serum creatinine (µmol/L)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as measured by interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α (in pg/mL) and myeloperoxidase (MPO, in ng/mL) in serum (measured in one trial site only)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Blood pH</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay (from end of surgery to ICU discharge, days)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Length of postoperative hospital stay (from end of surgery to hospital discharge, days)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Clinical outcomes and serious adverse events, i.e. serious post-operative complications (e.g. myocardial infarction, permanent stroke, acute kidney injury) and death from any cause</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">QoL measured with the Coronary Revascularisation Outcome Questionnaire (CROQ) and the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (CROQ core total, EQ-5D utility score)</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par49">The primary outcome and secondary outcomes 1 to 4 above are measured pre-operatively and at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-operatively (from knife down time). An additional measurement is made for secondary outcome 1 (blood lactate) at 10 min after cross-clamp release. Clinical outcome data will be collected during the post-operative hospital stay: only deaths will be collected during follow-up after hospital discharge. Quality of Life data are collected pre-operatively and at 3 months and 12 months post-operatively.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par50">Based on previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] we assumed correlations between the pre- and post-operative cTnT measurements of 0.2 and between successive post-operative measures of 0.7. With 5 repeated post-operative measurements and these correlations, a sample size of 240 participants (80 per group) will provide 90% power at a 5% significance level (2-sided) to detect a difference in cTnT of 0.25 standard deviations (SD) between adjacent groups (i.e. a 0.25 SD difference between placebo and low dose propofol and between low and high dose propofol respectively), when all groups are considered together in one overall analysis. This allows for a 7.5% dropout rate. This sample size also gives 90% power to detect a moderate difference of 0.5 SD (the target difference in the PROMPT study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), between any two groups at a 1.67% significance level.</p>

                <p id="Par56">Where treatments are being compared using statistical modelling, the sham supplementation group will act as the reference category and all applicable statistical tests will be 2-sided superiority comparisons. For each outcome to be compared statistically, a model with indicators for the two propofol groups (i.e. assuming no ordering to the groups) will be compared to a model which assumes an ordinal linear dose response relationship with increasing dose of propofol supplementation (i.e. as hypothesised, with the difference between the sham supplementation and low dose being the same as the difference between the low and high doses). If there is not a statistically significant difference in model fit between the two models at the 5% level, the ‘dose response’ model will be chosen (and we will not investigate the ‘unordered group’ model further). Conversely, if there is a statistically significant improvement in fit using the ‘unordered group’ model then this will be selected. An overall assessment of the effect of treatment across the three groups will be quantified, and differences between pairs of treatments (e.g. sham vs low dose supplementation, low vs high dose supplementation and sham vs high dose supplementation) will be reported, using 98% CIs and a 1.67% significance level to take into account multiplicity associated with three outcome comparisons. Otherwise, comparisons will be performed using a 5% significance level, apart from tests for interactions which will be performed using a 10% significance level (see the ‘<xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Outcome data analyses</xref>’ section), and confidence intervals will be 95%. There will be no further adjustment for multiple testing, though consideration will be taken in interpretation of results of the number of statistical tests performed and the direction, magnitude, and consistency of treatment estimates for different outcomes.</p>

Different variance-covariance structures will be explored (compound symmetry, first-order autoregressive, Toeplitz and unstructured) and the structure which provides the best fit (in terms of likelihood ratio tests or Akaike information criterion if non-nested models are compared) will be used.</p>

If outlying observations are identified which mean that models do not fit the data adequately, sensitivity analyses omitting such observations may be considered.</p>

              <title>Missing data</title>
              <p id="Par67">Missing data will be minimised by performing a thorough data cleaning process until data are either received, confirmed as unavailable or the trial has reached the analysis stage. Missing data will be indicated in all tables using observation counts for categorical variables and indicated by footnotes for continuous variables. If the amount of missing data differs substantially between treatment groups, then potential reasons will be explored (reasons for missing outcome data will be included in outcome data tables where known).</p>
              <p id="Par68">In terms of predictors, there will be no missing data for any of the randomisation factors (i.e. site) by design. All remaining potential predictors are pre-randomisation measurements of continuous longitudinal outcomes. If missing for less than 5% of participants, these missing values will be imputed using mean or median values (depending on the distribution of non-missing data) for the whole cohort. If missing for more than 5% of participants, then multiple imputation will be considered.</p>
              <p id="Par69">Because longitudinal models use all available data across all time points, there is little benefit in imputing missing postoperative outcome data if the missing data can be assumed to be missing at random (MAR; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). The assumption that data are MAR will be assessed by comparing the variances of continuous outcomes across the groups and the dropouts/withdrawals in each group: if these are similar then the data can be assumed to be MAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is expected that outcomes are more likely to be missing if the participant has a ‘poor’ outcome, but it is not anticipated that missingness will be related to the treatment group. If the MAR assumption does not hold and missingness/dropout is not balanced across groups, imputation methods which do not assume MAR will be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par70">It is anticipated that some data for cTnT and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress will be outside the assay detection range and imputation of alternative values for these data will be considered. For example, where the lower detection limit is 5 ng/mL, using the midpoint between 0 and 5 if the number of values below 5 is few (&lt; 5%) or using multiple imputation between the values of 0 and 5 if more than 5% are below 5. For baseline (pre-operative) values below the detection limit a categorisation of the values (e.g. &lt; 5, 5–10 etc.) may also be considered if a large proportion (&gt; 20%) of the data are below the lower detection limit, with cut points chosen to give approximately equal observations in each category above the detection limit. Similarly, if post-operative values above the upper limit of assay detection are observed, these will be imputed. For example, the upper detection limit of the cTnT assay is 10,000 ng/L: if &lt; 5% of observations are &gt; 10,000 then a value of 10,000 will be used and if &gt; 5% are &gt; 10,000 then multiple imputation of values &gt; 10,000 will be considered.</p>
              <p id="Par71">For multiple imputation, a general imputation model using an iterative procedure to generate imputed values will be used to generate multiple complete data sets (e.g. using Stata’s mi impute). The model of interest would then be fitted to each complete dataset and effect estimates combined using Rubin’s rules. If appropriate, methods such as predictive mean matching will be used to ensure that imputed values lie within specific ranges.</p>

              <p id="Par75">Assays to assess levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress are performed in duplicate (as there is insufficient funding to allow all assays to be performed in triplicate). In the primary analysis of these outcomes, the two replicates will be included in the model. A third repeat assay is carried out if the two measurements are not in agreement (i.e. the values differ by more than a pre-defined threshold, guided by previous experience and reported assay coefficient of variation). These analyses will include the results of the third assay and a variable indicating whether data were from the original run of the samples or from a re-run.</p>

Demographic data and follow-up rates will be tabulated separately for (a) participants recruited before or during and (b) after the COVID-19 pandemic, using 19/7/2021 (lifting of the final stage of COVID-19 restrictions in England) as the pandemic end date. Participants recruited before or during the pandemic will be grouped together because of relatively low numbers recruited prior to the start of the pandemic and because very few of these pre-pandemic recruits completed their 12-month follow-up prior to the start of the pandemic. If these descriptive analyses suggest that the COVID-19-related cohorts differ, then the primary outcome analysis will be repeated using an interaction between the trial treatment and the COVID-19 cohort to determine whether the effect of the trial treatment differed between the COVID-19 cohorts. Overall QoL scores will also be summarised by the COVID-19 cohort and an exploratory analysis will be carried out adjusting each QoL score regression model for the COVID-19 cohort.</p>
