                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Delivering higher doses of protein to mechanically ventilated critically ill patients did not improve patient outcomes and may have caused harm. Longitudinal urea measurements could provide additional information about the treatment effect of higher protein doses. We hypothesised that higher urea values over time could explain the potential harmful treatment effects of higher doses of protein.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We conducted a reanalysis of a randomised controlled trial of higher protein doses in critical illness (EFFORT Protein). We applied Bayesian joint models to estimate the strength of association of urea with 30-day survival and understand the treatment effect of higher protein doses.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Of the 1301 patients included in EFFORT Protein, 1277 were included in this analysis. There were 344 deaths at 30 days post-randomisation. By day 6, median urea was 2.1 mmol/L higher in the high protein group (95% CI 1.1–3.2), increasing to 3.0 mmol/L (95% CI 1.3–4.7) by day 12. A twofold rise in urea was associated with an increased risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio 1.34, 95% credible interval 1.21–1.48), following adjustment of baseline characteristics including age, illness severity, renal replacement therapy, and presence of AKI. This association persisted over the duration of 30-day follow-up and in models adjusting for evolution of organ failure over time.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The increased risk of death in patients randomised to a higher protein dose in the EFFORT Protein trial was estimated to be mediated by increased urea cycle activity, of which serum urea is a biological signature. Serum urea should be taken into consideration when initiating and continuing protein delivery in critically ill patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">Establishing the optimal dose of protein has been identified as a research priority in the field of critical care nutrition to inform clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While protein is a fundamental requirement for stimulation of protein synthesis and cellular function and survival, the current evidence remains insufficient to recommend an optimum dose. Observational studies are conflicting with some leading to hypotheses that higher doses of protein in the critically patient may lead to harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In an 85 centre study of 1301 patients, the EFFORT Protein trial randomised patients to 2.2 g/kg/day or more of protein versus 1.2 g/kg/day or less for 28 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. No benefit was seen from higher doses of protein, with a signal for potential harm in a cohort of ICU patients with multi-organ failure. While the association between protein load and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with multi-organ failure has been previously hypothesised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the EFFORT Protein data highlights the need for this association to be investigated in detail, to identify which patients may be harmed by high protein dose. Randomised controlled trials estimate the overall effect of an intervention, but in their delivery, important data on the mechanism through which this intervention exerts its effect may also be collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We are increasingly aware that heterogeneous responses to interventions are seen in critically ill patients as a result of diverse baseline and disease-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Identifying biological signatures of effectiveness (or harm) via mechanistic understandings of these interventions could aid the future population enrichment for subsequent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Applying joint modelling to longitudinal data collected from clinical trials may address this, and in the case of EFFORT Protein distinguish and isolate the effects of ureagenesis from protein loading on survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Serum urea increases have consistently been observed across the intervention arms of nutritional RCTs of amino acid supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The capacity for the critically ill patient to use amino acids for muscle protein synthesis is estimated to be 60% lower than that of a healthy human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Protein not taken up by tissues are degraded to amino acids and further metabolised to ammonia and thereafter into urea. The rate limiting step is carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, which is ATP dependent and may therefore be limited by altered substrate utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While ammonia is toxic, its measurement is not recommended in the majority of clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Further serum ammonia levels show variability from sample handling and processing, making multicentre evaluations unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Urea acts as a biological signature of urea cycle function and ammonia disposal, and can be measured at scale, e.g. in an 85 centre trial randomising 1301 patients. There is both biological rationale and observational data for ureagenesis as a result of altered or excess urea cycle activity in multi-organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">We hypothesise that there is a sequential causal relationship between higher protein delivery, increased urea cycle flux and increased risk of death, with urea acting as a biological signature of toxic protein deamination products. Effective randomisation to higher urea production allows the effect of ureagenesis to be specifically examined. We aimed to estimate this via a joint model of the time-to-event outcome (30-day mortality) and a longitudinal maker (urea) using data from EFFORT Protein. This data will add to the increasing body of evidence supporting targeting of routinely collected data to guide nutritional therapy, aiming to reduce harmful metabolic effects and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes.</p>

The investigator-initiated EFFORT Protein trial protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committees of Queen’s University, Canada, and a central institutional review board (IRB) at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA that granted waiver of informed consent for sites that acceded to this central IRB. Otherwise, where required by local study sites, local ethics approval was obtained, and informed consent was also obtained from designated patient surrogates before randomisation.

Raw urea trajectories are presented over time for both treatment groups. To further describe the heterogeneity in urea trajectories over time, we performed unsupervised trajectory clustering on repeated urea measurements. We used an unsupervised k-means trajectory clustering approach based on repeated log-transformed urea measurements. The number of clusters was chosen based on examination of several partition indices and our preference for selecting the smallest number of discrete clusters to illustrate trajectory variability. For a table of characteristics, patients were stratified by urea trajectory using the longitudinal clustering.</p>

                <title>Analysis of primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par20">We used a joint model to quantify treatment effect of randomisation to high protein by linking the time-to-event and longitudinal outcome. The joint model can estimate two effects of protein randomisation: The direct effect of protein randomisation on survival, and the indirect effect of protein randomisation on survival through time-varying urea. The survival outcome (Cox model) and longitudinal urea measurements (linear mixed effects model) are combined in one joint model. Over time, urea is intermittently measured, has a degree of measurement error, and death stops urea measurements. Joint models allow estimation of the time-varying, patient-specific random effect of the endogenous covariate (urea) on an outcome (30-day mortality) with adjustment for baseline covariates while accounting for non-random dropouts due to death or discharge alive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">We adapted a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to illustrate the potential causal paths tested in the joint model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The elaborated, pre-specified DAG was based on expert opinion and biological plausibility, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S1.</p>
                <p id="Par22">To build the joint model, we followed two steps. Firstly, we used a Cox model for 30-day mortality and included covariates as justified above and outlined in the DAG, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S1. Secondly, we used a linear mixed effects model for longitudinal urea measurement. The randomisation group, measurement day, and RRT were included as fixed effects. Random intercepts and slopes were given to each subject to allow for different trajectories of urea over time. We expected urea rise to be greatest in the first 7 days in the higher protein group and introduced an interaction term for protein randomisation and time. In addition, urea was log transformed to improve likelihood of model convergence. We used cubic splines to allow for nonlinear changes of log-urea over time. The splines work by dividing the range of longitudinal urea measurements into parts that are then assigned a ‘basis function’ or ‘knots’. Three knots were chosen to capture the majority of nonlinearity based on our groups previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">In secondary analysis, we performed several extensions of the joint models to investigate different forms of association between urea and 30-day mortality. The primary joint model estimates the association of the current value of urea at time (<italic>t)</italic> with the hazard of 30-day mortality, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S2. However, patients with the same urea measurement at <italic>t</italic> may not have the same risk depending on the history of previous urea measurements, e.g. a patient with a decreasing urea versus a patient with an increasing urea. Therefore, we explored whether the hazard of death at time point <italic>t</italic> is associated with the trajectory of urea at <italic>t</italic> (defined by the slope incorporating the previous day's urea measurement), Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S2B. In addition, we explored the cumulative effects by examining the association of the whole area under the urea trajectory up to <italic>t</italic> with the time-to-event outcome, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S2C. Model diagnostics were done by visual inspection of the diagnostic plots. The results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding two-sided 95% credible intervals (CrIs).</p>

                <title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
                <p id="Par24">We performed several sensitivity analyses. Firstly, we made a joint model to adjust for baseline covariates pre-specified in the EFFORT Protein trial analysis: Age, APACHE II score, clinical frailty score, sarcopenia (SARC-F), admission type, and geographic region, where all continuous covariates were modelled as linear.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Secondly, to further test the association of urea change with protein dose and mortality, we used a multivariate joint model to include a daily POD score. This joint model tested the association of longitudinal POD score and urea with 30-day mortality. We constructed a DAG to elucidate the structure of the multivariate model, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig S3. In this multivariate analysis, we expected association of urea with 30-day mortality to remain but be smaller in magnitude than in the univariate joint model. This would suggest that the biological processes linking urea, POD, and outcome are interrelated, but that urea will continue to provide additional information on risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">Thirdly, to address the potential confounding effect of AKI on urea rise and mortality, we repeated the primary joint model in a subgroup of patients with no AKI at baseline. Additionally, we made a multivariate joint model to include AKI status at the same time point of urea measurements (up to day 12). Acute kidney injury was defined as the presence of KDIGO stage 1 AKI or above using serum creatinine criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This joint model tested the association of longitudinal AKI status and urea with 30-day mortality. Finally, to allow comparison with previous work linking urea-to-creatinine ratio changes to different amino acid doses, we modelled urea-to-creatinine ratio trajectories over time.

                <p id="Par34">Three extensions were observed. Firstly, the strength of the association between time-varying urea and 30-day mortality was persistent across the entire duration of 30-day follow-up (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Secondly, increasing trajectories and higher cumulative values of urea were associated with higher risk of 30-day mortality (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). Whereby a doubling of the rate of rise of a patient's urea from the previous day, results in an estimated increase in the hazard of death (HR 3.42, 95% CrI 1.72–6.94). Similarly, we measured a cumulative effect of exposure to higher urea levels (area under the curve), Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2. There was an increased risk of death (HR 1.42, 95% CrI 1.22–1.65) for a doubling of the area under the curve of the urea trajectory.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par38">In this secondary analysis of the EFFORT Protein trial, higher doses of protein resulted in higher urea trajectories which were in turn associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality. Similarly, greater rate of rise of urea and higher cumulative exposure to urea were associated with an increased risk of death. Effective randomisation to higher urea production allowed the effect of ureagenesis to be specifically examined, and that the indirect treatment effect of high-dose protein causing harm was estimated to be mediated via ureagenesis. This relationship persisted in sensitivity analyses accounting for different baseline and time-varying confounders including organ dysfunction and AKI. These data are concordant with previous similar secondary analyses of glutamine supplementation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and with our current understanding of skeletal muscle physiology in critical illness and specifically multi-organ dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Serum urea acts as a biological signature of the metabolic derangement seen in critical illness leading to increased protein degradation.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Critically ill patients exhibit both reduced baseline muscle protein synthetic rates and an attenuated synthetic response to protein-anabolic resistance and serum urea increases reflect amino acid hepatic deamination as opposed to tissue incorporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These highly energy dependent processes are limited by bioenergetic failure as a result of altered substrate utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our analysis of the EFFORT study suggests that protein delivery to critically ill patients requires modification guided by the serum urea. In addition to the estimate associating time-varying urea with death, the rate of rise of urea and the cumulative exposure to greater urea levels were associated with death. These consistent associations support the potential benefit of urea guided strategies. Firstly, to avoid a protein dose initially that amplifies the rate of rise of urea in early organ failure. Secondly, to limit the cumulative exposure to high urea levels from protein dosing. Whether this approach improves patient outcomes requires prospective testing. However, such a strategy represents a promising avenue to move the critical care rehabilitation field forward in terms of patient selection and efficacy signals.</p>

                <title>Ureagenesis</title>
                <p id="Par40">While endogenous and exogenous amino acids can be used for ATP generation in starvation (e.g. via the Cahill cycle) this is not necessarily true in multi-organ dysfunction. Intramuscular hypoxia and inflammatory signalling, impaired GLUT-4 translocation and insulin resistance either divert key processes or provide negative feedback loops to prevent this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The end result is an accumulation of toxic intermediary metabolites such as ammonia from an overburdened urea cycle. Multi-organ dysfunction can include subtle liver dysfunction, which may affect such pathways in the absence of overt hepatic failure. Quantifying the effect of hepatic dysfunction on urea cycle flux (and indeed Cahill cycle flux) was outside the scope of the reanalysis, though the retention of the signal for harm following correction for persistent organ dysfunction implies that this may have been accounted for. In previous work, ourselves and others have demonstrated the relationship between mortality, morbidity, and persistent critical illness with the urea-to-creatinine ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Urea-to-creatinine ratio increased in patients randomised to higher protein suggesting an increase in catabolism. However, loss of creatinine generation related to muscle wasting was not assessed in this reanalysis, as the focus was on the much closer relationship between protein dose and urea metabolism.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Although AKI is an independent cause of uraemia, the fact that randomisation to higher protein was associated with higher urea and that harm associated with high-dose protein was associated with presence of AKI suggests that the two causes of uraemia (decreased elimination and increased production) may potentiate in their associations with adverse outcome. By contrast, clinical need to commence RRT is triggered by a supply demand imbalance with respect to renal function and metabolic burden and thus also reflects both excess urea generation and inadequate elimination. In this study, effective randomisation to higher urea production allows the effect of ureagenesis to be specifically examined. Our analyses suggest considerations for protein loading in critical illness may equally apply to patients with AKI, with or without RRT.</p>

                <title>Clinical implications and future directions</title>
                <p id="Par42">The findings of a biological basis for the potential for harm from high protein doses in the critically ill patient strengthens the case for not exceeding the current guidance doses of 1.2 g/kg at any stage in critical illness, especially in the setting of a raised or rising urea. Multiple RCTs have demonstrated increases in urea with varying doses of amino acids or enhanced feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Clinical guidelines may be revised to remove higher doses, or to consider serum urea prior to dose escalation. More specifically, time-varying urea could be assessed post initiation of nutrition, to account for baseline heterogeneity. While the nuances of clinical implementation of such methods require elucidating, clinicians should consider modifying protein delivery to critically ill patients when a rising urea is observed following protein loading. Future research might focus on urea cycle activity and the mechanisms of tissue ammonia toxicity, and indeed if this is the mechanism of the altered cellular processes characterising multi-organ dysfunction in critical illness. In addition to better characterisation of nitrogen excretion in multi-organ dysfunction, these effects need to be considered alongside other potential mechanisms of harm of amino acids such as altered autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Potential avenues include large dataset analyses with functional outcome measures, observational studies examining dose-dependent ammonia toxicity, or mediation-based examination of clinical trials.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par43">These analyses remain secondary to the main analysis of the EFFORT Protein trial and have several limitations. Our estimate of the potential causal relationship between time-varying urea and 30-day mortality remains dependent on the assumption that appropriate confounders have been accounted for. This strong assumption suggests residual baseline and time-varying confounding has been addressed and the shared interdependencies between the longitudinal urea measurements and 30-day mortality are explained by latent, subject-specific random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The persistence of the association between urea rise and mortality in joint models with a variety of association structures and in models incorporating time-varying organ dysfunction, or specifically AKI status, adds support to a putative causal relationship. In sensitivity analyses, we were able to test the association using the original EFFORT Protein adjustment set to provide consistency with pre-selected, clinically relevant confounders. Finally, when we removed any effect of baseline AKI, an important subgroup with a signal for harm in the EFFORT Protein, urea increases remained associated with mortality. These analyses add important evidence to support urea as a surrogate on the causal pathway in proteins’ effect on mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par44">A second limitation is that these analyses were not what the EFFORT Protein trial was designed for and remain at risk of residual bias. The joint model approach and adjustment sets were not pre-specified and there remains risk of confounding, especially from additional confounding introduced by examining a relationship with a surrogate (urea) over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, when interest is to gain understanding into the process of how a treatment affects the survival outcome via a biomarker pathway, joint models provide an attractive framework and can potentially distinguish both the indirect treatment effect on the survival outcome through the longitudinal outcome, and the direct treatment effect on the survival outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Third, as a pragmatic multicentre RCT, there are no mechanistic data from the EFFORT Protein trial to elucidate the biological pathway involved between excess ureagenesis, organ damage, and mortality. Consequently, we can only provide a conceptual framework regarding potential mechanisms of harm which may involve ammonia. In addition, the multitude of potential pathways that can impact catabolism such as inflammation and immobilisation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] are not directly measured and therefore limit the assessment of urea as a marker of nutritional resistance. However, when persistent organ dysfunction and need for ongoing organ support—broad but relatively robust surrogate endpoints of the pathophysiology of critical illness—were included in joint models, urea rises remained associated with harm. Fourth, we do not have detailed data on incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding which could have increased urea and confounded these analyses. Finally, EFFORT Proteins, pragmatic RCT design provides robust average treatment effects (such as higher protein causing higher urea levels), but how generalisable these effects are on an individual patient level with differing baseline risk remains unknown.</p>
