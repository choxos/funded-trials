                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Chronic stable angina is common and disabling. Cardiac rehabilitation is routinely offered to people following myocardial infarction or revascularisation procedures and has the potential to help people with chronic stable angina. However, there is insufficient evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for its routine use in this patient group. The objectives of this study are to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the ‘Activate Your Heart’ cardiac rehabilitation programme for people with chronic stable angina compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>ACTIVATE is a multicentre, parallel-group, two-arm, superiority, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, with recruitment from primary and secondary care centres in England and Wales and a target sample size of 518 (1:1 allocation; allocation sequence by minimisation programme with built-in random element). The study uses secure web-based allocation concealment. The two treatments will be optimal usual care (control) and optimal usual care plus the ‘Activate Your Heart’ web-based cardiac rehabilitation programme (intervention). Outcome assessment and statistical analysis will be performed blinded; participants will be unblinded. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months’ follow-up. Primary outcome will be the UK version of Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ-UK), physical limitations domain at 12 months’ follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be the remaining two domains of SAQ-UK, dyspnoea, anxiety and depression, health utility, self-efficacy, physical activity and the incremental shuttle walk test. All safety events will be recorded, and serious adverse events assessed to determine whether they are related to the intervention and expected. Concurrent economic evaluation will be cost–utility analysis from health service perspective. An embedded process evaluation will determine the mechanisms and processes that explain the implementation and impacts of the cardiac rehabilitation programme.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Angina is chest pain usually caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, which restricts blood flow to the myocardium, especially when oxygen demand is increased during exercise. Angina is defined as stable if chest pain occurs predictably on physical exertion, or with emotion, and settles promptly with rest or after taking sublingual nitrate medication. Affected individuals have an increased risk of acute coronary events such as myocardial infarction (MI).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Management consists of behaviour change advice to reduce risk factor profile, drug treatment and revascularisation procedures.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Cardiac rehabilitation is routinely offered to patients following MI, or revascularisation procedures, and consists of co-ordinated activities to improve the underlying cause and restore optimal functioning and slow, or reverse, disease progression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The most prevalent components of cardiac rehabilitation are behaviour change and exercise training, but comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programmes also include education, interventions to improve mental health, involvement of friends and family members and the development of long-term strategies beyond participation in the cardiac rehabilitation programme. Despite international guidance,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5</xref> such programmes are not offered routinely to people with chronic stable angina.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not support cardiac rehabilitation in this group until stronger evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is available.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although there is a good evidence for the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> or following MI or revascularisation procedures,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> rates of uptake and long-term adherence are low, especially in women, ethnic minority groups, and in areas of high deprivation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>A systematic review of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for adults with stable angina,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> identified seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n=581) with high risk of bias. It found low-quality evidence that cardiac rehabilitation resulted in a small improvement in exercise capacity compared with usual care with standard mean difference 0.45 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.7), and uncertainty about the effect on all-cause mortality, acute MI, cardiovascular-related hospital admissions, quality of life and cardiac rehabilitation-related adverse events. These RCTs were small in size and recruited mainly white middle-aged men. More evidence is needed from under-represented groups including women, older age groups, ethnic minorities and those with comorbid conditions. Web-based programmes might increase the reach of cardiac rehabilitation, and there has been one small RCT (n=94) of such a programme (‘Activate Your Heart’), which demonstrated that it was possible to provide cardiac rehabilitation to people with chronic stable angina.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Trial methods were feasible in terms of recruitment, retention and outcome measurement. After 6 months, there were statistically significant lower levels of angina frequency, but a larger RCT is needed to test longer-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p>
              <p>‘Activate Your Heart’ has the potential to improve physical and mental health with minimal risk. There may be a risk of injury or provoking an episode of angina when exercising, however, the physical activity goals are carefully graded and the programme has an excellent safety record.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

                <p>ACTIVATE is a multisite, parallel-group, two-armed, superiority RCT with 1:1 allocation, stratified by gender and recruitment site (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). A pragmatic RCT of effectiveness compared with usual care, with blinded outcome assessment and statistical analysis; unblinded participants and rehabilitation providers. An internal pilot phase will assess feasibility. There will be a concurrent economic evaluation with a health service perspective. An embedded process evaluation will use mixed methods to examine the mechanisms and processes that explain the implementation and impacts of the enhanced rehabilitation programme, including an examination of barriers leading to health inequities. The Health Inequalities Assessment Toolkit (<ext-link xlink:href="www.hiat.org.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.hiat.org.uk</ext-link>) informed trial design. The RCT was registered on 16 September 2021 (ISRCTN10054455). Trial registration data can be found in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>.</p>

                  <title>Optimal usual care</title>
                  <p>Usual care will be optimised in all participants. All participants will be seen by their general practitioner or cardiology team, using a protocol informed by NICE guidance<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> to ensure that all are receiving optimal care. Considering the pragmatic nature of the proposed RCT, no restrictions will be placed on usual care. NICE guidance<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> recommends that patients with chronic stable angina receive adequate information and support, lifestyle advice about smoking, exercise, diet and weight control. Episodes of angina should be treated with short-acting nitrate medication. Antianginal drug treatment to prevent episodes of angina consists of a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker in the first instance; second-line drugs (such as ivabradine, ranolazine) will be used as needed. In addition, drugs for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease such as MI or stroke, include aspirin, ACE inhibitor (especially if diabetes is present), statins in line with NICE guidance (and treatment targets) on lipid modification<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and antihypertensives in line with NICE guidance (and treatment targets) on hypertension.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

                  <p>Concomitant medication will be recorded as part of the health economic data collection. There are no restrictions on any medications. Participants will not have participated in a cardiac rehabilitation programme over the previous 12 months, but other schemes such as smoking cessation, exercise referral and weight management schemes may be available and accessible to participants. Where participants have engaged in one or more of these it will be recorded.</p>

                  <p>Usual care will be optimised as described above. In addition, participants in the intervention arm will be given access to ‘Activate Your Heart’ (<ext-link xlink:href="www.activateyourheart.org.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.activateyourheart.org.uk</ext-link>), which is an online interactive, secure and password-protected website designed for participants to use at home. The programme was coproduced with healthcare professionals, patients/members of the public and software designers. The programme aims to deliver the five core components described by the British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation: health behaviour change and education, lifestyle risk factor management, medical risk factor management, psychosocial health and long-term management.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The programme uses the following behaviour change techniques: goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback on behaviour, graded tasks, social reward, providing information about health consequences and reducing negative emotions. The programme is tailored to individual need, organised in four stages, which can be completed in 8 weeks, but access to the site and its features continues for 12 months. Before beginning the programme, each participant sees a member of cardiac rehabilitation staff who provides training on the website either face-to-face, or remotely by telephone or video consultation. The participant will complete an online registration form, which records their medical history and cardiac risk factors. A paper-based manual is available for participants who are unable or unwilling to use the online rehabilitation system.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The website generates a tailored plan from this information, consisting of individualised goals for exercise, diet (eating more fruit and vegetables and reducing salt), emotions (managing stress, anxiety and low mood) and smoking. Adherence to these goals is regularly assessed by a short set of questions and feedback on performance. As the participant progresses through the programme, goals become increasingly difficult. Each participant records details of their daily exercise in an online diary, and regular feedback is given. Smokers are provided with feedback about the amount of money they are saving. The programme also contains written information about the health consequences of heart disease and risk factors (exercise, diet, sexual activity, driving, returning to work, hobbies, holidays, benefits, smoking, anxiety and mood). In addition, the programme reduces negative emotions by providing advice about stress reduction and anxiety management skills. There is access to an online discussion forum, and ‘ask the expert’ email facility. Cardiac rehabilitation staff can monitor participants’ progress and respond to questions posted via email. After 12 weeks, the cardiac rehabilitation staff member will see the participant again to discuss progress and local exercise opportunities. Cardiac rehabilitation staff will report any safety events that they become aware of.</p>

                <p>The economic evaluation aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ‘Activate Your Heart’ online rehabilitation programme plus optimal usual care when compared with optimal usual care alone. The rehabilitation programme will be fully costed using unit costs from a health service perspective. Unit costs will be obtained from national sources of reference costs and applied to information received from pilot questionnaires, namely salary band of cardiac rehabilitation therapists, time spent with the participant at the initial and final rehabilitation appointments, costs of travel and the costs of registering with the ‘Activate Your Heart’ online cardiac rehabilitation programme. Participants’ health service activity data will be obtained from the CSRI<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and unit costs from national sources.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> The costs of service use and the cost of the intervention will be added together for use in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We will account for the likely skewed nature of cost data in any regression carried out, by using Tweedie regression and/or beta distributions. The EQ-5D-5L scores will be converted into a health utility weight using UK norms. The base-case analysis will be conducted using the Van Hout scoring algorithm,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with sensitivity analysis conducted using the EQ-5D-5L value set for England.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Utility indices will be used to calculate QALYs over the 12-month trial period, using the area under the curve approach, with regression-based adjustment for baseline EQ-5D utility scores.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> The health economic results will initially be presented as disaggregated tables of costs alongside the health consequences. In these tables, we will also describe the costs and consequences of the rehabilitation intervention in the underserved groups recruited, such as women, ethnic minorities and those of low socioeconomic status.</p>
                <p>Costs and consequences will then be combined in a cost–utility analysis, to estimate the cost per additional QALY gained associated with each of the compared options. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the robustness of the obtained results to sample variability and plausible variations in key assumptions and employed analytical methods. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed to show the probability that the intervention is cost-effective at specific thresholds of cost per QALY gained such as NICE threshold range of £20 000–£30 000 per QALY gained.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We will develop a two-stage economic model; a decision tree to reflect the outcomes of the trial (within-trial economic evaluation) and a Markov state transition model to extrapolate the evolution of patient outcome and costs over a lifetime horizon (model-based economic evaluation). Value of information analysis will be conducted after taking into account uncertainty derived from decision-analytical models.</p>

                <title>Process evaluation</title>

By conducting a process evaluation, it will be possible to identify if observed impacts are solely due to the cardiac rehabilitation programme, or if these impacts are a result of external and internal variables closely linked to the environment and the context in which the intervention takes place. More specifically, the process evaluation will examine the recruitment of sites and rehabilitation teams, recruitment and reach in participants (from the recruitment log), intervention delivery to individuals (coverage, intensity), participation, retention, response of individuals to the rehabilitation intervention (data collected by the ‘Activate Your Heart’ website), unintended consequences (adverse events and inequities), contextual factors and sustained motivation for behaviour change. The website will be examined for the degree of completion of the programme, the number of occasions that the website was accessed and the extent of the change in behaviour(s) recorded. There will be a particular focus on underserved groups (women, ethnic minorities, low socioeconomic status, other PROGRESS-Plus<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> characteristics and those without internet access or device).</p>
                <p>Semistructured telephone or video interviews of participants (n=30) with purposive sampling to ensure diversity based on age, gender, functional impairment, treatment group, site, ethnicity and mode of delivery. A topic guide will be developed with the assistance of our Public Advisory Group and will ask about the acceptability of the rehabilitation programme and the barriers and facilitators of uptake and completion, such as family support, health inequities, lack of facilities, lack of transport, etc. However, topic guides will be iterative and informed by earlier interviews and adapted accordingly. There will be a particular focus on the acceptability and barriers to implementation in underserved groups (women, ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status). Interviews will take place at the end of the 12-week cardiac rehabilitation programme among those receiving the intervention, and between months 11 and 12 in both groups. We will interview a minimum of 10 cardiac rehabilitation staff at different time points, to gain insight into the early, medium-term and longer-term delivery of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. All of the interviews will be audio recorded and fully transcribed. Participant contact with the online discussion forum, and the ‘ask the expert’ email facility will also be examined. We will also examine data collected routinely by the website for the purposes of the national audit for cardiac rehabilitation. Qualitative data will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Quantitative data (recruitment logs, use of the website, recorded change in behaviours, national audit data) will be analysed using descriptive statistics to allow for the exploration of frequency of responses.
