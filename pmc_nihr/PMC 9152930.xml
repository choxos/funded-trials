                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) frequently undertake physiotherapy programmes to improve walking and balance. They often require adult support to exercise in a functional position. A novel interactive exercise trainer has been devised to enable children to exercise with against resistance in a functional position, but its efficacy has yet to be proved. A novel protocol has been developed to determine whether a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is feasible.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is multicentre randomised controlled feasibility trial with an embedded qualitative study. Forty children with CP, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) I–III will be recruited from community paediatric physiotherapy caseloads. Participants will be randomised to 10 weeks of training with the interactive training device or to usual physiotherapy care. The mediolateral motion of the centre of mass estimate and Paediatric Balance Scale will be explored as potential primary outcomes measures, tested at baseline, 10 weeks and follow-up at 20 weeks. The views of child participants, their parents and physiotherapists will be gained through e-diaries and qualitative interviews.</p>
                  <p>Feasibility will be determined by examining recruitment and retention rates, completeness of, adherence to the intervention, appropriateness of outcome measures and effectiveness of blinding. Results will be reported in accordance to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders affecting the development of movement and posture that occurs in 2.1 per 1000 children worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Difficulties with walking and balance are common and can limit participation in schooling and functional activities.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> There are multiple causes of walking difficulties in children with CP, including spasticity and weakness, which affects 80% of children.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Additionally, children with CP often have poor balance, which further impacts on everyday functional tasks, such as dressing.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Walking ability can be classified using the Gross Motor Function Classification system (GMFCS).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Children with GMFCS I–III are the focus of the proposed study. Children with GMFCS classification I–II are able to walk functionally outdoors, while children with grade III GMFCS require walking aids.</p>
              <p>Physiotherapists frequently prescribe exercise programmes for children with CP aimed at maintaining range of movement, strengthening weak muscles and developing balance skills. In many cases, the children find it hard to undertake exercises in functional positions such as standing, without support from an adult. The Happy Rehab (Innovaid, Denmark) interactive exercise trainer was developed (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) to help children exercise more independently in a functional supported standing position. It provides support around the hips and additional assistance and resistance via motors aligned to the ankle and knees. This allows the child to exercise muscles functionally in novel ranges, for example, strengthening the thigh muscles with the hip and knee in a straighter position. The games-based exercises may increase motivation and require the child to control the games by moving their weight side-to-side, forward and backward. It is proposed that this may improve balance during dynamic tasks such as walking.</p>

              <p>A small scale study of the interactive trainer found marked improvements in walking, but had a number of limitations in terms of outcome measures used, lack of follow-up and control group.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Therefore, evidence is still required to establish the efficacy of the equipment. Initially, a study is required to establish the feasibility of such a trial within a community physiotherapy service.</p>
              <p>This study aims to establish whether it is feasible to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of this complex intervention, and to assess the acceptability of the interactive trainer and the trial protocol to physiotherapists, children and their families.</p>

                <title>Trial design and setting</title>
                <p>The research question is as follows: Is it feasible to conduct a multicentre randomised control trial of a physiotherapy programme using an interactive exercise trainer to improve balance in ambulant children with CP? This trial is a single-blinded; multicentre feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative study. Community paediatric physiotherapists working at Child Development Centres (CDCs) will recruit children from their caseloads. The study will be conducted between 9 February 2021 and 1 August 2022. Participants will be randomly allocated to training with the Happy Rehab device, or to the control group of usual physiotherapy care. Both groups will carry out 10 weeks training at home, the clinic or their school. The study will compare the intensity of training in different settings. Qualitative semistructured interviews with a subgroup of physiotherapists, parents and children will take place to explore their experiences of taking part; interviews will take place in the clinic or child’s home.</p>
                <p>The research question can be framed in the following way:</p>
                <p>P Population—Children with CP aged 4–18 years.</p>
                <p>I Intervention—A programme of physiotherapy using the interactive training device.</p>
                <p>C Comparison group—Usual care.</p>
                <p>O Outcome of interest—Feasibility of the trial and intervention.</p>
                <p>T Time—Training three times per week for 10 weeks, plus follow-up at week 10 and week 20.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Four devices will be available and situated in special schools, CDCsor the child’s home. The child’s physiotherapist will be trained to set up the device targeting exercises to improve range of movement, contracture and muscle weakness. This may include active-assisted hip, knee or ankle movements within specified ranges of movement or side-to-side and forward and back weight transfer. The treating physiotherapist will personalise the exercise programme based on a standardised assessment, including a discussion with the child and their guardian about their goals and aims of any intervention.</p>
                <p>The child will use a pseudonym of their choice to log onto the games, and to maintain confidentiality. Children will play the games within the mid-range of muscle length to begin with so that the games are difficult but achievable. This will aid motivation and adherence. After 5 weeks, the child’s physiotherapist will progress the games by requiring the muscles to work in the inner and outer ranges of movement and/or against increased resistance. Training will build up to 20 min per day, 3 days a week over a 2-week period, with progression to a 30 min programme per day, 3 days a week after 5 weeks. The child will train with supervision from by the child’s therapist, teaching assistant, parent or carer. The children will follow a series of games following a 2 min warm up of continuous passive movement. The interactive trainer records the training session (duration, games performed games outcomes) to provide a description of the parameters of training.</p>
                <p>The control group will receive a usual care physiotherapy programme individualised for each child lasting 20–30 min.</p>
                <p>Collaborative goal setting combined with an e-diary will allow the children and their parents/carers from both arms of the study to monitor progress over time and record their satisfaction with their exercise programme. The research team will assess fidelity through e-diaries, recording of exercise parameters via the interactive trainer and by observing ten exercise sessions and completing a fidelity checklist, to ensure the intervention follows protocol.</p>

                  <p>This will be a single-blinded RCT. The assessor will be blinded to allocation while carrying out the assessments at baseline and week 10. It will not be possible to for the assessor to remain blinded to group allocation for the 12 participants taking part in qualitative interviews occurring at week 11. However, the assessor will remain blinded to group allocation at week 20 for the remaining participants who are not undertaking the interviews.</p>

                  <p>Participants will be randomly allocated at a ratio of 1:1 and will be minimised by age (above or below 9 years) and by GMFCS level (level I and II vs level III). This is because acquisition of gross motor ability peaks by age 9, and children above that age plateau or may decline in motor skills.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The minimisation sequence and randomised allocations will be computer-generated in conjunction with an independent statistician. The blinded assessor will enter the details required for randomisation into the study website, book the participant’s first appointment with the treating therapist.</p>
                  <p>An email will be generated by the study website to inform the local treating physiotherapist of the participant’s allocated group. The treating physiotherapist will reveal group allocation to the participant at the first session. An unblinded researcher will arrange for the interactive trainer to be transported to the site where the child usually does their physiotherapy for example, school, CDC, home.</p>

                  <p>This qualitative study uses novel ways of data collection with the children including semistructured e-diaries using electronic tablet devices and photo-elicitation interviews. Semistructured interviews will be undertaken with parents/carers and physiotherapists. Triangulation of the e-diaries and interviews will be used to provide credibility, ensuring that the understanding of the full scope of the experiences related to participating in the trial is as complete as possible from the perspectives of the children, parents and physiotherapists. Twelve parent–child dyads will be recruited (30% of the total sample of the feasibility study). Four physiotherapists, who have delivered the intervention and control treatments in different settings, will be interviewed. Sampling of up to eight parents who declined or withdrew their child from the study will be undertaken.</p>

                <p>Trial data collected will be recorded on a paper copy of a trial-specific case report form (CRF) and will be considered source data. The blinded assessor will complete the CRFs for all participants. Completeness of data will be maximised by checking all forms at each assessment to ensure there are no missing items. Automatically generated prompts will be sent by email to encourage the participants to return their diaries, should they fail to do so within 2 weeks of the due date. Double-entered data will be compared for discrepancies using a stored procedure, and discrepant data will be verified using the original paper data forms. Before database lock, a proportion of original paper records will be checked against the database to ensure accuracy of the final dataset.</p>
                <p>Confidentiality will be maintained by allocating a participant number to all CRFs and keeping the securely codes stored separately. Audiorecorded interviews will be transcribed and anonymised as soon as practicable. Original recordings will be held securely as an encrypted file on the University of Plymouth server, until completion of the qualitative data analysis process, then deleted.</p>
                <p>Data will be collected and stored in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998/General Data Protection Regulation 2018.

                <p>A sample size of 40 participants will allow the overall recruitment rate to be estimated. It is anticipated that follow-up of a minimum of 12 participants in each of the intervention and usual care groups would provide sufficient data to inform indicative sample size calculations for the definitive main trial. An estimated recruitment rate of three to four children per month over a 12-month period has been calculated based on population and previous experience.</p>

              <p>This study sets out to explore the feasibility of conducting a trial using a complex intervention in a variety of community settings. Using the proposed protocol, we will explore barriers and facilitators to running the trial. The protocol sets out a model of loaning the training device for an intensive ten-week intervention. We will be collecting initial data to indicate cost of the device, transport, repairs and maintenance. We anticipate that the logistics of transporting the devices within the community may prove difficult using existing infrastructures. We will be able to test these procedures to gain realistic timescales for a full trial.</p>
              <p>We plan to include children with a range of cognitive, sensory and motor skills and we will examine if our primary outcome will capture change across all participants. By engaging in qualitative interviews, we will be able to determine the children and their parents’ experiences of and perspectives on both the intervention and proposed outcomes, gaining important information whether these were acceptable or if outcomes were too difficult or took long. We will be able to examine their perspectives on any impact that the location (school, home or clinics) has on participation, as well the wider impact on their levels of participation and ability to manage their condition.</p>
              <p>The main limitation of the trial is the lack of power to determine a significant difference in outcome measures. However, this feasibility study is an important step towards designing a full trial to test the efficacy and economic benefit of using a novel interactive exercise trainer to improve walking and balance in children with CP.</p>
