                  <p>There were no significant differences associated with early treatment use.
The mean contracture cost for the treatment group was £817 and for the

(<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.04). The cost per unit of improvement for the
Barthel Index was −£1240 indicating that the intervention costs less and is
more effective. The cost per unit of improvement for the Action Research Arm
Test was −£450 indicating that the intervention costs less and is more
effective.</p>

                  <p>Treating spasticity early in stroke patients at risk of contractures with
botulinum toxin leads to a significant reduction in contracture costs. The
cost per improvement of Barthel and Action Research Arm Test indicates that

              <p>The cost of managing stroke places a significant burden on the individual, families
and the economy.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These costs significantly increase in stroke patients who
develop complications such as spasticity, contractures, pain and pressure
sores.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="bibr3-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There is
a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that spasticity occurs early following
stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In patients who do not recover useful arm function, this is
likely to lead to contractures, pressure sores and pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Botulinum toxin is one treatment that can reduce spasticity<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but it is not routinely offered
to acute stroke patients. A possible reason for this could be the perception that
this drug is expensive.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Apart from one cost-effectiveness study from the results of
a randomised-controlled trial,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> economic studies have either
used retrospective cohort analysis<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> or economic modelling using
expert opinion.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="bibr8-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We have previously demonstrated that screening and treating spasticity early, on
first presentation after the first stroke in patients who have no useful arm
function, with botulinum toxin prevents contractures, reduces pain, and does not
interfere with functional recovery (EUBoSS Trial).<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This current paper uses results
from this randomised-controlled trial to investigate the cost-consequences of using
botulinum toxin early in the management of spasticity following stroke.</p>

              <p>This study reports on the cost-consequences of the early use of botulinum toxin in
post-stroke spasticity. The trial was approved by North West – Greater Manchester
South Ethics Committee Reference number 10/H1003/111. It was registered with EudraCT
(2010-021257-39) and at ClinicalTrials.gov-Identifier: NCT01882556.</p>
              <p>The protocol<sup><xref rid="bibr9-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
and the results related to effectiveness have previously been published.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In brief, in
this double-blind placebo-controlled study, patients with an Action Research Arm
Test grasp-score ⩽2 and who developed spasticity within six weeks of a first stroke
were randomised to receive injections of either 0.9% sodium-chloride solution
(placebo) or onabotulinumtoxin-A (treatment). In addition to a range of measures of
impairment and hand function, the Barthel Index, and Action Research Arm Test were
measured at six months post-stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Further, details regarding participants’ use of health services were documented at
two, four, six and 12 weeks following treatment and at six months post-stroke. These
included GP visits, hospital visits and admissions. Current medication use and any
changes from discharge were documented. Treatments to manage contractures were also
recorded. Patients were encouraged to document such activities in a diary and this
additional informal questioning was completed at each review to ensure all
information was provided.</p>
              <p>Resource use costs associated with the study were summarised into relevant categories
and valued in £ sterling using a price year of 2017/18. The costs were determined
from national published sources of unit costs British National Formulary,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> National
Health Service reference costs (NHS 2017/2018) and estimated contracture
costs.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The Barthel Index and Action Research Arm Test were used to generate a cost per unit
of improvement in each of the measures. A one-way sensitivity analysis was
undertaken (using IBM SPSS 27) to assess the extent of potential changes in the main
cost parameters and outcomes of the treatment using the mean difference and lower
and upper bounds of the confidence intervals. The 95% confidence interval of net
cost and changes in outcomes were used to generate a series of potential scenarios
and explore the changes in the estimated cost per unit of improvement.</p>

              <p>We have previously demonstrated that the early use of botulinum toxin reduced
spasticity and contractures after stroke and that the effects lasted for
approximately 12 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In this study, we have demonstrated that the additional
treatment with botulinum toxin does not lead to an increase in cost associated with
managing these patients.</p>
              <p>This indicates that the early use of botulinum toxin for post-stroke spasticity can
be cost-saving to the NHS when assessed in terms of gain in the activity of daily
living (Barthel Index) and arm function (total Action Research Arm Test). This
result contrasts with previously reported cost-effectiveness data that suggested
that the base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for botulinum toxin type A
plus therapy was £93,500.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, it is possible that the magnitude of difference can
be explained by the differences in the two studies: <list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The previous study measured response to treatment using the Modified
Ashworth Score (an invalidated measure of spasticity),<sup><xref rid="bibr12-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>
which has previously been shown to underestimate treatment
effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>The previous study treatment was initiated in patients who are likely to

46 weeks post-stroke).<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This contrasts with
the current study where treatment was initiated in patients who
presented with spasticity prior to contractures being established (mean
time to treatment 14 days post-stroke).<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>The previous study primarily focused on improving function using a

study,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> the primary focus was to prevent
contractures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the current study, all patients had an Action Research Arm Test of 0
to 2 at injection,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> whereas in the
previous study 45% of the participants had an Action Research Arm Test
&gt;3.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p></list-item></list>There are two main limitations in this study. The first is that the study had
a small sample size and was not powered to assess cost-effectiveness. As a result,
some data was not recorded and is therefore absent from the analysis. For example,
the number of therapist contacts following discharge to the community was not
recorded. A further limitation is that this study has only been able to assess the
health costs rather than additional social costs. While the study recorded details
about the number of paid social care services participants received, unpaid family
care was not recorded. Secondly, the patients were not monitored longer term, so we
have had to estimate the costs associated with treating contractures. Currently,
evidence suggests contractures are likely to be common<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and are often not managed well.
The costs for long-term management of contractures can be high. It may involve
treating repeated infections with antibiotics, the treatment of pressure sores and
surgery for debridement or to reduce discomfort and allow for basic hygiene. For the
purposes of this study, we have used a mean cost for the long-term management of
contractures of £9193.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-02692155221133522" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We feel that this is a realistic cost that includes the
full direct and indirect costs of contracture management.</p>
              <p>This study is the first randomised-controlled study using botulinum toxin early to
analyse the potential cost-effectiveness of trying to manage contractures. It
provides data that suggests that the perceived expense of botulinum toxin early
after a stroke before any contractures have developed may help reduce health costs
longer term. Clinicians, often subconsciously, make decisions based on the cost of
treatment on a daily basis. This is a form of rationing services which clinicians
are often unaware they make. It is uncomfortable for clinicians who want to be
patient-centred but must balance this ideal, with remaining service-centred to
ensure patient flow through their service. We hope that this study helps to ease
just one of the many cost-based treatment decisions that clinicians must make.</p>
              <p>Treating spasticity early, in stroke patients at risk of contractures, with botulinum
toxin does not lead to a significant increase in cost associated with managing these
patients. Future-powered studies should now focus on the long-term
cost-effectiveness associated with treatment involving botulinum toxin and ensure
all social costs are included to allow for a more meaningful result.</p>
