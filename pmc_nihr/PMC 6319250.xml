                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, a disease affecting younger patients, is rapidly increasing. Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, has been proposed for treatment de-escalation in this setting to reduce the toxicity of standard cisplatin treatment, but no randomised evidence exists for the efficacy of this strategy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did an open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 32 head and neck treatment centres in Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK, in patients aged 18 years or older with HPV-positive low-risk oropharyngeal cancer (non-smokers or lifetime smokers with a smoking history of &lt;10 pack-years). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive, in addition to radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions), either intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiotherapy) or intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> loading dose followed by seven weekly infusions of 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The primary outcome was overall severe (grade 3–5) toxicity events at 24 months from the end of treatment. The primary outcome was assessed by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN33522080.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2016, 334 patients were recruited (166 in the cisplatin group and 168 in the cetuximab group). Overall (acute and late) severe (grade 3–5) toxicity did not differ significantly between treatment groups at 24 months (mean number of events per patient 4·8 [95% CI 4·2–5·4] with cisplatin <italic>vs</italic> 4·8 [4·2–5·4] with cetuximab; p=0·98). At 24 months, overall all-grade toxicity did not differ significantly either (mean number of events per patient 29·2 [95% CI 27·3–31·0] with cisplatin <italic>vs</italic> 30·1 [28·3–31·9] with cetuximab; p=0·49). However, there was a significant difference between cisplatin and cetuximab in 2-year overall survival (97·5% <italic>vs</italic> 89·4%, hazard ratio 5·0 [95% CI 1·7–14·7]; p=0·001) and 2-year recurrence (6·0% <italic>vs</italic> 16·1%, 3·4 [1·6–7·2]; p=0·0007).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Compared with the standard cisplatin regimen, cetuximab showed no benefit in terms of reduced toxicity, but instead showed significant detriment in terms of tumour control. Cisplatin and radiotherapy should be used as the standard of care for HPV-positive low-risk patients who are able to tolerate cisplatin.</p>

              <p id="para10">The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is increasing rapidly in high-income countries,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> reaching epidemic proportions in some estimates.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This increase has been attributed to a rise in human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is considered to be a distinct disease entity from HPV-negative head and neck cancer. The disease affects younger adults and treatment can be successful.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> HPV status, tumour nodal stage, and smoking history define three groups with distinct survival outcomes: low risk (HPV-positive, &lt;10 pack-years; 3-year overall survival 93%), intermediate risk (HPV-positive, &gt;10 pack-years; 3-year overall survival 71%) and high risk (HPV-negative; 3-year overall survival 48%).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab bioradiotherapy are both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of head and neck cancer, with cisplatin being standard of care for advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in most countries. However, concurrent cisplatin therapy is associated with substantial increases in acute, sometimes life-threatening, toxicity,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> compared with radiotherapy alone. The treatment also increases long-term sequelae,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> including xerostomia and dysphagia. Consequently, young patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma might endure substantial, life-changing side-effects of treatment, that could affect their quality of life, for several decades.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">Standard treatment for human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy) results in considerable acute and long-term toxicity. Wide consensus exists about the need for de-escalation treatments with decreased toxicity and similar survival. Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is thought to result in reduced toxicity and thus might represent an ideal form of de-escalation in this setting. Meta-analyses of existing small, mainly retrospective studies reported poorer outcomes with cetuximab than with cisplatin for head and neck cancers overall, but a possible benefit in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">Results of our open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial show that, in patients with low-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, not only did cetuximab result in similar rates of severe and all-grade toxicity to cisplatin but it importantly resulted in poorer overall survival and higher rates of locoregional recurrence and distant metastases than did standard cisplatin therapy.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy should remain the standard of care for patients with low-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. Our findings also suggest caution with de-escalation strategies and highlight the importance of phase 3 trial data before changing clinical practice.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para100">There is global consensus about the need for treatment de-escalation (reduction of toxicity while preserving anti-tumour efficacy) for these patients.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> One such strategy seeks to substitute cetuximab for cisplatin as the radiosensitiser. Radiotherapy can induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in head and neck cancers, resulting in acquired resistance.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Cetuximab, a targeted EGFR inhibitor, might help overcome this resistance and might also induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In a randomised trial,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> bioradiotherapy with cetuximab was shown to significantly improve overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone (median 49·0 months <italic>vs</italic> 29·3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·74; p=0·03) in patients with head and neck cancer, and, in an updated analysis,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> in patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HR 0·16 [95% CI 0·07–0·36]). Since toxicity rates (except for rash) were broadly similar between the two groups, cetuximab could potentially represent a less toxic alternative to cisplatin in this setting.</p>
              <p id="para110">Conversely, an inverse association between HPV positivity and EGFR status has been reported.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Therefore, EGFR inhibition might not be as effective as chemotherapy in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Studies have reported conflicting results in this regard<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and, as yet, no randomised comparisons have been done in HPV-positive patients. The De-ESCALaTE trial aimed to compare the toxicity, survival, and time-to-recurrence outcomes of cetuximab versus cisplatin in patients with low-risk, HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving radiotherapy in the curative setting. As these treatments might have different effects on quality of life, especially swallowing, relevant patient-reported outcomes were also measured between the two groups.</p>

                <p id="para210">Recruitment of 304 patients was also estimated to allow detection of a 50% reduction in late severe toxicities with at least 90% power and a 25% or greater reduction in acute severe toxicities with 85% power. An additional 30 patients were recruited to allow for withdrawals and any higher risk (T4,N3) patients recruited. The interim analysis was done after the first 200 patients were recruited. More details are provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para220">An intention-to-treat analysis was done for all outcomes, and a per-protocol analysis was done for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes of toxicity and survival. All patients allocated to treatment groups were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, even if they did not receive the treatment. Patients who withdrew or who had major protocol violations as assessed by the independent trial monitoring team were excluded from the per-protocol analyses. All analyses were unblinded.</p>

Proportions of patients affected by one or more toxicity event were compared by Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> test. A severe toxic event was defined as a toxicity assessed as grade 3–5 by CTCAE, version 4. The type of event was characterised by the CTCAE, version 4, System Organ Class and Term. Toxicities were classified as acute if they first appeared during or up to 3 months after treatment, and were classified as late if they persisted, or first appeared, more than 3 months up to 24 months after treatment. Multiple occurrences of events of a single toxicity type within an analysis time period are counted as a single event. Events that were present both within 90 days after treatment and remained after that period were counted as acute events and also as late events but were not counted twice when analysing the overall number of acute and late events. Toxicities reported as part of a serious adverse event notification but that were not reported as a toxicity event were added to the counts of toxicity events.</p>

Patients who died from head and neck cancer causes as the first event were classed as recurrences. New primaries and persistent nodal disease (detected within 90 days from randomisation) were not included in the analysis of time to recurrence. Patients on follow-up and patients lost to follow-up were censored at the last date at which they were known to be alive. 95% CIs were generated with a univariate Cox proportional hazards model. The proportional assumption was tested by plotting the observed Kaplan-Meier values against the Cox predicted values. The effect of randomised treatment on outcome was also assessed after adjusting for known prognostic factors with a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Two post-hoc subgroup sensitivity analyses examined the association with overall survival of the very low-risk group with TNM-8 stage I and II disease, and those who were doubly positive for p16 and HPV-DNA in-situ hybridisation.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para460">HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is projected to become the most common form of head and neck cancer in many developed countries.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Results of our study show that, in the setting of low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the use of cetuximab bioradiotherapy instead of cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy resulted in no overall benefit in terms of toxicity but showed significant detriment in tumour control. Our trial also highlights that the good survival outcomes of HPV-positive low-risk oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are in part a function of the type of treatment received, and not merely a reflection of favourable intrinsic tumour biology. Therefore, cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy should continue to be considered the standard of care in this setting.</p>
              <p id="para470">Contrary to expectations from the findings of the initial cetuximab registration trial,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> the rates of early, late, and overall serious toxicity resulting from cetuximab were not lower than those of cisplatin, although the toxicity profile was different. Global quality of life also appeared to be similar. Less than half of patients received the full dose of cisplatin because of toxicity. However, there was still a significant difference in survival compared with the cetuximab group in which most patients received the full regimen. Although cetuximab does result in fewer serious adverse events, this alone is not sufficient justification for its use in this setting. The findings of our study confirm those of other studies and meta-analyses comparing chemotherapy to bioradiotherapy with EGFR inhibitors in mixed head and neck cancer populations.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Until now, to our knowledge, no randomised studies had been done in HPV-positive disease.</p>
              <p id="para480">As HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a relatively new disease entity, there have been changes in risk classification schemes, its TNM staging system, and the use of p16 immunohistochemistry as the sole determinant of HPV positivity since the inception of this trial and during its conduct. We defined low-risk patients according to the Ang classification,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> which is the most widely cited and used system. Since then, many other prognostic systems have been developed for this indication, each with different component factors. The new AJCC/UICC TNM 8th edition has included a new classification for HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In this new classification, HPV-positive T4 and N3 cases, constituting stage III HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, have been shown to have higher rates of distant metastases than stage I or II tumours.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Additionally, the use of p16 alone as a surrogate marker of HPV causation has been criticised, because in some studies the subsets comprising p16-positive, HPV-DNA-negative disease appear to have poorer outcomes, similar to patients with p16-negative and HPV-DNA-negative disease.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> In other studies, this subset of patients showed similar survival to patients with p16-positive, HPV-positive disease.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> To understand whether these factors affected our conclusions, we did post-hoc sensitivity analyses and found no difference in the results. Patients with T4 or N3 disease appeared to have even higher detriments in overall survival if they were treated with cetuximab than if they were treated with cisplatin. The numbers were small, however, leading to wide confidence intervals.</p>
              <p id="para490">Our study was originally designed to test for differences in toxicity as a means of assessing whether cetuximab effectively reduces treatment-related toxicity for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. We anticipated equivalent disease control and survival endpoints between study groups and did not formally power the study to show non-inferiority. Despite this limitation, the trial shows significant differences in both recurrence and survival endpoints in favour of cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. This outcome appears to be due to a relatively larger effect of cisplatin, compared with cetuximab, on locoregional control and distant metastases. We used p16 and HPV DNA in-situ hybridisation to assess HPV status, as this method is widely accepted<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and is recommended by the US National Comprehensive Care guidelines as one of the appropriate options for this purpose.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> This could be viewed as a limitation, because HPVE6/E7 RNA evaluation by PCR is considered the gold standard for testing HPV status. However, this method is not easily feasible in the clinical setting; moreover, in our study, patients who were p16-positive and HPV-positive showed similar survival rates to those who were p16-positive and HPV-negative.</p>
              <p id="para500">Studies testing different de-escalation approaches for low-risk and intermediate-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma are underway. Our data suggest that cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy delivers substantially improved outcomes compared with bioradiotherapy with cetuximab, even in patients with good outcomes. Assuming that cetuximab does not reduce the efficacy of radiotherapy to control disease, these findings support the beneficial effects of adding cisplatin to radiotherapy in this group of patients. The reduced rate of distant metastasis also suggests that cisplatin might contribute to a systemic effect, even in low-risk patients. In light of our findings, we would advise caution with de-escalation strategies, especially those that remove systemic chemotherapy altogether, and strongly advocate that the results of phase 3 trials should be awaited before making any changes to routine clinical management.</p>
              <p id="para510">This study is, to our knowledge, one of the first to compare cetuximab with cisplatin in combination with radiotherapy in the context of treatment de-escalation in HPV-positive disease. Not only did this trial show no reduction in toxicity with cetuximab but it also confirmed a statistically and clinically significant detriment in tumour control and survival endpoints with this therapy. These results have immediate implications for clinical practice and highlight the importance of doing comparative phase 3 trials in new indications, even for treatments that are already approved or have shown benefit in phase 2 trials.</p>

              <p>De-identified participant data and the data dictionary will be available along with the study protocol and statistical analysis plan from Jan 1, 2020, onwards. Please email <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="mailto:M.L.Dalby@warwick.ac.uk" id="interrefs20">M.L.Dalby@warwick.ac.uk</ext-link>. The final dataset will include basic demographics, tumour characteristics, treatment detail, survival, and quality of life and toxicity outcomes. Data will not include name, address, hospital number or date of birth, or any other identifying data. The data will be accompanied by metadata which gives a complete explanation of the data fields, the definition, the standards used such as TNM staging, and the units used. The data will be shared through custodianship by the principal investigator. A data access committee will be convened and will comprise the principal investigator and two other co-investigators. They will be responsible for assessing requests for data sharing about granting access. The data management committee will be responsible to the steering committee and requests for appeals will be made directly to the trial steering committee. The process for requesting data sharing will be as follows: the requestor will complete a two-page proforma requiring name and contact details of the requestor, the objectives of the study, the methodology, the expected outcome, the statistical analysis plan, whether the project will be a collaboration with the DeESCALaTE study organisers or will only acknowledge the study and its organisers, ethical committee approval, and funding and peer review details. The data sharing committee will meet at least twice a year to consider these requests. Urgent requests may be considered in between these meetings. In the event of a declined application, the requestors may lodge an appeal with the trial steering committee chairperson. The dataset will be stored with the principal investigator at the Institute of Head and Neck Studies and Education in the long term. The data will be available for public release from the time of publication of the main results of the study. Prior to that, access of the data may be considered in specific circumstances. After 5 years of publication of the result, the data may then be lodged with a data archiving facility. Requestors who are granted access to the data will be required to complete a data sharing agreement, which is based on the principles, content, and format published by the the National Cancer Research Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncri.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Initiatives-Biobanking-2-Access-template.pdf" id="interrefs30">NCRI</ext-link>).</p>
