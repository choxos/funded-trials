                <p>The ratio of maternal serum sFlt-1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) to PlGF (placental growth factor) has been used retrospectively to rule out the occurrence of preeclampsia, a pregnancy hypertensive disorder, within 7 days in women presenting with clinical suspicion of preeclampsia. A prospective, interventional, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial evaluated the use of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in women presenting with suspected preeclampsia. Women were assigned to reveal (sFlt-1/PlGF result known to clinicians) or nonreveal (result unknown) arms. A ratio cutoff of 38 was used to define low (≤38) and elevated risk (&gt;38) of developing the condition in the subsequent week. The primary end point was hospitalization within 24 hours of the test. Secondary end points were development of preeclampsia and other adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. We recruited 370 women (186 reveal versus 184 nonreveal). Preeclampsia occurred in 85 women (23%). The number of admissions was not significantly different between groups (n=48 nonreveal versus n=60 reveal; <italic>P</italic>=0.192). The reveal trial arm admitted 100% of the cases that developed preeclampsia within 7 days, whereas the nonreveal admitted 83% (<italic>P</italic>=0.038). Use of the test yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.8–100) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI, 97.1–100) compared with a sensitivity of 83.3 (95% CI, 58.6–96.4) and negative predictive value of 97.8 (95% CI, 93.7–99.5) with clinical practice alone. Use of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio significantly improved clinical precision without changing the admission rate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Preeclampsia, a heterogeneous, multisystem disorder defined by the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria or evidence of end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation affects 2 to 5% of pregnancies worldwide.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Preeclampsia is associated with a high risk of iatrogenic preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) infant, placental abruption, and perinatal mortality, along with significant maternal morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Although hypertension and proteinuria are hallmarks of the disease, they have poor predictive value for the development of adverse outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, the initial clinical presentation is heterogeneous and current clinical tools applied to women who present with clinical suspicion of the disease do not allow accurate prediction of the development of preeclampsia even in the short term; this inability to effectively rule in or rule out the condition in those at risk means some cases are missed,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> whereas many women are unnecessarily admitted for monitoring or followed up intensively.</p>
            <p>Recently, angiogenic factors (specifically sFlt-1 [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1] and/or PlGF [placental growth factor]) have been suggested as good candidate biomarkers for the prediction of preeclampsia occurring in the short term. The largest study conducted to date analyzed the performance of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in women who presented with suspected preeclampsia.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The study showed that a ratio ≤38 conferred a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.3% (95% CI, 97.9–99.9) for developing preeclampsia within 7 days, whereas a ratio &gt;38 conferred a positive predictive value (PPV) of 36.7% (95% CI, 28.4–45.7) for developing preeclampsia within 4 weeks.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Several authors suggested that implementation of sFlt-1/PlGF into clinical practice may be of benefit by reducing unnecessary admissions for those at low risk of developing the disease in the short term and by more targeted increase in surveillance for those at high risk.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Additionally, given its good correlation with outcomes,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> it has been suggested that it could be valuable in guiding management in women with preeclampsia, such as optimization of timing of delivery or timing of corticosteroid administration. Collectively this could allow better resource allocation by reducing costs in low-risk women, and potentially improve outcomes in both low- and high-risk women.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, existing studies are either observational or retrospective and meaning that economic analyses and recommendations for clinical use have limitations.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
            <p>To address these shortcomings, we designed this randomized clinical trial to assess whether the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, used in combination with current clinical guidelines as used in real-life practice, could reduce the number of women admitted due to a suspicion of preeclampsia and to assess the real-world performance and clinical utility of this test in its ability to detect preeclampsia in daily clinical practice.</p>

                <p>INSPIRE (Interventional Study Evaluating the Short-Term Prediction of Preeclampsia / Eclampsia In Pregnant Women With Suspected Preeclampsia) was a prospective interventional randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>We used a 1:1 ratio for randomization. Participants were individually randomized to either standard clinical management or standard clinical management + sFlt-1/PlGF ratio result. The allocation was determined by the laboratory team using 1:1 randomization using a computer-based system. The allocation was not known to the clinical teams assessing the women.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Eligible participants were pregnant women (18 years old or older), between 24+0 and 37+0 weeks of gestation with a clinical suspicion of preeclampsia. This was judged according to the following: new onset elevated blood pressure<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or worsening of preexisting hypertension or new onset proteinuria (any protein in the urine &gt;trace on dipstick) or worsening of preexisting proteinuria or new onset headache, visual disturbance, edema or right upper quadrant pain, or any other clinical suspicion of preeclampsia.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria were preexisting diagnosed preeclampsia/eclampsia or hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet counts syndrome, multiple pregnancy, inability to provide informed consent/unwillingness to participate or significant disease (ie, cancer) or disorder (ie, significant mental health problems), which in the opinion of the investigator might either put the participants at risk or influence the result of the study or the participant’s ability to participate in the study.</p>

                <title>Standard Clinical Management of Suspected Preeclampsia</title>
                <p>Management of suspected preeclampsia involved initial assessment of blood pressure, proteinuria (first by urine dipstick and then by urine protein:creatinine ratio if dipstick was positive), urine microscopy and culture, baseline blood tests (full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and clotting), as well as physical examination and cardiotocography. Blood pressure was managed according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Decisions to admit were made by the attending doctor (either alone or after discussion with a senior colleague) and depended on clinical condition or concerns. Ultrasonographic assessment of the fetus was usually performed on those patients who were admitted.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Women who presented with signs or symptoms of preeclampsia were approached to participate in the study. After informed consent, they had clinical assessment and standard clinical management blood taken as well as an additional sample for sFlt-1/PlGF. Blood samples were processed in the central laboratory, and turn-around time was 60 minutes. Once the sample was received, women were randomized by the laboratory team to either nonreveal (comparator; standard clinical management) or reveal (intervention; standard clinical management + sFlt-1/PlGF ratio result) trial arms and the clinical team informed of the allocation.</p>
                <p>In the reveal (intervention) arm, the sFlt-1/PlGF results were available to the clinicians alongside the other requested blood samples. In the nonreveal (comparator) arm, the sFlt-1/PlGF results were not available until trial completion, and patients were managed according to standard clinical management, without knowledge of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. The same clinical team attended women from the reveal and nonreveal trial arms.</p>
                <p>In the reveal arm, sFlt-1/PlGF ratio was incorporated into the clinical decision framework with a ratio of ≤38 considered to confer low risk of developing preeclampsia within 7 days and a ratio &gt;38 deemed elevated risk.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The clinical algorithm for the reveal group advised discharge of women with ratio ≤38 unless deemed necessary by the clinician due to concerning clinical features. For women with ratio &gt;38, a low threshold for admission or increased surveillance was advised.</p>
                <p>Admission was defined as any admission arising within 24 hours, driven by clinical assessment (+ sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in the reveal group only) at the time of recruitment. (S1 Appendix in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.12739">online-only Data Supplement</ext-link>). Importantly, the decision-making in the reveal group was not based only on the ratio but on the consideration of the ratio in conjunction with assessment of the clinical picture (ie, if the attending clinician thought admission was warranted, the patient was admitted). Although pathways for the intervention and control arms were provided to clinicians, the final management decision, based on either subjective or structured risk assessment, as well as test results, was at the clinician’s discretion, reflecting a pragmatic approach to more reliably assess real-world effectiveness. Continuous training and education about the ratio and its clinical interpretation were given before and during the trial. Knowledge of the ratio was used only as an indication for admission and follow-up not for delivery, which was performed according to current clinical guidelines. Research staff recorded, but did not intervene in, clinical decisions.</p>

Method reproducibility, assessed as interassay percent coefficient of variation, for sFlt-1 was 5.1% at 102 pg/mL and 2.8% at 1043 pg/mL and for PLGF was 3.0% at 106 pg/mL and 2.9% at 1069 pg/mL.</p>

                    <title>Primary Outcome</title>
                    <p>The primary outcome was preeclampsia-related inpatient admission within 24 hours of the test, within 7 days, or by delivery. Preeclampsia-related inpatient admission was defined as an admission driven by suspicion of preeclampsia defined as above, where preeclampsia has been recorded as a differential diagnosis and where ongoing blood pressure monitoring, assessment of proteinuria, and preeclampsia blood samples have been requested. Patients who were admitted without these (eg, after premature rupture of membranes or threatened preterm labor) were not deemed to have had a preeclampsia-related admission. This was defined after case report form review by experienced clinicians who were blinded to the trial arm, sFlt-1/PlGF result, and clinical outcome. If 3 independent assessors could not unanimously agree, an external arbiter (A.T. Papageorghiou) made the final decision—in 4 cases.</p>

                    <p>Secondary outcomes were incidence of preeclampsia within 7 days and by the time of delivery; birth weight; Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) admission; Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score at delivery; platelet count, renal, and hepatic function measured using blood tests at time of first clinical assessment (ie, study enrollment/baseline) and time of delivery.</p>
                    <p>The diagnosis of preeclampsia was made according to the following criteria: diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg together with proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ≥30 mg/mmol) or serum creatinine &gt;97 μmol/L, elevated liver transaminases to twice the normal concentration or platelets &lt;100 000/dL. Superimposed preeclampsia was defined as an elevation in diastolic BP of &gt;15 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure &gt;30 mm Hg, together with (urine protein/creatinine ≥30 mg/mmol), or serum creatinine &gt;97 μmol/L, elevated liver transaminases to twice the normal concentration, platelets&lt;100 000/dL.</p>
                    <p>SGA was defined as birth weight &lt;10th centile adjusted for newborn sex (Viewpoint software, GE Healthcare, United Kingdom).</p>
                    <p>Outcomes were prospectively extracted from the electronic records, and case notes from the time of birth and with outcome assessors blinded to the sFlt-1/PlGF result. In instances where preeclampsia was not reported before discharge, research staff made a 6-week phone call after delivery and searched online data portals and electronic patient records to determine if postnatal readmissions and additional relevant information existed that had not been reported previously.</p>

                <p>Trial arm comparison revealed significant differences in the segregation of at-risk patients (admitted versus nonadmitted). This showed that use of the ratio was significantly more effective at discriminating and directing admission of patients at risk of preeclampsia within 7 days, lower birth weight, lower APGAR scores, SGA babies, and worse maternal biochemical profiles, as well as time of delivery compared with standard clinical management (Table <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p>

                  <p>To assess if knowledge of the ratio would allow us to make the diagnosis of preeclampsia earlier, we assessed the time to preeclampsia diagnosis in both trial arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table S4). The median time to diagnosis in nonreveal was 9.5 days (IQR, 0–32) compared with 7 days (IQR, 0–29) in the reveal arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.6387). The Kaplan-Meier analysis consistently showed a trend towards earlier diagnosis in the reveal arm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Preeclampsia severity and additional maternal adverse outcomes are presented in Tables S5A and S5B.</p>

                  <p>In the nonreveal arm, the sensitivity in predicting the development of preeclampsia within 7 days was 83.3% (95% CI, 58.6–96.4) for a specificity of 80.1% (95% CI, 73.2–85.9); this was in contrast to the reveal arm, which resulted in a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 85.8–100) for a specificity of 77.8% (95% CI, 70.6–83.9). The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio alone gave a better sensitivity than the nonreveal arm at 95.8% (95% CI, 78.9–99.9). This increased sensitivity was achieved without significant loss of specificity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p>

              <p>At present, the identification of those patients with suspected preeclampsia who warrant admission can be challenging, leading to either unnecessary admissions or missed diagnoses. This is mostly because of inappropriate allocation to high-risk and low-risk groups with standard clinical tools. In this pragmatic trial, women presenting with suspected preeclampsia were randomized to management by sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test in conjunction with standard clinical care versus standard clinical care alone to assess the value of this test on clinical management and admission decisions. There was no difference in the overall number of admissions between the 2 arms. However, using the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio permitted a more accurate admission of high-risk patients and discharge of low-risk patients without changing the overall admission rate. This is supported by the admission of 100% of preeclampsia patients. In addition, the admitted women were more likely to have elevated creatinine and urate and lower platelets, whereas their newborns had lower birth weight and APGAR scores higher SCBU admission rates: all indicators of a higher risk group.</p>
              <p>We hypothesized that use of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio would reduce overall hospitalization—a proxy for a clinical concern that the patient would develop preeclampsia or preeclampsia-related problems; however, this was not found. Nevertheless, use of the test increased the proportion of high-risk patients admitted, without influencing the admission rate. The clearest example is in the correct identification of women with preeclampsia in the reveal arm where use of the ratio in combination with standard clinical management identified 100% of the patients, whereas standard clinical management (nonreveal), by the same clinical team, identified 83%. This translated to 3 patients being sent home who subsequently developed preeclampsia, and, therefore, remained at risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In addition to preeclampsia, the use of the test allowed us to identify women at higher risk of other adverse outcomes, including lower birthweight infants, SGA infants, increased SCBU admissions, and lower APGAR scores. This suggests that use of the ratio with clinical practice might have broader clinical utility not only for predicting preeclampsia but also for related adverse outcomes, as has been suggested by observational studies.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Alongside these impacts, use of the ratio also allowed safe discharge of patients at extremely low risk of preeclampsia. In this study, 126 patients with an initial suspicion of preeclampsia had a ratio ≤38 and were not admitted; of these, none developed preeclampsia within 7 days. In effect, use of the test allowed admission of the right patients.</p>
              <p>Post hoc analysis showed a nonsignificant trend towards a more rapid diagnosis of preeclampsia in the reveal arm. This may be of clinical value in that it suggests that the diagnosis is made more quickly with knowledge of the ratio. This may be either because of increased surveillance or admission of high-risk patients and may ultimately have an impact on infant outcomes. Larger independent studies are warranted to confirm or refute this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>When comparing the nonreveal trial arm with reveal for admission of women who developed preeclampsia within 7 days, we saw an increase in sensitivity from 83.3% to 100% with similar specificity (80.1% versus 77.8%). The PPV of the reveal arm was 40.0% compared with 31% for the nonreveal arm. The NPV for the reveal arm was 100% compared with 97.8% for the nonreveal arm (reflecting the 3 patients sent home). When comparing the sensitivity of the ratio alone (95.8% [95% CI, 78.9–99.9]) it outperformed standard practice (nonreveal) but was not as sensitive as the ratio in combination with clinical practice (reveal). Its specificity was comparable (79.5% [95% CI, 72.4–85.5]) with both standard practice and use of the ratio together with standard practice. Its NPV was reassuringly similar (99.2% [95.8–100]) to that reported in previous observational studies.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These data suggest use of the ratio together with standard clinical practice provides better performance than either the ratio alone or standard clinical practice alone.</p>
              <p>The limitations of this study include the fact that it was confined to a single center, which might limit the generalizability of the findings; it is possible that admission rates differ in other units, although the ability of sFlt-1/PlGF to distinguish women more likely to develop preeclampsia should not be affected by this. The unit is a tertiary referral center; test performance, which included clinical assessment, may differ in a less experienced unit where we hypothesize that use of the ratio would be even more beneficial. It has not escaped our attention that the PPV of the test alone outperformed standard clinical practice. This might be beneficial in resource-poor environments where there is poorer recognition of the disease.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the use of angiogenic biomarkers sFlt-1 and PlGF in women with suspected preeclampsia. It provides real-world evidence for the implementation of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in clinical practice. We observed no change in admission rates, but the results of this study clearly show that the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in combination with standard clinical practice both identifies and leads to correct admission of women with increased risks of preeclampsia and worse biochemical profiles, infants with low birth weight, SGA, low APGAR scores, and increased SCBU admission. This ability lends itself to now asking whether the test could be used to mitigate some of these outcomes, including influencing the timing of birth. Larger studies will be needed to elucidate this.</p>
              <p>In summary, use of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio improved clinical precision without affecting admission rates.</p>

              <p>The management of suspected is clinically complex, principally because of the poor clinical tools currently available. The measurement of angiogenic factors (sFlt-1 and PlGF) has shown significant promise in improving this situation. Here, we present the first clinical trial on the use of sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in patients with suspected preeclampsia and showed that use of the ratio in conjunction with standard clinical practice significantly improves clinical precision without changing admission rates.</p>
