                  <title>PURPOSE</title>
                  <p>Prognosis for adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is poor, and there are currently no licensed CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapeutics. We developed a novel second-generation CD19-CAR (CAT19-41BB-Z) with a fast off rate, designed for more physiologic T-cell activation to reduce toxicity and improve engraftment. We describe the multicenter phase I ALLCAR19 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02935257" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02935257</ext-link>) study of autologous CAT19-41BB-Z CAR T cells (AUTO1) in relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult B-ALL.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>Patients age ≥ 16 years with r/r B-ALL were eligible. Primary outcomes were toxicity and manufacturing feasibility. Secondary outcomes were depth of response at 1 and 3 months, persistence of CAR-T, incidence and duration of hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia, and event-free survival and overall survival at 1 and 2 years.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Twenty-five patients were leukapheresed, 24 products were manufactured, and 20 patients were infused with AUTO1. The median age was 41.5 years; 25% had prior blinatumomab, 50% prior inotuzumab ozogamicin, and 65% prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. At the time of preconditioning, 45% had ≥ 50% bone marrow blasts. No patients experienced ≥ grade 3 cytokine release syndrome; 3 of 20 (15%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved to ≤ grade 1 within 72 hours with steroids. Seventeen of 20 (85%) achieved minimal residual disease–negative complete response at month 1, and 3 of 17 underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation while in remission. The event-free survival at 6 and 12 months was 68.3% (42.4%-84.4%) and 48.3% (23.1%-69.7%), respectively. High-level expansion (Cmax 127,152 copies/µg genomic DNA) and durable CAR-T persistence were observed with B-cell aplasia ongoing in 15 of 20 patients at last follow-up.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>AUTO1 demonstrates a tolerable safety profile, high remission rates, and excellent persistence in r/r adult B-ALL. Preliminary data support further development of AUTO1 as a stand-alone treatment for r/r adult B-ALL.</p>

              <p>CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T has induced sustained disease responses in relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL),<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of Tisagenlecleucel. The role of CD19 CAR-T in adult B-ALL is less clear. Adult CD19 CAR-T trials have shown significant immune-mediated toxicity, relatively short duration engraftment and remission, and a requirement for consolidation with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT).<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> There is currently no licensed CD19 CAR-T for adult B-ALL.

              <p>The CD19-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in CAT19-41BB-Z has a lower affinity for CD19 than FMC63, the scFv used in all currently licensed CD19 CAR-T products.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The affinity of an scFv binding its target is determined by its binding on and off rates. The reduced affinity of CAT19-41BB-Z to CD19 is due to a fast off rate, which imparts rapid dissociation from CD19. We hypothesized that the subsequent shorter cell-cell contact may be advantageous by reducing cytokine release and thereby reducing toxicity, as well as reducing T-cell exhaustion, which may enhance CAR T-cell persistence.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These features would address major limitations of CAR-T therapy in B-ALL, namely, toxicity and lack of durable responses.</p>
              <p>We have previously tested our hypothesis in the pediatric B-ALL setting. Autologous CAT19-41BB-Z CAR-T cells (abbreviated henceforth as AUTO1) demonstrated high efficacy, tolerable safety profile, and durable persistence in a clinical study in pediatric B-ALL (CARPALL; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02443831" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02443831</ext-link>), comparing favorably with outcomes reported in the ELIANA trial of Tisagenlecleucel in the same patient cohort.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The present study, ALLCAR19 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02935257" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02935257</ext-link>), was designed to investigate whether the safety profile, manufacturing feasibility, and preliminary efficacy outcomes of AUTO1 could be reproduced in adults. Given the vulnerability of adult patients with B-ALL to immunotoxicity, we used a fractionated CAR-T dose titrated to disease burden. Furthermore, we explored a semiautomated CAR-T manufacturing system.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The results demonstrate encouraging response and safety characteristics coupled to excellent early AUTO1 expansion and persistence, supporting further development as a stand-alone therapy for r/r adult B-ALL.</p>

                <p>This multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label phase I study was conducted in three centers, treating 20 adult patients with r/r B-ALL. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the Data Supplement (online only) and Protocol (online only). Following leukapheresis and CAR-T manufacture, patients received lymphodepletion (LD) with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 3 doses over 3 days) and cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg, single dose). CAR-T was administered in a split-dose schedule, titrated to pre-LD bone marrow (BM) disease burden. On day 0, patients with blasts &gt; 20% received 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T and patients with blasts ≤ 20% received 100 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T. At an interval of 9 days (in the absence of grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome [ICANS] or grade 1-2 ICANS not fully resolved), dose 2 was administered, to a total dose of 410 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells (Fig <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).</p>

                <p>Of 26 patients registered, 25 were enrolled. One registered patient did not proceed to enrollment because of rapid disease progression. Of the 25 enrolled patients, 24 had apheresate with adequate CD3+ T cells for CAR-T manufacture and generated an autologous CAR-T product, which met predetermined release criteria. Four of 24 patients were not infused. One of four developed CD19-negative relapse following blinatumomab bridging; one of four developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and two of four died from infection in the context of progressive refractory B-ALL (Fig <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).</p>
                <p>Patient demographics for the 20 infused patients are summarized in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The median age was 41.5 years (range, 18-62 years). 75% of patients had an abnormal disease karyotype, and 30% had Ph+ disease. Patients had received a median of three previous lines (range, 2-6) including blinatumomab in 25%, inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) in 50%, and allo-SCT in 65%. No patients had previous CAR-T therapy, and no patients had CNS involvement. All Ph+ patients received ≥ 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors before LD (imatinib 6/6, ponatinib 6/6, and dasatinib 1/6; Data Supplement) and were either relapsed or refractory (4 of 6) or intolerant (2 of 6) to last-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The median observed follow-up on all 20 patients from first infusion was 21.7 months (range, 0.6-33.9 months). Detailed demographic information for all registered patients is given in the Data Supplement.</p>

                <p>Two processes were used for CAR-T manufacture (details are given in the Data Supplement), and all products met release criteria (Data Supplement). Six products were manufactured using process A, and all were infused. Eighteen were manufactured using process B, and 14 of 18 were infused. A target cell dose of 410 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells was achieved in 22 of 24 products (5 of 6, process A; 17 of 18, process B). The median CD3 viability was 99.6% (range, 80.9%-99.9%) at cryopreservation for all manufactured products. The mean CD4/8 ratio was 3.56. The mean transduction efficiency was 66% with a mean stem-cell memory or naive T-cell population of 13.4% and a central memory T-cell compartment of 28.7%. Individual product details are outlined in the Data Supplement.</p>

                <p>The median disease burden for all infused patients was 43% blasts at registration (range MRD level disease to 98% blasts), and 18 of 20 (90%) received bridging therapy (Data Supplement). Thirteen of 20 received vincristine/corticosteroid; 3 of 20 received ponatinib; 3 of 20 received IO; 1 of 20 received FLAG-IDA; and 1 of 20 received UKALL14 reinduction therapy. Repeat BM assessment before LD revealed that 45% of patients had ≥ 50% blasts; 20% had 5%-49% blasts, and 35% had ≤ 5% blasts. Of the 18 of 20 patients who received bridging, only 4 had a significant reduction in disease burden to ≤ 5% blasts: two patients with IO, one with UKALL14, and one with vincristine/dexamethasone.</p>

                  <p>Eight of 20 patients (40%) developed grade 2 CRS; 3 of 20 (15%) developed grade 1 CRS, but no patients experienced ≥ grade 3 CRS, despite 65% having &gt; 5% blasts pre-LD. Ten of 11 patients with CRS had &gt; 5% blasts pre-LD (median, 70%; range, 4%-90%). The median onset of CRS was at 6 days postinfusion (range, 2-31 days), and the median duration was 4.5 days (range, 1-27 days).</p>
                  <p>Tocilizumab was administered in 7 of 20 (35%) cases, all in patients who developed grade 2 CRS. One of eight patients with grade 2 CRS recovered from their blood pressure with fluid boluses and did not require tocilizumab. No patients received corticosteroids for the management of CRS. Using the split-dosing schedule, 15 of 20 patients (75%) received the full protocol-defined dose of 410 × 10<sup>6</sup> AUTO1. Five of 20 patients (25%) received a single dose (10 × 10<sup>6</sup> AUTO1) because of ongoing grade 1 or 2 CRS at day 9 in 3 of 5 cases and because of infection in 2 of 5 cases.</p>

                  <p>ICANS was observed in 4 of 20 (20%) patients of which 3 (15%) were grade 3 but resolved within 24-72 hours to ≤ grade 1 with corticosteroids. The median onset of ICANS was at 22 days postinfusion (range, 14-41 days), and the median duration was 1.5 days (range, 1-8 days). All cases were investigated using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging of brain, EEG, and CSF analysis. Findings of magnetic resonance imaging of brain were variable between the 3 grade 3 ICANS patients: 1 of 3 showed leukoencephalopathy (from previous therapy), 1 of 3 was normal, and 1 of 3 showed ill-defined white matter lesions. EEG detected diffuse slowing in all cases and nonconvulsive status in one case, which terminated with lorazepam. CSF analysis was performed at day 28 in 12 patients, including all cases that developed ICANS. CAR-T cells were readily detected in all CSF samples (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), and the proportion of CD3+ CAR-T cells was increased in patients with ICANS (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). CSF cytokines were low at day 28 (Data Supplement), which is commensurate with findings in the peripheral blood (PB) at the same timepoint (Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).</p>

Late infectious events were more common in the allo-SCT cohort (15 infectious events) compared with the non–allo-SCT cohort (two infectious events; Data Supplement). Infectious deaths occurred in two patients before day 28, from multidrug-resistant bacterial sepsis and fungal pneumonia. Both had primary refractory B-ALL, and both were neutropenic and lymphopenic for ≥ 1 year.

At peak qPCR expansion, the median PB CAR+ T-cell fraction by flow cytometry was 83.7% (range, 5.71%-96.6%), with a median absolute CAR T-cell number (CARs/mL) of 468 (range, 88-8,627). Pharmacokinetic analysis for all treated patients (Data Supplement) showed a mean area under the curve (AUC D0-28) of 1,251,802 copies/µg gDNA. Cmax and AUC D0-28 are higher for AUTO1 (all patients) than those reported for adult B-ALL Tisagenlecleucel responders (Cmax = 54,248.9 and AUC 0-28 = 485,033 copies/µg gDNA, respectively).<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>

Finally, Turtle et al<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> described severe CRS in 7 of 25 CAR T-cell recipients and severe ICANS in 15 of 30.</p>
              <p>We developed CAT19-41BB-Z, a CD19 CAR with a rapid binding off rate for CD19,<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> designed to reduce the magnitude of T-cell activation per target cell encounter and hence reduce immunotoxicity and improve engraftment. Toxicity was low in pediatric r/r B-ALL with CAR-T persistence for ≥ 1 year in most patients, although the majority had low disease burden before CAR-T. Given the potential for toxicity in adults and consideration of treating patients with higher disease burden, we incorporated both risk-adaptive and split-dosing into the ALLCAR19 study design. Dose titration to marrow disease burden can reduce toxicity,<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> whereas split-dosing permits delay or discontinuation of the second dose in the event of onset of toxicity.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Despite high disease burden in many patients, immunotoxicity was relatively limited in our study with no CRS ≥ grade 3 and only three patents developed grade 3 ICANS, which responded swiftly to corticosteroids, resolving to ≤ grade 1 within 72 hours in all cases.</p>
              <p>Infection was a significant cause of morbidity and mortality on study. Contributory factors included intensive previous therapies, high frequency of previous allo-SCT, pre-existing cytopenias, and previous colonization with multiresistant organisms. This highlights the need to try to minimize infections during previous therapies, of antimicrobial stewardship, and importance of appropriate specialist input during CAR-T therapy. Fecal microbiota transfer as a decolonization strategy for multiresistant organisms may hold promise for high-risk patients.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Late infections were more common in those who underwent previous allo-SCT, underscoring the need for ongoing monitoring and appropriate prophylaxis post–CAR-T.</p>
              <p>Response rates were encouraging, particularly considering the favorable toxicity profile. The high levels of CAR-T engraftment and prolonged persistence are likely important to the sustained remissions. MRD-negative remission was achieved in 85% of patients at 1 month, and the 1-year OS and EFS were 63.8% and 48.3%, respectively. Other studies have reported 54%-85% MRD-negative responses in adult cohorts,<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> although the median EFS was below 8 months even in those achieving MRD-negative responses.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We documented only two cases of CD19-positive relapse, both in patients without CAR-T persistence. CD19-negative relapse was more frequent, occurring in four patients, likely reflecting ongoing selective pressure exerted by persisting CAR-T. Dual antigen targeting may help to reduce relapse risk from CD19 escape when CAR-T persistence is durable.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It is notable that only 3 of 20 patients underwent allo-SCT consolidation while in morphologic remission. Of these, one died of adenoviremia, one relapsed with CD19-positive disease, and one remains in remission beyond 2 years. Response durability in most patients with detectable CAR-T not receiving allo-SCT supports the use of CATCAR-T as a definitive therapy rather than a bridging strategy. We accept that patients can relapse because of CD19 escape or lack of CAR-T persistence.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Indeed, optimal patient selection for allo-SCT consolidation remains an important question for the field. Whether biomarkers (CAR-T marking and B-cell aplasia) can be used to refine such decisions requires further investigation.</p>
              <p>Intention to treat in the high-risk adult B-ALL is an important consideration. We manufactured products for all but one patient, demonstrating the robustness of semiautomated manufacturing systems.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We lost patients during the manufacturing period to infections and disease progression. In the future, improved logistics and rapid release testing should improve vein to delivery times to &lt; 14 days. Allogeneic approaches have been proposed to expedite patient treatment, but current iterations add considerable toxicity because of the requirement for more profound immunosuppression to prevent rejection and the requirement for subsequent (and in some cases second) allo-SCT because of limited CAR-T persistence.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In summary, ALLCAR19 demonstrates feasibility of manufacturing and administration of AUTO1 to adults with r/r B-ALL. AUTO1 expanded and persisted in most patients with limited immunotoxicity, and remissions were maintained for over 24 months without allo-SCT. ALLCAR19 is a proof of concept that a fast off-rate CD19 CAR can be a stand-alone salvage therapy in adult r/r B-ALL with acceptable toxicity.</p>
              <p>These findings are being confirmed in a larger phase II study (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04404660" ext-link-type="uri">NCT04404660</ext-link>) including primarily not only patients with morphologic BM relapse but also a smaller cohort with MRD level or extramedullary disease. Study end points include clinical efficacy (overall response rates, progression-free survival, EFS, OS, proportion of patients achieving MRD-negative CR, incidence of CD19-negative relapse, proportion of CR/CRi (CR and incomplete count recovery) without additional therapy, including allo-SCT), in addition to expansion of the safety data set and manufacturing success rates. Parallel translational end points are designed to document expansion and persistence of AUTO1 in the PB and BM with the overall aim of establishing AUTO1 as a definitive stand-alone therapy for patients with relapsed disease.</p>
