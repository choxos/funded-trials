                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>A proportionate universal (PU) approach to early years’ service provision has been advocated to improve children’s health and development and to reduce health inequality, by ensuring that services provide timely and high-quality parenting support commensurate with need. Process-oriented research is critical to examine the factors that contribute to, or hinder, the effective delivery/implementation of such a model in community-based family services. This study aimed to assess the delivery, acceptability and feasibility of a new PU parenting intervention model (called E-SEE Steps), using the Incredible Years® (IY) parent program, when delivered by trained health/family service staff in three “steps”—one universal step (the IY Babies Book), and two targeted steps (group-based IY Infant and Toddler programs).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation within a pragmatic parallel two-arm, assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted in community services in four local authorities in England. The process evaluation used qualitative data gathered via interviews and focus groups with intervention arm parents who were offered the targeted steps (n = 29), practitioners (n = 50), service managers (n = 7) and IY program mentors (n = 3). This was supplemented by quantitative data collected using group leader pre-training (n = 50) and post-delivery (n = 39) questionnaires, and research notes of service design decisions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The E-SEE Steps model was acceptable to most parents, particularly when it was accompanied by engagement strategies that supported attendance, such as providing childcare. Practitioners also highlighted the positive development opportunities provided by the IY training and supervision. However, participant views did not support the provision of the IY Babies book as a standalone universal component, and there were barriers to eligible parents—particularly those with low mood—taking up the targeted programs. Service providers struggled to align the PU model with their commissioned service contracts and with their staff capacity to engage appropriate parents, including tackling common barriers to attendance.</p>

                  <p>Despite general enthusiasm and support for delivering high-quality parenting programs in community services in the England, several barriers exist to successfully delivering IY in a proportionate universal model within current services/systems.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The earliest years in a child’s life are a critical period in their development, during which time responsive and empathic parenting can promote positive outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2010, the Marmot Review concluded that good quality services in the early years, including parenting support, can have enduring effects on health, but that action was needed across the system to reduce inequalities in terms of physical and mental health and the development of appropriate cognitive and social skills [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Marmot et al. suggested that these actions must be universal but with a scale and intensity relative to the level of disadvantage—an approach they described as “proportionate universalism” [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> p15].</p>
              <p>The principle of proportionate universalism (PU) has gained both support and objection since Marmot’s 2010 review, largely due to tensions inherent between universalism and targeting policies [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Carey and colleagues argue that while the principle is theoretically appealing, its application in practice has been limited by a lack of guidance for policy makers and practitioners wishing to implement a PU approach [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, there have been different interpretations of what a ‘proportionate’ response is, or should be, in practice; some commentators [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] favor broad universal provision while others [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] advocate for better targeting of, and increased provision for, disadvantaged families. A recent systematic review of early childhood parenting interventions, aiming to reduce social inequalities in children’s health and development, found only 23 interventions across Europe [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of these, only two met criteria to be considered PU models, with their intervention levels tailored according to need; the remaining programs were all categorized as targeted provision, aimed at specific populations, e.g., economically disadvantaged families or those living in deprived neighborhoods. There is a need for more descriptive and empirical studies to explore how PU models work in practice.</p>
              <p>This paper details process evaluation findings of a PU model of parenting support for the parents of children under two years, called <bold>E</bold>nhancing <bold>S</bold>ocial-<bold>E</bold>motional Health and Wellbeing in the <bold>E</bold>arly Years (E-SEE Steps), for the parents of children under two years. The intervention model and findings on its clinical and cost-effectiveness are detailed in our companion trial outcome paper [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (full protocol available at: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dev.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/13/93/10" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.dev.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/13/93/10</ext-link>). The trial demonstrated no positive effect of the PU intervention on either parent depression or child social emotional wellbeing, when compared to the control arm, and it was concluded that changes to the parenting program and the service delivery system may be required. The present study builds on these findings to explore the barriers and facilitators of a PU model in practice.</p>
              <sec id="sec006">
                <title>E-SEE Steps</title>
                <p>The constituent programs of the E-SEE Steps model are taken from a parenting series called the Incredible Years® (IY), based on social learning and attachment theory [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and designed to promote social and emotional health and wellbeing by improving parent-child interactions and enhancing attachment and parent sensitivity. E-SEE Steps can be considered a PU model because it comprises two IY programs (IY-I and IY-T) delivered in three steps—one universal dose, and two subsequent targeted/indicated steps determined by need, delivered as the children age (<bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Program content is summarized in <bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>. The universal dose (the IY-B book) is suitable for all parents of babies under 12 months and was posted to all intervention parents, after baseline and randomization, to increase awareness of their babies’ socioemotional needs. Revisions to the book were made following our external pilot trial [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the definitive trial tested Edition 2 [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Parents were eligible for the targeted steps of the PU model—the IY-I or IY-T programs—if at follow-up 1 (2 months post baseline) or 2 (9 months post baseline), respectively, they obtained ‘mildly depressed’ or higher scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (a 9-item self-administered measure of depressive disorder) [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and/or if their child scored in the ‘monitoring zone or above’ on the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional, Second Edition (ASQ:SE-2) [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (a parent-completed measure of their child’s social emotional development). The IY-I and IY-T targeted group sessions were delivered weekly in collaborative two-hour discussion sessions, plus exercises to practice at home.</p>
                <p>While there is substantial evidence to support the use of parenting programs (and IY in particular) with parents of children aged 3–12 years in order to prevent and manage emotional and behavioral difficulties, the evidence is equivocal for younger children [e.g., <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the UK, the IY Infant (IY-I) program has shown promise of effectiveness in a comparison study [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] although the effectiveness of the IY Toddler (IY-T) program has yet to be established [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, while prevention and early intervention programs are more likely to achieve positive outcomes when implemented with fidelity [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and when parental engagement is high [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], less is known about the implementation barriers/facilitators, processes and context of parenting interventions for infants and toddlers. Only a minority of parents who could benefit from such evidence-based interventions receive them in practice [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A recent Individual Participant Data meta-analysis found no evidence for differential effects of IY by social disadvantage [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting it can be suitably tailored to need and there is evidence to suggest that severely depressed parents of children with serious conduct problems are likely to benefit most from the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                <p>More process-focused research is now needed to examine how these interventions can be embedded within real world community services for children and families, and to understand the individual, organizational and system-level factors that contribute to or hinder effective delivery [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The present study seeks to advance this understanding by presenting findings from an embedded process study, as part of a multi-site randomized controlled trial of a PU intervention delivered by public services to parents of children under two years.</p>

                <p>Our paired trial outcome paper [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reported on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness findings of E-SEE Steps, the uptake of the E-SEE Steps intervention by parents and the fidelity of IY program delivery by public sector services. It found a low rate of conversion from parents’ eligibility to take up of the parenting programs (50% for IY-I and 21% for IY-T), low program completion rates (45% for IY-I and 43% for IY-T) and varying levels of adherence by site and group/practitioner, with a mean fidelity rate of 64% for IY-I and 74% for IY-T. However, there were high levels of parent satisfaction with program content and process (3.4 and 3.7, out of 4, for IY-I and IY-T respectively). This process evaluation paper builds on, and elucidates those findings via two pre-defined research questions:</p>

                <title>Service design</title>
                <p>The research team supported sites to tailor E-SEE Steps to their context. This included a series of in-person workshops, videos and information sheets for practitioners to identify and refer parents to the trial, and tailored service design support to set up the targeted group-based programs (IY-I and IY-T) in their areas. This included supporting sites to identify delivery locations to maximize access, select group leaders, employ appropriate parent engagement strategies, and make use of program fidelity data.</p>
                <p>A detailed 64-page Service Design Manual for the E-SEE Steps intervention (freely accessible from: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/e-see-trial/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/e-see-trial/</ext-link>) was developed to provide more detail on the theoretical foundations of the intervention, including a logic model, and detailed implementation guidance. Implementation briefings were also created for each individual site. Service design decisions and key challenges in each of the four sites were systematically logged by the research team and are described below.</p>
                <p>E-SEE-Steps was designed to be delivered by a combination of Early Years Children’s Services and/or Public Health Nursing staff, trained by accredited IY mentors (and supervised regularly) to deliver IY as part of the trial. However, the intervention was led by a single agency in two of the four sites, reflecting the variable nature of existing partnerships and cross-agency working arrangements for service delivery. The IY developer recommends that group leaders have prior training in child development and cognitive social learning theory, as well as experience with young children, parenting skills, and family interactions. Health visitors, providing the universal new birth home visit (10–14 days after birth), were the main agents for identifying and inviting mothers to join the study. A small minority of parents were recruited via community children’s services or self-referral. Researchers followed-up referrals to complete the recruitment process and sent a copy of the IY-B book (universal step) to all parents who had been randomized to the intervention.</p>
                <p>A key challenge for sites was the timing of the invitation—study and intervention information had to compete for parents’ attention with a range of health education material already required as part of the new birth visit service. Moreover, in real world delivery, professionals delivering a PU service would be continually assessing families’ needs and timing their offers of help to match needs and receptivity. E-SEE Steps was not personalized in this way; constrained by the trial design, the model provided targeted support at set points in the child’s development corresponding with the age range of the IY-I and IY-T programs.</p>
                <p>Supervision for leaders delivering the group-based programs was provided by accredited IY mentors remotely, on a fortnightly basis during delivery. Due to difficulties with data protection and organizational firewalls, the planned sharing of group video footage with mentors for review of practice was not possible for most of the groups, and supervision sessions relied on leaders’ self-assessments. Some IY group leaders (four groups across two sites) managed to arrange face-to-face sessions with mentors to achieve this review.</p>
                <p>In line with IY program guidance, the E-SEE Steps model emphasizes the importance of sites employing engagement strategies to facilitate access to parenting support. Sites differed in their ability to fund and/or provide the recommended support, including introductory home visits, provision of childcare, transport support, preparation and engagement time for leaders. Suggested leader preparation also included undertaking dry runs of delivery to increase familiarity with the materials and processes but only one site managed to achieve this. Targeted E-SEE Steps were planned as four IY-I and two IY-T groups in each site, however, all four trial sites delivered only two IY-I groups each; two sites delivered two IY-T groups and two sites delivered only one. Health professionals’ time for training and delivery was covered by NHS excess treatment costs but there was no budget support for Children’s Services’ staff and participation was contingent on existing resources.</p>
                <p>The control group/arm received services as usual (SAU); IY-B, IY-I and IY-T were not offered as SAU in trial delivery sites. As part of the service design work, a profile of SAU in each site was created in order to capture availability of childcare and parenting services to both intervention and control families (<bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref></bold>). This revealed a wide range of support available to families from post-natal support and healthy weight and nutrition, to behavior management, early learning and development, and support for children with additional needs. While several parenting programs were on offer across sites (e.g., Triple-P, Strengthening Families and the Solihull Approach) the service receipt data shows that less than five parents in each arm accessed these parenting support programs.</p>

                  <p>Eight focus groups and 22 one-to-one interviews were undertaken by four experienced, female researchers (VB, SM, RC and KWh), following the completion of intervention delivery in each site. Four focus groups were conducted with group leaders (n = 19) and four with parents and co-parents who had attended the group-based intervention (n = 17). These were conducted in person by two researchers (one leading, and one note taking) and lasted 90 minutes. Semi-structured topic guides explored: the acceptability and usefulness of the IY-I book as a universal intervention; the acceptability of a proportionate universal model; processes for identification, screening and recruitment; strategies/ approaches for engagement; barriers/facilitators of attendance; and experiences of participation in the groups (see <bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref></bold>).</p>
                  <p>Ten semi-structured interviews (lasting approximately 30 minutes each) were conducted in person or by telephone with health and children’s services managers and IY trainers/mentors.

Twelve semi-structured telephone interviews (approximately 15–20 minutes each) were also undertaken with non-attending intervention parents to explore why parents did not engage/discontinued engagement.

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Engagement processes</italic>. Group leaders and service managers described the challenges of recruiting and engaging parents. Reported barriers were related to the processes of service engagement, specifically the timing and relevance of the offer i.e., identifying the right parents at the right time, and “selling” the offer, in particular the clarity of the offer in terms of what the program involved, and where and when it would take place. For example, group leaders highlighted the importance of the gap between initial contact with a parent and the group starting in terms of engaging parents</p>

                  <p>In terms of communicating clearly to parents what the group would offer, group leaders reflected on a lack of certainty around factors such as creche provision making this more challenging:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“The kind of thing that came up when I was contacting parents for toddler group was that we didn’t have the crèche and we weren’t sure if we were going to have a crèche…So that was kind of like yeah</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I can come if that’s…there but if not, definitely not.”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Early identification and the opportunity to build relationships and attune to parents’ needs are needed to facilitate engagement and the delivery of this model:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“It’s really about maintaining that contact and identifying when is the right time because for a lot of parents you don’t walk past your front door for quite some time when you’ve had a newborn baby</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">You’re getting your routine in place…</italic>”</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">The IY program</italic>. There was evidence of some practitioner resistance to a few of the core IY processes/activities, such as role play with which, arguably, not everyone would feel comfortable:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“… [they] were very resistant, to role play… They were resistant in the training and they</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that moved on and although we spent, I spent more time than anything else I think on…on trying to problem solve that with them.”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Adapting the program with fidelity was also not straight-forward; for example, adapting to small group sizes and different ages, and leaders reflected the preparation time needed:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“…<italic toggle="yes">the particular challenge was for us was the babies that we had… trying to tailor and… still deliver the program how it should have been delivered</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Existing professional practice was also raised as a potential barrier, with the collaborative (non-didactic) IY approach being considered quite different to the current culture and practice in the service organizations: <italic toggle="yes">“… there’s still much</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">an awful lot of teaching and not that much collaboration going on</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">I think a lot of advice giving may have been given…”</italic> (Mentor).</p>
                  <p>There was a consensus that an additional booster training session would help to prepare practitioners to better negotiate these challenges but that the timing of this–in relation to delivery–is important to ensure connections are made between learning and practice:</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Supervision and mentorship</italic>. Group leader skills, supervision and mentorship were regarded as important factors in supporting program delivery with fidelity. Indeed, this was also reflected in the post-delivery questionnaires (See <bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>),</bold> which showed an increase in the number of group leaders who reported feeling confident in delivering a parenting group (42% pre-training cf. 59% post-delivery). However, a significant minority still lacked confidence even after delivering IY-I/IY-T. The group leaders who participated in interviews, described how IY mentor guidance and supervision sessions helped them to grasp the collaborative process and develop their practice:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“… it has changed her practice</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it really has, where before she would have stepped in, intervened and offered the advice and guidance, she now knows how to facilitate that conversation to enable parents to reach that understanding and that decision making and empowering them back to be able to do that… She will always say, “It totally changed the practice,” which is really powerful because people can get set in their ways and continue to do what they’ve always done…”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>However, challenges arose from the logistics and (remote) mode of supervision. Group leaders felt that live supervision offered the best support for delivering with fidelity, particularly in terms of reviewing and reflecting on video recordings:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>

                  <p>Notably, in the post-delivery questionnaires, most IY group leaders (80%) reported that their organizations had been supportive during delivery, ensuring that practitioners had sufficient time, resources and encouragement to deliver programs effectively (See <bold><xref rid="pone.0265946.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Reasons given for lower organizational support ratings included reports that no changes were made to existing caseload to free up time for delivery, not enough time was given to prepare and prioritization of other tasks over delivery.</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Theme 1</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Nature of the intervention offer</italic>. Four sub-themes were identified in relation to the acceptability of the intervention offer: (1) receiving and understanding the offer, (2) familiarity, (3) crèche, and (4) co-parent attendance. Several parents who did receive the offer said they lacked an understanding of what it entailed. They understood that it would be a group of parents but were unsure of what they would be doing in the group and suggested that they would have been more comfortable if they knew more detail about the group and a breakdown of what the sessions involved:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“<italic toggle="yes">I don’t think it was enough information, because I remember starting coming to the groups, and it kind of all had to get explained to me again</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">I didn’t really know what I’d actually joined up for… I don’t really think there was a lot of information given when it was…So you’re like, yeah you’ve been invited to come to this group, but then I actually had no idea what was… what to expect from the group</italic>.”</p>

                  <p>All key stakeholders perceived familiarity and trust as important to acceptability, with the relational nature of the offer highlighted as critical. Familiarity was important for attendance both in terms of knowing other parents attending the group and in terms of familiarity with IY processes, e.g., having attended IY-I, parents knew what to expect at IY-T. This was particularly the case for non-attending parents and those who felt anxious about attending a group. A local venue and the option to attend with a co-parent or friend were suggested to increase acceptability:</p>

                  <p>Although crèche provision is known to promote and maintain attendance at parenting groups, for those who chose not to attend it was viewed as an irrelevant resource, either because they did not want to give up the time they had with their child when not at work, or because they felt uncomfortable leaving their child in the crèche:</p>

                  <p>Several parents reported not knowing that they could have had a co-parent attend with them and some of them felt this would have made a difference to their decision to attend:</p>

                  <p>Group leaders questioned the fit between the demands of the IY program and parents with low mood and depression. They suggested that low mood could be a barrier to attendance, with those parents finding it difficult to commit to a group when there is a lot going on at home:</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>There was mixed acceptability around the program processes for group leaders also. Specifically, leaders were cautious about using role play–one of the intervention’s primary processes–which they reported as difficult to successfully engage in for those with low mood:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“<italic toggle="yes">Did low mood prevent any parents from participating…Definitely… One of ours, she came to a little bit towards the end, didn’t she?</italic> …<italic toggle="yes">That’s why we had to be careful about role play, wasn’t it, that sort of woman who shutdown.

                    <p>(Leaders)</p>
                    <p>“<italic toggle="yes">Role play was the problem</italic>… <italic toggle="yes">and [name of mentor] asked us to even if they were sat on their seats just to try and get them to interact in some way and when we did she just… just totally went into herself whereas before that we hadn’t, we just let whoever wanted to participate</italic>.”</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Although leaders found different ways around this, like demonstrating the role play themselves, they were unsure whether it was feasible to engage with and deliver the program successfully to those struggling with low mood. Group leaders felt that this may have been exacerbated by small group sizes and these parents may have been more comfortable with the demands of IY within a larger group.</p>
                  <p>In instances where parents who were struggling with low mood did attend and engage with sessions, leaders felt that active engagement between sessions (e.g., phone calls and follow up) were central to ensuring that low mood didn’t become a barrier to attendance:</p>

The use of IY-B book as a universal intervention was intended to provide parents with a physical/close-to-hand educational resource similar to the NHS resources (e.g., “Birth to Five”) that have been digitized/put online in recent years. Parents who were interviewed reported finding the IY-B book difficult to access and largely engaged with it through practitioner signposting–calling into question the utility of book as a standalone resource (the universal level of E-SEE Steps). Use of the books was largely practitioner-led within targeted groups, and some of the difficulties highlighted by parents were intellectual or unfamiliar language (Americanisms). The accessibility of the book was also questioned by parents who said that the size of the book and its language could be quite intimidating and difficult to understand:</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Infrastructure–staff roles and levels</italic>. Staff level and role were highlighted as issues for long-term feasibility. The IY developer specifies at least two years’ recommended experience for those leading groups. This includes: experience with young children; experience with parenting skills and family interactions; at least one course in child development; and involvement with group activities/awareness of group dynamics. Training in social learning theory is also recommended. Additionally, the developer recommends that at least one of the two leaders conducting a group should have a Master’s degree or higher, or a comparable educational background, with the therapeutic skills needed to assess and manage parents and children with mental health problems. Most group leaders in this study satisfied these criteria, having extensive experience with young children. Although only one group leader held a Master’s degree, many had previous experience in leading group activities/programs. It was suggested by some services that IY delivery would be more feasible in the UK context if it could be delivered by a lower band of staff:</p>

In order to ensure capacity to support any future roll out of the E-SEE STEPS model, IY mentors described a need for more group leaders to work towards accreditation. Although many (n = 21, 53.8%) group leaders reported that they were planning on running more IY groups in the future, only seven (17.9%) said that they were working towards becoming accredited. Group leaders cited the process of accreditation as problematic, specifically with regard to financial and logistical support from their organizations. This was further compounded by a lack of capacity in the system, or uncertainty in future capacity of staff in the service to run another three groups to have the video footage evidence of group delivery to submit for accreditation: “<italic toggle="yes">I really</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">really would like to…But again it comes down to budget and if I’m going to be here in six months”</italic> (Leaders).</p>

                  <p>Service managers felt that the IY programs aligned well with their current parenting offer, often filling gaps in their provision, although both group leaders and service managers agreed that a lack of support and funding at commissioner level would hamper the feasibility of delivery going forward. Managers described a mismatch between the more responsive support they would like to offer their communities and their (highly targeted) commissioning arrangements; they felt it was unlikely they would have the organizational structure to support delivery of E-SEE Steps into the future. This was particularly true for health services, where changes in the remit/roles of practitioners had reduced involvement in parenting programs:</p>

                  <p>Several of the service managers acknowledged that they had underestimated the demand on their service.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study explored the acceptability, feasibility and practical implementation of the E-SEE Steps model, in the context of a randomized controlled trial [see <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The trial found no significant impact of the intervention on child or parent outcomes. Despite strong parent satisfaction and practitioner enthusiasm for the program, several barriers to implementation were identified in this process evaluation that might explain the trial’s null effect. Some of these are amenable to change through intervention adaptation and development or by removing research design constraints; others are intrinsic to the complex service system that supports delivery where it is potentially difficult to effect and measure change [see <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our findings support conclusions from a recent similar study of the IY Infant and Toddler programs in the Republic of Ireland [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with implications for both the program and organizations.</p>
              <p>Intervention features that could be revised include: updating program materials to be UK-specific and temporally relevant; ensuring availability of audio/electronic versions of the resources for a wide audience, not just those who struggle with literacy or language; and providing “booster” training or delivery preparation for practitioners to embed the IY collaborative process. As part of the external pilot [see <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the program developer produced a second version of the IY-B book in line with feedback from sites and standards set by the BFI. However, data from the process evaluation do not support the use of this book as a <italic toggle="yes">stand-alone</italic> resource in its current form; the parents and practitioners interviewed–while only a minority of the trial sample–pointed to the scaffolding that is needed to enable parents to access its content and to the revisions still required to ensure alignment with the current UK early years’ approach. Similar amendments could also be made to the IY-I video and IY-T book and video resources, but it would require additional investment and agreement from the developer to do so.</p>
              <p>The trial’s supervision model was challenged by the organizational and system context; among other things, organizational data protection protocols prevented file sharing between co-delivery agencies and the IY Mentors. In addition, despite widespread implementation of IY parenting programs [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], there are few certified UK IY Mentors and resource constraints meant that travel for face-to-face supervision was not feasible during the trial. This has implications for future implementation; significant investment is needed in UK systems to upskill the workforce to fulfil this critical supervisory function, preferably at a local level. IY Inc. USA provides a structured system of accreditation to move from local group leader to mentor and trainer but the process takes investment and hours of training, delivery and supervision. This makes capacity building a difficult prospect for overstretched public service systems, which experience high staff turnover in the context of limited resources for professional development [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Features of the children’s services’ system that require consideration if PU models are to be supported, include the alignment between national mandates, locally commissioned service offers and the capacity of providers to deliver intensive programs like IY. At the start of the pilot trial in 2015, responsibility for Health Visiting passed to the Local Authorities in England, resulting in lengthy service transformation programs. These changes directly impacted health visitors’ roles, largely reducing their involvement in the delivery of parenting support and affecting their capacity to deliver E-SEE Steps. In addition, our findings suggest that multi-agency collaboration is a necessary but not sufficient condition to deliver a model like E-SEE Steps, which assumes a shared culture and approach. Sites with existing multi-agency partnerships were significantly quicker in setting up and implementing the model but this did not guarantee successful recruitment or retention of parents to the IY groups.</p>
              <p>Indeed, take-up of the targeted group-based programs was lower than expected, particularly for IY-T, and many eligible parents were “lost” before the first session of the groups, i.e., they did not engage with the offer at all. Our findings suggest this is most likely due to parents returning to work and the lack of flexibility in the timing of group delivery (e.g., evenings or weekends), but also because familiarity and trust had not been sufficiently established with those parents previously unknown to the services. The evidence suggests that greater investment in building rapport and motivation to change in parents, prior to groups starting, could help to boost access and retention [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265946.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This engagement with services is also likely to be more effective if it begins antenatally when expectant parents may have greater capacity to consider health education. Lack of staff capacity presented challenges to undertaking this engagement work in trial sites, and may have particularly impacted parents who struggled with low mood and anxiety who needed more support/engagement to facilitate group participation. Other intervention wrap-around support such as childcare and transport assistance were often difficult for services to provide because of limited financial resources and are unlikely to be commonplace support offers in real world delivery.</p>
              <p>This research is one of the few process evaluations of a parenting intervention, delivered via three steps over the course of the child’s early life, focused on children in the early years and has included the views of four key stakeholders, including families who were eligible but who did not engage with the targeted steps of the intervention. While the study included a large sample in qualitative terms, it is limited by the fact that the group of parents who participated are unlikely to represent all parents in the larger trial. In addition, the study did not explore the experience of families who received only the universal component of the model; conclusions about IY-B as a universal resource have been drawn from those parents who were also eligible for one of the targeted programs. Finally, while this study has surfaced a number of critical organizational and service-level barriers to delivery, it was not possible within the resources of the trial to examine in detail the influence of wider system-level context on the intervention, such as the receptivity of sites to a PU model (though site selection involved a site-completed readiness proforma) or the presence/absence of local policies or strategies that may have facilitated its adoption or implementation.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Marmot and colleagues highlighted the need for high quality parenting programs to meet needs across the social gradient, a goal which they claim has seen limited progress in the 10 years since their first report [<xref rid="pone.0265946.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the success of PU models, like E-SEE Steps, is contingent on both the faithful delivery of the intervention programs and the supportive, flexible and resilient organizational systems that host and deliver them. In this instance, the model assumed that existing home visiting and children’s services’ support were sufficient to provide the opportunities for family assessments and to convey information about community groups relevant to parenting needs. However, our evaluation findings point to real difficulties for practitioners and service organizations in ensuring the resources and capacity to identify eligible parents, properly engage and retain them, and to prepare sufficiently to deliver programs with fidelity, with appropriate supervision and oversight. Taken together, these findings provide a reasonable explanation for the lack of positive impact demonstrated in the effectiveness study and a need for further, more focused research is indicated.</p>
