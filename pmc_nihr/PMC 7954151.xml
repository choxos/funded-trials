                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>Surgical treatment of hip fracture is challenging; the bone is porotic and fixation failure can be catastrophic. Novel implants are available which may yield superior clinical outcomes. This study compared the clinical effectiveness of the novel X-Bolt Hip System (XHS) with the sliding hip screw (SHS) for the treatment of fragility hip fractures.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a multicentre, superiority, randomized controlled trial. Patients aged 60 years and older with a trochanteric hip fracture were recruited in ten acute UK NHS hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated to fixation of their fracture with XHS or SHS. A total of 1,128 participants were randomized with 564 participants allocated to each group. Participants and outcome assessors were blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the EuroQol five-dimension five-level health status (EQ-5D-5L) utility at four months. The minimum clinically important difference in utility was pre-specified at 0.075. Secondary outcomes were EQ-5D-5L utility at 12 months, mortality, residential status, mobility, revision surgery, and radiological measures.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 437 and 443 participants were analyzed in the primary intention-to-treat analysis in XHS and SHS treatment groups respectively. There was a mean difference of 0.029 in adjusted utility index in favour of XHS with no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (95% confidence interval -0.013 to 0.070; p = 0.175). There was no evidence of any differences between treatment groups in any of the secondary outcomes. The pattern and overall risk of adverse events associated with both treatments was similar.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Any difference in four-month health-related quality of life between the XHS and SHS is small and not clinically important. There was no evidence of a difference in the safety profile of the two treatments; both were associated with lower risks of revision surgery than previously reported.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hip fractures are one of the greatest challenges facing the medical community. In 2000, there was an estimated global incidence of nine million osteoporotic fractures, of which 1.6 million were hip fractures.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These fractures constitute a heavy socioeconomic burden worldwide. The cost of this clinical problem is estimated at 5.8 million disability adjusted life years lost, 1.75% of the total healthcare burden in established market economies.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Approximately half of all hip fractures lie outside of the joint capsule and the great majority of these are trochanteric fracturesâthose in the region between the greater and lesser trochanter that can be typically treated with fixation rather than replacement.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The sliding hip screw (SHS) is well established in the treatment of these fractures and in many patients is effective at allowing controlled collapse of the fracture with consequent mechanical stability leading to successful bone healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, in some people fixation strength is compromised due to porotic cancellous bone, making fixation difficult, risking implant cut out, when there is insufficient bone at the fracture to share the load on the limb with the fixation device. Rather than controlled collapse along the line of the screw, the screw may cut out from the hip leading to failure of the fixation and damage to the hip joint.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Revision surgery, to either re-fix or replace the hip, is complex and the outcomes are very poor in this frail group of patients with inpatient mortality approaching 50%.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>

              <p>The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System (XHS; X-Bolt, Dublin, Ireland) builds on the successful design features of the SHS; it only differs importantly in the nature of the fixation in the head of the femur. Expanding flanges are deployed to engage and compress the surrounding cancellous bone improving fixation in cadaveric and biomechanical studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Biomechanical testing has demonstrated that the XHS has improved cut out strength compared with the SHS, the principal means of implant failure in the treatment of these fractures.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> There is also improved rotational control and better torsional stability at the fracture site.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Our randomized pilot study, Warwick Hip Trauma Evaluation (WHiTE) One, has indicated that there is a trend towards a reduced risk of revision using the XHS compared with the SHS.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The aim of this trial was to quantify the comparative clinical effectiveness of the XHS and the SHS for the treatment of fragility hip fractures.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>

                <p>Patients were screened in ten acute NHS hospitals in the UK. Patients were included who presented with trochanteric fracture of the hip, determined by the treating surgeon using the AO/OTA classifcation,<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and who in their opinion would benefit from SHS fixation. Patients were excluded who: were younger than 60 years of age; had a sub-trochanteric fracture; or who were managed nonoperatively. Overall, 2,105 patients were potentially eligible for entry into the trial between June 2016 and April 2018 at the ten study sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, 1,128 were randomized and consented into the trial. Twelve participants were randomized in error; of whom eight had the wrong type of fracture and received a non-trial intervention, and four were randomized twice. Three participants (XHS = 2, SHS = 1) withdrew immediately post-randomization for whom no data are available. Baseline demographic data were similar in both treatment groups (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). Participants had a median age of 86 (IQR 79 to 91) years, 825 participants were female and pre-injury median EuroQol Five-dimension Health Status and Index (EQ-5D) utility index was approximately 0.7 (0.4 to 0.8).</p>

                <p>Diagnosis of a hip fracture was confirmed as per routine clinical care. Routine investigations, anaesthetic assessment, antibiotic, and venous thromboprophylaxis were used as per local policy.</p>
                <p>Anaesthesia was achieved in accordance with local policies.

                <p>Internal fixation with either device was performed following the manufacturerâs guidelines; the positioning of the participant, surgical approach, and wound closure was determined by the operating surgeon. Postoperative analgesia was prescribed by the responsible clinical teams as appropriate. In the postoperative period, as per standard of care, participants in both groups underwent an initial physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessment. An initial treatment plan was devised, aiming to mobilize participants through early, active, full weight-bearing. Participants were discharged from the acute Orthopaedic Trauma Ward at the earliest safe opportunity to the most appropriate discharge destination.</p>

                <p>Fixation was with a SHS and standard lag screw. Briefly, the fracture was reduced by closed means under image intensifier guidance. A wire was passed from the side of the femur into the centre of femoral head and then a channel opened to allow the passing of a large diameter cannulated screw over the wire and across the fracture. The screw was then mounted into a barrel attached to a side plate of a length determined by the operating surgeon.

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>It is recognized that patients with a hip fracture are a clinical priority for urgent operative care,<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with a preference to be treated on the next available trauma operating list. Most patients with a hip fracture are in pain and receive opiate analgesia. Accordingly for many patients the initial period in hospital is confusing and disorientating. Similarly, patientsâ next of kin, carers, and friends are often anxious at this time and may have difficulty in assimilating large amounts of information that they are given about the injury and plan for treatment. The initial focus is on obtaining consent for surgery, where possible, and informing the patient and any next of kin about immediate clinical care. It is often not possible for the patient or relative/carer (consultee) to review trial documentation, consider the information, and communicate an informed decision about whether they would wish to participate. The consent procedure for this trial reflected that of the surgery, with the clinical team assessing capacity before taking consent for the surgical procedure. This capacity assessment was then used to decide on the proper approach to consenting to the research study. An appropriate method, in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005, was then used to gain either prospective or retrospective consent from the participant, or appropriate consultee, by a Good Clinical Practice-trained,<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> appropriately delegated member of the local research team.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at four months. The EuroQol Five-dimension Health Status and Index (EQ-5D) is a validated measure of HRQoL, consisting of a five dimension health status classification system and a separate visual analogue scale.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> An updated version of the EQ-5D with five response levels (EQ-5D-5L) has recently been developed to enhance the responsiveness of the instrument to changes in patient health. The measurement properties of the EQ-5D in this patient population have been extensively investigated and is currently the best measurement tool available.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This outcome was obtained through telephone interview with the participant or consultee. EQ-5D-5L index values were derived by mapping EQ-5D-5L descriptive system data onto the EQ-5D-3L valuation set using the Crosswalk Index Value Calculator.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Using this value set the scale ranges from -0.594, indicating the worse possible heath state, to 1.0, and is anchored at 0 and 1.0 indicating a health state equivalent death and perfect health respectively.</p>

                <p>HRQoL was also similarly measured at 12 months using the EQ-5D-5L. Mortality was obtained from participantâs medical notes, information from carers, and the NHS Digital Spine, an information technology infrastructure linking widely used healthcare IT systems.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>

                <p>Functional status was assessed on an ordinal scale: freely mobile without aids; mobile outdoors with one aid; mobile outdoors with two aids or a frame; some indoor mobility but never goes outside without help; and no functional mobility (using lower limbs). Data were obtained prospectively through participant and carer telephone interviews.</p>
                <p>Residential status was assessed on an ordinal scale: own home/sheltered housing; residential care; nursing care; rehabilitation unit â hospital bed in the current trust; rehabilitation unit â hospital bed in another trust; rehabilitation unit â NHS-funded care home bed; and acute hospital. Data were obtained prospectively through participant and carer telephone interviews.</p>
                <p>All-cause revision surgery was obtained from participantâs medical notes, participant and carer telephone interviews, and review of the index hospital digital medical imaging record. Complications were obtained from the participantâs medical notes and participant and carer telephone interviews. Radiological outcomes were collected from any radiographs taken as part of routine clinical follow-up during the first 12 months post-surgery, as planned in the protocol, but will be reported elsewhere.</p>

                <p>The best available evidence we had from data collected during the WHiT (Warwick Hip Trauma) and WHiTE studies suggests that the SD for EQ-5D at four months post-surgery is approximately 0.3 points.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The best available evidence for what constitutes a minimal clinically important difference for EQ-5D, which is important to detect, was estimated to be 0.075.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Using a conservative estimate of the SD (0.33), this suggested a standardized effect size of approximately 0.24; a âsmall to moderate effectâ based on Cohenâs criteria.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
</p>
                <p>Assuming that the EQ-5D derived utility at four months post-surgery would have an approximate normal distribution, which was reasonable,<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and a 1:1 allocation ratio, then if the true difference between the experimental and control group EQ-5D means was 0.075, for 90% power, we required 338 participants in both the experimental group and in the control group. Based upon a similar trial in this population we expected considerable loss to follow-up, due to death, increasing frailty and cognitive decline, and post-randomization withdrawals in participants who declined ongoing follow-up, so we assumed that only 60% of recruited study participants would be available at the definitive outcome at four months.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Conservatively, we aimed to recruit 1,128 patients to ensure 90% statistical power based upon these assumptions.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Descriptive analyses of participantsâ baseline characteristics and intervention were summarized as means and SDs for normally distributed variables, as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for binary and categorical variables. The main analyses of the primary and secondary outcome variables were conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; including all participants with consent to use their data in their randomized groups, with no imputation for missing data.</p>
                <p>Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the primary outcome. The model included four-month EQ-5D-5L score as the dependent variable and treatment group as the main independent variable adjusted for centre, age, sex, and cognitive impairment at baseline. A zero value was imputed for the EQ-5D Index for all those participants who had died prior to the collection timepoint; this is the recommended approach based upon empirical studies exploring options for handling death in these analyses.<sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) and dichotomized by defining an AMTS of 7 or less as abnormal cognition and 8 or more as normal cognition.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The model was replicated for EQ-5D-5L scores reported at 12 months post-surgery to assess for longer-term differences between treatment groups.</p>
                <p>A generalized linear model (GLM) approach was used to analyze secondary outcomes. Mortality and all-cause revision surgery were analyzed with logistic regression, and functional status was analyzed with ordinal regression.<sup><xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The number and proportion of participants reporting each type of complication one or more times over the 12 month follow-up period were explored and the count of the number of types of complications reported by each participant was analyzed using Poisson regression. As per the primary outcome, the regression models for the corresponding secondary outcomes included treatment as the main independent variable, adjusting for centre, age, sex, and cognitive impairment.</p>
                <p>Radiological outcomes will be presented in a descriptive analysis elsewhere. Due to unexpectedly high volumes of missing data, residential status was also considered unsuitable for statistical analysis and only descriptive baseline data have been presented.</p>
                <p>The sensitivity of the primary outcome analysis to assumptions made was assessed. The health state of participants prior to entry into the trial was accounted for by extending the main analysis to further adjust for retrospective baseline EQ-5D-5L score. The impact of the analysis population was evaluated using a per-protocol analysis, where participants who did not receive the treatment allocated to them were excluded, and Complier Average Casual Effect (CACE) analysis, where the adherence to treatment allocated is accounted for without exclusion. The imputation of zero for the EQ-5D-5L index values of participants who had died was investigated by repeating analyses solely among living participants. To ensure that any skew in the EQ-5D-5L data was not impacting the outcome, bootstrapping using normal approximation and 10,000 iterations was adopted to estimate the confidence intervals (CIs) for the treatment effect. Finally, the sensitivity to departures from the missing at random assumption was evaluated using a pattern-mixture model, in which data and missingness are modelled jointly.</p>
                <p>Treatment effects were summarized using 95% CIs alongside a prespecified two-sided 5% significance level. Analyses were conducted using Stata v. 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).</p>

There was no evidence of a difference between treatment groups in mean EQ-5D index for either the primary outcome (adjusted difference 0.029; 95% CI -0.013 to 0.070; XHS mean 0.345 (SD 0.355); SHS mean 0.320 (SD 0.359)). The 12-month outcome result was similar with adjusted difference 0.026 (95% CI -0.016 to 0.068; XHS mean 0.312 (SD 0.364); SHS mean 0.293 (SD 0.361)). A full breakdown of the responses provided to each domain of the EQ-5D-5L are reported in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary Tables i to iii). The longitudinal changes were similar between the treatment groups.</p>

              <p>The findings of this trial provide strong evidence that any difference in the HRQoL between patients treated with XHS or SHS at any timepoint in the year following hip fracture surgery is small and not clinically important. All sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were concordant with the principal finding.</p>
              <p>The finding of the primary analysis of HRQoL at four months was maintained at long-term follow-up at one year. Mortality, functional, and residential status outcomes were also not different between the treatment groups. There was no evidence of a difference in the overall safety profile of both treatments, with all-cause revision surgery risk and complication profiles that were similar. The findings of this definitive trial do not support the inferences of superiority of the XHS based upon the findings of earlier biomechanical and pilot clinical investigations.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>We observed a comparatively low risk of revision surgery, lower than reported in previous smaller studies.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This may be associated with changes in co-interventions in clinical practice such as an increased prioritization of hip fracture surgery on operating lists or improved supervision of training surgeons associated with the implementation of best practice tariff.<sup><xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It is likely that the patientsâ recovery following hip fracture is only moderately influenced by the selection of the surgical implant.</p>
              <p>This was a large, pragmatic, multicentre, multisurgeon, randomized controlled trial. The strengths of this study are those inherent to the designâa randomized study nested within a cohort, a low risk of confounding, and findings that we believe to be generalizable. In addition, the sample was very large, including a wide variety of trochanteric fracture types and participants, attrition was relatively low given the population, and the outcomes measured were those most relevant to the patients and clinicians involved in their care.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The attrition rate in the trial was anticipated but nevertheless considerable (13.1% at four months and 19.4% at 12 months) but this was reasonably balanced between groups and less than the planning assumptions reported in the protocol. Patients sustaining hip fracture are frail with a high mortality and often increase their level of care following the fracture. Approximately 10% of the participants allocated to the XHS did not receive this intervention; however, the primary ITT and sensitivity PP and CACE analyses produced similar findings. The revision risk was much lower than that reported most commonly in randomized and non-randomized comparative studies of extramedullary implants (e.g. XHS and SHS). We used a threefold approach to collecting these dataâparticipant/carer self-report, hospital medical records, and review of all participantsâ available clinical imaging at 12 months. It is possible that participants underwent revision in hospitals outside of those included in the trial, although the vast majority of patients return to their index hospital if complications occur. It is also possible that this finding is due to potential centre effects, and hospitals participating in the trial may not reflect wider UK practice.</p>
              <p>In conclusion we have found no evidence of any difference in HRQoL among patients with trochanteric hip fractures treated with either the XHS or SHS. This is despite biomechanical data to support the XHS and an indication of an improved revision risk in our previous pilot study.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>

              <p>- There was no statistically significant difference in the health-related quality of life at four and 12 months between X-bolt Dynamic Plating System and the sliding hip screw.</p>
              <p>- The findings suggest no clinically meaningful difference between the novel and standard implants in the treatment of trochanteric hip fractures.</p>
              <p>- Revision surgery risks are low in UK practice; current national recommendations for surgical care of these fractures should remain unchanged.</p>

                <p>The study was supported by a patient advisory group which provided input to the programme of research. Patients partnered with us for the design of the study, the informational material to support the intervention, and the burden of the intervention from the patientâs perspective. Throughout the study, patients were involved in the management and oversight of the study. At the end of the study, the patient advisory group commented on the findings and contributed to the dissemination plan. A lay summary has been prepared and made available to the study participants and the general public.</p>
