                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is a strong evidence base for the benefits of parenting interventions for parents without severe mental illness (SMI). As the impact of maternal SMI can be significant on child development, mothers need support to maximise outcomes for themselves and their children. Some mothers with SMI require admission jointly with their baby to a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU), a psychiatric inpatient ward, for assessment and treatment. However, MBUs do not yet offer formally evaluated, evidence-based parenting interventions as a matter of routine. This paper describes a study to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a parenting and psychological intervention targeting the mother’s and infant’s wellbeing for mothers admitted to a MBU.</p>

                  <title>Methods/Design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study is a multisite, single-blind feasibility trial with half the participants randomised to the Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme plus treatment as usual (TAU) and the other half randomised to TAU alone. Self-report and observer-rated assessments are collected at baseline, 10 weeks post-baseline and 6 months post-baseline. Participants are mothers admitted to a MBU in the Northwest of England or the Midlands. Participants are included if they are fluent in English to provide informed, written consent. Our objective is to determine whether we can recruit 66 women, randomise 60, and retain them in the intervention and study, and whether the intervention and study procedures are acceptable. As part of a nested process evaluation, qualitative interview data from trial participants and MBU staff will inform feasibility and acceptability. The feasibility of collecting data required to conduct an economic evaluation of the intervention will also be explored.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Although research has been conducted in relation to mothers with severe mental illness and MBUs, to our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, uptake and retention alongside the potential efficacy of a parenting intervention for this population. This study is essential to examine the contextual challenges involved in this setting with this population and to identify any refinements required.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Given the significant impact of maternal mental illness on child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the importance of interventions to promote optimal outcomes for children in the early years has been widely recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in order to raise infants in loving and supportive environments, parents need to feel confident in their parenting skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Parents, and especially mothers, with good parenting skills feel that they have a good parent–infant relationship. This relationship has been found to influence the infant’s wellbeing, social and academic competence, and emotion regulation abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Parenting an infant can be a challenge for parents enjoying good mental health, but it can be an even greater challenge for parents who are mentally unwell. Maternal mental illness has profound effects on the woman, her family and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Estimates suggest that 10–20% of women develop mental health problems during pregnancy or within the first year of having a baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, it is estimated that 1% of women have severe mental illness (SMI) or significant mental health difficulties requiring specialist psychiatric services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; in 2013, at least 6985 of the 698,512 women giving birth required admission to a Mother and Baby Unit (MBU). Research has shown that perinatal depression, anxiety and psychosis carry an estimated total cost to society of £8.1 billion for each 1-year cohort of births in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a cost of approximately £10,000 for each birth. Perinatal psychosis costs approximately £53,000 per case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">The UK has been at the forefront of developing inpatient psychiatric units to admit mothers with existing or perinatal onset SMI, jointly with their babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These mothers present with various difficulties, including (puerperal) psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, severe affective illness (such as postnatal depression) and mother–infant relationship difficulties. The importance of specialist perinatal services in the treatment offered to these mothers and their families has been recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Despite improvements in mental illness and mother–infant interactions, as yet there are no structured parenting interventions that guide health professionals to help mothers with mental health difficulties strengthen early parenting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">The NICE guidelines and reviews recommend psychiatric and psychological interventions for mothers with mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], because the quality of the mother–infant relationship in mothers with severe mental health difficulties can be poorer compared to mothers with mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Although research has shown that treating the mother’s symptoms improves her mental health, this improvement does not necessarily directly relate to her interaction with her infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Therefore, there is a need for further research on parenting interventions with a skills training component for mothers who are looking after babies and who experience SMI or severe mental health difficulties (e.g. severe depression or postpartum psychosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

Although parenting programmes improve the emotional and behavioural adjustment of children and parental psychosocial wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the importance of addressing parenting issues as well as parental mental health needs has been emphasised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Certainly, mentally ill mothers are not inherently poor parents. Indeed, a review and meta-synthesis of 23 studies has identified the importance women with severe mental health difficulties attach to motherhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

                <p id="Par25">The Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme, designed to be an intervention at level 4 of the Triple P hierarchy of five levels, has been developed to enhance parental knowledge, skills and confidence. It targets three important areas crucial in enhancing maternal and infant wellbeing, namely (1) positive parenting skills promoting secure attachment, reducing maternal and infant distress, (2) improving partner and social support to increase maternal and overall family wellbeing and (3) increasing maternal coping resources to reduce mental health difficulties. Its primary focus is on enhancing maternal parenting competence and confidence, thereby improving the quality of the mother–infant relationship and subsequent attachment, which in turn improves infant and maternal wellbeing.</p>

                <p id="Par26">In preparation for this feasibility study, the chief investigator has led a number of studies related to Baby Triple P. For example, a small pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of Baby Triple P in mothers with postnatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The results were in the predicted direction regarding level of happiness, self-regulation, subjective bonding and depression (at post-treatment only). The 12 women who received Baby Triple P completed all sessions, were retained for all follow-up assessments and rated it as highly acceptable.</p>
                <p id="Par27">A second study explored the views of mothers admitted to the Manchester MBU about the perceived acceptability and feasibility of a parenting intervention like Baby Triple P in the setting of a MBU. Using Q-methodology, which is designed to assess opinions and views, all participants agreed on the perceived benefits of Baby Triple P and the MBU environment as suitable to facilitate it. The intervention was viewed as an acceptable and feasible parenting intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, without staff support, the possible implementation of this intervention on the MBU would be difficult. Consequently, we conducted another study with MBU staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which showed that staff also regarded this intervention to be feasible and acceptable for the MBU setting. MBU staff indicated that the intervention could help reduce the ‘bad parent’ stigma often identified in the population of mothers presenting with severe mental health difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">Given these encouraging findings, we aim to test the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the Baby Triple P programme plus treatment as usual (TAU) in mothers with severe mental health difficulties admitted to one of two UK National Health Service (NHS) MBUs.

MBU staff also identify eligible patients and offer them a Consent to Approach form (a form which gives written consent for the research team to approach patients with information about the study) to sign if they are interested in hearing more about the study. Eligible patients who provide consent (to be approached by the research team) are then approached in person by the researcher who (1) provides them with a Participant Information Sheet outlining the study procedures and requirements, (2) explains the research to them and (3) gives them the opportunity to ask questions. Eligible patients are required to take at least 24 h to think about whether they would like to take part in the feasibility trial. As the MBU is an inpatient psychiatric unit, some participants may require more time to consider their participation, and this will be allowed. After 24 h, or when participants indicate that they are ready to discuss their possible participation further with the researcher, or if the participant is happy to take part, written informed consent is obtained. If they do not wish to take part, they are thanked for their time and asked if they are happy to share their reason for not wishing to take part, but are not obliged to do so. Furthermore, the project manager checks for continued consent with participants when (1) informing participants which arm they have been allocated to, (2) when patients are discharged from the ward, and (3) before and at the beginning of follow-up assessments. A copy of the consent form is given to the participant to keep, one is placed in the clinical notes and another in the investigator site file. Consent forms are retained as records.</p>
                <p id="Par55">After participants have provided written consent to take part in the study, we ask them to complete a Consent to Contact form and to provide their email addresses and telephone numbers so that the research team can contact them (1) to remind them of any study assessment or intervention appointments or interview times, (2) to forward a summary of the findings if they indicate on the consent form that they wish to receive this and (3) to contact them about taking part in other studies within the programme of research if they indicate on the consent form that they agree to this.</p>
                <p id="Par56">Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, the research team may decide to discontinue a participant from the study at any time if this is deemed to be necessary for one of the following reasons: ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively), significant protocol deviation, significant non-compliance with the study requirements, withdrawal of consent and loss to follow-up. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded if participants are happy to share this but they are not obliged to do so.</p>
                <p id="Par57">All participants are reimbursed at the end of the study with £30 to thank them for their time and contributions. They are also offered a certificate and a list of useful contacts/organisations for additional support.</p>

The trial project manager, not blinded to treatment, manages all follow-up assessments (including a telephone call to participants before the research assistant contacts participants to arrange follow-up assessments to check continued consent and remind participants not to reveal their treatment allocation to the research assistant) and monitors breaches to blindness. The research assistant is asked to indicate at the beginning of each follow-up assessment which treatment arm they think participants have been allocated to and give a confidence rating and reason for this judgement; this information is recorded in the Case Report Forms and monitored. When breaches occur prior to follow-up appointments, an alternative blinded research assistant will undertake subsequent data collection.</p>

                <p id="Par60">The Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme consists of eight sessions (estimated to be delivered over 8–10 weeks) by trained facilitators. All participants allocated to receive this intervention will be given the Baby Triple P workbook to keep and share with their partner and family.</p>
                <p id="Par61">The first four sessions are usually delivered face-to-face on an individual basis by drawing on the information provided as presentation slides or in the handbook. These sessions are designed to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents in parenting and coping. Sessions cover advice on parenting, bonding and mother–infant interaction and relationship, partner and family support, and brief psychological coping strategies. The subsequent four sessions are designed to be delivered over the telephone, which is suitable for an inpatient setting when participants may be discharged or on home leave from the unit in preparation for discharge; they can also be delivered face-to-face. These sessions allow the participant to review progress and practice skills, thereby enhancing her parenting confidence, competence and overall wellbeing.</p>
                <p id="Par62">The intervention has a flexible delivery format, which is suitable for mothers with severe mental health. Sessions can be delivered flexibly to allow participants to attend to their baby’s needs, if required, or to pace the sessions in line with their own mental health needs. Session length can range from 45 to 90 min for the initial four sessions and 30–60 min for the telephone sessions. The content of one Baby Triple P session can also be covered in two briefer sessions and breaks can be taken.</p>

In line with all standard and individually prescribed clinical interventions as directed by the MBU clinical teams, TAU usually consists of case management using a care programme approach from their allocated MBU psychiatric nurse, pharmacological interventions from psychiatry and non-parenting, psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy for depression). Nursery nurses and MBU staff also offer psychosocial interventions (e.g. Baby Massage or Video Interactive Guidance) to inpatients, which participants can choose to engage in, but these are not structured, manualised activities that focus on improving parenting competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. TAU will vary depending on patient needs, capacity and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

                <p id="Par66">Outcomes relate to uptake (the proportion of eligible participants consenting to partake), attrition and retention rates. Through semi-structured interviews with participants and MBU staff we will also further explore the acceptability of the study procedures and intervention. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability outcomes as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par67">Feasibility of recruitment will be measured through recording how participants found out about the study, recruitment rates, number of potential participants found eligible, initially approached by MBU staff, consented to be approached by the research team, and approached about the study by the research team, reasons for declining to be approached or take part in the study if known, and percentage of eligible participants consented and their characteristics.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">Feasibility of randomisation will be assessed by recording number of refusals to be randomised.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">Engagement/retention in the study and to study procedures will be measured by recording the number of participants who withdraw and the time point at which they withdraw from the study.

                <p id="Par72">Self-report and observer-rated measures will be used alongside routinely collected information such as psychiatric history. Participants will be asked to complete an adapted version of the Family Background Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] asking about family sociodemographic information, family composition and maternal social support, past psychiatric and admission history, symptom presentation, diagnosis and pregnancy experiences. Data on medication type and use will be collected alongside baby care information from nursery nurses’ and clinical case-notes. Social services involvement and safeguarding information will also be collected. We will record this if it is the participant’s first admission.</p>
                <p id="Par73">Baseline assessments will be conducted prior to the start of the Baby Triple P plus TAU or TAU phase by a researcher face-to-face with participants at the MBU (referred to as Time 1). Post-intervention assessments will be conducted after the intervention phase (which will be 10 weeks (plus or minus a week) post-baseline assessments; Time 2) and at a final follow-up assessment at 6 months (26 weeks plus or minus a week, post-baseline assessments; Time 3). They will be conducted by a researcher in person at a location convenient for participants (e.g. at home or intervention setting) or at the MBU (if the participant has not been discharged) and/or over the telephone and/or via post. A flexible assessment method was chosen deliberately in order to be responsive to the needs of this population and their preferences.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Participants will be asked to complete the following self-report measures at all assessment time-points (all measures will be presented to participants in a booklet (for ease of completion) and hence the order of the questionnaire presentation will be the same for all assessments and for both MBUs):<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par75">The Maternal Efficacy Questionnaire (MEQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] to assess maternal confidence and competence as an indicator of overall wellbeing. Participants are asked to rate 10 questions on a 4-point Likert scale and to consider how they rate themselves in comparison to other mothers. The MEQ is a domain-specific measure of parental self-efficacy because nine of the 10 items address a mother’s self-efficacy in specific parenting tasks (e.g. soothing the baby; feeding, changing, and bathing the baby) and one item assesses general parental self-efficacy. The scale has good internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86) and is strongly correlated with the PSI Sense of Competence Scale (<italic>r</italic> = − 0.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">The Brief Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] to assess mood. Participants rate 21 statements on a 4-point Likert Scale (ranging from 0 to 3). Internal consistencies (coefficient alpha) for each scale for the DASS normative sample were determined as Depression 0.91, Anxiety 0.84, Stress 0.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The DASS-21 has good internal reliability with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 0.87–0.89) for the Depression subscale, 0.82 (95% CI ¼ 0.80–0.83) for the Anxiety subscale, 0.90 (95% CI ¼ 0.89–0.91) for the Stress subscale, and 0.93 (95% CI ¼ 0.93–0.94) for the Total scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] to assess the mother–infant relationship. Participants rate 25 statements on a 6-point Likert scale, which can be broken down into four subscales (indicating (1) general emotional bond and response to the baby, (2) feelings of anger and rejection, (3) confidence in caring for the baby and (4) possible risk to the baby). Low scores indicate good overall bonding. Its test-retest reliabilities (Pearson’s r) were of 0.95, 0.95, 0.93 and 0.77, respectively, in a sample of 30 mothers. PBQ has acceptable internal reliabilities with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.79 for impaired bonding, 0.63 for rejection and anger, and 0.63 for anxiety about care. Due to zero variance in the two items of the risk of abuse scale, the internal consistency of risk of abuse could not be determined. When these items were omitted from the total PBQ scale, Cronbach’s alpha was 0.77 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">The Brief Symptom Inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] to assess symptom severity and distress. This 53-item inventory asks participants to rate the extent to which they have been bothered (0 = not at all to 4 = extremely) in the past week by various symptoms. The Brief Symptom Inventory has nine subscales designed to assess individual symptom groups and three global indices (such as the Global Severity Index, the Positive Symptom Distress Index and the Positive Symptom Total Scale). Good internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alphas) for subscales were reported as between 0.71 (psychoticism) and 0.85 (depression) in a sample of 719 psychiatric patients. Good test-retest reliability scores (Pearson r) were reported for the Global Severity Index (<italic>r</italic> = 0.90), the Positive Symptom Distress Index (<italic>r</italic> = 0.87) and the Positive Symptoms Total Scale (<italic>r</italic> = 0.80) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">The EQ-5D-5 L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] to measure health status (in the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/distress, and anxiety and depression). Quality-adjusted life years will be estimated from the EQ-5D as recommended by NICE for the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">A bespoke health and social care resource use questionnaire to capture services used during the study, particularly following MBU discharge. It takes 5–10 min to complete. At 10 weeks post-baseline, participants will be asked to report on health and social services they have accessed since entering the study. At 6 months post-baseline, they will be asked to report on the health and social services they have accessed since the 10 weeks post-baseline assessment.</p></list-item></list></p>

Clinical staff rate service users’ difficulties in 12 areas using a 4-point Likert scale (from ‘not a problem’ to being ‘a severe problem’). They are designed for repeated use to capture changes in a wide range of health and social domains, including psychiatric symptoms, physical health, functioning, relationships and housing. The areas are (1) overactive, aggressive, disruptive or agitated behaviour, (2) non-accidental self-injury, (3) problem drinking or drug-taking, (4) cognitive problems, (5) physical illness or disability problems, (6) problems associated with hallucinations and delusions, (7) problems with depressed mood, (8) other mental, behavioural social problems, (9) problems with relationships, (10) problems with activities of daily living, (11) problems with living conditions and (12) problems with occupation and activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par83">The Clinical Global Improvement Scale (CGI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] will be used to gauge improvements from admission to discharge. The CGI is a commonly used measure of symptom severity, treatment response and the efficacy of treatments in treatment studies of patients with mental health difficulties. The severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Scores range from ‘not at all ill’ to ‘extremely ill’. The Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale that requires the rater to assess how much the patient’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. Ratings range from ‘very much improved’ to ‘very much worse’. The CGI Efficacy Index is a 4-point × 4-point rating scale that assesses the therapeutic effect of the treatment ranging from ‘unchanged to worse’ to ‘do not significantly interfere with patient’s functioning’.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par84">The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] is a scale which a clinician or researcher may use to measure 24 symptoms, including depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviours. Each symptom is rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from not present to extremely severe); it is commonly used in psychiatric settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">The Louis MACRO (Mother and Child Risk Observation) Measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] will be used to assess infant wellbeing and the mother–infant relationship. Using a 5-point Likert scale, MBU staff rate mothers on 10 items across five domains (including safety, care, emotional responsiveness, mother’s mental stage and infant characteristics that may contribute to parenting difficulties). The Louis MACRO has excellent internal reliability with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.96 for the total scale and between 0.79 and 0.95 for the 10-item subscales. Its subscales’ inter-rater reliabilities (Pearson’s r) were between 0.81 and 0.93 and its test-retest reliability scores were 0.71 to 0.93. Note that this measure is routinely used by some MBUs.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Assessment of acceptability of intervention and study procedures</title>
                <p id="Par86">Acceptability will be examined quantitatively through study uptake, attrition and retention rates as well qualitatively through interviews because participants’ experiences of participation in a trial and its procedures (e.g. quantity and frequency of assessments, randomisation process) are important for informing the design and methods of a future full-scale RCT. In addition, the acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through a validated satisfaction questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and through qualitative research interviews (described below) in order to examine if the current intervention is considered to be acceptable and appropriate for this population.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] will be used to collect information on participants’ views on the acceptability of Baby Triple P and their overall satisfaction with this intervention. Participants are asked to rate 13 questions (e.g. to what extent has the programme met your needs?) on a 7-point Likert scale and provide answers to three open-ended questions (e.g. do you have any other comments about this programme?). This will be administered to participants (allocated to receive Baby Triple P plus TAU) in person or over the telephone or via post after they have completed the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par88">Semi-structured individual interviews will be conducted post-intervention with MBU staff and trial participants allocated to the intervention arm prior to or around the time of their final follow-up assessment. All participants will be given a separate participant information sheet and consent form. Staff participants will be recruited through an advert or poster displayed on the ward. All interviewees will be interviewed at a time and place convenient to them or via telephone for up to 90 min. Interviewees will be given the choice to be interviewed by a researcher who works on the study at the same MBU they were admitted to and who they know or by a researcher who works at a different MBU and who they do not know. This is to ensure that participants feel comfortable expressing their views in the interview.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Interviews with participants and MBU staff will explore (1) acceptability, usefulness and user-friendliness of the intervention, (2) changes in and any benefits to themselves since receiving the intervention, (3) perceived changes/improvements to the intervention needed, (4) ways to increase adherence to and engagement in the intervention, (5) views on the procedures of the trial, and (6) perceived changes/improvements needed to increase adherence to and engagement in the study.</p>

An initial coding framework will be developed to reflect key service and service user-determined topics covered by the interview schedule. Following data familiarisation, this framework will be augmented and extended to encompass new emerging themes. Coding will be undertaken by the first author and/or a member of the research team, experienced and trained in qualitative data analysis, and in consultation with our service user consultants to capture potentially different perspectives.</p>

This framework will then be applied to the remaining transcripts. As the constant comparison of new data occurs, the framework will be amended and refined to enable the introduction of new codes or the deletion of redundant codes. Data will be interpreted and analysed within the final framework to structure and compare participant and staff views about the intervention.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par96">This will be the first study to examine the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a RCT of a manualised parenting and psychological intervention for women admitted to one of two inpatient MBUs. It is also the first feasibility RCT to examine the possible benefits of a manualised parenting intervention in an acute inpatient setting with this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The intervention is first offered in the MBU and, depending on admission time, it continues following discharge, offering continuity of care to participants whose care has to be transferred from inpatient acute psychiatric care to community care following MBU discharge. It is anticipated that routine post-discharge care will vary depending on local psychiatric and psychological arrangements and support.</p>
              <p id="Par97">This study allows for the exploration of pragmatic issues that will inform a larger RCT. This feasibility study will allow us to assess the suitability of the Baby Triple P programme for this clinical population and, if necessary, identify how it can be refined and tailored to meet participant capabilities and needs during an inpatient admission in terms of both its content and the practicalities of its delivery (e.g. by refining the length and number of sessions per week and/or mode of delivery). As participants will present with a range of perinatal mental health diagnoses and difficulties as well as parenting concerns and levels of confidence, the appropriateness of the content and practicalities of attending sessions will be examined in interviews.</p>
              <p id="Par98">The information gained from this study will provide an indication of what recruitment methods work or do not work in this setting and with this clinical population, enabling us to identify any participant-, staff- or service-related barriers to recruitment alongside solutions to overcoming these. It will help us to determine whether it is possible to recruit a large enough sample for a full-scale RCT and in what timescale. In addition, the adequacy of the recruitment sites can be examined in order to determine the characteristics of the sites that make them most suitable for a future RCT of this intervention. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be scrutinised to determine whether it affords a large enough and suitable sample and whether revisions are needed for a future RCT (e.g. to eligibility criteria, etc.). An exploration of participant and staff facilitators for and barriers to study engagement is likely to highlight practicalities that need to be considered when embedding a RCT in this setting.</p>
              <p id="Par99">Inpatient psychiatric wards can be challenging environments for patients to recover in and for staff to work in. Ward acuity and severity and expression of mental health problems alongside staffing issues can influence the availability of routine psychosocial and psychological support for women admitted to a MBU, whilst the baby’s needs also determine if the mother can access any support being offered. Hence, it is anticipated that TAU across both MBUs and outpatient routine care will vary. As evidence of cost-effectiveness is essential to inform future NHS policy, this study will determine the best approach to obtain the data needed to conduct a robust economic evaluation of the intervention in a full RCT. Furthermore, this study will allow us to collect data on what aspects of ward activities have to be considered in order to identify the best approaches (e.g. the recruitment procedures, the completion of measures, the intervention delivery and/or format) to implement this intervention successfully.</p>
              <p id="Par100">It will be vital to identify the most appropriate, effective and sensitive outcome measures in order to detect meaningful participant reported and observer rated changes in parent and infant wellbeing resulting from the intervention. The use of observer rated measures is indicated given that participants are admitted to an inpatient unit due to a crisis that may affect their ability to concentrate on and complete self-report measures, but training is required to achieve inter-rater reliability across different raters. This study will enable us to establish which assessments are meaningful, relevant and appropriate during inpatient admission and after discharge.</p>
              <p id="Par101">The inclusion of service user consultants in various aspects of this study has been emphasised. As part of this, we will also assess the type of training and amount of support required for service user participation in the analysis of interview data and other study aspects. Staff views on the use of the intervention and the impact of the study on the MBU in combination with participant experiences will inform the development of a future RCT.</p>
