                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Recent evidence suggests that larger blood pressure reductions and multiple antihypertensive drugs may be harmful in older people, particularly frail individuals with polypharmacy and multimorbidity. However, there is a lack of evidence to support deprescribing of antihypertensives, which limits the practice of medication reduction in routine clinical care. The aim of this trial is to examine whether antihypertensive medication reduction is possible in older patients without significant changes in blood pressure control at follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This trial will use a primary care-based, open-label, randomised controlled trial design. A total of 540 participants will be recruited, aged ≥80 years, with systolic blood pressure &lt;150 mm Hg and receiving ≥2 antihypertensive medications. Participants will have no compelling indication for medication continuation and will be considered to potentially benefit from medication reduction due to existing polypharmacy, comorbidity and frailty. Following a baseline appointment, individuals will be randomised to a strategy of medication reduction (intervention) with optional self-monitoring or usual care (control). Those in the intervention group will have one antihypertensive medication stopped. The primary outcome will be to determine if a reduction in medication can achieve a proportion of participants with clinically safe blood pressure levels at 12-week follow-up (defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;150 mm Hg), which is non-inferior (within 10%) to that achieved by the usual care group. Qualitative interviews will be used to understand the barriers and facilitators to medication reduction. The study will use economic modelling to predict the long-term effects of any observed changes in blood pressure and quality of life.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The general population is ageing<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and, consequently, the number of people living with age-related chronic conditions is increasing.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hypertension is the number one comorbid condition in older people with multiple chronic conditions<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and 52% of those aged ≥80 years are prescribed two or more antihypertensive drugs (equivalent to approximately 1.25 million people in the UK).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Blood pressure lowering has been shown to be effective at preventing stroke and cardiovascular disease in healthy individuals aged ≥80 years with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure of &gt;160 mm Hg) and high-risk stage 1 hypertension.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> However, as with many trials,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> these studies included healthier populations with lower polypharmacy and multimorbidity than might be expected in the general elderly population. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that larger blood pressure reductions and multiple antihypertensive prescriptions may be harmful in older people.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Evidence from observational studies also suggests that higher intensity blood pressure treatment is associated with increased risk of falls in older people,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> although this is also disputed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</p>
              <p>Some patients consider the increased risk of falls and other adverse events (AEs) to be as important as the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, particularly those taking medications for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thus, decisions over blood pressure lowering in the elderly, particularly the frail elderly, require the weighing of harms and quality of life. However, clinicians can often struggle to stop prescribing medication due to a perceived lack of evidence, fear of the reaction of other prescribers, fear of precipitating events such as stroke or angina and concern that patients will feel their care is being cut.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>
</p>
              <p>There is limited evidence from randomised trials examining the safety of antihypertensive medication reduction or withdrawal.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> The Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> enrolled some patients on antihypertensive treatment who were then randomised to placebo (effectively complete medication withdrawal) and the second Australian National Blood Pressure trial investigators followed up participants who withdrew medication during the trial run-in period but who were not randomised into the trial. They found younger patients with lower baseline blood pressure and fewer drug prescriptions were more likely to sustain medication withdrawal at 12-month follow-up.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> However, there are few trials comparing a specified strategy of antihypertensive medication reduction with usual care in terms of effects on blood pressure control and quality of life.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In addition, there are no previous economic modelling studies of a strategy of medication reduction in the elderly.</p>
              <p>The aim of this work will be to examine whether antihypertensive medication reduction in patients with controlled systolic hypertension (≤150 mm Hg) who are being prescribed two or more antihypertensives is possible without significant changes in blood pressure control at follow-up.</p>

                <p>This trial will use a primary care-based, open-label, randomised controlled, two-parallel groups, non-inferiority trial design, recruiting 540 participants with controlled blood pressure (systolic &lt;150 mm Hg) on two or more antihypertensive treatments. Participants will be randomised to a strategy of medication reduction (intervention) or usual care (control) and followed-up for 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Embedded qualitative and economic analyses will examine barriers and facilitators to medication reduction and the cost-effectiveness of the approach.</p>

                <p>Participants will be identified and recruited from general practices via the UK Clinical Research Network. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by trained practice staff searching practice-based electronic disease registers using a standardised strategy. GPs will be asked to check the search results and remove people whom they believe to be unsuitable to participate in the study. Remaining potentially eligible patients will be sent letters of invitation from their GP and those expressing an interest in the trial will be asked to attend a screening and baseline appointment. Patients not responding to the first invitation will receive one reminder letter (up to 4 weeks after the first letter). Other potentially eligible patients may also be approached opportunistically by a member of the clinical care team. Those who do not wish to take part will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire detailing their reasons.</p>

Blood pressure readings will be taken in the left arm (where appropriate) after participants have been seated for at least 5 min of rest, using an appropriate sized cuff.

                <p>Participating GPs will review each participant’s antihypertensive medication regimen prior to the baseline appointment, and decide which medication should be removed if they are randomised to the intervention arm of the trial. The choice of medication to be withdrawn will be at the discretion of the GP, but their decision will be informed by an individual’s comorbidities and existing guidelines, where appropriate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Specifically, participating GPs will be encouraged to identify previously unrecognised contraindications to medication, defined by the Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In the absence of these, or a strong clinical rationale for continuing despite a STOPP criteria being met, GPs will be recommended to reduce antihypertensive medications in reverse of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence C+A+D algorithm for older patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> All participants in the trial will remain on at least one antihypertensive.</p>

                <p>Once a medication has been removed, GPs or other appropriate, delegated healthcare professionals will closely monitor the participant’s response to medication reduction: they will be given advice about what and when to monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>), but this schedule will be flexible. All participants will be expected to return for at least one routine safety follow-up visit, and further visits may be required if blood pressure is raised (≥150 mm Hg), or AEs occur. Where blood pressure is persistently raised, GPs will be expected to re-adjust medication (dose or type), rendering the likelihood of an SAE occurring as a result of the intervention very low.</p>

Frequent monitoring in the initial 4 weeks after drug withdrawal is thus not required unless blood pressure (BP) levels are extreme or there are other clinical concerns (see above). Where systolic/diastolic BP values fall into different categories, consider the higher value. BP should be taken as the averaged second and third measurements using a validated monitor.

Differential use of self-monitoring in the intervention group, or indeed in the control group (many patients now self-monitor routinely)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> is not expected to impact on the study results, since there is good evidence that self-monitoring only affects blood pressure levels if used in combination with a co-intervention.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> All other clinical care will continue as usual.</p>

                <p>Participants will attend one research follow-up clinic, 12 weeks (±2 weeks) after baseline and those in the intervention will attend one additional safety visit after 4 weeks (±2 weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). A period of 4 weeks is expected to be sufficiently long enough to assess the impact of antihypertensive medication reduction, since these drugs usually take approximately 4 weeks to ‘wash out’ of a patient’s system. Earlier safety visits are not recommended since they could provide false reassurance that blood pressure is within safe limits if the withdrawn drug has not washed out of the participant’s system.</p>
                <p>The follow-up assessments will include standardised blood pressure measurement (for assessment of the primary outcome), questionnaire assessments and adherence to the trial medication regime, side effects and AEs (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Where possible, all participants will be flagged for mortality and hospital admissions using National Health Service patient tracking services, permitting long-term follow-up for up to 5 years after the trial has finished.</p>
                <p>Each participant has the right to withdraw from the trial at any time. We will ask all participants to attend a follow-up visit as far as is practicable, regardless of whether medication is re-introduced to participants in the intervention group, or a participant in the control group has medication withdrawn. Unless a participant withdraws consent, vital status will be assessed even where an individual has been lost to follow-up (eg, moved away). If given, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF.</p>

                <p>Assuming that 100% of participants in the usual care group, and 96% of those in the medication reduction group have controlled systolic blood pressure levels (&lt;150 mm Hg) at follow-up, approximately 540 participants will be required to detect a non-inferior difference in systolic blood pressure control between groups. Calculations assume a 10% non-inferiority margin, 90% power, 2.5% one-sided level of significance, 10% loss to follow-up and a 10% dilution effect due to cross-over between arms. There is no existing precedent for an appropriate margin of non-inferiority in this type of trial, but 10% was deemed useful to inform future doctor-patient discussions about medication reduction: if the non-inferiority margin is met, it will suggest that for every 10 patients who have their medication reduced, at least 9 will still have controlled blood pressure at 12-week follow-up.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>A detailed statistical analysis plan will be agreed prior to the end of the trial. The primary and secondary analyses will be by intention to treat (ITT), unless stated otherwise. The primary analysis will be a non-inferiority analysis by means of the ‘two one-sided test’ procedure,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> whereby the 95% CI for the relative risk of participants with systolic blood pressure at 12 weeks below 150 mm Hg between the medication reduction group and the usual care group is calculated. This will be obtained by means of a generalised linear mixed effects model with GP surgery included as a random effect and baseline blood pressure as a fixed effect. If the lower limit of the CI is &gt;0.9 (equal to a risk difference of 10%) then the research hypothesis that medication reduction will be non-inferior in terms of blood pressure control to usual care will be accepted. As a secondary analysis of the primary outcome, a per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed, since ITT can be anticonservative for a non-inferiority hypothesis.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Participants who received the medication reduction intervention in the PP analysis will be defined as a participant in the medication reduction arm who maintained their medication reduction throughout the 12-week follow-up period.</p>
                <p>Secondary analyses will examine the proportion of participants in the medication reduction arm who maintained their medication reduction throughout the 12-week follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by means of linear mixed effects models, adjusting for the baseline level of the outcome and baseline systolic blood pressure and including practice as a random effect: systolic blood pressure, EQ-5D-5L and the Frailty index/frail scale. The difference in the rate of side effects and AEs between the medication reduction and usual care arms will be analysed by means of a logistic mixed effects model adjusting for baseline systolic blood pressure and including practice as a random effect.</p>
                <p>Exploratory subgroup analyses of blood pressure control, change in blood pressure and maintenance of medication reduction will be conducted by different levels of baseline frailty, functional independence, cognitive function, number of medications prescribed at baseline and number of comorbidities at baseline.</p>

                  <p>Face-to-face interviews with GPs and patients will be conducted to generate understanding about the barriers and facilitators to antihypertensive medication reduction. Informed consent will be sought from approximately 15 GPs to provide a broad range of opinion from varying practice sizes (small to large) and settings (rural to urban). Participating GPs will also be asked to identify up to 15 patients for interview, based on the same inclusion criteria as those applied to participants in the main trial.</p>
                  <p>Interviews with GPs will use a chart-stimulated recall approach to explore the factors which influence their treatment choices in older hypertensive patients.

Interviews with patients will use ‘brown bag’ medication review techniques<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> to create a complete record of medication held, with a commentary on usage from the participants’ perspective. Diagrammatic elicitation techniques will be used to complete a relational map outlining participants’ circumstances and how these relate to the medications taken. These sketches will be used as the basis for a discussion on the implications of withdrawing antihypertensive medications, and what this ‘gap’ might mean for the patient.</p>
                  <p>All interviews will be transcribed verbatim, stored and organised using NVivo software (QSR International, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia). Interview and visual data from GP and patient interviews will be subjected to thematic analysis, with a particular orientation to exploring clinical and patient perspectives on the barriers and facilitators to reducing antihypertensives.</p>

Costs of the therapies prescribed, side effects and acute and long-term costs of cardiovascular events will be obtained within the trial and from the literature. Quality of life on each treatment strategy will be obtained from the trial data using EQ-5D-5L, and previous studies will inform utility values for cardiovascular disease health states and the impact of side effects. The model will determine the cost per additional QALY gained of the medication reduction intervention versus usual care and analyses will be conducted from a health and social services perspective. The model will be run with a lifetime perspective, with costs and benefits discounted at a rate of 3.5%. A value of information analysis will assess whether a further trial would be appropriate to reduce decision uncertainty, and identify those parameters where more precise estimates would be most valuable and should therefore be chosen as outcomes for such a trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Current guidelines in the UK suggest that doctors should ensure that patients are fully informed of the benefits and risks of their prescribed medications and where appropriate, discuss the potential for medication withdrawal in frail individuals with multimorbidity.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This is difficult given consultation time constraints and fear that deprescribing might result in harm.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This is compounded by conflicting and inconclusive evidence about the benefits and harms of treatment, and a lack of evidence about what will happen if these treatments are reduced.</p>
              <p>The ECSTATIC trial enrolled 1067 younger participants aged 40–70 years, taking antihypertensives for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The trial demonstrated that only 27% of participants were able to maintain medication reduction throughout follow-up and at 3 months, systolic blood pressure was on average 6 mm Hg higher in the deprescribing group. At 2-year follow-up, the risk of uncontrolled blood pressure was significantly higher in those patients attempting to deprescribe. Unlike the present study, the medication reduction algorithm used did not encourage reintroduction of therapy if blood pressure was persistently raised.</p>
              <p>The Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Treatment in Elderly people (DANTE) study<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> examined the effect of complete antihypertensive medication discontinuation in 385 patients over the age of 75 years and with mild cognitive deficits. After 16 weeks of follow-up, they observed a 7/3 mm Hg increase in blood pressure but no difference in overall cognition compound score or quality of life between groups. A study by van der Wardt <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> examined the feasibility of a trial reducing antihypertensives in patients with dementia, but was only able to recruit nine participants for the withdrawal programme (1% recruitment rate) and a larger trial was deemed unfeasible. Similarly, the Opti-Med trial<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> demonstrated in 95 participants that a broader deprescribing approach is achievable in patients living in nursing homes, but was unable to examine the effect on clinical outcomes due to recruitment issues resulting in only 38% of the planned sample size being enrolled.</p>
              <p>The OPtimising Treatment for MIld Systolic hypertension in the Elderly (OPTiMISE) trial will target frail individuals with polypharmacy and comorbidity, and aim to establish whether a strategy of antihypertensive medication reduction is safe and acceptable to older patients. The findings of this trial will support better patient-centred management plans for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in older individuals and inform future deprescribing trials in primary care.</p>
