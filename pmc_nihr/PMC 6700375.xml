                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Post-stroke aphasia might improve over many years with speech and language therapy; however speech and language therapy is often less readily available beyond a few months after stroke. We assessed self-managed computerised speech and language therapy (CSLT) as a means of providing more therapy than patients can access through usual care alone.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this pragmatic, superiority, three-arm, individually randomised, single-blind, parallel group trial, patients were recruited from 21 speech and language therapy departments in the UK. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had been diagnosed with aphasia post-stroke at least 4 months before randomisation; they were excluded if they had another premorbid speech and language disorder caused by a neurological deficit other than stroke, required treatment in a language other than English, or if they were currently using computer-based word-finding speech therapy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 6 months of usual care (usual care group), daily self-managed CSLT plus usual care (CSLT group), or attention control plus usual care (attention control group) with the use of computer-generated stratified blocked randomisation (randomly ordered blocks of sizes three and six, stratified by site and severity of word finding at baseline based on CAT Naming Objects test scores). Only the outcome assessors and trial statistician were masked to the treatment allocation. The speech and language therapists who were doing the outcome assessments were different from those informing participants about which group they were assigned to and from those delivering all interventions. The statistician responsible for generating the randomisation schedule was separate from those doing the analysis. Co-primary outcomes were the change in ability to retrieve personally relevant words in a picture naming test (with 10% mean difference in change considered a priori as clinically meaningful) and the change in functional communication ability measured by masked ratings of video-recorded conversations, with the use of Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs), between baseline and 6 months after randomisation (with a standardised mean difference in change of 0Â·45 considered a priori as clinically meaningful). Primary analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which included randomly assigned patients who gave informed consent and excluded those without 6-month outcome measures. Safety analysis included all participants. This trial has been completed and was registered with the ISRCTN, number ISRCTN68798818.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>From Oct 20, 2014, to Aug 18, 2016, 818 patients were assessed for eligibility, of which 278 (34%) participants were randomly assigned (101 [36%] to the usual care group; 97 [35%] to the CSLT group; 80 [29%] to the attention control group). 86 patients in the usual care group, 83 in the CSLT group, and 71 in the attention control group contributed to the mITT. Mean word finding improvements were 1Â·1% (SD 11Â·2) in the usual care group, 16Â·4% (15Â·3) in the CSLT group, and 2Â·4% (8Â·8) in the attention control group. Word finding improvement was 16Â·2% (95% CI 12Â·7 to 19Â·6; p&lt;0Â·0001) higher in the CSLT group than in the usual care group and was 14Â·4% (10Â·8 to 18Â·1) higher than in the attention control group. Mean changes in TOMs were 0Â·05 (SD 0Â·59) in the usual care group (n=84), 0Â·04 (0Â·58) in the CSLT group (n=81), and 0Â·10 (0Â·61) in the attention control group (n=68); the mean difference in change between the CSLT and usual care groups was â0Â·03 (â0Â·21 to 0Â·14; p=0Â·709) and between the CSLT and attention control groups was â0Â·01 (â0Â·20 to 0Â·18). The incidence of serious adverse events per year were rare with 0Â·23 events in the usual care group, 0Â·11 in the CSLT group, and 0Â·16 in the attention control group. 40 (89%) of 45 serious adverse events were unrelated to trial activity and the remaining five (11%) of 45 serious adverse events were classified as unlikely to be related to trial activity.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>CSLT plus usual care resulted in a clinically significant improvement in personally relevant word finding but did not result in an improvement in conversation. Future studies should explore ways to generalise new vocabulary to conversation for patients with chronic aphasia post-stroke.</p>

                  <p id="para70">People with chronic aphasia post-stroke often want and require more speech and language therapy than they can access. We searched the Cochrane Library and Medline for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials of interventions or service delivery for chronic aphasia in post-stroke populations, using the search terms âaphasia OR dysphasia AND therapy OR treatment AND strokeâ. We included papers published in English between Jan 1, 2010, and Feb 8, 2019. Studies of drug therapies, electrical stimulation, alternative medicine, and randomised controlled trials without between-group comparisons were excluded. The FCET2EC trial (From Controlled Experimental Trial 2 Everyday Communication) was a high-quality randomised controlled trial of 158 patients with post-stroke aphasia, with a low risk of bias due to computer generated randomisation and masked outcome measure assessors. This trial showed the effectiveness of speech and language therapy (â¥10 h per week for 3 weeks) for patients with chronic aphasia compared with controls on a waiting list for therapy, with benefits still evident at 6 months after treatment, and it supports findings from smaller trials (n=20 or fewer per group) that chronic post-stroke aphasia can improve with speech and language therapy. Due to resource limitations, computer therapy has been explored as a potentially efficient method of delivering sufficient quantities of speech and language therapy. Systematic reviews of computer-based speech and language therapy for patients with aphasia suggest that it might be more effective than no therapy and just as effective as face-to-face therapy. However, the quality of the studies included in the systematic reviews was low, with small sample sizes (n=55 or fewer). Only two of the studies assessed maintenance of treatment effect and only one considered the effect on functional communication. One small scale pilot study (n=34) included health economic evaluation, which suggested potential cost-effectiveness of CSLT.</p>

                  <p id="para90">The Big CACTUS trial is the first multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with post-stroke chronic aphasia (&gt;6 months) to assess both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of self-managed word finding therapy with specialist aphasia computer software. It is also the first randomised controlled trial powered to detect a meaningful difference in clinical outcomes. Our trial shows that it is feasible and acceptable to provide computerised therapy in routine clinical contexts increasing the availability of speech and language therapy provision. The findings provide robust evidence that patients with chronic aphasia can achieve improvement in their word finding, which is maintained after a 6-month follow-up period through self-managed practice with a computer. However, the improvement did not generalise to conversation. Health economic evaluation suggests that this low-cost intervention is more likely to be cost-effective for patients with mild and moderate word finding difficulties than for all patients with chronic aphasia.</p>

                <p id="para120">Big CACTUS was a pragmatic, superiority, three-arm, individually randomised, single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited from 21 community speech and language therapy departments within 20 UK National Health Service (NHS) Trusts (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 21</xref>). We designed a pragmatic study, using the pragmatic-explanatory continuum indicator summary (PRECIS) domains (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 105</xref>).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para130">Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and had aphasia confirmed by a speech and language therapist after one or more strokes at least 4 months before randomisation. Patients had word finding difficulties (defined by a score of 5â43 out of 48 on the Comprehensive Aphasia Test [CAT] Naming Objects test),<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> could perform a simple matching task on the StepByStep computer program<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with at least 50% accuracy (score of 5 out of 10 or higher), and could repeat at least 50% of words in a repetition task on StepByStep (score of 5 out of 10 or higher). Patients were excluded if they had a premorbid speech and language disorder caused by a neurological deficit other than stroke, if they required treatment for a language other than English (because the StepByStep software used for therapy was in English), or if they were currently using a word finding computer program, including StepByStep.</p>
                <p id="para140">Eligible patients were identified by practising speech and language therapists from past and current caseloads and voluntary sector support groups. Therapists used a Consent Support Tool<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> to identify the level of support required for each patient with aphasia to provide written informed consent and to identify those who required a carer to provide written consent or a declaration of belief that they wished to take part.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para160">We used a centralised web-based randomisation system to randomly assign patients to one of three interventions: usual care, CSLT plus usual care (CSLT group), or attention control plus usual care (attention control group), using a fixed 1:1:1 allocation ratio. This system used stratified block randomisation with randomly ordered blocks of sizes three and six, stratified by site and severity of word finding at baseline based on CAT Naming Objects test scores:<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> mild (31â43), moderate (18â30), and severe (5â17). Only the independent randomisation statistician knew the block sizes, which were not disclosed until after the trial ended. The statistician used the restricted-access randomisation system to specify the randomisation details and to generate the randomisation schedule, which was retained within the system. Therapists randomly assigned patients using the online system and disclosed the allocation to the patient.</p>
                <p id="para170">We could not mask patients and treating therapists to intervention allocation. However, the therapists performed baseline assessments before randomisation and therefore completed these masked to treatment allocation. The therapists who performed baseline assessments also provided CSLT and attention control interventions. Therefore, we trained separate therapists (outcome assessors), masked to intervention allocation, to do follow-up assessments at each site. Video recordings of conversations between patients and therapist assessors at baseline and follow-up were rated independently of the therapist team who delivered the intervention by speech and language therapists who were not involved in the trial, ensuring raters were masked to intervention allocation and timepoint of measurement.

Each patient chose 100 words that were relevant to them, before they were randomly assigned to one of the intervention groups, which were then used for computerised word finding practice. Practice was supported by a therapy assistant or volunteer under the supervision of the therapist for 6 months.</p>
                <p id="para200">Patients in the attention control group were asked to complete paper-based puzzle book activities (eg, sudoku, spot the difference, word searches, or colouring) on a daily basis and received supportive telephone calls from the research team once a month. The type and difficulty of the puzzle book was established by the therapist who did the baseline assessments and the research team sent new books each month on the basis of the phone call discussions. If they wished, patients were able to continue using CSLT after the 6-month supported period if they still had access to it (given that CSLT often required laptops that had been lent, and might have subsequently been required by a new patient).

Clinical assessment comprised a CAT comprehension test (baseline visit only);<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> a picture naming test of 100 personally relevant words (co-primary outcome measurement); a 10 min conversation between the therapist and patient, structured around topics of personal importance to the patient, which was videoed and later assessed using the activity scale of the Therapy Outcome Measures (TOMs; a co-primary outcome measurement),<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> once all of the conversations had been made and their presentation could be randomly assigned to masked raters. The number of treated words used in conversation were also counted (secondary outcome) by two members of the central research team (who were masked to the timepoint of the video conversation and the group allocation of the participant). Further secondary outcome measurements included the Communication Outcomes After Stroke (COAST)<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> questionnaire (the key secondary outcome according to our Hochberg statistical testing procedure), self-rated by the patient; the CAT Naming Objects test;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and the CarerCOAST<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> questionnaire, self-rated by the carer about themselves and the patient (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>).</p>

The events were then classified into adverse events and serious adverse events using International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice classifications.

We terminated recruitment after 278 of the planned 285 participants had been enrolled, because the observed dropout rate (9%) was lower than anticipated (15%) and the study had the desired statistical power to address the co-primary objectives.</p>
                <p id="para290">We based the analysis of the primary outcomes (6 months after randomisation) on a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) principle, which included randomly assigned patients who gave informed consent and excluded those without 6-month outcome measures. We based analysis on the treatment patients were randomly assigned to. We excluded deaths before assessment at 6 months in all clinical effectiveness analyses because the association between the interventions and increased risk of mortality was viewed as extremely unlikely.</p>

We analysed all clinical outcomes at 9 and 12 months in a similar manner. Co-primary, key secondary, and key multiple treatment comparisons (CSLT <italic>vs</italic> usual care and CSLT <italic>vs</italic> attention control) are the sources of multiple hypothesis testing.

              <p id="para360">Participants were recruited to the trial between Oct 20, 2014, and Aug 18, 2016, and were followed up between Oct 24, 2015, and Sept 12, 2017. A total of 818 participants were screened for eligibility, of whom 278 (34%) were randomly assigned to the usual care group (101 [36%]), the CSLT group (97 [35%]), and the attention control group (80 [29%]). Eight participants died before 6 months follow-up, 25 withdrew consent, one was lost to follow-up, and one was excluded based on investigatorsâ decisions. Reasons for dropout included personal and family issues, unhappiness with allocated study group, and unwillingness to complete outcome measures. In addition, outcome visits were not done with three participants. For further details see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 18)</xref>. 240 (86%) of 278 participants were included as eligible in the mITT analysis: 86 (36%) of 240 in the usual care group, 83 (35%) of 240 in the CSLT group, 71 (30%) of 240 in the attention control group <italic>(</italic>

              <p id="para370">The mean age of all participants was 65Â·4 years (SD 12Â·9) with a range 23 to 92 years and 164 (61%) of 270 were men. 119 (44%) of 270 participants had mild word finding difficulties (CAT Naming Objects test score 31â43 points out of 48), 80 (30%) were moderate (18â30 points), and 71 (26%) were severe (5â17 points). Participants were a median of 2 years (IQR 11 months to 4 years) post-stroke (range four months to 36 years). Intervention groups were broadly similar at baseline for both the mITT and multiple imputation analysis populations (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 99</xref>). Notable exceptions include a greater proportion of participants with severe comprehension difficulties but a lower proportion of participants with severe word finding difficulties in the attention control group than the CSLT or usual care groups.

              <p id="para390">Mean changes in functional communication in conversation based on TOMs (the second co-primary outcome) were very similar across interventions (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The mean difference in change between the usual care group and the CSLT group was â0Â·03 (95% CI â0Â·21 to 0Â·14; p=0Â·709) and between the CSLT group and attention control group was â0Â·01 (â0Â·20 to 0Â·18). Therefore, the CSLT approach did not appear to improve functional communication in conversation.</p>
              <p id="para400">The mean improvement in COAST in the CSLT group compared with the usual care group and the attention control group was not sufficient to suggest that CSLT improved the key secondary outcome (participant's own perception of their communication and social participation or its effect on their life; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). The results were similar after adjusting for additional covariates: length of time post-stroke and location of stroke (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 39</xref>). Location of stroke was reported as recorded in medical notes, hence a mixture of vascular territories and lobes were reported. For other secondary outcomes, on average, no improvement was seen in the number of treated words used in conversation across groups between baseline and 6 months (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 76â78</xref>). Additionally, evidence was not sufficient to suggest that improved word finding of treated words generalised to untreated words (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 72</xref>). At 6 months, the mean change in word finding of untreated words was 3Â·9 (SD 7Â·9) in the usual care group, 3Â·3 (7Â·0) in the CSLT group, and 0Â·7 (8Â·5) in the attention control group, indicating an adjusted mean difference in change of â0Â·3 (95% CI â2Â·7 to 2Â·1) in favour of usual care compared with CSLT. Carer-related outcomes (ie, change in carer's perception of patient's communication and social participation, as assessed using the first 15 items of the CarerCOAST, and change in the carer QoL, as assessed using the last five items of the CarerCOAST) are reported in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 81, 100)</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para410">With regard to safety (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 93</xref>), negative effects of CSLT were low. 23 (27%) of 85 participants in the CSLT group reported fatigue or anxiety at some point during the 6 months of computer use, which translates to one event per person per year. The number of participants who experienced any adverse events was 70 (61%) in the usual care group, 61 (72%) in the CSLT group, and 50 (63%) in the attention control group (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).

              <p id="para420">Predefined subgroup analyses indicated that the effect of CSLT on word finding was broadly consistent regardless of time post-stroke and slightly higher for participants with mild word finding difficulties and for those whose verbal comprehension was within normal limits (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 49â51</xref>). For functional conversation and perception of communication effectiveness or QoL, the subgroup and main results were consistent (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 49, 50, 52, 53</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para430">All participants randomly assigned to the CSLT group received the StepByStep aphasia therapy software on a computer. Some practice was recorded for all but 11 participants, with a mean of 28 h (SD 25Â·6) and a median of 21 h (IQR 4Â·9â49Â·7) in total between baseline and 6 months. In comparison, a mean amount of 3Â·8 h (SD 7Â·4) of usual speech and language therapy was received by all participants between baseline and 6 months. 57 (61%) of 94 participants in the CSLT group continued to use the computer exercises unsupported beyond the 6-month timepoint. Fidelity to CSLT, attention control and usual care is described in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 106)</xref>. In terms of quality of CSLT delivery, of particular note is that volunteers and therapy assistants only spent a median of 45 min per participant (IQR 22Â·0â77Â·5) over the 6 months practising newly learned words in conversation. More in depth analysis of fidelity of CSLT in Big CACTUS is in progress.</p>
              <p id="para440">Regarding health economic evaluation, the per-patient incremental cost of CSLT was Â·733 (95% credible interval 674 to 798) and the incremental QALY gain was 0Â·017 (â0Â·05 to 0Â·10), resulting in an ICER of Â·42â686 per QALY gained compared with usual care. For CSLT compared with attention control, the ICER was Â·40â164 per QALY gained. For CSLT compared with usual care, participants with mild word finding difficulty had an ICER of Â·22â371 per QALY gained and for those with moderate word finding difficulty, the ICER was Â·28â819 per QALY gained, whereas CSLT was more expensive and produced fewer QALYs than usual care for participants with severe word finding difficulties.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para450">Big CACTUS shows that CSLT alongside usual care enables increased amounts of therapy practice and significantly improves the ability to retrieve personally relevant words chosen for practice. This outcome is likely to be due to the CSLT rather than the extra activity of the participant or attention provided by the therapy assistants. Improvement in word finding was maintained 6 months after the intervention period. However, CSLT did not have an effect on conversation, self-perceived improvements in everyday communication, social participation, or QoL.</p>
              <p id="para460">It is notable that 57 (61%) of 94 participants chose to continue using the computer program unsupported beyond the end of the formal intervention period (if they still had access to it), suggesting many participants valued the opportunity to continue practising language skills independently. Subgroup analysis showed no effect of time post-stroke (ranged from 4 months to 36 years in this trial) on the ability to improve word finding, showing that people can continue to learn new words even a long time after the event. This finding supports the findings from small studies included in the Cochrane review of aphasia therapy,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> that SLT in general benefits patients with chronic aphasia.</p>
              <p id="para470">Big CACTUS supports indications from smaller studies that improvements in the ability to find treated words in patients with chronic aphasia do not generalise to untreated words.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Therefore, it is crucial that words of personal relevance form the focus of speech and language therapy in general to ensure usefulness. However, generalisation of newly learned words into conversation was not seen in the present trial, mirroring the findings in motor rehabilitation after stroke, where in the context of randomised comparisons with usual care or attention control interventions, improvements have been shown in motor function, balance, and gait velocity but not in functionally relevant activities of daily living.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The findings of the present study therefore suggest that identifying ways to support functional use of new words is a priority to achieve the goal of improving conversation. The CSLT intervention intended that therapy assistants or volunteers would practise tasks to promote the use of new words in context. However, these tasks were only carried out for an average of 45 min in total over 6 months. Future studies will need to establish how to ensure support for practising words in context and whether increased practice in context helps with generalisation.</p>
              <p id="para480">CSLT can be considered a safe intervention as only a few negative effects were reported by participants and the groups had no significant differences in incidences of adverse events or severe adverse events. Participants in the CSLT group spent, on average, 28 h on independent, repetitive word finding practice, at a mean cost of Â·733 per participant. In contrast, 28 h of a therapist would cost approximately Â·1400 per patient. Hence, relative to providing face-to-face speech and language therapy, CSLT is a low-cost option for delivering additional word finding therapy to patients with chronic aphasia post-stroke. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that CSLT was not observed to affect conversation, the QALY gain associated with CSLT compared with usual care was low and the intervention is unlikely to be considered cost-effective for the whole patient population with aphasia because of the size of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. However, CSLT is more likely to be cost-effective than usual care for patients with mild and moderate word-finding difficulties. The key cost driver of delivering CSLT is time spent setting up the software and providing technical support, which in our study was done by therapists. These tasks could conceivably be done by therapy assistants or volunteers, substantially reducing costs. A full discussion of the health economic results will be the subject of a further publication.</p>
              <p id="para490">Strengths of the study include recruitment and treatment of participants who are representative of the clinical population from a wide range of clinical settings that used existing models of IT services to implement CSLT. The CSLT intervention also has international applicability and is manualised and publicly available, enabling replication. Additional study strengths include the addition of a third group to enable differentiation of the effect of speech and language therapy components of CSLT from effects of additional activity and attention, and observation of fidelity to the trial interventions. Outcome measures addressed impairment, activity, and participation dimensions of the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Measuring across the ICF domains is important as this study suggests that word finding improvement (impairment) is not a good surrogate measure for functional conversation (activity). The trial also included health economic evaluation, and to our knowledge, our study is the first to do this for SLT. The use of an accessible version of the EQ-5D-5L permitted patients with aphasia to rate their own QoL for QALY estimation, rather than relying only on the view of a carer, which is not always the same as that of the patient themselves.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para500">A limitation is that only one computer program was used of the many commercial programs and apps available, and for only one language domain (ie, word finding) affected by aphasia. The results of the study also need to be considered in context of rapid technological advancement. Because the software used was only in English, patients who required treatment in a language other than English were excluded. Additionally, participant ethnicity was not recorded. While the intervention was given to all eligible participants, further research should identify patient characteristics that indicate motivation to participate in CSLT and likelihood of a good outcome for prudent targeting of the intervention, such as aphasia severity, age, and education. Participant characteristics influencing practice will be addressed in a further paper. Although data has been presented here on the amount of practice carried out, dose response and effect of continued practice are important. Preliminary data can be found in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 59)</xref> and will be explored in more detail in further publications.</p>
              <p id="para510">Despite blocking of the allocation sequence, slightly more participants were randomly assigned to CSLT and usual care groups compared with the attention control group. Sites recruiting small numbers of participants and the termination of recruitment after 278 patients might have contributed to this chance imbalance, which resulted in higher power than expected for the CSLT and usual care primary comparison and slightly lower power than expected for the CSLT and attention control comparisonâalthough adequate to address the intended research objectives. We used the activity scale of the TOMs to measure conversations because it has good reliability and is likely to detect clinically meaningful change, though it might not detect small changes.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Although cost-effectiveness was an important aspect of the study, it was not powered to detect a meaningful difference in QALYs. Finally, it was not possible to measure the amount of activity participants carried out with puzzle books in the attention control group with as much accuracy as the amount of computer practice carried out and therefore it is not known how well the attention control intervention controlled for CSLT.</p>
              <p id="para520">In conclusion, this study has shown that CSLT is a low-cost intervention enabling access to additional word finding therapy for patients with chronic aphasia, leading to significant improvement in the ability to find words of personal relevance. Further research should focus on therapy techniques to promote generalisation of new words to functional, everyday communication contexts.</p>
