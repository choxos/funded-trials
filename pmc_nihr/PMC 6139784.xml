                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Mass drug administration has made a major contribution to the public health control of several important neglected tropical diseases. For settings with more than one endemic disease, combined mass drug administration has potential practical advantages compared with separate programmes but needs confirmation of feasibility and safety. We undertook a study of mass drug administration in the Solomon Islands for trachoma and scabies control using ivermectin and azithromycin, key drugs in the control of neglected tropical diseases worldwide.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The entire population of Choiseul province, Solomon Islands, was eligible to participate. An azithromycin-based mass drug administration regimen was offered in line with standard recommendations for trachoma elimination (oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline). An ivermectin-based mass drug administration regimen was offered at the same time (oral ivermectin or topical permethrin), with a further dose 7–14 days later, using a modified version of a regimen demonstrated to be effective for scabies control. All participants underwent safety assessments 7–14 days later. Participants in ten randomly selected sentinel villages underwent a more detailed safety assessment. Routine health system reports of hospital or clinic admissions and deaths were also obtained to compare health outcomes in the 12 month period before and after the mass drug administration.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>The study enrolled 26 188 participants, 99·3% of the estimated resident population as determined at the 2009 census. Of those enrolled, 25 717 (98·2%) received the trachoma regimen and 25 819 (98·6%) received the first dose of the scabies regimen between Sept 1, and Oct 2, 2015. A second dose of the scabies regimen was received by 21 931 (83·7%) of participants. Adverse events, all mild and transient, were recorded in 571 (2·6%) of the entire study population and 58 (4·1%) of participants in the ten sentinel villages. In the 12 months before and after the mass drug administration the numbers of hospital admissions (1530 <italic>vs</italic> 1602) and deaths (73 <italic>vs</italic> 83) were similar. In the month after the mass drug administration, 84 individuals were admitted to hospital and two died, compared with a monthly median of 116 admissions (IQR 106–159) and six deaths (IQR 4–7) in the 12 months before and after the mass drug administration.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In the largest trial so far involving coadministration of regimens based on ivermectin and azithromycin, the combination was safe and feasible in a population of more than 26 000 people. Coadministration of mass drug administration based on these two drugs opens up new potential for the control of neglected tropical diseases.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Mass drug administration involves treatment of whole populations with a pharmaceutical agent to reduce or interrupt transmission of an infectious pathogen. It has become a key strategy for the control of neglected tropical diseases in several low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The five main neglected tropical diseases currently targeted by mass drug administration are onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and infection with soil-transmitted helminths, diseases that are strongly related to living conditions and primarily affect rural populations in resource-limited settings.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Mass drug administration is intended to complement improvements in both environmental risk factors and health service access, to ultimately achieve elimination of these diseases.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Many communities are affected by multiple neglected tropical diseases.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although some programmes for mass drug administration target more than one neglected tropical disease (eg, combined ivermectin and albendazole for both lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis), they are more often aimed at single diseases. There has been increasing international recognition of the need to better integrate these vertical structures, both with each other, and with local health systems.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The potential logistical and health benefits of integration include cost savings, reduced burden on health systems and communities, and better disease control through improved coverage. However, uncertainties remain about the feasibility of integration in resource-limited settings, and about the efficacy and safety of coadministration of drugs on a large scale.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Embase, without language restrictions, for studies reporting on the mass coadministration of azithromycin-based and ivermectin-based regimens, published up to Nov 15, 2017, with the terms “azithromycin” and “ivermectin”. We identified one study of 1500 participants in a setting of endemic neglected tropical disease, showing that this combination (plus albendazole) resulted in mild, transitory adverse events consistent with the known profiles of the individual drugs when used alone, and no evidence of potentiation. This study, however, provided insufficient power to detect uncommon adverse events arising from coadministration and highlighted the need for large field studies of this strategy. Additionally, it did not investigate coverage and feasibility issues of coadministration of these two therapies.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">Our trial was designed to investigate the feasibility and safety of mass drug administration of two integrated therapies with azithromycin and ivermectin. To our knowledge, it is the first published large-scale trial of coadministration of this strategy to control neglected tropical diseases, providing safety information on more than 26 000 people as opposed to 1500 in the only previous study. In our study, safety was evaluated using active and passive monitoring of adverse events as well as a comprehensive review of routine clinic and hospital admission records for the 12 months before and after the intervention. We investigated the feasibility of joint mass administration of the two regimens, demonstrating that coadministration based on these two drugs opens up new potential for the control of neglected tropical diseases.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">The study provides evidence that coadministration of azithromycin and ivermectin is feasible and safe in a population of more than 26 000 people in a neglected tropical disease-endemic setting. We have demonstrated that a high level of population coverage is achievable in a large and geographically disperse population and provided robust evidence of the safety of this strategy in population settings. Our findings, therefore, support the strategy of integration of mass drug administration for neglected tropical diseases sharing similar target populations and therapies to reduce costs and allow a more rapid scale-up of programmes.</p>

                <p id="para130">The study was done in Choiseul Province of the Solomon Islands, an island nation in the South Pacific region with a population of approximately 580 000 people across roughly 990 islands.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Choiseul is located in the northwest of the country.

All team members received training on study activities before the trial commencement. We obtained verbal consent, in local dialect, for individuals aged 18 years or older and verbal consent from a parent or guardian for younger individuals. Before drug administration, information sheets explaining the trial were distributed to local community nurses who were trained in study procedures, and community members were given an opportunity to meet the local health staff to ask questions. Apart from the study-specific consent process, community mobilisation efforts were identical to those that had been used by the Ministry of Health in preparing other provinces for trachoma-related mass administration of azithromycin. Individuals who consented to receive the regimen were asked to attend the village clinic or community hall to receive treatment on an agreed date.</p>

                <p id="para170">The azithromycin regimen for trachoma followed WHO guidelines, identical to that used for trachoma mass drug administration in the rest of the country.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Participants were offered a single oral dose of azithromycin at a dose of 20 mg/kg, using weight bands (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), up to a maximum of 1 g. Children weighing less than 12·5 kg received oral suspension at a dose of 20 mg/kg; others received tablets. Infants younger than 6 months were not given azithromycin, but instead were offered topical tetracycline ointment 1% for administration by a parent or guardian to both eyes twice per day for 6 weeks.</p>
                <p id="para180">For administration of ivermectin for scabies, participants were offered a dose of oral ivermectin at 200 μg/kg, using weight bands, at the same time as the trachoma drug administration. The same dose was offered a second time, 7–14 days later. This regimen was based on a protocol shown to be safe and effective in a previous trial,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> with the modification that the second dose was offered to all participants (rather than being restricted to those with clinical scabies at baseline) because clinical examination of all participants was infeasible on such a large scale. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and children weighing less than 12·5 kg were offered two applications of topical permethrin cream 7–14 days apart, rather than ivermectin. We used 12·5 kg as the lower limit (rather than 15 kg, which is used for weight-based dosing of ivermectin in mass administration for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis), to make administration consistent with the azithromycin weight cutoff.</p>
                <p id="para190">Oral drug administration was directly observed for both ivermectin and azithromycin. Participants offered permethrin were given the option to apply the cream at home, or to have a trained nurse apply it in a private room at the clinic. For topical therapies (tetracycline and permethrin), appropriate use of the medication was explained on a one-to-one basis by a member of the study team to the recipient, or the recipient's carer.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The coverage of mass drug administration regimens for scabies and trachoma, and of coadministration for both diseases, was calculated using the 2009 census data as the denominator, with subanalysis by age and weight bands. Coadministration was deemed successful if the coverage for both diseases was similar to that for trachoma achieved by other provinces in the same campaign (approximately 80%). For comparison with single-agent regimens, we obtained programmatic coverage data from other provinces in which the Ministry of Health had previously conducted mass administration of azithromycin for trachoma.</p>
                <p id="para210">Safety was evaluated via four methods, incorporating standard definitions of adverse events.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> First, we sought information on the occurrence of immediate severe adverse events, defined as admission to hospital or death within 24 h of exposure to study medicine, as recorded in hospital records and a review of death reports. Second, we asked all participants about their current health (“Are you well today?”) at the time of initial drug administration. At the time of the second dose of the ivermectin-based scabies regimen participants were asked about their health status since the first dose (“Have you had any problem with the first dose?”). If they answered in the negative, we administered a checklist of health conditions, supplemented by free text recording of conditions not on the checklist. Third, we undertook active surveillance for adverse events in ten randomly selected sentinel villages. In these communities, we administered a questionnaire at both occasions of drug administration which sought information on the presence or absence of each condition on the checklist, again using a free text field to elicit conditions not on the list. Finally, we undertook a review of routine clinic and hospital admission records submitted through the national District Health Information System (DHIS2) during the 12 months after mass drug administration, and compared those data to data for the 12 months before mass drug administration.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para300">To our knowledge, this trial is the first published report of large-scale coadministration of ivermectin and azithromycin as components of neglected tropical disease control. We have demonstrated that coadministration of the two drugs was safe and feasible. The lack of any serious adverse events in a population of more than 21 000 people, and the small number of adverse events, indicate that coadministration is a viable means of integrating programmes to control multiple, coendemic neglected tropical diseases. Furthermore, the high level of coverage achieved, both for the coadministration and the second dose of the ivermectin-based scabies regimen, indicates the feasibility of coadministration as strategy for mass drug administration. A randomised trial might have provided more detailed data on safety, but would not have been feasible on this scale, due to costs and the burden that would have been imposed on the Solomon Islands health system.</p>
              <p id="para310">Although the benefit of mass azithromycin administration for trachoma is well established,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> the evidence for benefit of mass administration of ivermectin-based regimens for scabies control has emerged only recently, most notably in the SHIFT study, the strategy's first comparative trial.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> SHIFT took place in Fiji and its findings showed that a single round of mass drug administration with ivermectin reduced community prevalence of scabies by 94% at 1 year, a substantially greater reduction than either mass permethrin administration or standard care.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In the present study, we have shown that a high level of population coverage can be achieved in a large and geographically dispersed population, even when including a second dose of ivermectin for the entire population. Coverage levels for the first dose (which involved joint administration of the two regimens) was similar to levels achieved for mass azithromycin administration alone in the other Solomon Islands provinces (86% in 2014–15, Oliver Sokana, personal communication). Given the high costs of transport and other logistics in remote settings, joint delivery of two drugs in mass administration regimens has the potential to deliver considerable savings. However, a specific difficulty with the current ivermectin-based regimen for scabies is the requirement of a second dose after 7–14 days, to kill newly hatched mites;<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> this regimen is distinct from the schedules used for mass ivermectin administration for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, which require only a single dose. Although we achieved high coverage with the second dose, the logistical challenges and increased cost clearly represent a potential barrier to the wider use of ivermectin for scabies control and to routine integration with other neglected tropical disease programmes. Further studies of the efficacy of one instead of two doses for scabies, or longer-acting drugs such as moxidectin,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> might widen the possibilities for the integration of mass drug administration for scabies with other neglected tropical disease programmes without entailing the additional costs of delivering the second dose.</p>
              <p id="para320">In the largest previous study, with 1500 people receiving the combination, there was no indication of clinically significant adverse events or alterations in efficacy.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Our findings in a much larger population provide more robust evidence for the safety of coadministration of ivermectin and azithromycin in population settings. Our study also provides encouraging data on the safety of ivermectin in younger children, particularly those weighing as little as 12·5 kg. Gastrointestinal upset, headache, and dizziness are well recognised side-effects of azithromycin and ivermectin and were the most commonly encountered adverse events in this study, all of a mild nature.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our study had some limitations. The design was non-randomised, so safety assessments relied on before-and-after comparisons in the same population. We also adopted a pragmatic means to assess safety across the target population. For the entire population of 26 188 participants, we sought open-ended information on health status at the time of coadministration, and again at the time of delivery of the second dose of the scabies regimen, 7–14 days after the two drugs had been received. We also sought more detailed symptom-specific information on about 6% of participants resident in the ten sentinel villages. However, we were not able to assess safety in this manner for the 3888 (16·3%) participants who did not receive the second dose. Also, we might have missed mild, transient adverse events that occurred within a short time of joint administration but had been forgotten by participants by the time they were interviewed at the second dose. We supplemented this active surveillance approach with routinely recorded data on hospital admissions and deaths in the periods preceding and following mass drug administration. The absence of any signal of increased health-care use after mass drug administration is consistent with our active surveillance data.</p>
              <p id="para340">The integration of mass drug administration for neglected tropical diseases sharing similar target populations and drug regimens, as demonstrated in our study, has the potential to facilitate medication delivery, thereby reducing costs and allowing more rapid scale-up of programmes for multiple neglected tropical diseases. The evidence from our trial is that, on a very large scale, there were not serious adverse events arising from the joint administration of the two regimens. Studies in different populations, including different combinations of drugs (eg, triple therapy with ivermectin, albendazole, and azithromycin), are needed to further expand the evidence base for coadministration as a global strategy for control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases.</p>
