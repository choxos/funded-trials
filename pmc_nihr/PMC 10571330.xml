                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting at least 5 million children in South Asia. Majority of these children are without access to evidence-based care. The UK Pre-school Autism Communication Therapy (PACT) is the only intervention to have shown sustained impact on autism symptoms. It was systematically adapted for non-specialist community delivery in South Asia, as the â€˜Parent-mediated Autism Social Communication Intervention for non-Specialists (PASS)â€™ and extended â€˜PASS Plusâ€™ interventions. RCTs of both showed feasibility, acceptability and positive effect on parent and child dyadic outcomes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The Communication-centred Parent-mediated treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder in South Asia (COMPASS) trial is now a scale-up two-centre, two-arm single (rater)Â blinded random allocation parallel group study of the PASS Plus intervention in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone, plus health economic evaluationÂ embedded in the India health system. Two hundred forty children (approximately 120 intervention/120 TAU) with ASD aged 2â€“9Â years will be recruited from two tertiary care government hospitals in New Delhi, India. Accredited Social Health Activists will be one of the intervention delivery agents. Families will undertake up to 12 communication sessions over 8Â months and will be offered the Plus modules which address coexisting problems. The trialâ€™s primary endpoint is at 9Â months from randomisation, with follow-up at 15Â months. The primary outcome is autism symptom severity; secondary outcomes include parentâ€“child communication, child adaptation, quality of life and parental wellbeing. Primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles using linear mixed model regressions with group allocation and repeated measures as random effects. The cost-effectiveness analysis will use a societal perspective over the 15-month period of intervention and follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">If clinically and cost-effective, this programme will fill an important gap of scalable interventions delivered by non-specialist health workers within the current care pathways for autistic children and their families in low-resource contexts. The programme has been implemented through the COVID-19 pandemic when restrictions were in place; intervention delivery and evaluation processes have been adapted to address these conditions.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par72">Over 80% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) live in Low and MiddleÂ Income Countries (LMICs), and at least 5 million children in South Asia are autistic, the great majority without access to evidence-based care. This lack of access to evidence-based care along with the stigma and discrimination faced by families of children with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] impacts parental well-being and their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recent evidence from high-income countries supports the effectiveness of targeted parent-mediated interventions for the early care of autistic children and studies from Southeast Asia reflects that parents receiving interventional support report a better quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Interventions that are delivered through parents have the additional advantages of improving parental knowledge and wellbeing, potentially promoting the social empowerment of mothers, generalising into improvements in the family environment for the child and thus potentially conferring long-term impacts on the social context, the childâ€™s environment and functional outcomes.</p>

                <title>UK evidence</title>
                <p id="Par73">The Pre-school Autism Communication Therapy (PACT) is the only intervention in the field so far to have shown sustained impact on autism symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The therapy derives from theory-based research into autistic development and is targeted at getting parents to recognise their childâ€™s social communication differences and create an environment which gives the child space and time to communicate at their own pace. This intervention uses video feedback techniques to work with parents to enhance their understanding and responsiveness to the atypical communications of their young autistic child.</p>
                <p id="Par74">The MRC-funded UK PACT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (<italic>N</italic>â€‰=â€‰152) and its 6-year follow-up at mean age 10.5Â years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed treatment effect to reduce autism symptom severity, both at the primary endpoint (ES 0.64, 95% CI 0.07, 1.20; a 15% relative reduction) and at follow-up (ES 0.70, 95% CIâ€‰âˆ’â€‰0.05, 1.47), with a statistically significant averaged effect over the whole period (ES 0.55, 95% CI 0.14, 0.91). The endpoint change was strongly mediated through the targeted optimisation of parentâ€“child dyadic social communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], supporting the intervention theory: autistic children who received this treatment benefited from the enriched communication environment that their parents were able to create; this in turn had a long-term positive impact on the social interactions the children initiated and on the childrenâ€™s autism symptoms. PACT is an NIHR â€˜Signalâ€™ study; the intervention is evidenced in UK NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and has been selected for implementation in the UK Department of Health Improving Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) program.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Adaptation to South Asia</title>
                <p id="Par75">The original UK PACT therapy was adapted for use in South Asia in a systematic manner, including manual translation and cultural adaptation to enhance parental acceptability, developing a supervision and training cascade led by specialists in UK, India and Pakistan. Key additional features were to allow the adapted intervention to be delivered by community based non-specialist health workers and the delivery of the intervention at home. The resulting intervention was originally published as â€˜Parent-mediated intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorders in South Asiaâ€™ but has now been renamed for use including beyond South Asia, as the â€˜Parent-mediated Autism Social communication Intervention for non-Specialistsâ€™ (PASS) involved 12 sessions delivered over 8Â months to children aged 2 to 9Â years. A pilot RCT in India and Pakistan (the PASS study; 2012â€“2014; Autism Speaks) of the PASS intervention vs usual care (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] showed (i) high acceptability, with 24/32 (80%) of parentâ€“child dyad completing all intervention sessions including 100% (10/10) of families from low socio-economic backgrounds; (ii) high therapist fidelity against original PACT criteria; and (iii) replication of dyadic PACT results with effect on parental (ES 0.25, 95% CI 0.14, 0.36) and child (ES 0.14, 95% CI 0.04, 0.24) dyadic social communication. The PASS intervention was showcased at the World Bank-WHO summit on mental health (Washington, April 2016) and at the World Innovation Summit for Health (Qatar, November 2016).</p>

                <title>Extension to co-occurring conditions</title>
                <p id="Par76">Subsequently, the team in India developed and piloted an enhancement of PASS which included a clinical decision algorithm containing strategies to address common co-occurring conditions in autistic children. These included sensory-seeking and disruptive behaviours (identified in the PASS trial as potential barriers to implementation and acceptability in low-resource settings), creating a comprehensive intervention for children with ASD in the 2â€“9-year age group (PASS Plus; PASSâ€‰+). The pilot RCT of PASSâ€‰+â€‰(The PASSâ€‰+â€‰study; 2014â€“2016; Grand Challenges Canada) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] demonstrated feasibility by meeting its recruitment target of 40 children in a rural setting; the intervention was delivered successfully with fidelity to 19 families randomised to intervention. Eighty-nine percent of intervention families partially or entirely completed the 12-session intervention. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a reduction in mean scores of autism symptom severity, though the confidence interval contained zero (adjusted mean difference [AMD] 2.42; 95% CIâ€‰âˆ’â€‰7.75, 2.92; ES 0.22); large treatment effects on proximal outcomes of proportion of parent synchronous responses (AMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18, 0.52; effect size ES 3.97) and proportion of child communication initiations with parent (AMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.03, 0.32; ES 1.02). Confidence intervals for effects on mutual shared attention (AMD 0.10; 95% CIâ€‰âˆ’â€‰0.07, 0.27; ES 0.5) and co-morbid symptoms (AMDâ€‰âˆ’â€‰9.0; 95% CIâ€‰âˆ’â€‰24.26, 6.26; ES 0.32) contained zero.</p>
                <p id="Par77">Both these projects have enabled the India team to capacity build in training and supervision of non-specialist health workers. Evaluation methods have also been adapted and tested in both of these pilot studies, including the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC), the primary outcome measure to be used in COMPASS. The project team in India will preserve competence in delivery, analysis and dissemination seamlessly into COMPASS, minimising the risk of loss of capacity.</p>

              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Current trial</title>
                <p id="Par78">The proposed Communication-centred Parent-mediated treatment for Autism Spectrum Disorder in South Asia (COMPASS) trial will build on this pilot work already carried out in India and will constitute the largest definitive trial of the intervention, involving 240 participants recruited through two government-run tertiary care super-speciality hospitals linked to medical schools in the capital city of New Delhi, which cater across all populations with a significant representation of the urban poor. The intervention will take work conducted in the two previous trials to the next step by delivering through existing health system frontline workers to ensure that the intervention is scalable through existing human resources. This trial will be conducted in the capital city of New Delhi, which has 11 districts. As well as clinical effectiveness, the cost-effectiveness of intervention will be investigated. Economic evaluations support decision-making where there is growing demand placed on the healthcare system but with limited budgets, by synthesising costs and health benefits to allow for an assessment of cost-effectiveness (value for money).</p>
                <p id="Par79">Two groups of frontline workersâ€”accredited social health activists (ASHA) and auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANM)â€”are deployed in the New Delhi National Urban Health Mission, through the primary urban health centres (PUHC). The PUHC covers a population of 50,000 residents, which is serviced by 3â€“4 ANMs and up to 25 ASHAs. The ASHA is a resident of the community and is a married woman between 25 and 45Â years old. She is a bridge between the local community and the health services overseeing a population of 2000. Her role includes supporting the organisation of urban health and nutrition days, motivating families for institutional deliveries and accompanying mothers to institutions during childbirth, conducting home visits during pregnancy and for the new-born over the first month of life, mobilising families to attend immunisation days, supporting them to introduce appropriate complementary feeds and encouraging the adoption of family planning methods and help for medical illnesses along with being the frontline worker for various vertical programs (e.g. supporting environmental hygiene around infectious diseases). She is supervised by the ANM who is the key frontline health worker at the PUHC. The ANM supports maternity care as her primary role. The COMPASS team will work with the State Health Mission to identify ASHA workers spread across a geographical area suitable to our recruitment centres, to deliver the COMPASS intervention. The formative phase of the trial, particularly the mapping of children referred from the recruitment site, allowed us to understand the distribution of high-density clusters of families. Simultaneously, we were able to determine that the time available to the ASHA worker for COMPASS work would be limited. To address the possible risk to the completion of the trial intervention cases in these areas, the trial steering committee in January 2019 supported the plan of using a mixed worker model. Since mapping of cases from the recruitment site has revealed that there are 9 districts (of 11 districts in New Delhi) which have a clustering of families, we will focus on identifying and recruiting ASHA workers from each of these districts. Simultaneously, we will identify ASHA like workers who will be project appointed workers but will share the same characteristics as the ASHA workers (e.g. age, education level and local residence). These collectively will be known as COMPASS counsellors and will be trained and supervised in the same manner. This mixed worker model will have COMPASS counsellors trained to deliver to trial families.</p>
                <p id="Par80">The trial will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention on symptoms of ASD and parentâ€“child interaction as well as more general impacts on child functioning, parental well-being and social empowerment. COMPASS will be the largest trial of its kind for ASD in any LMIC setting, and the evidence generated will have an impact not only on health policy and practice in India but also other low-resource settings in the region.</p>

The primary endpoint is at 9Â months from randomisation, with follow-up at 15Â months. The primary outcome is autism symptom severity, as measured by the blind-rated Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC). Secondary outcomes include parentâ€“child communication, child adaptation and quality of life and parental wellbeing.</p>

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par86">The trial will take place in a population representative of the urban disadvantaged, a fast-growing demographic who represent an under-researched and under-served population in India and in global health. Whilst an urban elite can access multi-disciplinary private care from community-based NGOs and private providers, the urban disadvantaged must rely entirely on busy government tertiary hospital paediatric services. The latter is our TAU and represents the â€˜best availableâ€™ care in the public sector; this is delivered from autism clinics in specialist child development centres, which provide a programme of eclectic behavioural therapy approaches. However, take up is patchy and often compromised by the need to travel to these specialist centres; adherence is under 50%. In short, this TAU is highly expensive and not scalable due to its complete reliance on tertiary hospital-based specialists. Systematic data on precise treatment uptake is lacking (it will be provided by the health economic aspect of this trial), but the aim of the experimental model is to remedy the deficiencies of care for this important demographic by providing a home-based individualised evidenced and quality service in an efficient step-down fashion, using novel digital support (described below).</p>

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is an autonomous institution of national importance. Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Lok Nayak Hospital (MAMC-LNH) is one of the oldest medical centres in India being established in 1930. Both centres are premier medical training institutes for undergraduate and postgraduate education. The Departments of Paediatrics in both hospitals have speciality child developmental clinicians, with a special interest in Autism; in MAMC-LNH, it is the Child Development Centre (CDC) which runs daily services, and at AIIMS, there is an autism clinic once a week within the Child Neurology Division. AIIMS alone had 400 new cases of autism registered in 2015â€“2016 of which 150 were from the Delhi region; similarly, MAMC-LNH had 90 new cases from the Delhi region in the same period. A 1-year study at AIIMS found a population-appropriate spread of ages at autism identification (15% agedâ€‰&lt;â€‰3Â years, 49% 3â€“6Â years, 7%â€‰&gt;â€‰7Â years).</p>

Along with this, they will reconfirm the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the trial and proceed to obtain informed consent with eligible families. They will seek permission to audio record the consent and read out the complete consent form. The consent will be recorded on paper, in audio form and on a REDCap application (described below). Following this audio consenting, signatures will be obtained on a paper consent form from the primary caregiver of the child during an in-person visit (either at a centre or at the participantâ€™s home).

                <p id="Par107">The trial will take place in a population representative of the urban disadvantaged, a fast-growing demographic who represent an under-researched and under-served population in India and in global health. Most families in this population access care in the public sector tertiary centres available at minimum cost across the city. The services in two of these centres are our TAU and represent the â€˜best availableâ€™ care in the public sector. The Department of Paediatrics, AIIMS, runs an autism clinic once a week. Child psychologists at the clinic provide ASD diagnosis and services based on applied behaviour analysis. In addition, parental counselling and training and medical treatment are provided for the management of comorbidities. The Child Development Centre (CDC) at MAMC-LNH is an assessment and treatment centre, which runs 6Â days a week. It caters to children with neurodevelopmental disabilities and behavioural and psychological problems. The CDC offers services like speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, special education, and clinical therapy along with medical management for comorbidities.</p>
                <p id="Par108">Systematic data on precise components of TAU and TAU uptake is currently lacking and will be collected and summarised using data collected to support cost-effectiveness analysis within the trial using a Cost of Illness Inventory (see Sect.Â 11). We will randomise approximately equal trial participants from the recruitment sites to minimise any bias due to differences in the TAU arms in the two sites.</p>
                <p id="Par109">With regard to the risk of contamination across trial arms, it is unlikely that families in the intervention arm will be close to other families in the TAU arm and unlikely that detailed intervention information would be shared between participants.</p>

Manualised video-feedback training is used with parents to aid social communication with their autistic child. The video-feedback method is evidenced from other work as a critical active ingredient in this form of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Additional co-morbidity â€˜Plusâ€™ (PASSâ€‰+) modules have been systematically developed as a series of therapeutic modules for the most common coexisting problems, which could be integrated efficiently into the core PASS social communication intervention and which could be delivered with the already proven core social communication intervention (PASS). It includes modules for sensory difficulties, feeding, toileting, sleep and behaviour problems as well as a module to support parent wellbeing (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Intervention procedure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7621_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

This will ensure that the intervention is scalable through existing human resources. The COMPASS team will work with the State Health Mission to identify ASHA workers spread across a geographical area suitable to our recruitment centres. We will simultaneously recruit ASHA like workers, from the same communities who will be trained and supervised along with the ASHA workers. We will use the same cascade training and supervision model as in the PASS and PASSâ€‰+â€‰trials but scaled up through a comprehensive digital platform.</p>

The PASSâ€‰+â€‰intervention is already utilising digital technology to deliver the intervention through video-feedback on tablet computers; the integration of other elements into the PRIDE digital platform will be a major output of the formative phase and a key innovation within this scale-up project. It will allow remote supervision, peer therapy support and targeted training over three separate 3-day periods, with subsequent practice learning and supervision. This platform will thus successfully transition PASS and PASSâ€‰+â€‰into a scalable m-health platform for delivery within existing health systems of an individualised intervention (which is the only kind that has shown success in this complex disorder).</p>

An adverse event will be considered serious when there is participantâ€™s or caregiverâ€™s death, a life-threatening injury requiring hospitalisation, prolongation of hospitalisation, significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or requirement of intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. We do not anticipate any SAEs to relate to the trial intervention. Participants can also withdraw from the intervention programme and/or the trial at any time without the need to give any reason. The research team will keep an updated log of all withdrawals with relevant dates and details of reason for withdrawal. Participants will not be replaced and all data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be used unless participants explicitly request removal of their data from the trial.</p>

                  <title>Pandemic-related modifications</title>
                  <p id="Par116">Changes have become necessary due to the unprecedented COVID-19 restrictions in India in general and Delhi in particular, during the course of the trialâ€”which made it impossible to deliver the planned face to face sessions, either in the participantâ€™s homes or in any other setting. Moreover, the future pattern of social life in the medium term is unclear in India as it is internationally. From June 2020, an online/remote option for delivery of the PASS Plus intervention has been initiated with practice cases. This is through videoconferencing technology or where this is not possible due to lack of internet availability or access to a smartphone, by telephone. The default mode of intervention delivery will still be face-to-face when possible, but (as with now many health interventions internationally) we need to develop the capacity for a blended model including online remote delivery when needed.</p>
                  <p id="Par117">Parents will be taught how to record and upload/send parentâ€“child interaction play videos in advance of the first remote session. Where necessary, an additional introductory session will be included to ensure parents are familiar with and comfortable using the required technology. These procedures have been developed during the recent virtual delivery of this intervention to nine practice families outside the trial. We have found that the process has been acceptable and feasible for parents and therapists for most sessions delivered. They have also given positive feedback on becoming more proficient with using the various digital applications because of the intervention. Regarding supervision, we have found that the transfer of knowledge of strategies appears to be taking place as well as it would have in a face-to-face session.</p>
                  <p id="Par118">Making these immediate changes will allow families to continue/commence the intervention, despite the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 lockdowns. Should this online delivery prove successful and acceptable and should the unfolding situation require it, we will then be able to consider future-proofing the trial over the medium and longer term to allow the trial to complete in the face of an uncertain situation. This would then have the further added value of future-proofing the intervention itself for work at scale in India, when it may well be (as internationally) that remote working becomes a standard option for healthcare delivery in the future.</p>

                <p id="Par122">The primary outcome is as follows: autism symptom severity assessed at 9Â months post randomisation using the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a blinded researcher symptom-coding from video-taped child-researcher interaction. BOSCC is an adaptation of the standard diagnostic symptom algorithm to (i) maximise sensitivity to symptom change in treatment studies, with codes combining symptom frequency and severity on a 12-item, 0â€“5 scale (total 0â€“60), and (ii) be delivered and coded by non-specialists, making it highly suitable for LMIC implementation. It shows good reliability, validity and evidence of sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Feasibility of such video-interaction coding in India was shown in the initial PASS pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and, in the PASSâ€‰+â€‰pilot, BOSCC was used with 100% success at baseline (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰40), and 35 participants successfully completed it at endpoint. In the PASSâ€‰+â€‰pilot, the instrument development team from the US trained master trainers from UK and India (Divan and Cardozo), who undertook an adaptation for the South Asia context (including simplified behavioural descriptions and visual aids). They then trained project-based RAs. Coding of the BOSCC within the trial was shared by two project RAs and a master coder based in the USA. The inter-rater reliability (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰16; comparing 2 trial RAs with the US master coder) gave an ICC of 0.80.</p>

                  <p id="Par143">Adequate precautions including routine sanitisation of assessment rooms and kits before and after assessments, providing sanitised office transportation to participants, regular temperature checks of all team members and visiting families, supporting COVID-19 tests and vaccination of team members and use of transparent masks during in-person assessments were taken to minimise exposure to COVID-19 for both participants and assessors.</p>
                  <p id="Par144">Adapting the evaluation plan allowed trial assessments to continue in a situation where home visits in the community were not possible. Telephonically contacting families reduced the chances of exposure to COVID-19. However, in situations where telephonic interviews were not possible and there was mutual agreement to undertake home visits, assessors visited participants in communities. This has particularly been possible in the second quarter of 2022 which has seen reduction in COVID cases in the NCT of Delhi. Furthermore, continuing evaluations also ensures maintenance of competency of the trained assessors.</p>

                  <p id="Par145">As per original trial protocol, endline assessments were to be conducted between 9 and 12Â months from randomisation. However, due to COVID-19-related lockdowns and restrictions, for a subset of participants who were affected by trial pause, an additional 4Â months will be added to this assessment window. Thus, for such participants, the endline assessments will be conducted between 13 and 16Â months from randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par146">For participants whose assessments will not be completed in the given time, an additional month was given; failing which, all such participants were classified as endline missed. These participants were then approached for follow-up assessments.</p>
                  <p id="Par147">Follow-up assessments for the trial families were scheduled at 15Â months from randomisation. However, similar to the impact of a trial pause on the endline, for a subset of participants, an additional 4Â months will be added which shifted the follow-up start point from 15 to 19Â months. Additionally, a minimum gap of 3Â months will be ensured between the completion of end line assessments and start of follow-up assessments.</p>

                  <title>Trial update as on March 2023</title>
                  <p id="Par148">The COMPASS trial completed randomisation of 261 participants on 16 December 2022. As of 31 March 2023, 157 (60%) endpoint assessments were completed and 30 participants (11.5%) were lost to follow-up. Also, 86 (33%) follow-up assessments (15Â months post randomisation) were completed by the end of March 2023.</p>
                  <p id="Par149">Adaptation to the assessment processes were made during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions (these are detailed the above section). It has taken relatively more time to complete the telephonic assessments compared to in-person contacts. Telephonic assessments take between 4 and 6 contacts with each participating family; every contact takes around 60Â min and an additional in-person contact for BOSCC, DCMA and START administration. In-person assessments are completed in 3 contacts, each ranging from 60 to 90Â min. In both cases, the number of contacts and the time duration can vary depending on the familyâ€™s need and availability. However, it is also important to note that the method of administration of the primary trial outcome, i.e. the BOSCC has remained same throughout the trial (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The UK PACT showed an endpoint ES of 0.64 on autism symptoms and 0.55 over 6Â years. The PASS trial did not measure autism symptom outcomes, but its effect on the intermediate dyadic interaction outcomes that mediated autism symptom change was equivalent to the PACT study. Given the possible challenges of implementation at scale in India using existing health system workers and health system-like workers, in COMPASS, we hypothesise a conservative target effect size of 0.45 for BOSCC symptoms (representing a clinically relevant 5-point change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We further assume a conservative intra-cluster correlation of 0.02 to account for variation in therapist quality and clustering amongst the 20 intervention therapists, each seeing on average 8 participants (TAU participants treated as clusters of size 1 with ICC 0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Given these assumptions, 96 successfully followed up in each group would give 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.45SD and 85% power for effect size of 0.37 SD (two-tailed significance level 0.05 and <italic>t</italic>-test assumed, using Stata â€˜clsampsiâ€™). Our pilot studies showed attrition rates leading to endpoint missingness of 3/65 (4.6%) in a semi-urban setting (PASS) and 6/40 (15%) in a rural setting (PASSâ€‰+).

Some of these visits will be organised at participant homes to minimise inconvenience to families. In recognition and appreciation of this time commitment, all families will receive a participation token of INR 500 on completion of eligibility assessments whether or not they are eligible for the trial. INR 1000 will be provided on completion of assessments at each assessment timepoint, i.e. baseline, endline and follow-up. This will be a total of INR 3500 for each participant across the course of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par172">On successful completion of the Vineland-3, an assessment feedback report compiled by the research team, detailing adaptive skills, will be provided to all trial participants at baseline and 15-month follow-up assessment time points. This report will also include the age equivalence of the different sub-domains of adaptive skills, viz, communication, daily living, socialisation and motor skills. Periodic newsletters and customised birthday cards will be also sent out all participants through the duration of the trial to promote engagement of participating families.</p>

Hence, information about participants who are non-contactable over telephone calls will be shared with respective recruitment sites so that they can contact the participants and check their willingness to continue participation in the trial. In the event that the recruitment sites are unable to get in touch with them, a visit to participantâ€™s household by a designated COMPASS evaluation team member/assessor will be planned in order to enquire about participantâ€™s willingness to continue and address any concerns that may have. This will be considered as the last attempt, following which, if the participant refuses, they will be considered as having withdrawn consent or, if still non-responsive, then lost to follow-up for relevant reasons.</p>

Additionally, we will follow the CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances (CONSERVE) statement for reporting the results of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Descriptive statistics of recruitment, drop-out and completeness of interventions will be provided.

Baseline characteristics will be presented by randomised group without formal statistical tests.</p>
                <p id="Par176">We will test the primary hypothesis for between-group difference in the primary outcome (BOSCC) using generalised linear mixed models allowing for clustering by participants and therapists with fixed effects including baseline outcome measure, centre, age-group stratifier, treatment assignment, time (treated as a categorical variable) and time * treatment interaction. We will explore potential moderating effects by baseline severity, co-morbidities, home environment and parental education including interactions between the moderator and randomisation. Marginal treatment effects will be estimated for outcomes at each time point and reported separately as adjusted mean differences in scores between the randomised groups with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values.

                <p id="Par179">For the mediation analysis, if the efficacy analysis shows significant between group differences in the mediator (DCMA), then we will use parametric regression models to test for mediation of the intervention on BOSCC outcomes through DCMA. Since all the measures are continuous, the indirect effects are calculated by multiplying relevant pathways and bootstrapping is used to produce valid standard errors for the indirect effects. Mediation analyses are potentially biased by measurement error in mediators and hidden confounding between mediators and outcomes; we will build on our previous methodological and applied work in this context to include repeated measurement of mediators and outcomes to account for classical measurement error and baseline confounding.</p>

                <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                <p id="Par180">The cost-effectiveness analysis aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to TAU. TAU reflects the comparator arm of the trial and is an appropriate comparator as it reflects standard practice in the local setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The cost-effectiveness analysis will use a societal perspective, with a 15-month time horizon. Costs will be estimated from COII at baseline and 9- and 15-month follow-up. The costs of providing the intervention will be derived from a detailed process evaluation, to estimate the costs of training, delivery and supervision and take account of barriers experienced during the trial such as attrition of the front-line workers and variable periods taken to attain competency. Costs of scale up of this intervention (if found effective) will also be estimated by use of appropriate level of remuneration for staff involved in the intervention. The analysis will use the adapted CHU- 9D Index and associated utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the child. Costs and outcomes will not be discounted due to the trial time horizon and timing of follow-up assessments.</p>
                <p id="Par181">Regression analysis, adjusted for key covariates, will estimate the net costs and QALYs of the intervention. The estimates of net costs and QALYs from the regression analyses will be bootstrapped to simulate 10,000 pairs of incremental cost and QALY outcomes of the COMPASS intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This will include the following: (i) plotting the distribution of pairs of net costs and QALYs on a cost-effectiveness plane, to assess parameter uncertainty, (ii) generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to estimate whether the additional cost of a QALY gained by the COMPASS intervention is acceptable to decision makers; (iii) estimate the probability that the COMPASS intervention is cost-effective compared to TAU (iv) estimate a net benefit statistic. Sensitivity analyses will explore the interventionâ€™s cost-effectiveness using alternative measures of child health benefit, parental health benefit, the perspective of funders of health, education and social support services. Whilst 1 to 3â€‰Ã—â€‰GDP per capita has commonly been used as the cost-effectiveness threshold within studies in India, this has been noted to be high. More recent evidence estimated the cost-effectiveness threshold on the basis of health expenditures per capita and life expectancy at birth (resulting in estimates of $487 ($249â€“$618) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Missing data will be accounted for in the analyses of net costs, net QALYs and cost-effectiveness acceptability. The methods used to deal with missing follow-up data will be determined according to the extent and pattern of missing data (e.g. multiple imputation, missing indicator or propensity score methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

In 2019, Mr. Shamika Ravi, a health economist working in New Delhi, was invited to join the TSC. In 2020, the TSC was expanded to include the director, Department of Health and Family Welfare and State Nodal Officer (Delhi State Health Mission), and paediatrician Dr. Monica Rana, whilst in 2022, the international triallist Prof. Alan Stein, child and adolescent psychiatrist from the University of Oxford, was invited to the committee. The TSC has been consulted on the design, protocol, techniques for ascertainment and measurement. The TSC meets at least once prior to the commencement of the trial and at least annually thereafter.</p>

Summary results will be shared with participants through newsletters at the end of the trial. Information about key learnings from the trial will be also shared with caregivers of children with ASD through collaborative sessions organised at the two trial recruitment centres, other non-governmental organisation, parent advocates and community health workers. Dissemination will be done through workshops and conferences at the national and international level to share key learnings and strategies to take the intervention to scale. Also, modelling of costs and benefits of scaling up will be shared if the trial is found to be effective.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par194">This trial builds upon existing research evidence generated both in the UK and South Asia and addresses a key gap within evidence-based and scalable care pathways for autistic children and their families. It is the first trial conducted internationally which aims to provide a robust and well-powered evaluation of an intervention programme for autistic children and their families delivered by non-specialist health workers. If shown to be clinically and cost-effective, this programme will fill an important gap within current care pathways within low-resource contexts. The trial includes blind-rated distal and proximal outcomes assessing communicative and social development, as well as secondary outcomes relating to child functioning and caregiver and child wellbeing. Health economic analysis will provide important information about the costs and benefits of the PASS-Plus programme over and above standard care, as well as presenting a picture of standard care within New Delhi. The trial has run through the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020â€“2022 when significant social distancing restrictions were in place within India. Modifications were applied in response, which have allowed the trial to continue during much of this period; these have included adjustments to timelines and remote delivery of the intervention and research assessments, as necessary.</p>
