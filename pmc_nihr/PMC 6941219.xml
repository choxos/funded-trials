                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this open-label, investigator-initiated, randomised phase 2 trial following a selection (or pick-the-winner) design, we recruited participants from 17 UK hospitals. Men aged 18 years or older with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with one or two taxane chemotherapy regimens and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less had tumour biopsies tested with targeted sequencing. Patients with DDR gene aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated minimisation method, with balancing for circulating tumour cell count at screening, to receive 400 mg or 300 mg olaparib twice daily, given continuously in 4-week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to dose allocation. The primary endpoint of confirmed response was defined as a composite of all patients presenting with any of the following outcomes: radiological objective response (as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1), a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 50% or more (PSA50) from baseline, or conversion of circulating tumour cell count (from ≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline to &lt;5 cells per 7·5 mL blood). A confirmed response in a consecutive assessment after at least 4 weeks was required for each component. The primary analysis was done in the evaluable population. If at least 19 (43%) of 44 evaluable patients in a dose cohort responded, then the dose cohort would be considered successful. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib. This trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01682772" id="interrefs20">NCT01682772</ext-link>.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>711 patients consented for targeted screening between April 1, 2015, and Aug 30, 2018. 161 patients had DDR gene aberrations, 98 of whom were randomly assigned and treated (49 patients for each olaparib dose), with 92 evaluable for the primary endpoint (46 patients for each olaparib dose). Median follow-up was 24·8 months (IQR 16·7–35·9). Confirmed composite response was achieved in 25 (54·3%; 95% CI 39·0–69·1) of 46 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort, and 18 (39·1%; 25·1–54·6) of 46 evaluable patients in the 300 mg cohort. Radiological response was achieved in eight (24·2%; 11·1–42·3) of 33 evaluable patients in the 400 mg cohort and six (16·2%; 6·2–32·0) of 37 in the 300 mg cohort; PSA50 response was achieved in 17 (37·0%; 23·2–52·5) of 46 and 13 (30·2%; 17·2–46·1) of 43; and circulating tumour cell count conversion was achieved in 15 (53·6%; 33·9–72·5) of 28 and 13 (48·1%; 28·7–68·1) of 27. The most common grade 3–4 adverse event in both cohorts was anaemia (15 [31%] of 49 patients in the 300 mg cohort and 18 [37%] of 49 in the 400 mg cohort). 19 serious adverse reactions were reported in 13 patients. One death possibly related to treatment (myocardial infarction) occurred after 11 days of treatment in the 300 mg cohort.</p>

                <p id="para30">Trials for advanced prostate cancer have rarely pursued molecular stratification, and none of the drugs approved to date for metastatic prostate cancer care have a validated companion biomarker. Before starting this study, several genomic landscape studies were published describing an enrichment for aberrations in DNA repair genes in metastatic prostate cancers (studies identified in PubMed, searching for “prostate cancer”, “genomics”, and “biopsy”, between Jan 1, 2010 and Nov 1, 2015, with no language restrictions). Preclinical and clinical studies identified in PubMed (searching for “cancer”, “PARP”, and “BRCA” or “DNA repair” between Jan 1, 2005 and July 1, 2019, with no language restrictions) have established a correlation between different DNA repair defects and sensitivity to PARP inhibition in different tumour types, leading to drug approvals in ovarian and breast cancer. In the TOPARP-A trial, we identified an association between somatic alterations in DNA repair genes and antitumour activity of olaparib in 49 patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Other clinical trials of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer were identified on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs30">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> website, searching for “prostate cancer” and “PARP” for studies published from database inception to July 1, 2019, without language restriction.</p>

                <p id="para50">To our knowledge, TOPARP-B is the first prospective clinical trial in a genomically defined population of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. TOPARP-B aimed to clinically qualify a predictive biomarker for treating metastatic prostate cancer. TOPARP-B also assessed different doses of olaparib, and correlated different genomic aberrations and antitumour activity. This study has confirmed the antitumour activity of olaparib against metastatic prostate cancer with defective DNA repair secondary to either germline or somatic gene inactivation.</p>

              <p id="para80">Molecular stratification for treatment is not currently the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancers despite evidence of substantial interpatient genomic heterogeneity. Most therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancers target androgen receptor signalling; taxane-based chemotherapies and radiopharmaceuticals are also approved.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Although these drugs have improved outcomes in the past decade, metastatic prostate cancer remains invariably fatal and new therapeutic strategies involving molecular stratification are urgently needed. Genomic studies of metastatic prostate cancer have identified a number of potentially actionable recurrent genomic aberrations,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> including loss-of-function alterations in DNA repair genes in 20–25% of cases, such as defects in homologous recombination-mediated repair genes.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Among these, germline or somatic alterations in <italic>BRCA2</italic> are the most common, accounting for 6–12% of cases across studies.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These data underpin the evaluation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p id="para90">Olaparib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the catalytic activity of PARP1 and PARP2, which have key roles in DNA damage response (DDR). Olaparib is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian and breast cancers associated with germline <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> It is also approved as a maintenance therapy after response to platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, indicating benefit from PARP inhibition beyond tumours with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, olaparib has antitumour activity in vitro and in vivo in models that are defective in other DDR proteins, including PALB2, ATM, FANCD2, RAD51, and RAD54, among others, although the magnitude of preclinical sensitisation varies between proteins, with <italic>BRCA2</italic> loss being arguably the most potent sensitising event.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p id="para100">To evaluate the antitumour activity of olaparib against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we designed TOPARP, an adaptive programme of serial phase 2 clinical trials aimed at identifying predictive biomarkers for response to PARP inhibition in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para110">TOPARP-B is a multicentre, open-label, investigator-initiated, randomised phase 2 trial. Patients were recruited from 17 UK hospitals (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para120">Patients with prostate cancer that had developed metastasis and castration resistance were first registered on the trial for molecular preselection by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of primary or metastatic prostate cancer biopsies. Eligible patients were men aged 18 years or older, with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (metastatic and castration-resistant), and whose tumours had a putatively pathogenic mutation or homozygous deletion in a DDR gene that could be associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibition as identified by NGS. Patients were required to have previously received at least one but no more than two taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, regardless of prior exposure to novel hormonal drugs. Other inclusion criteria included: documented prostate cancer progression at trial entry, defined by either rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration (according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>) or radiologically (according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> or by bone scan as per PCWG2 criteria); a castrate testosterone concentration of less than 50 ng/dL; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less; and adequate organ function (including haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL after a protocol amendment on March 15, 2018 [previously ≥10 g/dL], platelets ≥100 × 10<sup>9</sup> per L, serum creatinine ≤1·5 times the institutional upper limit of normal, and albumin &gt;25 g/L). Patients previously treated with PARP inhibitors, platinum, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone were not eligible, nor were patients with known symptomatic brain metastasis or untreated spinal cord compressions. The baseline count for circulating tumour cells (CellSearch system; Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Castel Maggiore, Italy) had to be five cells per 7·5 mL blood or higher except in patients with radiologically measurable target lesions of 2 cm or more in diameter on the baseline CT scan and a PSA concentration of 2 ng/mL or higher on screening. The full eligibility criteria are in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 3–4)</xref>. The complete study protocol is available in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para130">The study was approved by the London–Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 11/LO/2019), and co-sponsored by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), London, UK. The trial was done in accordance with the principles of good clinical practice and overseen by independent data monitoring and trial steering committees. A trial management group was responsible for the day-to-day running of the trial. The Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at ICR (ICR-CTSU) had overall responsibility for trial coordination, monitoring, and analysis. Patients provided written informed consent before enrolment, both for the NGS prescreening and treatment stages.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para140">Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive olaparib at 300 mg (approved dose for the tablet formulation in ovarian and breast cancer<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>) or 400 mg twice a day. Randomisation was done centrally by the ICR-CTSU via telephone. The allocation sequence was generated centrally by a computer-generated minimisation algorithm derived by the ICR-CTSU, with circulating tumour cell count at screening (≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood <italic>vs</italic> &lt;5 cells per 7·5 mL blood) as a balancing factor. ICR-CTSU staff involved in the randomisation were not involved in the clinical running of the trial or data collection. Neither participants nor clinicians were masked to dose allocation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">The targeted NGS of tumour samples was done at the Cancer Biomarkers Laboratory at ICR. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks with a DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Samples that passed quality control testing with an FFPE QC Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) were used for library preparation with a customised panel (GeneRead DNAseq Mix-n-Match Panel V2; Qiagen) covering 113 genes; libraries were read with a MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina). Further details on the sample processing, quality control, bioinformatics pipelines, and panel design are available in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 5–7)</xref>.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Patients previously known to have germline aberrations were eligible only on confirmatory tumour testing by NGS.</p>
                <p id="para160">All patients received oral olaparib (300 mg or 400 mg, tablet formulation) twice daily continuously in 4-week cycles until evidence of radiographic progression (based on RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue disease, or the appearance of ≥2 lesions on bone scan), unacceptable toxicity according to investigator review, or patient decision to discontinue. Discontinuation because of clinical progression was the decision of the treating physician; discontinuation based solely on rising PSA in the absence of radiographic or clinical progression was discouraged. Patients treated with 300 mg twice daily were offered the option of dose escalation to 400 mg twice daily on confirmation of radiographic progression, providing the escalation was considered to be clinically indicated by the treating physician and the patient had not previously required a dose reduction for management of toxicity.</p>
                <p id="para170">Clinical assessments, including reviews of adverse events (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4.02) and ECOG performance status, physical examination, and routine blood tests (haematology and biochemistry), took place 2 weeks after the start of treatment, and then at the start of every new 4-week cycle. Radiological assessments (CT and bone scans) were done every 12 weeks. Local radiological response assessments were used for the primary endpoint definition; all RECIST 1.1 responses were confirmed by central review by radiologists at ICR (AC and NT). Circulating tumour cell counts were measured every cycle for the first 12 weeks, and thereafter every 12 weeks. Circulating tumour cell counts were centrally analysed at the Cancer Biomarkers Laboratory at ICR (by PF, BE, and GF) and results were not made available to the treating physician. PSA serum measurements were collected every cycle if available, and every 12 weeks at a minimum. Blood samples for correlative biomarker studies were taken every 4 weeks. Repeated tumour biopsies were optional, and pursued when feasible at baseline, after 1–4 weeks on therapy, and at the time of progression. Guidance on drug interruptions or dose reductions for CTCAE grade 3–4 haematological and non-haematological toxicities were implemented as outlined in the protocol. Up to 42 days of temporary interruption of treatment was allowed prior to mandating permanent discontinuation.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para180">The primary endpoint was confirmed response, defined as a composite of any of the following outcomes: radiological objective response (as assessed by RECIST 1.1 [modified with PCWG2 recommendations], a decrease in PSA of 50% or more (PSA50) from baseline, and conversion of circulating tumour cell count (from ≥5 cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline to &lt;5 cells per 7·5 mL blood<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>). To be judged a response confirmation in a second consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks later was required.</p>
                <p id="para190">Secondary endpoints were: radiographic progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to first evidence of radiographic progression (according to RECIST 1.1 or bone scan as per PCWG2 criteria) or death; time to radiographic progression, defined as the time from randomisation to first evidence of radiographic progression; progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to radiographic progression, unequivocal clinical progression, or death; overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause; time to PSA progression, defined as a confirmed increase of 25% or more and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more in PSA from the nadir (PCWG2); duration of PSA response, defined as the time from the first documented PSA decrease of 50% or greater to PSA progression; best percentage change in PSA from baseline while on treatment; percentage change in PSA from baseline at 12 weeks (or earlier if therapy was discontinued); proportion of patients with circulating tumour cell count conversion; and the safety and tolerability profile of olaparib.</p>
                <p id="para200">A prespecified exploratory endpoint was response in patients in whom dose was escalated to 400 mg twice daily after progression on 300 mg twice daily. A pharmacokinetics sub-study was planned but because of patients declining recruitment it was closed prematurely with no analyses pursued.</p>

              <sec id="cesec70">
                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para210">This trial followed a selection (or pick-the-winner) design.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Each dose cohort was assessed independently for the primary endpoint. The sample size needed to show the minimum desired antitumour activity was determined on the basis of A'Hern's one-stage design, with a response of 30% or less for the null hypothesis, and a response of more than 50% for the alternative hypothesis (one-sided α level of 0·05 and a β level of 0·15). Following the A'Hern design, if at least 19 (43%) of 44 evaluable patients in a dose cohort responded, then the dose cohort would be considered successful. If the 400 mg twice daily dose cohort was deemed successful, the DDR biomarker identified in TOPARP-A, in which all patients received 400 mg twice daily, would be considered validated as being predictive of response. In the event of both dose cohorts being successful, the pick-the-winner selection strategy would include consideration of secondary endpoints. No formal interim analyses were planned.</p>
                <p id="para220">For the primary endpoint, the evaluable population was defined as all randomly assigned patients who met all of the eligibility criteria and commenced trial treatment, unless they discontinued treatment prior to 12 weeks for reasons that were not related to the study drug or disease. Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomly assigned patients) and per protocol population (all evaluable patients who received at least one cycle of olaparib and had no eligibility violations). A post-hoc sensitivity analysis in patients with a circulating tumour cell count of five or more cells per 7·5 mL blood at baseline was done for comparison with TOPARP-A results. All other efficacy analyses were done in the ITT population. Toxicity was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib, and the worst grades of adverse events that occurred during treatment for each dose cohort are reported. Serious adverse events and deaths observed within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment were summarised by dose cohort, as well as the exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation, dose modification or interruption, and treatment delay.</p>
                <p id="para230">Analysis of the primary endpoint was triggered when all patients had completed at least 6 months of treatment (in the absence of prior discontinuation). Evaluable patients who discontinued treatment prior to 12 weeks due to progression or toxicity and had no follow-up assessments for the primary endpoint were considered non-responders. Response is presented along with exact two-sided 95% CIs. Percentage changes from baseline in PSA concentration and the sum of target lesions (RECIST 1.1) are represented in waterfall plots. Time-to-event endpoints are summarised by Kaplan-Meier curves, and median times estimated with 95% CIs. For radiographic progression-free survival and progression-free survival, patients alive and without progression were censored at the last scheduled disease assessment during the study. For time to radiographic progression, patients who did not progress radiologically were censored at the last scheduled disease assessment during the study or date of death, whichever occurred first. Patients alive at the end of follow-up were censored for the analysis of overall survival. Landmark analyses were used to explore the association between circulating tumour cell conversion at 8 weeks and 12 weeks with radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Additionally, exploratory subgroup analyses according to different genes of interest were preplanned for the efficacy endpoints. Five non-mutually exclusive subgroups were predefined: patients with alterations in <italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2, ATM, CDK12, PALB2</italic>, and any other gene related to DDR or associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Patients who had more than one DDR gene aberration were included in the analysis of all relevant subgroups.</p>
                <p id="para240">The trial was not powered for head-to-head direct comparisons of the two dose cohorts, and so tests to compare them were considered hypothesis-generating (ie, χ<sup>2</sup> test to compare the proportion of patients with a response and log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier curves). Statistical analyses were done with Stata software (version 15), on a snapshot of the data taken on July 5, 2019.

              <p id="para270">Between April 1, 2015 and Aug 30, 2018, 711 patients consented to NGS prescreening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). For 30 (4%) patients, no samples were made available for testing. From 681 patients with at least one sample available, 779 tumour samples were analysed (637 [82%] primary tumour samples and 142 [18%] post-castration-resistance metastatic biopsies). For 89 (13%) patients, biomarker determination was not possible because of the sample or the sequencing data not fulfilling quality control parameters.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(A) Trial profile and (B) DDR gene alterations in the intention-to-treat population (n=98)</p><p>DDR=DNA damage response.

              <p id="para280">Of the 592 patients with evaluable tissue samples, 161 (27%) had DDR gene aberrations on the basis of NGS.

              <p id="para290">98 patients with DDR gene aberrations were randomly assigned and treated in the two dose cohorts (49 patients in each cohort). At the time of the data snapshot, two patients remained on olaparib treatment. A greater number of participants were recruited than originally planned, at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee, to account for six participants (three in each cohort) who were deemed not evaluable (ineligible post-randomisation) for the primary endpoint analyses.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para420">The TOPARP-B trial has confirmed the antitumour activity of olaparib against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with specific DDR gene aberrations. The number of composite responses observed in the cohort of patients who received 400 mg tablets of olaparib twice daily met the predefined criteria for success, validating the DDR biomarker identified in TOPARP-A as being predictive of response.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Overall, the data suggest that both drug dose and the specific type of DDR gene aberration might influence antitumour activity, given that the composite response at the 300 mg regimen was lower and did not reach the predefined criteria for success. The antitumour activity observed varied considerably for different DDR gene aberrations, with the greatest antitumour activity seen in the subgroup with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> alterations.</p>
              <p id="para430">Despite randomisation, <italic>CDK12</italic> aberrations were imbalanced between the cohorts, with an enrichment in the 300 mg cohort. This imbalance might explain, at least in part, the inferior composite response in the 300 mg cohort.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The rationale to explore the two doses originated from prior clinical observations indicating a dose–response relationship for olaparib between 100 mg and 400 mg at twice daily dosing, although 400 mg has been associated with enhanced toxicity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In keeping with this finding, 37% patients at 400 mg had to reduce their dose to 300 mg, most commonly because of anaemia. All of these data would need to be considered when assessing the optimal dose of olaparib for prostate cancer treatment.</p>
              <p id="para440">Our results support the implementation of routine genomic testing of metastatic prostate cancer, to detect DNA repair defects for targeting by PARP inhibition. In a previous study, we reported an enrichment of germline inherited mutations in DDR genes in metastatic prostate cancer,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> which has led to the recommendation of broad germline NGS testing in all men with metastatic prostate cancer per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The antitumour activity of olaparib indicated in this trial, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with both germline and somatic aberrations of <italic>BRCA2</italic>, now supports the implementation of NGS testing of tumour samples.</p>
              <p id="para450">Antitumour activity was also observed in other DDR gene aberration subgroups. Responses in tumours with <italic>PALB2</italic> mutations were frequent, although the low prevalence of these mutations means that further data are required to confirm these findings. Clinical qualification of low-prevalence biomarkers is challenging in the pursuit of precision medicine approaches; the validation of genomic signatures<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> or functional biomarkers<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> that identify tumours with defective homologous-recombination, regardless of the mutated gene of origin, could help move the field forward, but such assays have not yet been validated in prostate cancer.</p>
              <p id="para460">Conversely, germline and somatic <italic>ATM</italic> aberrations are common in metastatic prostate cancer; <italic>ATM</italic> functions as a cell cycle checkpoint, preventing cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage rather than directly mediating repair, unlike <italic>BRCA2</italic> and <italic>PALB2</italic>. In the TOPARP-A trial, five patients had <italic>ATM</italic> aberrations in tumour biopsies: two of these had a PSA response, and two more had circulating tumour cell conversion. Preliminary results suggest that rucaparib, another PARP inhibitor, results in few PSA decreases in patients with <italic>ATM</italic> aberrations.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In TOPARP-B, we treated 21 patients with suspected deleterious <italic>ATM</italic> aberrations: two achieved a RECIST or PSA response, and several others had circulating tumour cell count conversions following therapy. Circulating tumour cell count decreases seen in this subgroup were associated with increased duration on the trial, tumour shrinkage per RECIST, and a PSA decrease, as was the case for the overall TOPARP-B population, with circulating tumour cell conversions robustly associating with increased radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Overall, the data suggest that the antitumour activity of olaparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with <italic>ATM</italic> loss is less than that for <italic>BRCA</italic>-altered tumours; nevertheless, a subset of patients with <italic>ATM</italic>-altered metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer appear to derive benefit. However, detection of <italic>ATM</italic> alterations alone might be insufficient to identify these sensitive tumours. Further studies, as well as the study of rational drug combinations, are now needed to elucidate how to best evaluate and treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with <italic>ATM</italic> alterations. Ongoing exploratory analyses from this trial will look to further characterise exceptional responses within each gene-defined subgroup to optimise patient stratification.</p>
              <p id="para470">We do acknowledge limitations to this study. Although the use of targeted NGS facilitates the clinical implementation of patient stratification, this method might be insufficient to capture complex aberrations resulting in PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, because all patients in our study had DDR gene aberrations and received olaparib, we are not able to fully differentiate the predictive value versus the prognostic effect of the gene aberrations in terms of survival. Randomised trials including patients with and without the biomarkers will be more able to clinically qualify putative predictive biomarkers.</p>
              <p id="para480">Nonetheless, the results from TOPARP-B have overall driven the design and conduct of several registration trials of PARP inhibitors in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02987543" id="interrefs60">NCT02987543</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02975934" id="interrefs70">NCT02975934</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03148795" id="interrefs80">NCT03148795</ext-link>), which are likely to guide the clinical use of PARP inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer in the future. Most of these studies aim to validate PARP inhibition as a precision medicine strategy for prostate cancers with DDR gene aberrations. Other studies, in parallel, are exploring the addition of PARP inhibitors to the standard-of-care drugs targeting the androgen receptor (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03732820" id="interrefs90">NCT03732820</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03395197" id="interrefs100">NCT03395197</ext-link>), on the basis of results from a phase 2 clinical trial indicating that a broader target population than just patients with gene aberrations might benefit from these drugs.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">In conclusion, the data from TOPARP-B have confirmed the antitumour activity of olaparib against metastatic prostate cancer with particular DDR gene aberrations. The high response observed in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with germline or somatic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> aberrations, and the durability of many of these responses, support the use of olaparib in this subpopulation. The antitumour activity observed against tumours with <italic>ATM, PALB2, FANCA</italic>, or <italic>CHEK2</italic> aberrations suggest that PARP inhibitors might have a role as single drug therapies or in rational combinations against these other subtypes of metastatic prostate cancer, although further data are needed to precisely assess the clinical relevance of each of these different DDR gene aberrations in prostate cancer.</p>
