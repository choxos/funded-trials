                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Willingness to pay (WTP) is used to generate information about value.
However, when comparing 2 or more services using standard WTP techniques,
the amounts elicited from participants for the services are often similar,
even when individuals state a clear preference for one service over another.
An incremental approach has been suggested, in which individuals are asked
to first rank interventions and provide a WTP value for their lowest-ranked
intervention followed by then asking how much more they are willing to pay
for their next preferred choice and so on. To date, evaluation of this
approach has disregarded protest responses, which may give information on
consistency between stated and implicit rankings.</p>

                  <p>A representative sample of the English population (<italic>n</italic> = 790)
were asked to value 5 dental services adopting a societal perspective, using
a payment vehicle of additional household taxation per year. The sample was
randomized to either the standard or the incremental approach. Performance
for both methods is assessed on discrimination between values for
interventions and consistency between implicit and stated ranks. The data
analysis is the first to retain protest responses when considering
consistency between ranks.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Estimating monetary values for health services using contingent valuation (CV) can be a
useful tool in estimating the benefits a service can provide to the population
questioned. It is often a necessity to aid decision making when market values cannot be
observed, as is frequently the case with publicly financed health care.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> A stated preference technique frequently used in this context, willingness to pay
(WTP), elicits the maximum value participants are willing to pay for specific goods or
services. However, eliciting WTP-based preferences for multiple health services
competing for limited public funds can be contentious.</p>
            <p>When WTP is used to elicit values from members of the public for such competing services,
the results often contain inconsistencies known as preference reversals, meaning the
rank generated from a simple ordering of interventions (stated or explicit rank) and
that generated from elicited WTP values (implicit rank) often do not match.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> It is difficult to determine the
cause of this inconsistency, but it has been linked to confusion regarding the exercise
or anchoring on the assumed cost of similar services.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, these preference reversals could be an indicator that participants are
not giving an accurate representation of value, presenting a more fundamental problem
for current WTP methodology.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Furthermore, WTP exercises often generate nondiscriminatory values (i.e., participants
state values with little or no significant difference across services). Depending on the
nature of the research and anticipated use of results, this can also be problematic. It
is possible that nondiscriminatory values represent true indifference. Alternatively,
when options are disparate and it is not unreasonable to anticipate a preference and
therefore distinction between values, nondiscriminatory values may indicate participants
have not fully engaged with the exercise and may be relying on a behavioral heuristic
such as yea-saying.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Results that contain both preference reversals and nondiscriminatory values may
indicate the WTP exercise has produced results that may not accurately represent
(differences in) value.</p>
            <p>An adaptation to the elicitation of WTP was proposed in 2002 to resolve these issues. The
“incremental” approach to WTP (originally coined the “marginal” approach) suggested
placing an exogenous framework on respondents based on their explicit rank that would
eliminate preference reversals and increase discrimination between values.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This approach asks respondents to provide a value for their least preferred
option and then asks how much <italic>more</italic> they would pay to attain their next
preferred option. This methodology means each value must be as much as or more than the
value given before it and therefore eliminates inconsistencies between ranks. Economic
theory indicates that by asking how much <italic>more</italic> individuals are willing
to pay for each subsequently preferred option, the respondent is encouraged to carefully
consider how much additional utility each option provides, forcing individuals to
estimate their consumer surplus at each stage, thus encouraging differentiation between
options and providing an accurate representation of value.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As respondents are free to give a zero value, meaning an increase in value is not
enforced but, provided it is considered a true zero, would indicate the next preference
is worth nothing additional.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the standard approach usually starts by asking participants to state the
order of their preference, followed by asking them to state how much they are willing to
pay for each option independently. Previous studies have found the incremental approach
to be superior to the standard approach as the former eliminated inconsistencies and
increased discrimination between values.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Yet, the methodology used in the
aforementioned studies discarded protest responses when considering preference
reversals. A zero value is considered a protest response if the justification is not
related to the intervention itself but an objection to the elicitation process. Provided
the participant elicits at least one positive value within the exercise, a zero response
in this context is unlikely to be a function of the elicitation system but rather
relates to the intervention in question, as an objection to the elicitation system would
manifest as protest responses to all interventions. By removing zeros thought to be
protests but elicited among other positive values, previous studies have, therefore,
eliminated the possibility of identifying inconsistencies in the incremental approach as
the framework dictates the value must be the same as, or more than, the previous value
in the elicitation process. This analysis considers the role of protest responses and
investigates whether they contribute to explicit and implicit rank inconsistencies.</p>
            <p>The incremental approach remains relatively unused, as the evidence available with
respect to its validity and reliability has been limited since the initial proposal.
This article contributes to the body of evidence regarding the incremental approach and
presents evidence of its performance relative to the standard approach. The analysis
presented evaluates both approaches with respect to preference reversals and
discriminatory power in resource allocation for dentistry, a setting that has not yet
been explored. The evidence used in this article is from the Resource Allocation in
National Health Service (NHS) Dentistry: Recognition of societal Preferences (RAINDROP)
study. This study applies priority setting techniques to generate a multicriteria
decision making tool—including preferences from the public—to optimize allocation of
resources to oral health services in a publicly funded, resource-constrained system. The
full protocol for this research can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The preference elicitation element of the study establishes monetary values from
people residing in England and aggregates them into a societal value for dental
interventions. The interventions presented are dental services either currently provided
or that have the potential to be provided as part of NHS England dental services or
through public health initiatives provided under the umbrella of Public Health England.
Previous research using the incremental approach has compared scenarios considered close
substitutes, with the most recent evidence examining public preferences for different
service providers of a single type of care (emergency and out-of-hours services).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The study described in this article is set in the context of oral health problems
faced by the population in England. Preferences are elicited for a broad range of
treatments where there is arguably a more complicated tradeoff, with interventions
targeting different societal groups.</p>

              <p>In line with the objectives of the RAINDROP study, a questionnaire was designed to
collect WTP values for dental interventions. This was administered by an independent
survey company, Qa Research (York, England). Ethical approval was gained from
Newcastle University Ethical approval was gained from Newcastle University Ethics

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Researchers approached households in 50 small local clusters across England, with
a maximum of 1 individual recruited in each household. A quota target list was
used to ensure recruitment of different demographic groups. Potential
participants were given information about the study and gave consent to be
interviewed, with a £10 incentive offered. Data collection was undertaken in
face-to-face interviews at the interviewee’s home with the interviewer using a
computer-assisted interface. Randomization was undertaken at an individual level
during the interview as part of the computer-assisted interface to either an
incremental or a standard approach using software-based randomization. The
algorithm for randomization is built into the survey software used by Qa
Research.</p>

                <title>Questionnaire Design</title>
                <p>The questionnaire was developed with the aid of a focus group recruited from a
Patient and Public Involvement group at Newcastle University to ensure that the
questionnaire was understandable and engaging for members of the general public.
The questionnaire was then piloted with a small sample of the general public
(recruited in the same way as for the main data collection), and small changes
to the wording were made.</p>
                <p>The questionnaire included 3 distinct sections: the initial section gathered
information regarding the participant’s demographics and socioeconomic status.
The second section introduced participants to the interventions and collected
explicit ranks and WTP values. The third section asked for information on
participants’ incomes, their experience of dental interventions, and frequency
of dental visits, all of which are hypothesized to affect their maximum

                  <p>Respondents were presented with a long-form explanation of each intervention
and were asked if they understood each description. For those who did not, a
flash card with a succinct version of the key information was presented.
These were accessible for each participant throughout the exercise. The
order in which the interventions were presented to respondents was
randomized to control for ordering and anchoring effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> After
respondents had read descriptions for all interventions, they were asked to
rank interventions from their most preferred to their least preferred. This
will be referred to as their explicit rank and represents an ordinal ranking
of alternatives. For this part of the exercise, equal ranking of options was
not possible, thereby replicating difficult resource allocation decisions
where options are mutually exclusive and the budget is finite.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

                  <title>Value elicitation</title>
                  <p>Before eliciting monetary values, interviewers read a “cheap talk script” to
respondents based on Mahieu et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> This reinforces the hypothetical nature of the exercise and attempts
to reduce hypothetical bias by informing the respondents of behavior that is
common in contingent valuation settings but not necessarily replicated in
real-life situations. The statement was also included to encourage
participants to express the value they hold for the intervention, instead of
focusing on cost, and to minimize gaming from respondents.</p>
                  <p>The payment vehicle of extra taxation for the household was chosen for a
multitude of reasons. First, most English residents who see a dentist
receive their dental care from the NHS.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The NHS is funded through taxation, but in dentistry, there is also a
copayment for most users. Second, the interventions discussed are provided
at a national level and therefore may not have a direct impact on the
household. Taxation encourages an individual value for a service provided at
a societal level. Third, the service would be continual, provided year on
year for the foreseeable future. Finally, additional taxation fits the wider
scope of the project as the RAINDROP study addresses how to best allocate
resources within NHS dentistry while taking into account societal
preferences. Those who do not pay tax were asked to give an estimation of
the maximum amount they would be prepared to voluntarily contribute each year.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
                  <p>Participants were randomized into 2 groups for the value elicitation portion
of the exercise, each using a different approach to WTP: standard or
incremental. As described previously, the standard approach asks for an
absolute, stand-alone maximum value from respondents for each intervention.
To ensure the greatest degree of comparability between the 2 approaches,
values for the standard approach were collected from the respondent’s least
to most preferred option. The incremental approach is a sequential valuation
exercise whereby values are elicited by asking participants the maximum they
are willing to pay for their least preferred option, then how much more they
are willing to pay for their next preferred option. The value of the
intervention is therefore partially dependent on the value elicited directly
before it, generating an exogenous framework determined by the explicit rank
where each subsequent value is equal to or more than the value that came
before. For both approaches, a ranking is inferred from the monetary values
given for the interventions, with the highest valued intervention
corresponding to the most preferred option and the lowest valued option
corresponding to the least preferred option. This rank is referred to as the
implicit rank.</p>
                  <p>To elicit the values, respondents were presented with a series of randomized
payment cards on their computer interface to avoid anchoring.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The values range from £1 to £200 in various increments and were
informed by discussions with the focus group. Respondents had to sort the
payment cards into 3 categories: “yes—willing to pay,”“no—not willing to
pay,” or “not sure.” Values that were sorted in the “not sure” category were
presented again once all other values for that intervention had been sorted,
to check if the respondent wished to move any “not sure” cards into “yes” or
“no” categories. As the list of payment cards was not exhaustive,
respondents were asked after the sorting exercise if they were able to give
an exact estimate of the maximum they would be willing to pay using an
open-ended question. This gave participants an opportunity to reassess or
confirm their valuation. If an exact estimate was not given but there was a
response to the payment card portion, a midpoint between the last
“yes—willing to pay” and first “no—not willing to pay” was used.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Respondents were able to give a zero response at any point during the
exercise.</p>

                  <title>Zero values</title>
                  <p>When a zero value was given, the respondent was prompted to justify their
answer. This justification is used to determine if the response was a true
zero or protest response, where a true zero is thought to be an accurate
representation of value. The zero justification section used in the
questionnaire is largely based on sections developed by Dixon and Shackley<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and Ryan et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which used set-text responses and included an open-ended option. Free
speech responses to the zero value classification question were transcribed
by the interviewer issuing the questionnaire. These were reviewed
independently by 2 members of the research team for classification into
protest or true zero, with disagreements resolved by discussion.</p>

                  <p>To generate evidence regarding preference reversals, responses are sorted
into 3 categories: consistent, partially consistent, and inconsistent. These
are defined as follows:</p>
                  <list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0272989X21996329">
                    <list-item>
                      <p>Fully consistent—where the implicit and explicit rank correspond
exactly</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                      <p>Partially consistent—where the deviations between the implicit and
explicit rank are due to equal values. For example, if the fifth and
fourth preferences both receive the lowest value, but the values
increase for the third, second, and first preferences, this is a
partially consistent response.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                      <p>Inconsistent (preference reversal)—where the implicit and explicit
ranks are directly contradictory and the deviation is not due to
equal values. For example, if the third preference is valued lower
than the fourth preference.</p>
                    </list-item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Although partially consistent responses are possible in the incremental
approach, the framework placed on respondent valuations for the incremental
approach in conjunction with the elimination of protest responses means that
preference reversals are impossible. However, for the purposes of this
article, it is assumed that, after giving some positive values, a respondent
in the incremental approach group then registers a protest response, and
this is evidence of an inconsistency between implicit and explicit ranks and
thus a preference reversal. This article therefore presents new evidence
regarding preference reversals in the incremental approach by retaining all
protest responses for the analysis of respondent consistency.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study is the first to find preference reversals in the incremental approach.
However, the proportion of participants eliciting an inconsistent response in the
incremental approach is 11%, compared to 72% in the standard approach. The presence
of preference reversals is only problematic insofar as it is believed that there
should be complete correspondence between the explicit and implicit rank. This rests
on the assumption that the individual responding to the questionnaire is valuing the
same attributes in both ranking exercises, yet it is not uncommon to observe
individuals providing different values for the same service dependent on perspective
in the context of health.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> It is therefore possible that, when asked to explicitly rank, individuals
place the interventions in order of what they would personally prefer to be funded
(i.e., what would have the largest impact on themselves), while the valuation
exercise, in asking for additional taxation payments, may encourage a wider
perspective. This fluid perspective can be seen in the wider willingness to pay
literature. Evidence from the EuroWill study noted that the explicit ranking task
and the valuation exercise are fundamentally different.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The explicit rank is an ordinal rank resting on a direct comparison of
competing programs, while the valuation exercise that generates the implicit rank
changes the frame of reference and asks people what amount they would be willing to
sacrifice from their personal income to have the program offered in the public
domain. It is therefore important to consider the nature of the 2 ranking exercises
and the changing frame of reference when discussing inconsistences in willingness to
pay exercises, particularly regarding the implications of inconsistences on
validity.</p>
              <p>It is also possible that respondents are revising their initial rank, or only arrive
at their final rank, as the exercise progresses. The standard approach gives an easy
avenue to revisit and revise rank, as values can be assigned freely. The respondents
in the incremental approach are somewhat anchored to their initial response as the
framework dictates the value must be as much as, or more than, the preceding value,
which could be problematic if ranking preferences across disparate bundles is
difficult. However, a previous willingness-to-pay exercise has explored the
discrepancy between explicit and implicit rank with the respondents, with the
majority (75%) of respondents identifying that their explicit ranks should be used
to inform priorities in a health service.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> If this holds for other priority setting in health exercises, the incremental
approach may in fact enable respondents to perform more rationally; the framework
may displace heuristics like anchoring on price and allow respondents to more
accurately reflect their underlying preferences.</p>
              <p>The inconsistent behavior of those who give 1 or more protest responses suggests the
unobserved underlying objection may be a result of an amalgamation of factors not
strictly associated with the elicitation process, arguably indicating that
participants are only willing to support some interventions funded by the specified
payment vehicle. These patterns of protest responses indicate participants opt in
and out of the exercise dependent on the intervention and surrounding context, as
opposed to the exercise itself. The current methodology in determining whether a
zero is true or protest is therefore limited, and using traditional methods to
determine the true intent behind a zero value is insufficient to decipher a response
that is a protest to the elicitation system compared with other, more-specific
objections regarding the interventions and payment vehicle. This is shown by the
inconsistent protest behavior in our sample. Using the traditional approaches limits
insight into the nature of the protest and potentially limits the representativeness
of the sample.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The values associated with the interventions offer little discrimination at the whole
sample level for either approach, and both suffer from significant clustering at the
median, which could suggest a true lack of differentiation in strength of preference
or a lack of sensitivity in both approaches. When considering a true lack of
differentiation, this may be due to the disparate nature of alternatives and the
resulting spread of preference among options. In previous studies regarding the
incremental approach, there has been a clear consensus rank between options, which
potentially has contributed toward discrimination between interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As there is no common rank, and the incremental approach depends on rank to
provide a valuation framework, it is unsurprising the values associated with the
interventions elicited using incremental approach do not offer increased
discrimination.</p>
              <p>The values associated with rank are strongly discriminatory for the incremental
approach. This indicates face validity as it corresponds to the underlying economic
theory and provides evidence of the ability of the incremental approach to
extrapolate value, which theoretically accurately represents the participant’s
consumer surplus. The standard approach provides increasing values from the fourth
preference onward, but the intervals are smaller. Assuming participants are not
overstating their maximum WTP, this indicates the incremental approach is superior
in capturing the additional value of the next preferred option.</p>
              <p>The top-ranked intervention in the standard approach, supervised tooth brushing,
receives the lowest median value in the standard approach. The incremental approach
remains consistent with theory and produces a result that corresponds with the
explicit rank. Previous studies and the WTP literature identify the most likely
explanation for the discrepancy in the standard approach is that participants will
anchor on perceptions of cost.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Participants are likely aware of the costs associated with brushing their own
teeth, with the only other additional cost described by the scenario being a nurse
to train teachers. This may be thought of as a “cheap” intervention and, as such,
may receive a lower value. Fluoride varnish, another intervention that may be
perceived of as low cost as it requires few additional resources, receives a
similarly low value. These results identify a potential limitation of the cheap talk
script as it may have been ineffectual when attempting to eliminate bias from
results. However, it is also important to consider these interventions in the wider
context of the questionnaire. These services are the only two that would be provided
through public health initiatives, which may affect the valuation. These services
are also the only ones to specifically target deprived communities, and there may be
an element of altruistic signaling.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0272989X21996329" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A participant can be seen as supporting the notion of helping those who are
disadvantaged by giving the service a high rank but may be reluctant to support it
financially—either generally through paying additional tax or more specifically
through the services suggested, as indicated by the protest responses.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The evidence in this article identifies that the incremental approach to WTP is
superior to the standard approach yet cannot conclude that the incremental approach
is fully consistent with theory. Further research should be conducted into the issue
of protest responses within the incremental approach and how they should be
considered in the context of preference reversals. In the interim, those seeking to
elicit values for multiple interventions should consider using the incremental
approach, particularly in a policy content. The behavior displayed by respondents
using protest responses has wider implications for the definition, use, and analysis
of zero responses in WTP questionnaires.</p>
