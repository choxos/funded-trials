                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Loneliness and social isolation have been identified as significant public health concerns, but improving relationships and increasing social participation may improve health outcomes and quality of life. The aim of the Project About Loneliness and Social networks (PALS) study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a guided social network intervention within a community setting among individuals experiencing loneliness and isolation and to understand implementation of Generating Engagement in Network Involvement (Genie) in the context of different organisations.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The PALS trial will be a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial comparing participants receiving the Genie intervention to a wait-list control group. Eligible participants will be recruited from organisations working within a community setting: any adult identified as socially isolated or at-risk of loneliness and living in the community will be eligible. Genie will be delivered by trained facilitators recruited from community organisations. The primary outcome will be the difference in the SF-12 Mental Health composite scale score at 6-month follow-up between the intervention and control group using a mixed effects model (accounting for clustering within facilitators and organisation). Secondary outcomes will be loneliness, social isolation, well-being, physical health and engagement with new activities. The economic evaluation will use a cost-utility approach, and adopt a public sector perspective to include health-related resource use and costs incurred by other public services. Exploratory analysis will use a societal perspective, and explore broader measures of benefit (capability well-being). A qualitative process evaluation will explore organisational and environmental arrangements, as well as stakeholder and participant experiences of the study to understand the factors likely to influence future sustainability, implementation and scalability of using a social network intervention within this context.</p>

              <p>Social isolation is considered to be an objective lack of social connections, contact or participation, while loneliness is a subjective psychological state where there is a discrepancy between desired and perceived levels of support or connectedness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The prevalence rates of loneliness and isolation vary;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> however, it is estimated to affect about 30% of the adult population in the UK.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Specific at-risk groups, such as the elderly, minority communities and those with long-term mental or physical health conditions are significantly more isolated than those in good health.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 6</xref> The Office of National Statistics (ONS) recently identified three profiles of individuals who are ‘at-risk’; these suggest that different factors may be important in the experience of loneliness at different points across the life course.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>

                <p>The impact of loneliness and isolation on well-being and the associated health risks have been identified as a significant public health concern<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> exacerbated by the prevalence of long-term conditions and advancing age.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Both loneliness and social isolation are associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> reduced quality of life<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> and is linked to poorer physiological outcomes such as raised blood pressure and increased health-risk behaviours (eg, sedentary behaviour).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Their impact on mortality is estimated to exceed that of traditional risk factors such as obesity and cigarette smoking, with a 50% higher risk compared with socially integrated participants.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> There are also significant costs associated with raised demand and use of health services, and loneliness is associated with increased general practitioner (GP) appointments, emergency hospital admittance and premature social care use.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref></p>

                <p>Although the determinants of loneliness and isolation are varied, social and emotional support from others is likely to be protective,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> with emerging evidence suggesting that improving the quality of interpersonal relationships and participation in social activities may be key to tackling the impact of loneliness.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Evidence has indicated that increasing social interactions and the number of people who can be relied on is associated with reduced levels of distress,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> while connecting with community resources can help protect against loneliness for those who are most at risk.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 25</xref> Furthermore, there is evidence that social network interventions can significantly improve health outcomes, quality of life and increase the take-up of new activities.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> A diverse and supportive network has been shown to reduce health service costs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A recent The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) quality standard recommends the navigation of older vulnerable people to community activities as a means of preventing loneliness in this group.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

                <title>Rationale and risk benefits for the current trial</title>
                <p>In line with this evidence, there is a logical argument for introducing an effective social network intervention outside of formal healthcare settings to connect people who are experiencing loneliness to others within their communities.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Creative engagement with non-traditional informal providers of wellness management (such as through accessing locally available community groups) offers an alternative opportunity to address health and social needs. We envisage that the study will offset any burden through providing wider benefit to organisations; first through staff development and training integrating the intervention into practice, and, second, by providing a resource and alternative referral pathway for individuals who they have identified at risk of isolation or loneliness (potentially extending beyond the life of the study). A series of nestled qualitative process studies will examine the context, practices and processes relating to implementing the intervention within the community context, and an economic evaluation to assess whether this is cost-effective.</p>

                <p>We will conduct a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial comparing participants receiving the facilitated social network Genie intervention to a wait-list control group; randomisation will be at individual and/or cluster (facilitator) level (see Randomisation section). We will work closely with community partners two localities (centred around Southampton and Liverpool) in identifying participants and delivering the intervention, as well as informing our understanding of the challenges and environmental factors associated with implementation.

                  <title>Identification</title>
                  <p>We will use a multistranded recruitment strategy to reflect the diversity of individuals who are living with loneliness or in isolation. This will be facilitated by collaborating community organisations to ensure that we are able to identify and access those most at-risk. Potential participants will be identified in the manner that best operates within existing working practices for each organisation (which will be different for each organisation/collaborator). This is necessary to explore the integration and scalability of Genie in local and organisational settings. Potential participants will be invited by the organisation; this may be by letter or during routine visits, appointments, or in line with the usual working practices of the partner organisation. This may include (but is not limited to) new referrals, waiting lists or opportunistic contacts during routine work of partner organisation. All eligible participants will be given a research pack including an invitation letter, participant information sheet and freepost reply slip to return should they wish to take part in the trial.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>To overcome potential issues of contamination (where a facilitator could become familiar with how GENIE works and thus find out about local activities and advise control group participants), facilitators will be 1:1 randomised to either the intervention or control arm. Randomisation will be stratified by organisation in blocks of two (ie, one facilitator will be randomised to the intervention arm and one to the control arm) and carried out by the trial statistician (SE) using the statistical software R v3.5.1. In some organisations, the risk of contamination does not exist (eg, where the only contact between a facilitator and participants would be by delivering the intervention). In these cases, some efficiency is gained by randomising the participants individually (block randomised 1:1 to intervention and control, again stratifying by organisation). The summary below details the different scenarios.

                <p>If there are organisational or setting constraints which prohibit facilitator or participant randomisation (eg, the facilitator works within a specified geographic location) we will assess whether there is ongoing contact between the facilitator and potential participants.

                <p>The sample size calculation is based on the primary analysis of the comparison of intervention and control arms on SF-12 Mental Health composite scale (MCS) score at 6 months,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and accounts for possible intracluster correlation (ICC) within facilitators. The MCS compares an individual score with an age group mean score; a negative score reflects poorer health. Previous studies (although in different populations) have suggested that differences of 3 and 4.7 points on the SF-12 would be clinically meaningful.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> We have based the current sample size on being able to detect a difference of 4 points. Based on a previous study in socially isolated older people,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> we estimate the SD of the outcome to be 10.4 (using a pooled estimate of baseline scores). Choosing 80% power and a type I error rate of 5%, an individually randomised study would require 216 people (108 per arm). Regarding clustering, previous studies have generally shown low ICCs for mental health scores from SF-12 and SF-36 (0.032 and below, although for different populations and clustering within GP practices)<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref>; we use an ICC of 0.05 here. Based on discussions with participating organisations, it was agreed that 12 participants per facilitator was suitable; this results in a design effect of 1.55 and an adjusted sample size of 335 people. Assuming 15% drop-out,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> we require 394 participants in total (197 per arm). This requires 33 facilitators; we will increase this to 36 facilitators to account for potential drop-out of facilitators.</p>

                <p>At 3 and 6 months after enrolment in to the study, patients will be invited to complete follow-up assessments. They may do this independently or with the assistance of the facilitator or a research team member (which may include online, on paper or over the phone). All follow-up assessments will be recorded no earlier than 2 weeks before the follow-up date and no later than 6 weeks after the follow-up date.</p>

                <p>All analyses will emphasise estimation and CIs over hypothesis testing, and will be conducted as intention-to-treat. Missing data will be assumed to be missing at random, unless accounting for more than 10% of the sample; if missingness is above this rate, approaches for dealing with missing data (eg, multiple imputation) will be discussed within the research team. Missingness will be reported for each arm and summaries of baseline characteristics of those lost to follow-up and those not will be used to judge potential sources of bias.</p>
                <p>Baseline sociodemographic data will be summarised within randomised arms using appropriate descriptive measures; likewise, all outcome measures will be summarised by arm at each timepoint. We will produce a forest plot of estimated effects for each outcome within each organisation to explore any variability in the impact of the intervention.</p>
                <p>The primary analysis will involve a mixed-effects model (pending the model meeting the associated assumptions) comparing groups on SF-12 at 6 months. The model will include a random intercept for facilitator and organisation, with participants clustered within facilitators clustered within organisation (hence a three-level model) and control for baseline SF-12. This analysis will be complemented by an analysis using the same framework but with SF-12 as the outcome and a random coefficient for time, where repeated measurements are clustered within participants (hence a four-level model).</p>
                <p>Non-response bias (ie, where a particular group of participants are unavailable or refuse to participate) will be reduced by taking steps to increase the initial response rate and reduce drop-out over the course of the study.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis will be a cost-utility analysis from a public sector perspective, with a primary outcome of cost/QALY at 6 months. Health-related quality of life will be collected via SF-12 at baseline, 3 and 6 months, with utilities being derived by application of the SF-6D scoring algorithm.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> In addition, scored values from the capability well-being measure (ICECAP-A)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 51</xref> will enable a secondary cost-utility analysis.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The use of ICECAP–A is planned to explore non-health attributes (specifically capabilities) that might be important to this population, thus allowing for a broader measurement of well-being than might be captured by SF-6D. While the comparative data collected on both measures may inform future studies in similar populations, it will also provide decision-makers with richer information than would be obtained by a single generic Health realted Quality of Life (HRQoL) measure.</p>
                <p>Intervention delivery resource use will be recorded on proformas designed to capture cost categories (eg, trainer time, pay scale, intervention setting and facilitator travel costs). Additionally, at baseline, 3 and 6 months resource use will be collected directly from participants using a questionnaire designed to capture healthcare, social service and other public sector service use, as well as participant service use (ie, participant and carer costs). An exploratory analysis will use a societal perspective providing decision-makers with evidence to inform judgements on what, in the broadest sense, is optimal for society.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The analysis of costs from a societal perspective will therefore provide detail on the cost-shifts within sectors (eg, health compared with social care). All analyses will follow practice guidelines,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53–55</xref> including those related to public health and/or complex interventions specifically.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56–58</xref> Cost-utility analysis will also allow for the construction of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to assess whether the intervention is cost-effective at a range of payer thresholds.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Subgroup analysis will be carried out in order to inform policy-makers’ decision-making with respect to the targeting of the intervention. Such subgroup analyses (for instance, looking at intervention effects in different groups) will be planned prospectively, and quantitative analysis —foreseeably including mixed-effects modelling to account for the clustered nature of the data<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> —will be set out as part of the statistical and health economic analysis plan. The economic evaluation will also be informed by the process evaluation in terms of considering how the contexts of this complex intervention relate to resource use and cost areas.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Such an explanatory focus will be taken throughout the study, with a view to interpreting study results and assessing study generalisability.</p>

                <title>Qualitative process evaluation and analysis</title>
                <p>The qualitative process evaluation will combine complementary components to seek to provide an in-depth understanding of the factors that facilitate individual, environmental and organisational factors that inhibit or promote the engagement, workability, integration, sustainability and scalability of a social network intervention for addressing loneliness in open settings. The process evaluation will consider the preimplementation contexts and processes, as well as observing use of the intervention in practice to understand the dynamics of implementation (including how the facilitation and other elements work) to consider implications for scale-up and sustainability for the participating organisations. Concepts from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> will be used to guide the identification of factors promoting or inhibiting the routine incorporation and <bold>e</bold>mbeddedness of a facilitated social network intervention. The non-adoption, abandonment and challenges to the scale-up, spread and sustainability framework will inform the evaluation of implementation because it has been designed to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health programme, addressing concerns such as implementation, scale-up and sustainability.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> An ethnographic approach making use of observations, interviews and documentary analysis will be used to capture the preimplementation processes in order to explore the workability and integration of Genie in different community organisations. Following this, interviews will take place to explore engagement, sustainability and scalability. Participants will be sampled purposively based on description of circumstances of loneliness and sociodemographic factors (age, gender and locality); we will explore the experiences and meaning of loneliness with reference to social and personal circumstances (eg, living and working arrangements) and situational contexts of loneliness (such as migration, separation and unemployment). This will be combined with exploration of how individual circumstances shape engagement with different elements of the intervention, how change is enacted and embedded into people’s everyday lives and how this involves other members of a person’s network. We will describe the engagement and activities undertaken following the intervention including how links with new networks and resources are identified and made (navigation); how these are integrated (negotiation) and how new connections improve capacity to enact healthy behaviours, improve well-being or reduce isolation (collective efficacy). We will explore how facilitators felt about delivering Genie and how this might be adopted by their organisations as part of their practice. We will draw out new improvements and benefits specific to individual circumstances and existing use of healthcare services. Further interviews postintervention will be conducted until ‘saturation’ (ie, no significant new insights emerge).</p>
