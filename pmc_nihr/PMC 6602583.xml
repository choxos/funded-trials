            <p id="p0010">Development of new therapies and vaccines to combat viral respiratory tract infections is slow, partly because of the limited understanding of innate immune responses at the respiratory mucosal site of disease. Detailed characterization of such responses might facilitate biomarker definition for respiratory diseases and provide novel mechanistic insights and a platform for the testing of novel therapeutics. Recently, noninvasive serial nasosorption of mucosal lining fluid has been used to study immune responses to experimental live human rhinovirus.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> However, human viral infection models require specialized centers and resources, with some studies requiring quarantine of volunteers.</p>
            <p id="p0015"><italic>In vivo</italic> animal models of innate immune stimulation are useful alternatives; for example, mammalian models of airway mucosal polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]) challenge (a viral double-stranded RNA mimetic) are well established and demonstrate the ability of these agents to induce proinflammatory cytokines by respiratory cells.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Many noninfectious models of innate antiviral immunity have used resiquimod (R848; a Toll-like receptor [TLR] 7/8 agonist, single-stranded RNA mimetic), which is closely related to imiquimod. R848 causes different vaccine-specific immune responses in minipigs when administered intradermally or intranasally, while intranasal R848 had adjuvant activity in macaques.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Studies using these models in mice, chimpanzees, and ferrets have provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of immunity to and pathogenesis of viral respiratory tract infections. However, they are not always practical to use, and they do not always accurately mimic human infection responses. Furthermore, the extent to which these models predict human vaccine efficacy is often unclear.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
            <p id="p0020">The zebrafish <italic>(Danio rerio)</italic> is an attractive alternative vertebrate species, especially because of similarities with the human innate and adaptive immune system. Recently, we have used zebrafish gills to assess respiratory inflammation, and our results suggest zebrafish are a relevant model to study mechanisms of respiratory mucosal innate immune responses.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Therefore, we developed parallel live zebrafish, mouse, and human challenge models to study the effects of viral RNA mimic TLR agonists with relevance to respiratory viral infection. These comparative studies allow assessment of cytokine responses at comparable and accessible sites of the respiratory mucosa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <italic>A-C</italic>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Kinetic profile of mucosal proinflammatory cytokine responses after zebrafish gill, mouse, and human nasal stimulation with R848. <bold>A-C,</bold> Schematics showing mucosal administration of TLR agonists and sampling of mucosal tissue/fluids to assess responses. <bold>D, G, J, M,</bold> and <bold>P,</bold> qRT-PCR analysis of zebrafish gills (n = 5, representative of 3 experiments).

            <p id="p0025">Human nasal samples were collected serially by means of nasosorption (using a synthetic absorptive matrix [SAM]) after saline and TLR agonist nasal challenge of 9 volunteers (see <xref rid="tblE1" ref-type="table">Table E1</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0010">www.jacionline.org</ext-link> for baseline characteristics of participants and <xref rid="tblE2" ref-type="table">Table E2</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0015">www.jacionline.org</ext-link> for nasal and systemic observations and clinical symptoms after R848 administration). The mouse nasal cavity is inaccessible for repetitive sampling, and therefore we developed a mucosal tissue sampling technique <italic>ex vivo</italic> by applying an absorption approach similar to that used for human subjects.</p>
            <p id="p0030">Zebrafish whole gill tissue was harvested at several similar time points after R848 challenge. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows how remarkably similar cytokine responses were across the 3 species, especially between zebrafish and human subjects (see <xref rid="figE1" ref-type="fig">Fig E1</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0020">www.jacionline.org</ext-link> for detailed responses of individual human subjects). An early response was observed for TNF-α, whereas IFN-γ levels increased later. These results suggest that R848 can be administered to human subjects as a noninfectious virus-type challenge of the innate immune system, whereas complementary studies in mice and zebrafish could allow mechanistic insight.</p>
            <p id="p0035">When poly(I:C) was applied, neither the fish gill nor human nose responded (see <xref rid="figE2" ref-type="fig">Fig E2</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0025">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). In contrast, the mouse nasal mucosal response to poly(I:C) was characterized by an early increase in <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, and <italic>Ifna2</italic> transcript levels and a later increase in <italic>Ifng</italic> transcript levels. Overall, the R848 and poly(I:C) challenges demonstrated both matching and discrepant innate antiviral responses in the different models.</p>
            <p id="p0040">To further refine the use of zebrafish gills as a model to study viral mimetics, we also established a noninvasive sampling technique using SAM to allow for repetitive sampling and thereby longitudinal studies of individual fish, which also contributes to the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) through refinement and reduction of animal procedures. <italic>Tnfa</italic>, <italic>il1b</italic>, <italic>ifnphi1</italic>, and <italic>ifng1.1</italic> transcripts were successfully detected by using this method and significantly increased in gills stimulated by R848 (see <xref rid="figE3" ref-type="fig">Fig E3</xref>, <italic>A-D</italic>, in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0030">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). Making use of transgenic zebrafish with labeled immune cells, we examined both neutrophil <italic>(Tg[lyz:GFP])</italic> and lymphocyte <italic>(Tg[lck:eGFP])</italic> distribution within the gill tissue and found a significant early transient increase in neutrophil counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), followed by an increase in lymphocyte counts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic>) in the lamella after R848 stimulation. Such cells, but not vascular epithelial cells, were also harvested by using SAM (see <xref rid="figE3" ref-type="fig">Fig E3</xref>, <italic>E-I</italic>). These data highlight the number of useful features of the zebrafish respiratory mucosal model that permit investigation of mechanistic immune pathways for assessing topical drug effects, viral infections, and vaccine adjuvant activity.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>R848 induces lymphocyte migration in zebrafish gills. <bold>A</bold> and <bold>C,</bold> Maximum z-stack projections of <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>lyz:GFP</italic>; neutrophils; Fig 2, <italic>A</italic>) and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>lck:GFP</italic>; lymphocytes; Fig 2, <italic>C</italic>) gills after treatment with water or R848 for 3 (Fig 2, <italic>A</italic>) and 8 (Fig 2, <italic>C</italic>) hours (n = 7). <italic>Scale bars</italic> = 100 μm. <bold>B</bold> and <bold>D,</bold> Average number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the first 20 lamellae of each filament.

            <p id="p0045">Animal models are central to our understanding of innate antiviral immunity. However, translation of these studies to human disease can be limited. This can result in the need for primate models of disease that are ethically, financially, and logistically challenging. Here we establish parallel methods for administration of TLR ligands directly onto the respiratory mucosa in 3 species, with measurement of local inflammation using simple and reproducible sampling methods. Development of a human nasal mucosal model is of special interest because the nose is the portal for viral respiratory tract infections that cause widespread winter morbidity and mortality, and there are advantages in studying a complex multicellular mucosal system directly in human subjects.</p>
            <p id="p0050">Using these approaches, we demonstrate remarkably analogous interferon and inflammatory cytokine production after R848 stimulation in the human and mouse nasal mucosa and zebrafish gill tissue, which was evident despite the functional inactivity of mouse TLR8.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> By contrast, human subjects and zebrafish did not respond to poly(I:C), demonstrating that this common mouse model of viral innate immune activation might have limited translation to the human mucosal response to double-stranded RNA viruses.</p>
            <p id="p0055">This study demonstrates that respiratory challenge with R848 might offer a novel mucosal model of antiviral immunity in human subjects. This human challenge model might be particularly suited to understanding differences in innate antiviral responses in patients with allergic and respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in which viral infections are major exacerbation triggers. As such, mechanistic studies using poly(I:C) challenge of mice might lack direct translation to human subjects. Instead, the R848 model can confidently be extended to mice and zebrafish, in which the analogous response to R848 allows more detailed mechanistic insights, relatable to those seen in human subjects.

Healthy participants were enlisted from a database of previous volunteers, as well as recruitment through newspaper advertisements. Subjects were aged between 18 and 60 years and were current nonsmokers with a history of less than 5 pack years. Participants had no history of asthma, respiratory illness, or any other major systemic disease and were required to be off nasal, inhaled, and systemic steroids. Participants with allergic rhinitis were permitted. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers before enrollment.</p>

On the day of the challenge visit, nasal mucosal lining fluid was sampled at baseline by using nasosorption (Nasosorption FX-i; Hunt Developments, Midhurst, United Kingdom) for a duration of 1 minute before and after nasal lavage, as described previously.<xref rid="bibE1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E1</sup></xref> After nasal challenge, nasosorption was performed at 30 minutes and then at hourly intervals for up to 8 hours in all subjects. Clinical parameters of nasal obstruction were assessed by using Total Nasal Symptom Scores and peak nasal inspiratory flow, as described elsewhere.<xref rid="bibE2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E2</sup></xref></p>

Saline and TLR agonists were administered by using a Bidose nasal delivery device (Thermo Fisher, Epsom, United Kingdom), which emits 100 μL per actuation. Poly(I:C) has been previously tolerated in another study at doses of up to 800 μg per nostril over a 24-hour period, with no adverse events reported.<xref rid="bibE3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E3</sup></xref> Therefore poly(I:C) was administered at a dose of 500 μg per nostril in five 100-μL installments by using the Bidose over a 1-hour period.
