                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We applied principles for conducting economic evaluations of factorial trials to a trial-based economic evaluation of a cluster-randomized 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin, omega-3 fish oil, and an action-planning leaflet, alone and in combination, from a UK National Health Service perspective.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The Atorvastatin in Factorial With Omega EE90 Risk Reduction in Diabetes (AFORRD) Trial randomized 800 patients with type 2 diabetes to atorvastatin, omega-3, or their respective placebos and randomized general practices to receive a leaflet-based action-planning intervention designed to improve compliance or standard care. The trial was conducted at 59 UK general practices. Sixteen-week outcomes for each trial participant were extrapolated for 70 years using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model v2.01. We analyzed the trial as a 2 × 2 factorial trial (ignoring interactions between action-planning leaflet and medication), as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial (considering all interactions), and ignoring all interactions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We observed several qualitative interactions for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that changed treatment rankings. However, different approaches to analyzing the factorial design did not change the conclusions. There was a ≥99% chance that atorvastatin is cost-effective and omega-3 is not, at a £20 000/QALY threshold.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Atorvastatin monotherapy was the most cost-effective combination of the 3 trial interventions at a £20 000/QALY threshold. Omega-3 fish oil was not cost-effective, while there was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about action planning. Recently-developed methods for analyzing factorial trials and combining parameter and sampling uncertainty were extended to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves within a 2x2x2 factorial design with model-based extrapolation.</p>

              <p id="p0050">Factorial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compare different combinations of ≥2 treatments.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> These enable ≥2 independent treatments to be evaluated efficiently and allow estimation of interactions between treatments (ie, how much the effect of 1 treatment changes when another treatment is also given). Economic evaluation of factorial trials, however, raises several challenges owing to the inappropriateness of transforming the data and the challenges of regression analysis on health economic data.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Analytical methods are further complicated by more complex factorial designs (eg, those evaluating 3 treatments simultaneously) and the need to extrapolate results beyond the end of the trial; we are not aware of any previous studies that have explored methods for conducting economic evaluations on factorial trials with these features.</p>
              <p id="p0055">Type 2 diabetes is characterized by polypharmacy: in addition to requiring medications to improve glycemic control, guidelines recommend that medication is used to control blood pressure and that both diabetic patients &gt;40 years and younger high-risk groups receive statins to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Atorvastatin is recommended in preference to other statins due to its potency and cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although there is extensive evidence demonstrating that statins are highly effective and cost-effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and preventing cardiovascular events,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> there was limited evidence in diabetic patients typical of those managed in primary care at the time the trial was funded.</p>
              <p id="p0060">Omega-3 is not currently recommended<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>; however, there is evidence that it significantly reduces triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and may raise LDL-C.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Trials in nondiabetic populations have found that it does not significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Many patients do not adhere to diabetes medications,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> which reduces the effectiveness of treatment and increases healthcare costs through increased hospitalizations.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Interventions affecting compliance or the likelihood of clinical events may have nonadditive effects on costs and life expectancy.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We are not, however, aware of any previous studies exploring interactions between statins, omega-3, and interventions to improve compliance in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
              <p id="p0065">This study aimed to apply the principles for conducting economic evaluations of factorial trials to a cluster-randomized 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial and to explore the extent to which the results are sensitive to the assumptions made about whether treatments have additive effects. We used the atorvastatin in factorial with omega EE90 risk reduction in diabetes (AFORRD) RCT<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> to conduct a trial-based economic evaluation assessing the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin, omega-3 fish oil, and an action-planning leaflet, alone and in combination, in patients with type 2 diabetes from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We also calculated the expected value of perfect information (EVPI).</p>

              <p id="p0070">AFORRD (ISRCTN 76737502) comprised a double-blind RCT conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes and no known cardiovascular events who were managed in UK primary care and were not thought to require immediate lipid-lowering treatment.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The trial used 3 interventions in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design.</p>
              <p id="p0075">All 800 patients were simultaneously:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0015"><list-item id="u0050"><label>•</label><p id="p0080">individually randomized to receive 20 mg/day atorvastatin or matching placebo</p></list-item><list-item id="u0055"><label>•</label><p id="p0085">individually randomized to either omega-3 EE90 (Omacor 2 g/day [Pronova BioPharma Norge AS, Lysaker, Norway], containing 46% eicosapentaenoic acid and 38% docosahexaenoic acid; referred to hereafter as omega-3) or matching placebo.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="p0090">All 59 participating general practices were cluster randomized to either standard care alone or to send patients a paper-based action-planning behavioral intervention intended to increase compliance with study medication (referred to hereafter as “action-planning leaflet”),<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> alongside standard care. This leaflet was posted to the patient along with other questionnaires 2 weeks after receiving tablets and starting treatment. It comprised 1 A4 sheet that encouraged patients to set and write down an action plan detailing when and where they would take the medication. Patients at the centers randomized to control received only the standard questionnaires.</p>
              <p id="p0095">Patients, therefore, received 1 of 8 combinations: no treatment; atorvastatin; omega-3; action planning; atorvastatin + omega-3; atorvastatin + action planning; omega-3 + action planning; or atorvastatin + omega-3 + action planning.</p>
              <p id="p0100">The protocol was approved by local and national ethics committees and regulatory agencies, and the study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines.</p>
              <p id="p0105">We based our economic evaluation solely on an extrapolation of the AFORRD trial (excluding external evidence) to estimate interactions and compare methods for dealing with the factorial design.

                <p id="p0125">We conducted a cost-utility analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of the 3 interventions in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. QALYs capture the effects of cardiovascular events on both length and quality of life. Cardiovascular risk factors (eg, LDL-C and triglycerides) were measured at baseline and at 16 weeks; week 16 data for each trial participant were extrapolated for 70 years using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model version 2.01 (UKPDS-OM2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/outcomesmodel" id="intref0030">https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/outcomesmodel</ext-link>),<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which predicts the frequency and timing of vascular events and estimates lifetime costs and QALYs. We assumed that body mass index, atrial fibrillation, smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) would remain at the values observed at week 16 indefinitely; cholesterol levels have previously been shown to be constant during long-term atorvastatin treatment.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>
<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref> gives further details on methods for costing, imputation, extrapolation, and analysis (in the Supplemental Materials found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018" id="intref0035">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="p0130">The UKPDS-OM2 was run with 1 000 000 Monte Carlo loops and 1000 sets of bootstrapped parameters (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref> for full details in Supplemental Materials found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018" id="intref0040">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018</ext-link>). We extrapolated data for each individual trial participant as randomized to estimate their lifetime costs and QALYs, as study medications are intended for long-term use and the benefits of lipid-lowering are likely to translate into fewer diabetic events and longer life expectancy.</p>
                <p id="p0135">Within-trial costs and QALYs for each patient were then added to the costs and QALYs extrapolated over a 70-year time horizon. The costs of atorvastatin and omega-3 were based on the level of compliance observed in the first 16 weeks of AFORRD and were assumed to be accrued until death. Action planning was assumed to comprise a one-off intervention received only at baseline. Patients were assumed to adhere fully with concomitant medication for the period in which they took each drug during the 16-week trial, and action planning was assumed to have no impact on concomitant medication costs.</p>
                <p id="p0140">The base case analysis did not adjust for clustering because preliminary analyses using mixed models encountered convergence problems arising from the number of patients per general practice varying between 2 and 55. Although it is generally recommended that 2-stage bootstrapping or multilevel models are used for cluster-randomized trials to allow for between-center variations in how cluster-randomized interventions are administered,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> such variations are unlikely within the first 16 weeks of AFORRD because all patients were posted the same leaflet, and no reinforcement was received until after 16 weeks; this was explored in sensitivity analysis.</p>
                <p id="p0145">AFORRD was powered assuming that the 3 interventions would have additive effects on clinical end points, and the factorial design was chosen to address multiple questions without increasing the sample size.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Clinical analyses evaluated each intervention using a different primary end point: the primary end point comprised LDL-C for atorvastatin, triacylglycerol for omega-3, and medication compliance for action plans.

Ten thousand bootstrap samples drawn from the AFORRD trial data set were each extrapolated using one of 1000 sets of UKPDS-OM2 risk equation parameters. Lifetime costs and QALYs for each bootstrap were analyzed using linear regression to adjust for prerandomization values of all UKPDS-OM2 risk factors observed in AFORRD (nonwhite ethnicity, sex, age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, history of atrial fibrillation, smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, blood pressure, and HbA<sub>1c</sub>).

                <p id="p0225">Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the conclusion that atorvastatin is the most cost-effective treatment was robust to changes in time horizon, compliance to treatment, the reference year for costs, and the price of action planning (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 3</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Tables 6-8</xref> in the Supplemental Materials found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018" id="intref0095">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018</ext-link>). When no discounting was applied, atorvastatin plus action planning had the highest expected NMB and a 52% chance of being the most cost-effective treatment. Using a lower discount rate after year 30 did not change the conclusions. Allowing for clustering by general practice, excluding within-trial costs and QALYs and modeling changes in risk factors over time based on recently developed prediction models (Leal et al, written personal communication, March 2019) also had negligible impact on the results.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0240">The results demonstrate that atorvastatin monotherapy is the most cost-effective combination of the 3 treatments evaluated in this 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial. Neither omega-3 nor action planning significantly increased QALYs, although the 2 × 2 × 2 analysis found that there was a 10% chance that atorvastatin plus action planning is the most cost-effective combination if the NHS is willing and able to pay £20 000 per QALY gained. This confirms previous evidence that atorvastatin is cost-effective as primary prevention for patients with type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> although a recent review found no good-quality economic evaluations on omega-3 or interventions to improve adherence to statin therapy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Further research to reduce the uncertainties concerning action-planning interventions may be good value for money, as the EVPI was estimated to be £149 million for the United Kingdom. However, we found that at current prices, further research on atorvastatin or omega-3 would not represent a cost-effective use of public funds.</p>
              <p id="p0245">The results of the sensitivity analysis running regressions separately for each factor highlight the importance of using regression to control for all factors simultaneously,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> because even small imbalances in the numbers of patients randomized to the most influential intervention can lead to spurious differences in less influential comparisons unless all factors are controlled for simultaneously.</p>
              <p id="p0250">Although treatment groups appeared balanced at baseline (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table 2</xref> in the Supplemental Materials found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018" id="intref0100">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.05.018</ext-link>), not controlling for baseline risk factors changed the conclusions of the 2 × 2 × 2 analysis and that assuming independence, highlighting the bias and misleading conclusions that can be introduced by even small baseline imbalances.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Trials with small numbers of patients per arm (such as small factorial trials with large numbers of randomized groups) may be particularly sensitive to bias from baseline imbalance, and cluster-randomized trials may be particularly likely to have baseline imbalance.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0255">This study also provides an example of “ignorable interactions” (ie, those that do not change conclusions about which intervention is the best value for the money).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We observed several qualitative interactions for costs and QALYs, which may have arisen from different cardiovascular interventions having multiplicative effects, the proportional hazards models used within UKPDS-OM2, or from the compliance intervention increasing the effect size for active drugs. These interactions, however, did not change the conclusions at a £20 000/QALY ceiling ratio because atorvastatin is extremely cost-effective, whereas omega-3 is poor value for the money and action planning had little effect on either costs or QALYs. Although many trials are robust to the assumptions about interactions,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> the conclusions of others are sensitive to which interactions are included.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The methods for dealing with the factorial design and the assumptions made about interactions are likely to have a larger effect in studies where all treatments affect QALYs and where cost-effectiveness ratios are close to the ceiling ratio.</p>
              <p id="p0260">The conclusions of the economic evaluation should be interpreted with caution because outcomes are extrapolated over a period many times longer than the study period, and we assumed that risk factors, compliance, and treatment effects would remain constant over time. Previous trials suggest that the effect of atorvastatin on lipids is stable over time.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Further research is needed to establish whether any shift in behavior from the action-planning intervention is permanent or whether subsequent interventions are needed to ensure that patients continue (or re-establish) their medication routine over time.</p>
              <p id="p0265">The analysis also ignored uncertainty around the cost and disutility associated with each diabetes-related complication predicted by the model. However, the UKPDS-OM2 takes account of the uncertainty around predictions of cardiovascular events and the importance of interactions is unlikely to be affected by uncertainty around risk factor trajectories or event costs/utilities. Within-trial QALYs could not be accurately assessed because EQ-5D was not measured at 16 weeks. The analysis was based on a single small trial and excludes a substantial body of external evidence demonstrating that statins are effective and cost-effective,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and that omega-3 does not significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0270">We excluded 68 patients who had missing 16-week data and used conditional mean imputation to impute missing 52-week resource use data because multiple imputation would have substantially complicated the analysis, requiring each patient to be duplicated many times within the UKPDS-OM2, followed by more complicated analyses to combine uncertainty around imputation, extrapolation, and sampling. None of these limitations are likely to have materially influenced the conclusions with respect to the factorial design.</p>
              <p id="p0275">Like 20% of published factorial trial-based economic evaluations,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> AFORRD includes cluster randomization. In general, multilevel models or two-stage bootstrap procedures are the most robust methods for dealing with clustering.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> We explored multilevel models in a sensitivity analysis and found that clustering by general practice had no impact on the conclusions, probably because the delivery of the cluster-randomized intervention (postal delivery of an action-planning leaflet) is unlikely to have varied between centers during the 16-week period analyzed. Two-stage bootstrapping was infeasible, and some multilevel models converged poorly, as only 40% (23 of 58) of general practices recruited more than 2 patients from each of the 4 individually randomized treatment arms.</p>
              <p id="p0280">This study followed recent recommendations for analyzing factorial trials<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and reporting of diabetes models.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The UKPDS-OM2 provided a useful framework for extrapolating data from a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial because it simulated lifetime outcomes for individual patients that could be analyzed as-randomized in groups stratified by different factors.

              <p>We would like to thank the participants and investigators of the AFORRD trial for their work in designing the trials and collecting and cleaning data. We also thank attendees of the Diabetes Trials Unit research review meeting for their input into the plans for the economic evaluation and/or their helpful feedback on the first draft. AFORRD Steering Committee members, coordinating centre staff, and clinical investigators are listed elsewhere (see reference <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Frauke Becker assisted validation of Stata code. Rosa Legood conducted preliminary work on the costing and analysis for the AFORRD economic evaluation, while Winitha Liyanage provided advice on the way in which trial data were used in the economic evaluation. Judit Simon and Ingrid Slade provided clinical input on which concomitant medications are related to diabetes.</p>
