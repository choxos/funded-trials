                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To evaluate individual and group long-term efficacy and safety of erenumab in individuals with episodic migraine (EM) for whom 2–4 prior preventatives had failed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants completing the 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP) of the LIBERTY study could continue into an open-label extension phase (OLEP) receiving erenumab 140 mg monthly for up to 3 years. Main outcomes assessed at week 112 were: ≥50%, ≥75% and 100% reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) as group responder rate and individual responder rates, MMD change from baseline, safety and tolerability.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall 240/246 (97.6%) entered the OLEP (118 continuing erenumab, 122 switching from placebo). In total 181/240 (75.4%) reached 112 weeks, 24.6% discontinued, mainly due to lack of efficacy (44.0%), participant decision (37.0%) and adverse events (AEs; 12.0%). The ≥50% responder rate was 57.2% (99/173) at 112 weeks. Of ≥50% responders at the end of the DBTP, 36/52 (69.2%) remained responders at ≥50% and 22/52 (42.3%) at &gt;80% of visits. Of the non-responders at the end of the DBTP, 60/185 (32.4%) converted to ≥50% responders in at least half the visits and 24/185 (13.0%) converted to ≥50% responders in &gt;80% of visits. Change from baseline at 112 weeks in mean (SD) MMD was −4.2 (5.0) days. Common AEs (≥10%) were nasopharyngitis, influenza and back pain.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Efficacy was sustained over 112 weeks in individuals with difficult-to-treat EM for whom 2–4 prior migraine preventives had failed. Erenumab treatment was safe and well tolerated, in-line with previous studies.</p>

              <p>Migraine is a common, highly disabling, episodic or chronic neurovascular headache disorder that remains undertreated.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Although treatments for acute attack have greatly improved over the last decades, they provide full relief in fewer than half of patients.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The current non-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) oral preventive medicines were not designed for migraine, do not provide improvement for many patients, and are associated with poor tolerability.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Adherence is also consequently poor.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Erenumab is a fully human, potent, selective monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the canonical CGRP receptor.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Clinical trials have demonstrated the preventive efficacy and good tolerability of erenumab in episodic migraine (EM)<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> and chronic migraine (CM).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> The long-term efficacy, tolerability and safety of erenumab in patients for whom &lt;2 prior migraine prophylactic medications had failed over 1 year in EM<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and CM,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and over 5 years in EM<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> have been reported. Post hoc analysis suggests that erenumab may also be effective in individuals with difficult-to-treat migraine for whom multiple preventive treatments have failed.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> The 12-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled LIBERTY study confirmed the efficacy and safety of monthly erenumab 140 mg in individuals with EM for whom 2–4 prior preventive treatments had failed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Subsequent follow-up demonstrated that efficacy was maintained throughout the first year of the open label extension phase (OLEP).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Efficacy of erenumab on the functional outcomes at 12 Weeks have been published previously.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This study addresses the interim results of the 2-year efficacy, safety and tolerability follow-up in 240 LIBERTY participants who completed the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment phase (DBTP) and entered an ongoing 3-year OLEP with monthly erenumab 140 mg.

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>LIBERTY (NCT03096834) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3b study conducted across Europe and Australia in participants with EM for whom 2–4 prior preventive treatments had failed.</p>
                <p>The study design and other details of LIBERTY study have been reported previously.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> In brief, the study was conducted in five phases: screening (2 weeks), baseline period (4 weeks), a DBTP (12 weeks), an ongoing OLEP (156 weeks) and a safety follow-up (12 weeks). The DBTP baseline is referred to as ‘baseline’ in this manuscript. Participants were initially randomised (1:1) to subcutaneous erenumab 140 mg (given as two 70 mg injections) or placebo once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Participants completing the DBTP could enrol in an ongoing 3-year OLEP, in which all participants received erenumab 140 mg monotherapy. Other preventive comedications were not permitted.</p>

                <p>‘Efficacy failure’ was defined as having no meaningful reduction in headache frequency after administration of the respective medication for an adequate period at therapeutic doses based on the investigator’s assessment within the last 5 years prior to screening. ‘Tolerability failure’ was documented as discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) at any time. ‘Not suitable’ was defined as unsuitable for treatment due to contraindications or precautions or other medically relevant reasons, as confirmed by the treating doctor.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>
</p>
                <p>Participants were excluded if they met the following criteria: at least 50 years of age at migraine onset, history of cluster headache or hemiplegic migraine headache, hypersensitivity or previous exposure to erenumab, previous treatment with products targeting the CGRP pathway or botulinum toxin A treatment in the head or neck region within the 4 months before initiation/during the baseline phase. Participants who were pregnant or nursing, history of seizure; major psychiatric disorders, active chronic pain syndrome, current diagnosis of ECG abnormalities, hepatic disease, malignancy within the last 5 years or a history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease/surgery within the year prior to screening, and those with medication overuse for any indication in the month before/during the baseline phase were also excluded.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria have been provided in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2</xref>.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p>Efficacy outcomes assessed at Week 112 of the OLEP included the proportion of participants achieving ≥50%, ≥75% and 100% reduction from DBTP baseline in monthly migraine days (MMDs); change from baseline in MMD, Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score, and Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary (MPFID) everyday activities (EA) and physical impairment (PI). Achievement of a ≥50% reduction in MMDs or 50% responder rate was defined as achievement of at least a 50% reduction in MMDs from individual baseline.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p>
                <p>Individual ≥50% response to erenumab therapy to week 112 of the OLEP is presented using heat maps, where fluctuations in individual ≥50% MMD reduction response are visualised over time. In each column, the response status of each participant is presented at each visit across the entire study until week 112. After reaching the initial ≥50% response threshold, a &lt;40% response versus baseline was always considered non-responder. To accommodate for small fluctuations in response, an MMD reduction between 40% and 50% was acceptable and the participant was considered as a ≥50% responder for that visit if the response at the next visit was ≥50% once more. A participant with a &lt;50% response at two consecutive visits was considered a non-responder for both periods. For instance, if a participant had a 55% reduction at week 12 and they were considered a responder; at week 16, if the MMD reduction compared with baseline had dropped to 44%, this participant would still be considered a responder for that period if the reduction had reverted to ≥50% by week 20. If, however, the participant had a &lt;50% reduction (ie, a &lt;50% reduction for two consecutive 4-week periods), they would be considered a non-responder over both periods.</p>

                <p>Of the 246 participants randomised to receive erenumab (n=121) or placebo (n=125), 240 (97.6%) completed the 12-week DBTP of the LIBERTY study and were enrolled in the OLEP.

                <p>Overall, 59/240 (24.6%) participants discontinued the OLEP at the time of the planned interim analysis at week 112: 27/118 (22.9%) participants from the erenumab group and 32/122 (26.2%) previously on placebo. Of the 59 participants who discontinued the OLEP, the main reasons for discontinuation were lack of efficacy in 26/59 (44.0%), participant’s decision in 22/59 (37.0%), AEs in 7/59 (12.0%), new therapy for study indication (migraine OR migraine prophylaxis) in 2/59 (3.4%), and pregnancy and physician decision in 1/59 (1.7%) each. Of these participants, 36/59 (61.0%) entered the 12-week safety follow-up, of which 34/36 (94.0%) completed follow-up. The reasons for the two discontinuations at this stage were new therapy for study indication (migraine OR migraine prophylaxis) and participant decision (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well-balanced across both treatment groups (those continuing erenumab and those initiating erenumab in the OLEP) as reported previously.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref>

                <p>A temporary technical issue in July 2018 resulted in the loss of electronic diary data for the efficacy endpoints for a subset of participants at week 60/week 64 of the OLEP; ~25% of participants had missing data for the week 64 visit for efficacy endpoints based on daily electronic diary and week 60 for HIT-6. Subsequently, a lower number of data points were reported for these visits. There was no impact on the collection of safety data.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

                <p>During the first year, 194 (80.8%) participants experienced TEAEs; over the 2-year OLEP, 207 (86.3%) participants experienced TEAEs. The exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates were 242.9/100 patient-years in the first year and 198.0/100 patient-years over the 2-year study duration.</p>
                <p>During the 2-year duration, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates were 157.6/100 patients-years in the continuous erenumab group, and 255.7/100 patients-years in those who switched to erenumab in the OLEP. The most frequently reported TEAEs (exposure-adjusted patient rate of ≥10%) were nasopharyngitis, influenza and back pain. Hypersensitivity was reported in one participant continuing erenumab in the OLEP. Constipation was reported in eight participants continuing erenumab in the OLEP and in five participants that switched to erenumab. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of constipation was 3.1/100 patient-years in the overall population; 3.9/100 patient-years for those continuing erenumab and 2.4/100 patient-years for those who switched to erenumab.</p>
                <p>The rate of serious AEs remained stable over the 2 years. The exposure-adjusted incidence of serious AEs in the erenumab arm during DBTP was 7.2/100 patient-years. The exposure-adjusted incidence of serious AEs in the overall population was 7.2/100 patient-years during the first year and 6.3/100 patient-years during the overall OLEP. In the second year of OLEP, the most commonly reported serious AEs were migraine (3/240 participants) and depression (2/240 participants).</p>
                <p>Rates of treatment discontinuation due to AEs were low. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of discontinuation of treatment due to AEs in the erenumab arm during the DBTP was 3.6/100 patient-years. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of discontinuation of treatment due to AEs in the overall population was 1.7/100 patient-years in the first year and 2.1/100 patient-years in second year. In the second year of OLEP, 4 (3.4%) participants in the continuous erenumab group and 5 (4.1%) participants who switched to erenumab in OLEP discontinued the study treatment due to AEs.</p>
                <p>The proportion of treatment-related AEs in the erenumab arm was comparable with that of placebo during the DBTP. Exposure-adjusted incidence rate of any treatment-related AEs during the DBTP in the erenumab arm was 86.7/100 patient-years and 95.1/100 patient-years in the placebo arm. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates of any treatment-related AE in the overall population was 30.1/100 patient-years in the first year and 19.8/100 patient-years in the second year of OLEP.</p>
                <p>There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment arms during the OLEP for laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG parameters. No deaths were reported, and no new safety findings were reported in participants during the 2-year OLEP.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this 2-year open-label follow-up study on the long-term effects of monthly erenumab 140 mg in individuals with EM in whom 2–4 migraine preventives had failed, ~70% of≥50% responders in the erenumab treatment arm at the onset of the extension study maintained a good response in half of the visits and 42% in ≥80% of the visits in the 2-year OLEP. A sustained ≥75% response of this difficult-to-treat population was observed in over half of ≥75% responders at the onset of the extension study, in at least half of the visits and in nearly one third in ≥80% of the visits in the 2-year OLEP. Sustained 100% response was seen in two thirds of the 100% responders at the onset of the extension study, in at least half of the visits and in nearly one fifth in ≥80% of the visits in the 2-year OLEP.</p>
              <p>Erenumab was safe and well tolerated over the 2-year follow-up period, in line with the safety profile observed in other long-term studies with erenumab<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–11</xref> and other CGRP inhibitors<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> in migraine populations that were not specifically selected for prior failure to migraine preventives.</p>
              <p>The number of participants achieving a≥50% reduction in MMDs at year 2 in this population with difficult-to-treat EM (57.2%) was slightly lower than those seen in EM with &lt;2 previous treatment failures: 71.0% at Year 5 of the 5-year OLEP study,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> 64.9% at week 52 of the STRIVE study,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 59.0% at week 52 of the OLEP in participants with CM,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but remained clinically relevant.</p>
              <p>The heat map presents the monthly (4 weeks) response status of individual participant responses to erenumab/placebo therapy from weeks 0 to 12 and erenumab therapy to the end for this 2-year analysis period (week 112). The heat map provides an overall visualisation of the fluctuation between responder and non-responder status of each participant providing a participant monthly journey of treatment benefits. Some participants had treatment benefit at each monthly time point while others had a consistent treatment effect with some months with lower response and still others had very few, if any, months with a treatment response. The heat map illustrates the nature of the disease, with some months being better than others, and indicates that participant response is variable even with continued treatment. The heat map also visually shows a clear switch to responders for participants treated with placebo during the first 12 weeks who switched to erenumab. A greater response was observed in participants that switched from placebo to erenumab where more non-responders converted to responder status on switching.</p>
              <p>The group responder rate demonstrates that of the ≥50% responders at week 12, 69.2% remained responder on ≥50% and 42.3% on &gt;80% of the visits and this can be visualised on the heat map. Of non-responders at week 12, 32.4% converted to ≥50% responder in at-least half the visits and 13.0% in at-least 80% of the visits. The heat maps and group responder rates validate the sustained response of erenumab over time on an individual as well as at a group level.</p>
              <p>The mean reduction in MMDs of 4.2 days from a baseline of 9.2 days at 112 weeks is comparable to mean reductions of (1) 5.3 days from a baseline of 8.7 days in the phase 2 study<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; (2) 3.1 days from 8.7 days in the subgroup analysis of the STRIVE (Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Erenumab in Migraine Prevention) study in participants who had previously failed &gt;2 migraine preventives<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and (3) 8.8 days from 18.1 days in the 52-week OLEP in participants with CM.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>Other functional parameters, as measured by HIT-6 and MPFID scores, also showed a similar improvement from weeks 12 to 112. A higher and consistent improvement was observed in the change from baseline in MMDs and functional outcomes (HIT-6 and MPFID scores) in participants who switched to erenumab at week 12 compared with those who continued erenumab.</p>
              <p>No new safety signals were observed throughout the 2 years OLEP. The safety profile of erenumab in the OLEP was consistent with that seen in the DBTP<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and across the year 1 of the OLEP.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The most frequently reported TEAEs in the 2-year OLEP were nasopharyngitis, influenza, and back pain, similar to those reported in the DBTP and the first year of the OLEP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>
</p>
              <p>The safety profile of erenumab in the 5-year OLEP of a blinded phase 2 study was consistent with that observed in the DBTP, with no increase in AEs over 5 years of exposure.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The long-term safety of erenumab in participants with CM from the 52-week OLEP with a 12-week DBTP was consistent with the known safety profile of erenumab, with comparable AEs in both arms in the DBTP.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>Recent trials also demonstrated the efficacy and safety of two other CGRP inhibitors, galcanezumab<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and fremanezumab,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> in participants with 2–4 prior preventive treatment failures, extending the findings from LIBERTY.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Long-term follow-up data of galcanezumab and fremanezumab are, however, not yet available. Altogether, these findings show that CGRP inhibitors are a novel, safe and effective treatment option for difficult-to-treat migraine.</p>
              <p>Overall, results from the 2-year OLEP demonstrated that erenumab 140 mg exhibited sustained efficacy, and was well-tolerated; these results coupled with a low dropout rate, are clinically meaningful outcomes in participants in whom 2–4 prior preventive treatment had failed with a high unmet need.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Open-label trials are generally associated with a responder bias, with participants not responding to treatment dropping out, and those that do respond remaining in the trial thus inflating the overall treatment effect observed. This is an inherent limitation of these types of studies. The individual heat maps have been provided to show the treatment effect for each individual participant so a visual comparison could be made. The low drop-out rate and high retention rates (nearly 75% over 2 years) are reassuring and indicate that erenumab was safe and well tolerated, but do not address the potential efficacy bias. The potential efficacy bias could be influenced by fluctuations in participant numbers and individual effects with 36 (15.0%) participants discontinuing within the first year of the OLEP (19 (7.9%) discontinuing due to lack of efficacy) and an additional 23 (9.6%) participants discontinuing during the second year (7 (2.0%) discontinuing due to lack of efficacy). The numerical rise in individual responder rates may be due to missing values among non-responders that prematurely discontinued the study. Additionally, the sample size in this study was smaller compared with other studies conducted in similar populations,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 25 26</xref> and only participants with EM were included, whereas a mix of participants with EM and CM would be observed in clinical practice. This study had a limited scope for evaluation of the efficacy and safety of erenumab 140 mg in participants with EM when compared with real-life clinical practice due to inclusion of participants aged 65 years or younger that were predominantly Caucasians females. However, since its launch in May 2018, erenumab has been used by thousands of patients from different ethnicities and age groups, including older than 65 years and its risk-benefit assessment continues to be positive.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Monthly erenumab 140 mg was effective, safe and well tolerated in the preventive treatment of EM in individuals in whom up to four prior preventive medications had failed. The efficacy of erenumab was well sustained over a 2-year follow-up; the safety profile was in-line with that of previous reports. Erenumab is a novel, effective and safe preventive treatment option for difficult-to-treat migraine.</p>
