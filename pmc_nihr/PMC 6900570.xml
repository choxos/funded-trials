                  <p>Ubrogepant is a novel, oral calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) receptor
antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. This trial
evaluated the safety and tolerability of ubrogepant, focusing on hepatic
safety, when administered intermittently with high-frequency dosing to
healthy participants.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this phase 1, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, healthy
adults (age 18–50 years) were randomized 1:1 to placebo or ubrogepant.
Ubrogepant was dosed at 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets) on 2 consecutive days
followed by 2 consecutive days of placebo, alternating for 8 weeks. Primary
outcome measures were safety and tolerability.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of participants randomized (n = 518), 516 were included in the safety
population (n = 260 placebo; n = 256 ubrogepant). Treatment-emergent adverse
events were reported in 45% of placebo and 44% of ubrogepant participants.
The most common was headache (10% placebo; 11% ubrogepant). Overall, seven
cases of alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase
levels ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal (five placebo, two ubrogepant) were
reported and adjudicated by a panel of independent liver experts blinded to
treatment. Four cases were judged unlikely related to treatment. Two cases
(one placebo, one ubrogepant) were judged possibly related, and one
(ubrogepant) probably related. Alanine aminotransferase increases
to ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal in the two ubrogepant cases (possibly or
probably related) were transient and resolved with continued dosing; both
cases were asymptomatic, with no concurrent bilirubin elevation.</p>

              <p>Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that plays an integral role
in migraine attacks (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). CGRP
receptor antagonism has proven to be effective in acute treatment of migraine
attacks (<xref rid="bibr3-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr7-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Development of
two of the first-generation small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, telcagepant
(MK-0974) and MK-3207, was discontinued because clinical data suggested a potential
for drug-induced liver injury (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Known
mechanisms of drug-induced liver injury include oxidative stress, development of
reactive metabolites, mitochondrial toxicity, altered bile acid homeostasis, and
innate and adaptive immune dysfunction (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Liver test abnormalities associated with
telcagepant and MK-3207 were attributed to molecule-specific metabolites, rather
than a class effect due to CGRP inhibition (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The lack of any observed liver enzyme
abnormalities with CGRP pathway blockade by monoclonal antibodies further supported
this conclusion (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p>
              <p>Ubrogepant is a small-molecule, orally delivered, potent, and specific CGRP receptor
antagonist that is under investigation for the acute treatment for migraine. It was
designed to be more potent than previous CGRP receptor antagonists, with the goal of
decreasing the dose needed for therapeutic effect and the associated risk of
hepatotoxicity. In functional assays, ubrogepant potently blocked human
α-CGRP–stimulated cAMP responses (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.08 nM) in human CGRP
receptor–expressing HEK293 cells and exhibited highly selective antagonist activity
for the CGRP receptor compared with other members of the human calcitonin receptor
family (<xref rid="bibr13-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This phase 1 trial

                <p>This phase 1, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group trial in healthy adults consisted of a 4-week screening period
followed by an 8-week (56-day) double-blind treatment period and a 4-week safety
follow-up period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102419869918">Figure
1</xref>). The trial was conducted at six trial centers in the United States
between 12 November 2017 and 17 May 2018. The trial protocol was approved by
appropriate institutional review boards (IRBs) for each trial center
(IntegReview IRB, Austin TX, USA or Advarra [previously Chesapeake] IRB,
Columbia, MD, USA). Informed written consent was obtained from all participants.

                <p>Eligible participants were healthy males or females aged 18 through 50 years
(inclusive) with a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
Participants were required to have normal ( &lt; 1 × the upper limit of normal
[ULN]) levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), and total bilirubin at each of two screening visits separated by at least
14 days. Participants were excluded if they had any of the following: any
clinically significant disease state (including migraine); a history of
hypersensitivity or clinically significant adverse reaction to a CGRP receptor
antagonist; sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 or  ≤ 90 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure ≥ 90 or ≤ 50 mm Hg at initial screening or before receiving trial
medication on day 1; potentially clinically significant abnormal
electrocardiogram results; QT interval prolongation; sitting pulse
rate &lt; 40 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm; any medication use (including over-the-counter
products, hormonal contraceptives, supplements, herbal preparations, or products
containing grapefruit) during the screening period; or had participated in a
trial of ubrogepant or another CGRP receptor antagonist within 3 months. For
current smokers, daily smoking was prohibited. Occasional smoking was permitted
and limited to no more than 8 cigarettes on any smoking day. Occasional smoking
was allowed because ubrogepant is not metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP1A1 (which
could be induced in the presence of smoking). Participants must have abstained
from drinking alcohol from the time the informed consent was signed through the
end of the study.</p>

                <title>Treatment and procedures</title>
                <p>Eligible participants were stratified by sex and randomly assigned (1:1; block
size = 4) to receive placebo (two placebo tablets) or ubrogepant 100 mg
(2 × 50 mg tablets) using an automated interactive Web response system in a
double-blind fashion based on a computer-generated randomization scheme.
Starting on day 1, participants in the ubrogepant group received 2 consecutive
days of ubrogepant 100 mg followed by 2 days of placebo, alternating for a total
of 56 days (8 weeks). Participants in the placebo group received two tablets of
matching placebo daily for 56 days (8 weeks). Participants and staff were
blinded to treatment assignment. The two trial treatments were indistinguishable
and administered in the same manner.</p>
                <p>Randomized participants returned to the trial center once or twice per week for
safety assessments, on-site dosing, and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic
assessments. Treatment was administered at the trial center approximately twice
a week, after which blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained at
either 0.5 hours (days 1, 14, 25, 37, and 49), 1 hour (days 5, 17, 42, and 53),
or 2 hours post dose (days 9, 21, 33, and 45). End-of-trial assessments were
completed on or within 4 days of the last day of the double-blind treatment
period (day 56) or early termination. A safety follow-up visit occurred 4 weeks
after the last dose.</p>

                <title>Safety assessments</title>
                <p>The primary outcome measures were safety and tolerability. All adverse events
(AEs) were monitored and recorded from the treatment start date to the safety
follow-up visit or within 30 days after last dose for participants without the
safety follow-up visit. An event that occurred after the safety follow-up visit,
or more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment for participants
without the safety follow-up visit, was not considered to be treatment-emergent.
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs occurring after the first
dose of treatment or AEs that existed before the first dose but increased in
severity after the first dose. Adverse events were coded using the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 20.1. Additional safety assessments
included clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram,
physical examination, and the Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (<xref rid="bibr16-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To closely monitor
hepatic safety, serum chemistry values were obtained at both screening visits
and on days 1, 5, 14, 21, 28, 33, 42, 49, 56 (end of trial), and 84. All
clinical laboratory tests were determined by a central laboratory (ACM Global
Laboratories, Rochester, NY).</p>
                <p>Selected TEAEs designated as events of clinical interest were monitored. The
events of clinical interest included treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (i.e.
type 4 or 5 on the Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale) or any suicidal
behavior; treatment-emergent elevation of ALT and/or AST value ≥ 3 × ULN; and
all potential Hy's Law cases, defined as an ALT or AST value ≥ 3 × ULN
accompanied by a total bilirubin value ≥ 2 × ULN and an alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) value &lt; 2 × ULN, all based on blood draws collected within a 24-hour
period. A blinded, independent clinical adjudication committee of three liver
experts reviewed each post-treatment case of ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN to assess the
relationship to study treatment and the presence of any potentially confounding
factors. The ULN for ALT was 44 U/L in males and 33 U/L in females. The ULN for
AST was 39 U/L in males and 34 U/L in females. The ULN for ALP was 129 U/L in
males and 98 U/L in females. The ULN for total bilirubin was 1.2 mg/dL in males
and females. Causality was graded using a 3-point scale (probable: ≥50%
likelihood; possible: 25–49% likelihood; unlikely: &lt;25% likelihood).</p>

                  <p>A total of seven participants (placebo n = 5; ubrogepant n = 2) had
postbaseline ALT and/or AST values ≥ 3 × ULN. Each of these cases was

and potential confounding factors (<xref rid="table4-0333102419869918" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Four of the five cases in
the placebo group were judged unlikely to be related to treatment, and one
case was deemed possibly related. Among the ubrogepant recipients, one of
the cases of ALT values ≥ 3 × ULN was judged possibly related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0333102419869918">Figure 3(a)</xref>), and one
was judged by majority vote to be probably related to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0333102419869918">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Both
cases in the ubrogepant group were asymptomatic, with no concurrent
bilirubin elevations, and resolved with continued ubrogepant dosing.
Extensive aggregate review of all cases with the adjudicators after
unblinding of the data at the end of the trial concluded that no hepatic
safety concerns were identified for ubrogepant. <fig id="fig3-0333102419869918" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This placebo-controlled study closely monitored the safety and tolerability of
ubrogepant 100 mg when dosed at the frequency of 2 days on followed by 2 days off
for 8 weeks in healthy participants, showing no significant potential for hepatic
injury. The intermittent dosing frequency of 2 days of ubrogepant followed by 2 days
of placebo was selected to reflect the episodic nature of migraine and achieve
high-frequency dosing and drug exposure (i.e. 28 days of drug exposure during a
56-day treatment period). The treatment duration of 8 weeks with a 4-week safety
follow-up period in the current trial provided sufficient time to monitor for
delayed hepatic AEs; this design was based on results from the telcagepant clinical
trials, during which all cases of AST and ALT elevations occurred within 8 weeks of
treatment initiation (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
Hepatic laboratory values were monitored approximately weekly throughout the 8-week
double-blind treatment period to provide a high likelihood of detecting hepatic
signals if the studied dosing were associated with any hepatic toxicity.</p>
              <p>Results demonstrated that ubrogepant had minimal effects on hepatic laboratory
values, with infrequent elevations in aminotransferases to ≥ 3  × ULN. The two cases
of transient aminotransferase elevations to ≥ 3 × ULN in the ubrogepant group were
asymptomatic, with no concurrent bilirubin elevations. Importantly, the
aminotransferase elevations resolved with continued ubrogepant dosing. These
findings are consistent with those of a long-term safety trial, in which adults who
treated up to eight migraine attacks every 4 weeks showed no hepatic safety concerns
(<xref rid="bibr17-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is important to note that transient postbaseline elevations in ALT and/or
AST ≥ 1 × ULN occurred in 27% of participants in the placebo and ubrogepant groups
of the current trial, suggesting that such fluctuations are common in a population
of healthy individuals. Given the overall balance in aminotransferase elevations
between placebo and active treatment, these observed elevations were likely to have
been fluctuations unrelated to the study drug. Overall, no safety concerns were
identified with the high-frequency dosing of ubrogepant.</p>
              <p>One limitation of this trial is that participants were healthy individuals with
BMI ≤ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and they were not allowed to take any other
medications during the trial. Therefore, the findings may not represent outcomes in
obese patients who may have underlying liver abnormalities (e.g. fatty liver) or in
patients with migraine who may be on multiple concomitant medications, including
those with potential for liver injury (e.g. acetaminophen/paracetamol). In addition,
because of the limited timing of pharmacokinetic sample collection, full
pharmacokinetic parameters were not calculated. However, as summarized above, the
overall pharmacokinetic, safety, and hepatic safety results observed in this trial
are consistent with results of a 52-week, long-term safety trial in a migraine
population (<xref rid="bibr17-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr19-0333102419869918" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Findings from this phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety trial in healthy
participants demonstrate that intermittent dosing of ubrogepant (2 days of
ubrogepant 100 mg alternating with 2 days of placebo) was not associated with an
increase in ALT or AST compared with placebo, or with the development of any
clinically significant liver injury. When administered at the studied frequency,
ubrogepant was safe and well tolerated over an 8-week period, with no clinically
relevant signal of hepatotoxicity.</p>
