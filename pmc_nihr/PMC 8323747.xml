                <p id="Par1">B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is associated with immunosuppression and patients are at increased clinical risk following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Covid-19 vaccines offer the potential for protection against severe infection but relatively little is known regarding the profile of the antibody response following first or second vaccination. We studied spike-specific antibody responses following first and/or second Covid-19 vaccination in 299 patients with CLL compared with healthy donors. 286 patients underwent extended interval (10â€“12 week) vaccination. 154 patients received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and 145 patients received ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken either by venepuncture or as dried blood spots on filter paper. Spike-specific antibody responses were detectable in 34% of patients with CLL after one vaccine (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰267) compared to 94% in healthy donors with antibody titres 104-fold lower in the patient group. Antibody responses increased to 75% after second vaccine (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰55), compared to 100% in healthy donors, although titres remained lower. Multivariate analysis showed that current treatment with BTK inhibitors or IgA deficiency were independently associated with failure to generate an antibody response after the second vaccine. This work supports the need for optimisation of vaccination strategy in patients with CLL including the potential utility of booster vaccines.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is associated with profound immune dysregulation that progresses over the disease course. The underlying aetiology is multifactorial, with hypogammaglobulinaemia, impaired cellular immunity and therapy-related immunosuppression commonly observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These perturbations in immunity predispose patients to an increased risk of infection and infection-related mortality remains a common cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Vaccination against common infectious agents is of paramount importance in supportive care but vaccine-induced immune responses and associated clinical efficacy are often reduced in this patient group.</p>
              <p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and has led to a global pandemic with over 3.2 million deaths to date. Several studies have shown increased rates of morbidity and mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CLL and this is exacerbated by the age of many patients with this condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par4">Novel vaccines against Covid-19 have shown remarkable efficacy and are likely to play a major role in control of the current pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 utilise nucleoside-modified RNA or adenovirus-based platforms, respectively, and incorporate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as vaccine immunogen. Both vaccines are given as two doses with the BNT162b2 vaccine approved for a 3-week interval whilst clinical responses after ChAdOx1 are improved with a longer period between prime and boost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, several countries, including the UK, have elected to adopt an â€˜extended intervalâ€™ vaccination regimen of between 10â€“12 weeks between BNT162b2 doses in order to maximise population coverage after a single vaccine.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Covid-19 vaccines offer the potential to provide patients with CLL with substantial clinical protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection but there is concern regarding the efficacy of vaccine responses in this group. Studies over many years have shown immune responses to vaccination are impaired in patients with B-CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is seen most particularly in the response to novel immunogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Attenuated vaccine-induced immunity is seen across many stages of the disease course but immune function deteriorates most particularly in heavily treated patients. Vaccine responses are also suppressed in patients who are undergoing treatment with BTK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is relatively little information to date regarding the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination in patients with CLL. Examination of 44 patients following 2 doses of mRNA vaccines recently reported a response rate of 52% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similarly, in a larger cohort of patients who had received the second BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine following a standard 3-week interval between doses, antibody responses were detected in 40%, with higher rates in patients with clinical remission after treatment, compared with a response rate of only 16% for patients on current treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. No current data exists studying ChAdOx1 in patients with CLL or for those on extended interval schedules.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here we present an interim assessment of spike-specific antibody response in patients with CLL following BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccination. Due to usage of an â€˜extended intervalâ€™ vaccine protocol within the UK for most patients to date, antibody responses have been assessed after single vaccination, with a smaller proportion assessed following the second dose. We show that immune responses are impaired in most patients and that IgA deficiency and current therapy with BTKi are independent risk factors for poor response.</p>

              <p id="Par7">Patients with a diagnosis of CLL or small lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL) were recruited to the study. The work was performed under the CIA UPH IRAS approval (REC 20\NW\0240) and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice. Informed consent was obtained in person or by remote consultation. Dates and subtype of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were obtained together with self-reported information on disease stage and date of CLL diagnosis, CLL treatment and infection history. Infection history was considered â€˜positiveâ€™ in cases of 2 or more serious or 3 or more respiratory infections in a 1-year period.

The median age of the patient group was 69 years (IQR 63-74) and 159 of the CLL patients (53%) were male. A total of 154 patients had received the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) whilst 145 received the AstraZeneca/Oxford ChAdOx1 adenovirus vaccine.</p>
                <p id="Par14">286 patients (96%) were vaccinated with an â€˜extended intervalâ€™ regimen of 10â€“12 weeks between the first and second vaccine. In this group blood samples were taken after the first vaccine in most cases in order to assess the immune response to single vaccine delivery. Thirteen patients (4%) were vaccinated according to the â€˜standard intervalâ€™ for the mRNA vaccine of a 3-week time period between first and second dose. In this group samples were taken only after the second vaccine. Matched samples after first and second vaccine were available in 27 cases.

                <p id="Par18">Several studies have now shown that people who have had a previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit particularly strong immune responses following Covid-19 vaccination. Previous infection can be determined by the presence of nucleocapsid-specific antibodies and these were detected in 5 donors with CLL. Within this group, median antibody titres within S1 samples were boosted by a remarkable 21,450-fold to reach a median value of 8580 U/ml (naturally infected median 8580 U/ml vs no previous infection 0.4 U/ml; <italic>p</italic>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001). Of note these values are comparable to the levels of 10,700 U/ml in samples from healthy donors with previous infection after one vaccine (<italic>p</italic>â€‰&gt;â€‰0.999).</p>
                <p id="Par19">Given the clinical heterogeneity amongst patients with CLL we next assessed antibody responses in relation to clinical status and management. Patients were divided into 5 groups: â€˜watch and waitâ€™; previously completed chemo-immunotherapy (median 68 months (IQR 35-115) since last treatment); current treatment with BTK inhibitor; current treatment with venetoclax; and â€˜plans to start treatment imminentlyâ€™. Analysis of serum samples showed that responses were low in all five groups and, although numbers within the subgroups were small, patient responses were particularly suppressed amongst those on current therapy or those who were due to start therapy in the near future (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par20">Following analysis of the serum samples we went on to determine the spike-specific antibody response from dried blood spot samples (DBS) using a spike-specific ELISA (The Binding Site (TBS)). These DBS1 samples were available in 267 patients and compared to values from 93 age-matched healthy donors following single vaccination. Analysis of paired samples showed a strong correlation between the spike-specific antibody response detected by serum and DBS within the patient group (<italic>r</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.65; <italic>p</italic>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1A</xref>) and confirms previous work within healthy donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par21">Antibody responses were detectable in 63 of the 267 DBS1 patient samples (24%) which compares to the value of 34% from the serum analysis. Positive responses were detectable in 71% of the control group and as such were somewhat lower than responses obtained from analysis of serum samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D, F</xref>). The magnitude of antibody response from DBS eluates was also lower within the patient group compared to controls (median ratio to calibrator of 0.5 vs 1; <italic>p</italic>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Amongst the 24% of patients where a positive antibody response was seen, a similar median ratio was observed in patients with CLL and healthy donors (CLL: 1.76 vs HD 1.71). Analysis of DBS1 eluate samples showed low responses across all patient groups. Comparison between subgroups showed that patients on BTKi therapy were less likely to develop a positive antibody response compared to those on watch and wait (<italic>p</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.0056) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>).

              <p id="Par28">SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have proven highly effective in protection against severe Covid-19 but there remains considerable concern about their efficacy in patients with immune suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here we show that immune responses elicited after the first and second vaccine are substantially reduced in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These findings raise a number of questions in relation to optimisation of vaccine protection in this vulnerable cohort.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The median age of our cohort was 69 years and as such it would be expected that immune senescence will play a role in vaccine response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Importantly we were able to compare the patient responses with a large age-matched control group. Antibody responses within the patient group after one vaccination were low and detectable in only 34% compared to 94% of age-matched controls. The antibody titre was also over 100-fold lower at this time. These results are comparable with the 18% response rate in a haematological cancer cohort that included 11 CLL patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">Interestingly, 5 of the 86 donors for which serological samples were available showed the presence of nucleocapsid-specific antibodies indicating previous natural infection and in this group the antibody response after first vaccine was remarkably high and directly comparable to those seen in previously infected healthy donors after vaccination. Indeed, antibody levels were markedly higher than those seen in previously uninfected patients after two Covid-19 vaccines. As such, immune memory after natural infection appears able to overcome the impaired antibody response to the initial vaccine in the patient group. Similar findings in relation to the â€˜vaccine-primingâ€™ effect of previous natural infection have previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Of interest, only 2 of these 5 patients reported symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection over the last 12 months suggesting that asymptomatic infection occurs amongst patients with CLL and that mortality rates may have therefore been overestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One limitation to this finding may be that some patients with CLL who had previous natural infection may lack a nucleocapsid-specific antibody response in the convalescent serum due to antibody waning, secondary immunodeficiency or hypogammaglobulinaemia.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Encouragingly, antibody responses increased after the second vaccine and were positive in 75% of serum samples and 71% of DBS eluates at this time point. These values are somewhat higher than the response rate of 40% in a recent study of 167 patients after the second BNT162b2 vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further assessment of donors within our study at this time point is ongoing as more samples are collected. Of note, most patients in this study were studied after extended interval vaccination and this may potentially serve to boost antibody responses following the second vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our study has found no difference in antibody levels following the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines to date.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Of interest, spike-specific antibody levels within patients after second vaccination were broadly comparable to those seen in the control group after a single vaccine which is noteworthy given the clinical protection demonstrated following a single vaccine within the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">We were further interested to see how vaccine responses varied in relation to clinical and laboratory features of individual patients. Patient age, or time since original diagnosis, did not impact significantly on vaccine response. In contrast the serum level of immunoglobulin was a notable determinant, with higher levels of all three isotypes associated with improved antibody response rate in univariate analysis. IgA deficiency emerged as the most significant predictor of poor vaccine response and normal levels were associated with a 10-fold increase in the probability of a positive response after second vaccination. IgA is the first of the immunoglobulin classes to diminish in patients with CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and this is reflected in this cohort where 32% of participants were deficient in IgA. IgA levels at diagnosis have also been shown to predict infection risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and IgA deficiency has been associated with poor responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Herishanu et al. also found that having normal immunoglobulins predicted better response rates to the BNT162b2 vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy was a strong and independent predictor of negative antibody response after the second vaccine. BTKi therapy has transformed the management of patients with CLL over the past decade but its impact on vaccine response has been previously reported and is unsurprising given the pivotal role of BTK in B-cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It would appear advisable that patients who are being considered for BTKi therapy should receive their Covid-19 vaccination prior to therapy where possible. However, we also observed suboptimal vaccine responses in untreated patients who were planning to start therapy in the near future and this is likely to reflect the immunosuppressive impact of active disease.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In contrast, positive antibody responses were observed in 83% of patients who were on â€˜watch and waitâ€™ management and this was particularly true for those with normal serum immunoglobulin levels.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Relatively few patients in our cohort were in remission from previous chemotherapy but it appears that antibody responses in this group are also more robust and this would be compatible with previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other limitations of our work include patient self-reporting for infection history and previous COVID-19 infection, a lack of nucleocapsid-specific antibody assessment in the DBS samples, inability to link to current haematological parameters, and the relatively small number of samples after the second vaccine as a result of the extended interval programme.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Our findings raise questions regarding optimal vaccination policy for patients with CLL and the potential need for additional management. The great majority of the UK population is receiving the Covid-19 vaccine with an â€˜extended intervalâ€™ of 10â€“12 weeks between doses. As such, in this interim report the majority of samples were obtained after the first vaccine but before the second dose and suggest that patients with CLL should be considered for early delivery of the second vaccine. However, antibody responses may remain suboptimal even after two vaccines. One option might be to consider a third â€˜boosterâ€™ vaccine and this is being implemented in some countries for patients in other risk groups. At this stage it is not clear if a third vaccine will indeed act to further boost antibody responses although the substantial increment after the second boost and the high antibody titres observed following natural infection suggest that this may be possible. It is possible that vaccination may serve to provide sufficient â€˜immune-primingâ€™ to protect against severe disease from subsequent infection even in the absence of a measurable spike-specific antibody response. Indeed, we have not yet assessed the profile of spike-specific cellular immunity following vaccination and, although cellular immune responses are also typically suboptimal in patients with CLL, these are likely to provide some protection from severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, antibody levels are emerging as a correlate of immune protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and as such the administration of prophylactic SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies to patients at the greatest clinical risk could be valuable.</p>
              <p id="Par38">In conclusion we show that antibody responses following Covid-19 vaccination are reduced in patients with CLL, with patients who are IgA-deficient or on BTKi therapy at particular risk for failure to develop a response. It is now critical that the clinical efficacy of vaccination is determined in this patient group using data linkage from large population datasets and this assessment is underway in many countries. This information, together with assessment of immune correlates, will be important to guide the ongoing requirement for behavioural adjustments such as social distancing.</p>
