                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire, England. We used ‘opt-out’ recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator. Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144 general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm) and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.99, <italic>p</italic> = 0.017) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary endpoints (diabetes control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89–1.18, <italic>p</italic> = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI 0.96–1.16, <italic>p</italic> = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75–1.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI 0.39–0.99; <italic>p</italic> = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components, given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve.</p>

                  <p>In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also required patient engagement.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Clinical research can only benefit patient and population health if findings are incorporated into routine care. There are delays and inappropriate variations in uptake of effective treatments and withdrawal of less effective or harmful treatments [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This translation gap is important to policy makers, healthcare systems, and research funders because it limits the health, social, and economic impacts of clinical research [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>United Kingdom primary care presents particular implementation challenges: growing demand, increasing complexity of care, and limited workforce capacity, against a background of frequent organisational reconfigurations [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We identified 107 clinical guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) relevant to UK general practice [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many implementation studies focus on a single clinical condition or problem (e.g., diabetes, antibiotic stewardship), limiting generalisability, as it is uncertain whether an implementation strategy developed for one condition will work for another. It is impracticable and inefficient to devise an implementation strategy for every new guideline. Furthermore, the clinical significance of behaviours often targeted in implementation studies, such as receipt of processes of care or investigations, is doubtful [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Implementation strategies are required, capable of integration into primary care systems and adaptable to different clinical priorities.</p>
              <p>We earlier derived evidence-based indicators that could be measured using routinely collected data [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We found marked variations in indicator achievement and scope for improvement in a sample of 89 general practices [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We subsequently focused our efforts on four ‘high impact’ indicators that would benefit population health if implemented more consistently: achievement of recommended treatment targets for all of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure (BP), and cholesterol in type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; avoidance of risky prescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anti-platelet drugs [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; achievement of recommended BP levels in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; and anticoagulant prescribing for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We drew upon systematic reviews of implementation strategies [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], theory-guided interviews with primary care staff [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and workshops with health professionals and patients to develop a multifaceted implementation package [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We compared the effects of the adaptable implementation package against implementation control on adherence to four different evidence-based high impact indicators.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>We conducted two parallel, cluster-randomised trials using balanced incomplete block designs. In implementation trials, there may be positive attention or negative demotivation effects from participant knowledge of allocation to an intervention or control group, respectively. Balanced incomplete block designs aim to balance any such nonspecific effects across trial arms, as each arm receives an intervention, thereby increasing confidence that any difference in outcomes is attributable to the intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The design is incomplete, as each arm receives only one of the interventions. General practices providing National Health Service (NHS) care were the unit of allocation, as the intervention was delivered at the practice level. We maximised pragmatism in trial design and execution to ensure ‘real-world’ relevance [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Practices were recruited from West Yorkshire, England, which covers a diverse population of 2.2 million residents, albeit with deprivation levels above the national average [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Around 300 general practices were then organised within 10 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).</p>
                <p>Eligible general practices used <italic>SystmOne</italic>, the computerised clinical system used by approximately two thirds of West Yorkshire practices (The Phoenix Partnership, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tpp-uk.com">http://www.tpp-uk.com</ext-link>). We excluded 31 practices that had contributed to earlier intervention development work. We invited practices via recorded post and email, with reminders at two weeks. The UK National Research Ethics Service granted ethical approval (14/SC/1393). This permitted use of an opt-out approach: all eligible practices were included, unless actively declined within four weeks of invitation. The study protocol has previously been published [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The study is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN91989345). This study is reported as per the CONSORT guideline for cluster-randomised trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s011">S1 CONSORT checklist</xref>).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>The trial statistician performed the two-stage randomisation using a bespoke computer-generated minimisation programme implemented in R, software version 2.15.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (incorporating a random element). First, practices were stratified by CCG and list size, and randomised to Trial 1 (implementation packages targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing), Trial 2 (BP control or anticoagulation in AF), or no intervention (80:64:34). As recruitment exceeded expectations, we included a ‘no intervention’ arm to allow us to evaluate any nonspecific effects of research participation (this paper presents comparisons within Trials 1 and 2; analysis of the no intervention group will be reported elsewhere). Secondly, within each trial we stratified practices by CCG, list size, and pre-intervention adherence to the two relevant targeted indicators and randomised them 1:1 to individual trial arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003045.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Within each trial, we assumed that any clinical effects of either implementation package would be independent of one another; each intervention arm therefore acted as the control arm for the other intervention arm in the same trial. For example, practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the implementation control comparison for practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. Practices from one CCG (29 practices) involved in a concurrent initiative targeting one of our study priorities, anticoagulation in AF, were excluded from Trial 2. Practices and trial personnel were not blind to allocation.</p>

The no intervention arm is shaded to indicate that it was not included in the analyses described here; analysis of this group will be reported elsewhere. <sup>c</sup>One practice in the risky prescribing arm merged with a non-ASPIRE practice in advance of the fourth feedback report. However, as they received the first three feedback reports, some outcome data are available, and they are included in the final analyses. <sup><bold>d</bold></sup>One practice in the BP control arm closed in advance of the third feedback report. However, as they received the first two feedback reports, some outcome data are available and they are included in the final analyses. As an example, for the diabetes control practices: there were 14,522 patients acting as the intervention group for the diabetes control implementation package and 18,131 patients acting as the control group for the risky prescribing implementation package.

                <p>The implementation package (detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) embedded behaviour change techniques within typical primary care interventions: audit and feedback, educational outreach, and computerised support. Implementation package content, specifically the clinical content and embedded behaviour change techniques, was adapted for each of the four targeted indicators and delivered to practices May 2015 to March 2016.</p>
                <p>Audit and feedback aimed to give comparative feedback on achievement, inform and prompt recall of clinical goals, highlight consequences of changing or not changing practice, suggest strategies for change, and encourage goal setting and reflection on progress towards goals. Quarterly electronic and paper practice–specific reports presented achievement ranked by practice and compared over time for relevant trial indicators in graphical and numerical forms, using remotely gathered, individualised practice data. Reports also contained brief, evidence-based clinical messages; responses to common queries; and action-planning templates. Practices received computerised search tools to identify relevant patients for review. We encouraged practices to use the feedback reports as supporting materials for professional appraisal and revalidation.</p>
                <p>Educational outreach aimed to enhance feedback reports by facilitating individual and group reflection, discussing barriers to action, sharing models of good practice, enhancing motivation, and action planning. We trained pharmacists over two days to deliver 30-minute sessions, designed to fit with existing practice meetings and offered to all staff involved in patient and practice management. We identified a key clinical contact to support practice engagement. We offered a second, follow-up session to review progress and refine action plans, as well as two days of pharmacist support for patient identification and review.</p>
                <p>Prompts and reminders reinforced clinical messages and indicator adherence. Computerised prompts for risky prescribing were offered to practices and had to be accepted before they became active on their system. If accepted, they were triggered during consultations and repeat prescribing through an algorithm for patient age, diagnosis, drug, and duration. A one-click justification (ignore, or add or stop medication) was required before users could proceed. Other targeted indicators had existing prompts on practice computer systems, usually to support the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF), a performance management system whereby general practices are remunerated according to achievement of targets reflecting quality of care [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We provided laminated reminders to convey key clinical information (e.g., management pathways) for BP control, anticoagulation for AF, and risky prescribing. We also developed checklists to facilitate shared decision-making with patients for managing BP and diabetes, but we could not make them available in a satisfactory format within the study time lines [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>We deliberately aligned intervention delivery with the QOF year to fit with existing practice schedules. We assumed that any actions prompted by the implementation package would occur within this period.</p>

We planned to measure all outcomes at 12 months post-randomisation.

We assessed QOF indicators relevant to implementation packages (diabetes control, BP control, and anticoagulation for AF) to examine any effects on existing routine indicators.

                <p>Median effect sizes on processes and outcomes of care for a range of guideline implementation studies are around 4%–9% [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Baseline achievement rates in risky prescribing were considerably higher and, considering a potential ceiling effect, a 5% decrease was realistic and clinically relevant.</p>
                <p>We aimed to recruit 144 practices: 80 in Trial 1 (diabetes and risky prescribing) and 64 in Trial 2 (BP control and AF), giving 90% power at 2.5% significance (adjusting for two comparisons per trial) to detect the specified effect sizes, allowing for 10% attrition. The mean cluster size (number of patients per practice by indicator), coefficient of variation, intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), and control group achievement rates were estimated from previously collected data [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s005">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

                <p>Analyses, conducted in SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) according to the prespecified statistical analysis plan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s012">S1 statistical analysis plan</xref>), were based on intention-to-treat (ITT), with two-sided significance testing at the 2.5% level to preserve an overall 5% Type I error rate per trial. We analysed primary outcomes using two-level binary logistic regression models, with patients (level 1) nested within randomised practices (level 2). We analysed binary secondary outcomes for individual indicators within the composite primary outcomes, and recorded processes of care using similar multilevel logistic models. We analysed continuous intermediate clinical outcomes using two-level linear models. All analyses adjusted for patient-level (sex, age) and practice-level covariates (baseline practice list size, CCG, pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total QOF score 2014–2015 [covering clinical and management domains], proportion of patients with 0–3 comorbidities). Sensitivity analyses were conducted when model assumptions were violated. Data completeness for these analyses depended on the completeness of <italic>SystmOne</italic> medical records and could not be assessed within the trial data set. Missing data in a patient’s record could have led to their incorrect inclusion or exclusion from the denominator of a particular quality indicator or resulted in the patient being incorrectly classified as achieving that indicator. For the primary and secondary analyses, we assumed that data were missing at random. Imputation was not performed for any outcome variables. Complete case analyses were performed for the continuous clinical outcomes. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made in the secondary endpoint analyses.</p>

                <title>Cost-effectiveness</title>
                <p>We conducted economic evaluations of three implementation packages using a decision-analytic modelling approach. Given resource constraints, we were unable to evaluate the anticoagulation for AF package. Implementation package costs included researcher and healthcare professional time and materials in delivery and resulting from change in practice. Trial estimates of effectiveness were inputted into decision models, with the main output being cost (UK £, 2017 prices) per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over a lifetime horizon from the perspective of the UK health and social care provider. Where possible we used models, parameters, and assumptions that had informed the original NICE guidance. For diabetes control, we used the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model (UKPDS-OM) version 2 [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For BP control, we recreated and adapted the model used to inform NICE guidance [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], identifying additional parameters through targeted searches and risk engines such as QRISK. We based the risky prescribing model on a previous model of NSAID prescribing used in a NICE osteoarthritis guideline (CG177). We adapted this model and populated it using results reported for three of the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs in the UK (diclofenac, naproxen, and ibuprofen) and aspirin. We created an additional model based on that used to inform the NICE Acute Kidney Injury guideline (CG169), covering NSAID prescribing in patients with CKD. Individual indicators were evaluated and their cost-effectiveness aggregated within each implementation package. We conducted a series of deterministic sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We used a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained to indicate cost-effectiveness. We applied a 3.5% discount rate to costs and benefits post one year.</p>

              <p>We assessed 278 practices for eligibility in January 2015, excluding 35 because of closure or earlier participation in the programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003045.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We invited 243 (87%) practices to participate in February 2015; 56 (23%) opted out, largely because of workload pressures, and nine were excluded for other reasons.</p>
              <p>In April 2015, we randomised 178 (73%) practices to Trial 1 (80 practices), Trial 2 (64 practices), or no intervention (34 practices). Analyses of the no intervention arm will be reported elsewhere. Within each trial, practices were randomised 1:1 to intervention arms.</p>
              <p>Baseline characteristics for general practices and patients were well balanced by trial and intervention (Tables <xref rid="pmed.1003045.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003045.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

              <p>No practices actively withdrew from the trial. One practice closed (BP intervention arm), another merged (risky prescribing) with a non-trial practice during the intervention period, and two trial practices merged (diabetes and risky prescribing). As outcome data for these practices were available up to the times of the second, third, and fourth feedback reports, respectively, all were included in the analysis using their most recent data.</p>
              <p>Between May 2015 and April 2016, all intervention practices received feedback reports as intended, including an end-of-study report (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s006">S6 Table</xref> summarises intervention delivery). Educational outreach visits were delivered to 67 (47%) of 144 practices; 52 (68%) of the 77 practices declining visits gave no reason. Sixteen practices (24% of those receiving educational outreach visits) utilised additional pharmacist support. One hundred twenty-six (88%) practices joined the organisational groups, allowing them to access searches and computerised prompts (risky prescribing practices only). Second educational visits were delivered to eight (6%) practices.</p>

The conclusions for total serum cholesterol and HbA1c were robust to log transformation of the outcomes in a sensitivity analysis conducted following model diagnostic checks. We observed no intervention effects on any QOF indicators, including those not targeted by the implementation packages.</p>
              <p>In estimating cost-effectiveness, we assumed equal costs for all four implementation packages. We conservatively doubled the cost per package. The total cost of package delivery was £175,592, and cost per practice was £2,439 (£175,592/144*2). Costs per patient (not only those eligible for indicator criteria) for an average practice list size of 7,130 were negligible (£0.28). No interventions were cost-saving. The risky prescribing package is highly likely to be cost-effective with an ICER of £1,359 and 79% chance of cost-effectiveness (<xref rid="pmed.1003045.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), with results largely driven by two indicators. While the deterministic ICER for the BP package indicates cost-effectiveness, this is highly uncertain, with the probabilistic results indicating only a 52% chance of cost-effectiveness. We have not presented model results for the diabetes package as incremental costs and benefits were negligible, making model results unreliable. Results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses when, for example, we increased and reduced intervention costs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s007">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s010">S4</xref> Figs present cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for the risky prescribing and BP control implementation packages.</p>

              <p>Our pragmatic, randomised trials found that an adaptable, multifaceted implementation package improved clinical care for only one of four high-impact indicators in general practices serving relatively socially deprived populations. The odds of risky prescribing for a patient in an intervention practice were 18.5% lower than for a patient with the same characteristics in a control practice, which could ultimately be associated with changes in mortality, morbidity, and health service use, depending on generalisability to the general population. There was insufficient evidence of an effect upon diabetes control, BP control, and anticoagulation for AF. Our findings suggest that the design and delivery of implementation strategies need to account for differences in the nature of targeted clinical behaviours and go further than the kinds of adaptations in content that we applied.</p>
              <p>Commonly used interventions to implement evidence-based practice, such as audit and feedback, educational outreach, and computerised prompts generally have modest if variable effects on clinical performance [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Tailoring such interventions to identified needs and barriers offers a means to enhance their effects, but how best to do this and improve patient outcomes remains uncertain [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our findings confirm the effectiveness, generalisability, and value of interventions incorporating audit and feedback to improve prescribing safety in UK primary care [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The PINCER trial compared one-off feedback with pharmacist outreach visits to one-off feedback alone, whilst the D-QIP study provided financial incentives in addition to weekly feedback. Given our pragmatic approach to practice recruitment, our intervention and findings compare most closely to those of the EFIPPS trial, which found that quarterly feedback, with or without embedded behaviour change techniques, reduced risky prescribing by a similar magnitude [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our modelling also indicated relative cost-effectiveness, mainly driven by improved levels of gastro-protection. It is noteworthy that the cost of the risky prescribing package was only £0.28 per patient.</p>
              <p>We found no benefit of the implementation package on the management and outcomes of our targeted long-term conditions. Systematic review evidence suggests that interventions targeting systems of patient management along with patient-mediated interventions (which we did not include) are likely to be important components of strategies in this context [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>The balanced incomplete block designs permitted comparison of intervention effects while mitigating any potential nonspecific performance effects of trial participation [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our trials were pragmatic in three ways. Opt-out recruitment ensured that participating practices were generally representative of the wider population [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Data collection was minimally intrusive. For intervention delivery, all practices received but were not obliged to act on feedback reports, whilst outreach visits were optional. Hence, the implementation packages were tested under real-world conditions, increasing confidence in wider applicability to routine general practice settings. We further demonstrated no adverse impacts on incentivised indicators of care not targeted by the implementation package.</p>
              <p>Our evaluation had five main limitations. First, the use of routinely collected data may have compromised the precision of trial outcomes and hence ability to demonstrate effects. However, we extracted structured data that are reasonably reliably coded in general practice, partly incentivised by QOF. Second, given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, we cannot make any inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components. Third, educational outreach visits were delivered by facilitators not allocated to specific trial arms, thereby risking contamination between arms. We had instructed facilitators to focus only on delivering the implementation package to which each practice was assigned. Fourth, an 11-month follow-up period may have been too short to detect changes in patient outcomes, such as those related to diabetes or BP control, especially if a number of general practices only received educational outreach visits later in this period. This explanation is unlikely, as other trials have demonstrated changed clinical outcomes within similar durations of follow-up [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; we also did not detect any improvements in processes of care for diabetes and BP control, respectively. Fifth, our composite endpoint for diabetes control requiring achievement of all HbA1c, BP, and cholesterol treatment goals may have been too demanding. Our clinical and patient advisors had considered this endpoint fair, if challenging.</p>
              <p>Our work highlights three methodological issues. First, the implementation package effect on risky prescribing was modest but important at a population level. Foregoing a randomised design, as has been suggested for quality improvement research [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], would have reduced confidence in the validity of our findings and risked false positive conclusions. For example, the trial design accounted for temporal changes, including improvements in risky prescribing and anticoagulation achievement and declines in BP and diabetes achievement (<xref rid="pmed.1003045.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which would otherwise be difficult to interpret. Second, whilst we see the pragmatic design as a strength, a more explanatory approach could have made full engagement with our implementation package a condition of trial participation. Such mandating is seldom possible or even desirable in quality improvement programmes dependent upon professional engagement, particularly if they encourage ‘gaming’ behaviours to achieve goals whilst circumventing real action. Similarly, our opt-out approach to recruitment may have reduced self-selection of more enthusiastic practices, as well as administrative burden. Those responsible for leading quality improvement initiatives often specifically wish to include less enthusiastic or poorer performing practices. Third, a critical challenge prior to pragmatic evaluations is to develop interventions that are sufficiently durable to withstand the relatively hard-pressed and evolving environments of clinical practice. Whilst we followed the UK Medical Research Council framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions, practice engagement with our implementation package was highly variable [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We would now recommend more intensive field work involving iterative cycles of testing and refining interventions prior to scaling up for definitive evaluation.</p>
              <p>We had set out to develop an implementation package that could be adapted for different clinical priorities in primary care. We offer four interrelated explanations for the observed differences in intervention effects. First, the targeted clinical behaviour(s) and associated endpoints varied according to the extent of control held over them by clinical staff. Clinicians could make relatively straightforward changes to reduce risky prescribing, such as adding gastro-protection for prescribed aspirin, with limited input from patients. The observed significant difference in achievement of the associated secondary outcome on gastro-protection provides evidence to support such a mechanism (although we would still advise cautious interpretation, given that these analyses were not formally adjusted as we tested across multiple secondary endpoints). In contrast, improving BP control can require at least two consultations and changes in patient behaviour, as well as finding a pharmacological agent that is acceptable to and effective for an individual patient. This is consistent with evidence that adherence to clinical recommendations that are more complex or disruptive to routine practice is lower compared with simpler recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interventions involving audit and feedback have also been shown to reduce other discouraged prescribing behaviours, namely of antibiotics [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and offer a means to address urgent priorities such as rising opioid prescribing [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Second, the risky prescribing package included an automated computerised prompt requiring a one-step justification for continued prescribing. Such prompts are generally effective in changing prescribing behaviour [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, a recent UK trial found that on-screen reminders did not improve adherence to the other prescribing behaviour we targeted, anticoagulation prescribing for AF [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. With the benefit of hindsight, this is unsurprising. Qualitative work we undertook before the trials revealed that anticoagulation prescribing comprises a series of deceptively complex considerations and behaviours, which include balancing benefits and risks with patients [<xref rid="pmed.1003045.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Clinicians sometimes lacked confidence in starting treatment, given that they encountered it relatively infrequently in routine practice and felt frustrated by complicated guidance that made treatment difficult to explain to patients. Third, the number of patients requiring action to achieve indicators varied by trial arm, with far more in the diabetes and BP control arms relative to risky prescribing and anticoagulation for AF (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003045.s005">S5 Table</xref>). Hence, the larger numbers of patients requiring action may have undermined clinicians’ perceived feasibility and motivation. Moreover, making changes for even a small number of patients within the risky prescribing indicator set would have had a comparatively larger effect upon achievement relative to other indicators. Fourth, the indicators for three targeted long-term conditions were incentivised in the QOF. As well as aligning the implementation package with existing quality improvement schemes, our intention had been to encourage practices to move beyond the QOF by adopting more challenging, evidence-based goals. Within the present constraints of UK primary care, it was hard for practices to take on additional, unrewarded work. Clinicians may, nevertheless, have been motivated to address risky prescribing because it concerned patient safety.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, an adaptable implementation package improved prescribing safety in general practice. However, we observed no benefits of the package within the context of an existing financial incentive system targeting similar aspects of care for three long-term conditions. Improving patient outcomes for long-term conditions requiring relatively complex management may require systemised approaches that target patient as well as professional behaviour.</p>

              <p>Please include an appropriate contact (web and/or email address) for inquiries to obtain access to the data (please note: this cannot be a study author).</p>
              <p>3. Abstract Background: The final sentence should clearly state the study question/hypothesis to be tested.</p>
              <p>4. Abstract: Methods and Findings: Please define the control for the intervention.</p>
              <p>5. Abstract: Methods and Findings (Line 120): You mention here that 34 practices were recruited as non-intervention controls. This could be misleading because you do not include any analyses of these controls in this manuscript, and comparisons are made to within-arm controls. Please remove the mention of these non-intervention controls here, and clarify the control for these analyses.</p>
              <p>6. Abstract: Methods and Findings: In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
              <p>7. Abstract: Conclusions: Please interpret the study based on the results presented in the abstract, emphasizing what is new without overstating your conclusions; the phrase "In this study, we observed ..." may be useful. Please avoid vague statements such as "these results have major implications for policy/clinical care". Mention only specific implications substantiated by the results. Specifically, both sentences of the conclusion are vague and do not clearly reflect what can be concluded from the study findings.</p>
              <p>8. Author Summary: Thank you for including an Author Summary. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>9. Author Summary: “What do these findings mean?”: Please revise the final point to: “In this study, we found that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ strategy did not work…” Please also revise this point to clarify what is meant by “did not work” and “the nature of clinical behaviors targeted”. </p>
              <p>10.Introduction: Please conclude the Introduction with a clear description of the study question or hypothesis.</p>
              <p>11. Methods: The following points in the Methods differ from those described in the trial registry (ISRCTN registry ISRCTN91989345): In manuscript: “Audit and Feedback”, “Educational Outreach”, and “Prompts and Reminders” are described (Methods: Procedures: Lines 224-249). In the registered trial protocol, “GP Appraisal and Revalidation” and “Patient Mediated Intervention” are also described. Please explain, including in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>12. Methods: The following points in the Methods differ from those described in the trial registry: There are a number of primary and secondary outcomes described in the manuscript (Methods: Outcomes: Lines 253-312). However, the registered protocol describes the primary outcome as: “Adherence; Timepoint(s): Adherence will be measures up to 12 mth post randomisation”, with no secondary outcomes described. Please clarify and explain the discrepancy. If the outcomes were not pre-specified in the protocol, please indicate that they were post hoc and explain why they were added. Post hoc comparisons should be presented as hypothesis generating rather than conclusive. Please explain, including in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>13. Methods: Line 328: Please provide a link to the pre-specified statistical analysis plan referred to here, and include as supplementary information.</p>
              <p>14. Results: Line 347: Please provide statistical evidence (in the appropriate tables) for the statement that: “Baseline characteristics for general practices and patients were well balanced by trial and intervention (Tables 1 and 2).”</p>
              <p>15. Results: Line 375: Please provide a reference for the statement: “The mean practice IMD was 30.22 (SD 13.86), within the top quarter of UK social deprivation.”</p>
              <p>16. Results: Lines 429-441: For the following adjusted analyses (the main analyses describing effects of diabetes, risky prescribing, BP, and AF implementation package on outcomes) please also provide the unadjusted analyses.</p>
              <p>17. Results: Lines 445-447: For the following adjusted analyses (the analysis of the effect of risky prescribing implementation on adjusted prescribing levels) please also provide the unadjusted analyses.</p>
              <p>18. Results: Lines 462-463: Please revise to: “Supplementary Figures 1-4 present cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for the risky prescribing and blood pressure control implementation packages.” or similar.</p>
              <p>19. Discussion: Line 541-543: Please provide an in-text reference to Supplementary Table 1 (S1 Table) for the statement that there are fewer eligible patients in the risky prescribing/anticoagulation AF arms.</p>
              <p>20. Discussion: Please present and organize the Discussion as follows: a short, clear summary of the article's findings; what the study adds to existing research and where and why the results may differ from previous research; strengths and limitations of the study; implications and next steps for research, clinical practice, and/or public policy; one-paragraph conclusion.</p>
              <p>21. Discussion: Thank you for including the link to the ASPIRE protocol, found at the end of the Discussion, after the Author Summary. It may be helpful to refer to any prospective study/analysis protocol in the Methods section of the manuscript. Also, the link does not seem to work.

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Alex McConnachie</p>
              <p>Willis et al report on two cluster randomised trials of implementation packages delivered to general practices to improve diabetes control, risky prescribing, blood pressure control, and anticoagulation in AF. This review looks at the use of statistics in the paper.</p>
              <p>Overall, the trial design, statistical methods, and presentation of results are very good. My one minor point is that it appears that the primary results were judged at a significance level of 2.5%; this is not explained in the statistical methods, but is mentioned in the results. I presume the reason for this is that each trial involved the assessment of two interventions, so a 2.5% significance level was use to preserve an overall 5% Type I error rate. This should be explained in more detail in the methods section.</p>
              <p>However, it could also be argued that the significance level should be set at 1.25%, since the trial as a whole involved testing the effect of four interventions. On that basis, the effect of the risky prescribing intervention would not be considered statistically significant. Either way, with multiple primary analyses, a clearer description of how the authors controlled the false discovery rate should be given.</p>
              <p>Was there a statistical analysis plan? Has this been published, or should it be provided as a supplement?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This paper presents a trial that evaluates implementation science interventions for multiple evidence based indicators. I agree with the authors that this approach could be useful in the context of multiple morbidity.</p>
              <p>However, the paper includes a number of flaws. The main ones are: the aim or hypothesis is not stated; the nature of the 'adaptation' included in the intervention is not sufficiently specified; the statistical results are not correctly interpreted; consequently, the conclusions may not be justified.</p>
              <p>Abstract: This could be clearer. In particular the sentence on randomisation would naturally follow-on from the sentence on recruitment.</p>
              <p>Introduction: This is clear and succinct. More could have been made of multiple morbidity. The study appears to lack a clear aim or hypothesis. The final paragraph here, explains what was done but not the purpose.</p>
              <p>Methods: The study design could be explained more clearly. Initially, it says that this is 'two parallel cluster randomised trials using balanced incomplete block designs'. This should be explained more completely: what are the intervention and comparator trial arms in each trial. Why does this represent a balanced incomplete block design?</p>
              <p>Later it refers to 'two stage randomisation' which suggests a single trial , the written description is not clear though Figure 1 is. Looking at Figure 1, the design is clear but the research question is not.</p>
              <p>It appears that the no intervention control trial arm was not included in the protocol but was only added because recruitment exceeded expectations. The paper then says that the control group analysis will not be reported in this study. It may be best to focus this paper on what was in the protocol only.</p>
              <p>The software for the minimisation could be mentioned. Also, how allocation was concealed as distinct from blinding.</p>
              <p>The description of the intervention is generic. It is not made clear how the intervention package differed for each of the four trial arms. What are the comparisons being made? The title refers to an 'adaptable' intervention though the basis of adaptation is not mentioned in the methods.</p>
              <p>Under outcomes it refers to 'primary outcomes for each intervention arm'. Normally there is one primary outcome for a trial. Here there are four intervention arms, but the study comprises two trials.</p>
              <p>Multiple comparisons require additional discussion.</p>
              <p>Missing data: initially it says that missing data could not be assessed, then it says that data were assumed missing at random. Does it mean that not recorded values were assumed to be not performed for process items? Was imputation performed for values like blood pressure? or were complete case analyses performed it is not clear.</p>
              <p>Results: </p>
              <p>Page 24 lines 429 and 436 and 439, where it says 'no effect', 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' as Doug Altman pointed out. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485">https://www.bmj.com/content/311/7003/485</ext-link></p>
              <p>line 434, where it says 'statistically significant improvement. The paper should interpret P values following the ASA recommendations. Cut points such as P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.025 should not be used. Reporting should be based on ASA guidelines with not 'bright lines' for interpretation such as P&lt;0.025. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.XVpvSuhKiUk">https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108#.XVpvSuhKiUk</ext-link>
</p>
              <p>Similarly line 442 where it says 'no statistically significant effect'</p>
              <p>Line 443 where it says 'significantly improved one of the indicators', was adjustment made for multiple comparisons?</p>
              <p>In genereal insufficient details are provided for the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
              <p>Line 458 'the deterministic ICER for the BP packages indicates cost-effectiveness'. How can this be so when the intervention had 'no effect' (line 436).</p>
              <p>Discussion </p>
              <p>Again, the paper concludes that the intervention package had no effect for three out of four indicators, but this could be an 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence error'. Consequently, the conclusion may be too strong. Perhaps more evidence will show that an adaptive approach may be effective.</p>
              <p>The paper arrives at the conclusion that an adaptable intervention 'does not work' but it is not made clear from the analysis plan how the various comparisons that were made could lead to such a conclusion. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript describes the findings from a large implementation trial intended to improve quality in primary care for 4 common conditions. The authors went through a careful process of selecting performance measures that matter and designing an implementation package based on the best available evidence at the time. They then implemented this in a large number of GP practices, and assessed the fidelity of the intervention. No differences were seen in their primary outcomes except a decrease in what they term "risky prescribing", meaning a patient safety issue, from 6.0% to 4.9%. A cost effectiveness analysis showed that for this one target, their intervention was cost-effective. The authors conclude that "a one size-fits-all implementation package only worked for 1 in 4 indicators".</p>
              <p>The topic area of this manuscript - improving quality and safety in primary care - is high on the agenda for all health care systems. As someone who regularly reviews quality improvement publications as part of their scholarly activities, I can say with authority that this manuscript is a very high outlier in terms of the preparation and planning that went into the intervention and the way it is reported. </p>
              <p>Note I am not a cost-effectiveness analyst and so can make no informed critique of their methods or results in this regard.</p>
              <p>The results of the QI process must have come as a big disappointment to the investigators, and will be disappointing to readers as well, but these are results that have to be widely disseminated in order for ongoing and planned implementations to be changed now, to avoid continuing ineffective QI initiatives. </p>
              <p>I have only a few comments for the authors to consider, all in the discussion sections about "Why?" The first and most obvious is already touched on briefly by the authors, namely that of their primary outcomes, the risky prescribing measure is the easiest for a GP to do. For two other conditions the performance measure is an intermediate outcome (or even a composite of several intermediate outcomes), and therefore much harder for the GP to influence. The AF indicator is a process measure but one that requires 1) that the GP calculate the CHADS-VASC score (maybe the EHR already does this automatically - if so then the manuscript should make this point) AND 2) prescribe a medication known to have a certain risk to it, plus be a pain-in-the-rear-end for patients and practices to monitor: they are signing themselves up to regular monitoring of INR, unless they are going with a new oral agent, which i suspect at the time this trial was going would have been rare in UK GP practices. As opposed to the "risky prescribing" measure, which only required someone to choose paracetamol instead of an NSAID or add omeprazole if they go with the NSAID. So, I wonder if the authors want to discuss a little more the 'easiness' of meeting this measure as opposed to the others. I understand that the process measures for diabetes - also easy things to do - didn't have significant improvements in their intervention group (although they all were a little better in the intervention vs the control), but most of them are topped out, anyway, with not a lot of room for improvement. So I think there is more-than-a-hint that these data are compatible with the conclusion that influencing a process measure is easier than influencing an outcome measure. Perhaps the authors want to expand a little on this text in the discussion, right now it is two sentences and, to me, focuses on the wrong thing- namely that BP control requires 2 visits - instead of the much-more-difficult problem of finding a pharmaceutical that is both effective and acceptable to the patient. The current text also does not deal with the AF performance measure, which like the risky prescribing measure only requires the GP to add a medication. Why isn't adding warfarin as easy as adding omeprazole? Understanding why is key to understanding why their intervention had an effect for one and did not for the other.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I wonder whether the "patient safety" angle of the "risky prescribing" measure played a role. The other measures are all clinical quality, whereas the risky prescribing measure is a patient safety issue, making it perhaps more important in the GP's eyes.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I think a little more information about the EHR prompt is warranted. Have I concluded correctly that this was the only measure that had an EHR prompt included? And was the prompt a hard stop, requiring an over-ride, or a soft-stop, something easily blown through by the GP? Judging by the size of the effect, I am assuming a soft stop. These data are also consistent with a conclusion that EHR prompts work for simple actions, which the authors note, but some more information about the prompt, and why there wasn't a prompt for the warfarin measure, would help readers understand when a prompt might work (I am presuming this is because the NSAID prompt was triggered by the e-prescribing of an NSAID, which the EHR can then assess against age, concomitant cytoprotection, GFR, and concomitant warfarin, whereas the AF measures would require an alert to be triggered by something else much more complex. The authors cite another trial in this regard, but rather than make readers go look up that trial they would benefit from a sentence or two about what makes one easy and the other complex).</p>
              <p>Lastly, there is the question of additional incentives. When practices are already being paid via QOF for doing a host of things, how much mental energy is left over to participate in something where they aren't getting more payments for doing the "thing"?</p>
              <p>So...bottom line, an important study with important (but disappointing) findings, that in my view would benefit from a couple hundred extra words from the authors speculating about why they think some aspects did and did not work as expected.</p>

              <p>6. Abstract: Line 108-109: Please revise this sentence to: “We used ‘opt-out’ recruitment, and practices that did not opt out were randomly assigned to to an implementation package…”</p>
              <p>7. Abstract: Line 123-124: Please describe the confounds for which you adjusted.</p>
              <p>8. Abstract: Line 127: Rather than saying that the implementation package “had no effect on other primary endpoints”, please provide the adjusted ORs ( with CIs and p values) for all four primary comparisons from Table 3.</p>
              <p>9. Abstract: Conclusions: Your conclusion only touches on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Can you please include your main conclusions regarding the primary endpoint (i.e. adherence is your registered primary endpoint, and the description above in the abstract describes specific patient-level primary endpoints that could be discussed). At Line 135, please avoid using the term “relatively cost-effective”; instead, please use quantitative terms to describe cost-effectiveness.</p>

              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Having reread the paper, and the authors' responses to my and the other reviewers' comments, I am happy with the changes that have been made. I have no further comments to make.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The revision has generally responded to the review comments.</p>
              <p>In the Abstract where it reads: 'The implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio 0.82; 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 126 0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year but had no effect on other primary endpoints. No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without gastro-protection in patient aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% 130 CI 0.39 to 0.99; p = 0.021). '</p>
              <p>It appears that the abstract is reporting only those results that are associated with P values less than 0.025, whereas the other outcomes are referred to as having 'no significant effects'. It would be preferable to report each of the primary outcomes in the Abstract.</p>
              <p>The ASA guidelines on P values make the recommendation that 'Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.' The authors justify their approach with respect to the analysis plan, but it would be preferable to follow the ASA recommendation. Rather than saying there was 'no effect', there was 'insufficient evidence of effect', I expect the authors do not want to add to the catalogue of 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' errors.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: I don't have any remaining issues with this manuscript and would proceed with accepting it.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Willis, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the academic editor, Dr. Sanjay Basu, I am delighted to inform you that your manuscript entitled "An adaptable implementation package targeting evidence-based indicators in primary care: a pragmatic cluster-randomised evaluation" (PMEDICINE-D-19-02682R2) has been accepted for publication in PLOS Medicine. </p>
              <p>PRODUCTION PROCESS</p>
              <p>Before publication you will see the copyedited word document (in around 1-2 weeks from now) and a PDF galley proof shortly after that. The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at the copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors.</p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>A selection of our articles each week are press released by the journal. You will be contacted nearer the time if we are press releasing your article in order to approve the content and check the contact information for journalists is correct. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximize its impact. </p>
              <p>PROFILE INFORMATION</p>
              <p>Now that your manuscript has been accepted, please log into EM and update your profile.
