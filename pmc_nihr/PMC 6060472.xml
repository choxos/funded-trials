                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">In hospital, staff need to routinely monitor patients to identify those who are seriously ill, so that they receive timely treatment to improve their condition. A Paediatric Early Warning System is a multi-faceted socio-technical system to detect deterioration in children, which may or may not include a track and trigger tool. It functions to monitor, detect and prompt an urgent response to signs of deterioration, with the aim of preventing morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to develop an evidence-based improvement programme to optimise the effectiveness of Paediatric Early Warning Systems in different inpatient contexts, and to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the programme in predicting deterioration and triggering timely interventions.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study will be conducted in two district and two specialist children’s hospitals. It deploys an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) design in conjunction with ethnographic cases studies with embedded process evaluation. Informed by Translational Mobilisation Theory and Normalisation Process Theory, the study is underpinned by a functions based approach to improvement. Workstream (1) will develop an evidence-based improvement programme to optimise Paediatric Early Warning System based on systematic reviews. Workstream (2) consists of observation and recording outcomes in current practice in the four sites, implementation of the improvement programme and concurrent process evaluation, and evaluation of the impact of the programme. Outcomes will be mortality and critical events, unplanned admission to Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU) or Paediatric High Dependency Unit (PHDU), cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, medical emergencies requiring immediate assistance, reviews by PICU staff, and critical deterioration, with qualitative evidence of the impact of the intervention on Paediatric Early Warning System and learning from the implementation process.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This paper presents the background, rationale and design for this mixed methods study. This will be the most comprehensive study of Paediatric Early Warning Systems and the first to deploy a functions-based approach to improvement in the UK with the aim to improve paediatric patient safety and reduce mortality. Our findings will inform recommendations about the safety processes for every hospital treating paediatric in-patients across the NHS.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par26">The UK paediatric mortality rate is the highest in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is evidence suggesting that missed deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and difference in hospital performance contribute to outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Research in the adult care context identified that acute in-hospital deterioration is often preceded by a period of physiological instability which, when recognised, provides an opportunity for earlier intervention, and improved outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">In the adult context, the Royal College of Physicians endorsed the implementation of a National Early Warning track and trigger tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to standardise the assessment of acute illness severity, predicting that 6000 lives will be saved. The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) recommends that Trusts in England use a track and trigger tool to reduce harm to patients and avail of lower insurance premiums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) (now NHS NHS Commissioning Board Special Health Authority) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] also advocate the use of a track and trigger tool as part of an early warning system. A ‘Track and Trigger tool’ (TTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] consists of sequential recording and monitoring of physiological, clinical and observational data. When a certain score or trigger is reached then a clinical action should occur including, but not limited to, altered frequency of observation, senior review or more appropriate treatment or management. Tools may be paper-based or electronic and monitoring can be automated or undertaken manually by staff.</p>
              <p id="Par28">There is currently limited evidence to support TTT use in paediatrics. The variation in accepted physiological normal ranges for respiratory and heart rate and blood pressure across the age range, make it challenging to develop a standardised tool suitable for generic application for all hospitalised children. Some single site studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reviewed the performance of individual TTTs, with preliminary data on the sensitivity of different cut-offs for physiological measurements. However, it was difficult to prove an ‘effect’ based on the outcome measures described, since the event rate of in hospital cardiac arrest or death is low. Even if agreement existed on a particular TTT, this needs to be acted upon in everyday clinical practice and there is considerable variation in the systems and processes in place through which this is achieved and which may be consequential for effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par29">TTTs are commonly part of wider Paediatric Early Warning System, which in turn are always part of a wider clinical and organisational context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] with a singular workplace history, culture, division of labour, skill-mix, infrastructure, workload, case-mix, leadership, resources, and specialist expertise, which may be consequential for effectiveness. There is currently wide variability in use of TTTs in practice. For example, recent work has reviewed TTTs throughout the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Out of a possible 157 in-patient units, information was obtained from 149 (95%) hospitals. 85% of units were using a TTT but there was huge variability in the tool being used and most of these were unpublished and un-validated. The current ad hoc utilisation of un-validated TTTs and variance in organisational capacity to respond to a deteriorating child may represent a serious clinical risk.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Over 700,000 children are admitted to hospital overnight in the UK annually with 8000 admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) as an emergency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Half of these admissions to PICU are from wards in the same hospital, suggesting that patients deteriorated acutely or had a cardiopulmonary arrest. Missed or delayed instances of deterioration identification in hospital are “failures in care” with a physiological, psychological and social cost to the child and family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is significant short-term added cost to the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] from rising cost of litigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the current national and global financial climate the NHS is under severe pressure to make yearly cost savings. For a society that values its NHS highly, this is widely recognised to be a situation that needs to be reversed. It is estimated that 1951 child deaths in the UK would need to be prevented each year to compare with the best performers in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">The CEMACH report (2008) identified the need for all health care professionals to be able to recognise serious illness in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It noted that not only did this involve good clinical skills and awareness of limitations but also good communication. The report highlighted identifiable failures in a child’s direct care in “…just over a a quarter deaths, and potentially avoidable factors in a further 43% of deaths.” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It was from this report that a recommendation for TTTs to be used in all hospitals was made. Recently the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), National Children’s Bureau and British Association for Child and Adolescent Public Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] have examined data on childhood deaths and focused specifically on interventions which may have an effect through policy and practice changes. Although health care amenable deaths appear to have fallen since the CEMACH report they are still very prevalent. Data available up to early 2013 showed in 3857 completed reviews 21% of the deaths had modifiable factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although these were not all as result of failure to recognise the deteriorating child, the scale of the problem, given the UK’s poor record on childhood mortality, is significant. The report specifically concluded:</p>
              <p id="Par32">“<italic>It is important that measures are taken to improve recognition and management of serious illness across the health service – both primary and secondary care; community and hospital; general practice, paediatrics, and mental health</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The report noted that comparative data between countries is extremely difficult to interpret but that significant discrepancies exist in the UK compared to the rest of Europe in respect of mortality.</p>
              <p id="Par33">There is, as yet, no consensus on the utility of the currently available TTTs and there is variance in monitoring of children and young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], training to aid recognition and response to deterioration and mechanisms to ensure best practice. Children admitted to hospital, and their families should have the expectation of excellent care. Therefore research that aims to reduce missed deterioration and prevent avoidable mortality, as well as limiting un-necessary NHS added cost and litigation (from failure to rescue), is both relevant and timely. A recent systematic review highlighted limited evidence for the validity and utility of TTTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and therefore there is an urgent national need to develop an evidence based approach to improving Paediatric Early Warning Systems in UK practice and produce guidance to inform National bodies (such as NICE, NHSLA, RCPCH, RCN) in order to improve patient safety within the NHS.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The aim of this study is to develop an evidence-based improvement programme to optimise the effectiveness of a Paediatric Early Warning System, evaluate its feasibility and potential effectiveness in improving the prediction of deterioration and triggering timely interventions, and identify factors necessary to ensure successful implementation and normalisation.</p>

It aims to develop an evidence based programme to improve Paediatric Early Warning Systems, evaluate its feasibility and potential effectiveness in improving the detection of deterioration and triggering timely interventions, and identify the factors necessary to ensure successful implementation and normalisation. The study is underpinned by a functions-based approach to intervention development. In other words, “the function and process of the intervention should be standardised, not the components themselves” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

                  <p id="Par47">A prospective mixed method, before and after study design with ITS core outcome evaluation and embedded ethnographic case studies in four hospitals.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">The ITS design is an effective quasi-experimental design and an alternative to the randomized controlled trial. Because it avoids the potential biases in the estimation of intervention by considering the time series factors, such as seasonal trends and autocorrelation, it is increasingly adopted in the evaluation of health care interventions, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are not feasible.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">The effectiveness of the improvement programme in optimising the Paediatric Early Warning System will be assessed by examining the core outcomes defined in the statistical section below. The primary analysis of the outcomes will be an interrupted time series for each of the four hospitals. This aims to identify a change in the rate of outcomes that are potentially attributable to the introduction of the programme to improve the Paediatric Early Warning System. The interrupted time series is adopted here for the main quantitative analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">The embedded ethnographic case studies conducted within each phase of the study will evaluate usual Paediatric Early Warning System practice, the process of implementation, and the impact of the improvement programme on the Paediatric Early Warning System post implementation.</p>

                  <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                  <p id="Par55">Healthcare improvement initiatives involve introducing interventions into complex social-technical systems. The dynamic nature of different technical, social, institutional and political factors affects the mechanisms by which an intervention has its effect. Interventions are ‘actors’ or ‘events’ within a system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which afford or constrain healthcare processes, require particular preconditions to work effectively, and interact with other technologies, people and processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In simple terms, the way in which an intervention interacts with each context affects its function.</p>
                  <p id="Par56">Thus, in developing, evaluating and implementing any intervention it is important to take into account relevant contextual features in order to establish the local modifications necessary to ensure sustainability and success, and to do this it is essential that an intervention’s generative mechanisms (its functions) are understood and can be articulated.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">The study design is therefore informed by the premise that implementing interventions in real world settings requires consistency in process and function, rather than form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Instead of standardising intervention components (e.g. a TTT, education workshops, a handover tool for nurses and doctors), standardisation should occur in the change process or key functions that these components aim to achieve. For example, “a handover tool for nurses and doctors” is better regarded as a mechanism to ensure key patient information is communicated between professionals. This mechanism could then take on different forms according to local context, while still achieving the same goal.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">In addition, in order to think systematically about improving Paediatric Early Warning Systems and the socio-technical contexts into which an improvement programme will be introduced, we will deploy Translational Mobilisation Theory (TMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. TMT is a practice theory which builds on ecological approaches to work, activity theory and Actor Network Theory to describe projects of goal-oriented collective action in conditions of emergence and complexity. ‘Projects’ are the basic unit of analysis in TMT and refer to an institutionally sanctioned socio-material network of time-bounded cooperative action and actors that follows a trajectory in time and space: in this case the detection of physiological deterioration and timely intervention in the care of sick children. Projects are given their form by Strategic Action Fields (SAF) which generate the institutional contexts in which projects are progressed and which provide the socio-material resources for collective action. The importance of understanding context for quality improvement purposes is well established. TMT provides a framework to support systematic attention to the salient features that condition projects of social action and which are likely to be consequential for the success or failure of an intervention. TMT directs attention to the mechanisms through which projects of collective action are mobilised - object formation (how actors create the objects of their practice), reflexive monitoring (practices through which actors evaluate a field of action to generate awareness of project trajectories), articulation work (practices that assemble and align the diverse elements through which object trajectories and projects of collective action are mobilised), translation (practices that enable practice objects to be shared and differing viewpoints, local contingencies, and multiple interests to be accommodated in order to enable concerted action), sense-making (practices though which actors order, construct, and mobilise projects and enact structures and institutions).</p>
                  <p id="Par59">Normalisation process theory (NPT), which has a high degree of conceptual affinity with this underlying theoretical framework, will provide an additional theoretical lens to inform tool implementation and the evaluation of this process. NPT is concerned with ‘how and why things become, or don’t become, routine and normal components of everyday work’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and it defines four mechanisms that shape the social processes of implementation, embedding and integrating ensembles of social practices. These are interrelated and dynamic domains and include: ‘coherence’ (the extent to which an intervention is understood as meaningful, achievable and desirable); ‘cognitive participation’ (the enrolment of those actors necessary to deliver the intervention, which, for our purposes can be human and non-human); ‘collective action’ (the work that brings the intervention into use); and ‘reflexive monitoring’ (the ongoing process of adjusting the intervention to keep it in place). We will use these domains as a framework to analyse the contextual factors necessary for integration into routine work organisation (normalisation). NPT and TMT are relatively new theories and we will be open to the possibility of contributing to their refinement in the light of our findings.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par60">The recent survey of paediatric units in the UK reported that 90% of tertiary units and 83% of District General Hospitals (DGH’s) already had a tack and trigger tool in place. A convenience sample of paediatric units was selected for the study to represent types of unit and those with and without a TTT in place. These four hospitals represent paediatric inpatient units of varying size; two specialist children’s hospitals with PICUs and two large DGHs (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). No studies so far have involved a DGH environment. It is important if a Paediatric Early Warning System is going to be used throughout UK we can capture this environment, where most children are admitted.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of participating hospitals</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>

                  <p id="Par108">Our concern will be with understanding the network of actors: people, processes, technologies and artefacts, and their interrelationships in each Paediatric Early Warning System. Drawing on our theoretical framework, the literature review, we will develop a template to guide our observations and interviews. Data generation will not be absolutely constrained by this however; rather in each case the strategy will be to ‘follow the actors’ (human and non-human). This will ensure that there is a consistent approach across case studies to facilitate comparative analyses, but flexibility to modify data generation in response to the singular features of each site. We will focus on what participants do, the tools they use, the concepts they deploy, and consider what these practices reveal about what they know and the factors that facilitate and constrain action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Adopting a TMT lens will direct attention to the socio-material relationships within each Paediatric Early Warning System and the impact of the local institutional context in conditioning the possibilities for action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par109">Observations will be undertaken over a period of up to six weeks in each case, in order to give sites sufficient time to become accustomed to having a researcher in their midst, and so we can develop an accurate understanding of normal practice. Observations will be conducted at different times of day/night and on different days of the week, including weekends, to ensure a range of time periods are covered.</p>
                  <p id="Par110">In addition we will also undertake 6–8 interviews with parents/carers to explore their views and experiences (<italic>n</italic> = 32) and semi-structured digitally-recorded interviews with a sample of clinical staff and relevant service managers (<italic>n</italic> = 48). Audio recordings will be transcribed verbatim and analysed to explore each Paediatric Early Warning System at micro, meso and macro levels. The aim will be to develop a clear description and understanding of the local Paediatric Early Warning Systems in each case.</p>
                  <p id="Par111">Observations will be recorded contemporaneously as low inference-style field notes and expanded on as soon as practical after the data was collected. Interviews will be digitally recorded with consent, and will be organised to take place either in private offices or by telephone. Interviews with a purposively selected sample of parents who have a physiologically unstable child will be undertaken when the child is still an in-patient, but at a time when their condition is considered by clinical staff to be stable. For the purposes of this study we will not include parents whose child has died but will interview parents whose (a) child has been monitored only (b) received intervention to prevent deterioration (c) had a critical event. Documents/records will be treated as both a resource and a topic. Their content will be analysed to inform our understanding of organisational processes and practices. Their form will be analysed in order to develop a better understanding of their design and affordances and inter-relationships.</p>
                  <p id="Par112">We will replicate this ethnographic process (both non-participant observations and interviews) following implementation of the programme, modifying the interview style and content, as well as the primary focus of the observations, in order to explore in detail staff experiences of the system, factors consequential for impact, and any unintended consequences. We will also reassess the Paediatric Early Warning System using the structured template as a guide to observation, in order to analyse changes in these relationships brought about by the improvement programme, and the implications this has for normalisation.</p>

Each of the four centres will have a local Principal Investigator (PI) acting as a study champion for the implementation of the improvement programme. The systematic review will be used to identify those factors that appear to support the normalisation of changes to the Paediatric Early Warning Systems in practice and we will draw on these materials to inform our improvement programme.

Interviews will be arranged to fit around the clinical responsibilities of service providers and can be undertaken either face to face or by telephone.

With the event rate of unplanned admission to PICU (206/20696 = 1%) and the monthly admission to hospital overnight from historical data from two of our sites (one tertiary one DGH), we obtained the monthly prevalence of unplanned admission to PICU at pre-intervention stage. Tibbals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] have shown that implementation of calling criteria (similar to a track and trigger tool) with a rapid response team resulted in a risk ratio of 0.65 in terms of total avoidable hospital mortality. We assumed that the implementation of the new intervention package will result in a similar risk ratio. For comparing the pre- and post- intervention monthly events, this results in a potential the effect size of 2.8 with mean difference 2.0 and common standard deviation 0.7. With effect size at least 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], a total of 24-month observations (12-month pre-intervention phase and 12-month post-intervention phase) would give this study 90% power. Given the potential for seasonal effects, we have taken this as a conservative approach for the sample size.</p>

This aims to identify a change in the monthly rate of mortality and the following critical events; unplanned admission to PICU or PHDU, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, medical emergencies requiring immediate assistance (arrest calls who were not respiratory or cardiac arrests), reviews by PICU staff and critical deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. First-order autocorrelation will be tested by using the Durbin-Watson statistic, and higher-order autocorrelations will be investigated by using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function. As some hospitals will switch from paper-based systems to electronic-based systems, this factor will be added in the models accordingly to accommodate the impact of the change. The changes of level and of slope at the adjacent time point between pre-implementation and post-implementation phases will be analysed and we will conclude the effectiveness of the intervention if either of these two changes is statistically significant at a 5% level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>

In the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.picanet.org.uk/">Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network</ext-link> (PICANET) database, the relevant information for this outcome is collected in calendar days.

              <p id="Par143">This paper presents the background, rationale and design for this mixed methods study examining the evidence for an evidenced based programme to improve Paediatric Early Warning Systems with evaluation of its potential effectiveness. This will be the most comprehensive study of Paediatric Early Warning Systems in the UK, and the first to be underpinned by a functions-based approach to intervention development, with the aim to improve paediatric patient safety and reduce mortality. Our findings will inform recommendations about safety processes that should be established in every hospital treating paediatric in-patients across the NHS.</p>
              <sec id="Sec24">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par144">Mortality is fortunately an infrequent outcome in acute paediatrics in the UK. This study may not have sufficient numbers of patients to be able to show the impact on mortality of a systems approach to improve patients’ safety. There will be a large number of secondary outcomes both qualitatively and quantitatively, which are likely to show change over time. The functions-based Paediatric Early Warning System programme is new and a radical challenge to orthodox approaches to improvement, which typically focus on the implementation of discrete interventions. Furthermore, implementing a system-wide programme of improvement is likely to be challenging in a cost constrained NHS. It will be important that any recommendations are practical and feasible. An assessment of the feasibility of such an approach will be a key outcome of the study.</p>
