                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Growing evidence suggests that experiences in the early years play a major role in children’s development in terms of health, wellbeing and educational attainment. The Trial of healthy relationship initiatives for the very early years (THRIVE) aims to evaluate two antenatal group interventions, <italic>Enhanced Triple P for Baby</italic> and <italic>Mellow Bumps</italic>, designed for those with additional health or social care needs in pregnancy. As both interventions aim to improve maternal mental health and parenting skills, we hypothesise that in the longer term, participation may lead to an improvement in children’s life trajectories.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">THRIVE is a three-arm, longitudinal, randomised controlled trial aiming to recruit 500 pregnant women with additional health or social care needs. Participants will be referred by health and social care professionals, predominately midwives. Consenting participants will be block randomised to one of the three arms: <italic>Enhanced Triple P for Baby</italic> plus care as usual, <italic>Mellow Bumps</italic> plus care as usual or care as usual. Groups will commence when participants are between 20 and 34 weeks pregnant.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The population we aim to recruit are traditionally referred to as “hard to reach”, therefore we will monitor referrals received from maternity and social care pathways and will be open to innovation to boost referral rates. We will set geographically acceptable group locations for participants, to limit challenges we foresee for group participation and retention. We anticipate the results of the trial will help inform policy and practice in supporting women with additional health and social care needs during antenatal and early postnatal periods. This is currently a high priority for the Scottish and UK Governments.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par43">Emerging neuroscience evidence suggests that the interactions between a child and their mother, particularly from conception to age 3 years, greatly influence the development of the child’s “base for competence and coping skills that will affect learning, behaviour and health throughout life” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Women with additional health and social care needs in pregnancy (for instance, due to domestic abuse, mental health problems, an addiction, having been in state care, etc.) are likely to be more anxious, depressed and have higher levels of circulating stress-related hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which can (1) create adverse epigenetic modifications to the developing foetus that permanently affect the baby’s response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and (2) independently disrupt the mother’s ability to be sensitive to her baby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Both these pathways may adversely affect the mother-infant interaction. In addition, both poor mother-infant interaction and maternal mental ill health strongly predict child maltreatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and a disadvantaged trajectory for children in terms of their future social, emotional and cognitive development and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, postnatal interventions may not be able to undo all of the changes resulting from maladaptive coping in adverse circumstances during pregnancy.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Sensitive mother-infant interactions are characterised by reciprocal communication from an early stage, which facilitates language but also significantly reduces the risks of maltreatment. This is thought to be due to mothers perceiving their infants as co-operating with them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Mother-infant interactions that succeed in facilitating secure future attachments enable overall development, including language, and may set infants onto a more positive life trajectory. The evidence for the effect of early child development on health and wellbeing in later life is widely accepted and early childhood interventions, such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the USA Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the Carolina Abecedarian Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Chicago Child-Parent Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], have had positive effects on a number of child development domains and on wellbeing and life success in adulthood. Furthermore, early intervention, is generally more cost-effective than intervening later, and is most effective in the antenatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, many applied economic evaluations in the area of home visiting and parenting have had diverse economic objectives and methodological problems including the lack of a societal perspective and limited cost analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par45">We hypothesise that the provision of a parenting support intervention, <italic>Enhanced Triple P for Baby</italic> (ETPB) or <italic>Mellow Bumps</italic> (MB), in addition to routinely provided care during the antenatal and early postnatal phase, will be a cost-effective way of improving maternal mental health, increasing the dyadic synchronicity and sensitivity of mother-infant interactions, reducing the risk of child maltreatment and improving child language and socio-emotional development. The Trial of healthy relationship initiatives for the very early years (THRIVE) is a three-arm, randomised controlled trial of women with additional health and social care needs in pregnancy aiming to compare ETPB plus care-as-usual (CAU) or MB plus CAU with CAU. Based on recent economic evaluation research carried out on a similar trial in Oxfordshire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], THRIVE will include a comprehensive economic evaluation.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par59">THRIVE is a three-arm, randomised controlled trial of 500 participants with additional health and social care needs in pregnancy, classified by National Health Service Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHS GGC) Special Needs in Pregnancy service (SNiPs) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (e.g., domestic violence, mental illness, a history of substance misuse, being looked after in local authority care or criminal justice involvement). Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three trial arms: ETPB plus CAU, MB plus CAU or CAU alone. All participants and their infants will continue to receive their antenatal and postnatal CAU according to local NHS and local authority guidelines.</p>
              <p id="Par60">THRIVE is sponsored by NHS GGC Health Board (Reference GN12KH589; NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, Research and Development Management Office, West Glasgow Ambulatory Care Hospital, Dalnair Street, Glasgow), which is responsible for ensuring that THRIVE is managed “according to the Research Governance Framework for Health and Community Care (Second edition, 2006) and World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects”. The study is subject to audit by the NHS GGC Health Board at any time during the trial. In addition, the University of Glasgow Medical Research Council/Chief Scientist Office Social and Public Health Science Unit (MRC/CSO SPHSU) has standard operating procedures that include auditing of ongoing studies.</p>

                  <title>Enhanced Triple P for Baby (ETPB)</title>
                  <p id="Par73">ETPB, informed by social learning theory, is an intervention designed to facilitate a smooth transition to parenthood for expectant parents by reducing the impact of known risk factors for perinatal distress and difficulties. It aims to provide infants with a healthy start to life by offering parenting skills training as well as psychological coping skills training to parents to enhance parental and infant wellbeing. In addition to focusing on practical parenting and coping skills, group sessions encourage participants to work with their partner or a supportive individual to develop and explore strategies needed to maintain more harmonious family relationships. Each participant’s partner or supportive other is invited to all of the group sessions but participants without support are not excluded. The programme offers four 2-h antenatal group sessions in a community setting and up to three individual 1-h postnatal sessions delivered face-to-face in the woman’s home. The programme is completed with a final 2-h postnatal group session. Antenatal sessions are scheduled to begin before the woman is 34 weeks pregnant, and the postnatal sessions are delivered after their infant is 6 weeks old. ETPB was developed at the Parenting and Family Support Center at the University of Queensland, Australia. Triple P interventions, provided by Triple P International (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.triplep.net">http://www.triplep.net</ext-link>), are delivered to parents in five different levels of intensity, the efficacy and effectiveness of which have been cited in numerous studies and randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. More recently, however, there has been a call for more registered independent trials (with pre-specified main outcomes), such as THRIVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                <sec id="Sec7">
                  <title>Mellow Bumps (MB)</title>
                  <p id="Par74">MB is underpinned by attachment theory and aims to encourage nurturing and attuned relationships between the mother and developing infant. MB is intended to decrease maternal antenatal stress levels, increase expectant mothers’ understanding of the neonates’ capacity for social interaction and emphasise the importance of early interaction in enhancing brain development and attachment. Participants are encouraged to identify potential sources of stress and work through how to manage these, reflect upon and identify sources of positive social support and to identify barriers to good parenting. The programme offers seven 2-h antenatal group sessions and one 2-h postnatal group session. Antenatal sessions begin when participants are between 20 and 30 weeks pregnant, and the postnatal sessions are delivered when infants are between 6 and 12 weeks old. Partners and/or supportive others are invited to attend one antenatal session. MB was developed by a charity, Mellow Parenting (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mellowparenting.org">http://mellowparenting.org</ext-link>), based in Govan, Glasgow. Evidence for Mellow Parenting programmes is small-scale but encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Care-as-usual (CAU)</title>
                  <p id="Par75">All participants in this study will continue to receive their routine antenatal and postnatal care. Generally, this involves care from hospital and community-based healthcare specialists, such as midwives, obstetricians and health visitors. The exact care received by each participant will depend on their individual additional health and social care needs and may also engage services from other sources including social work services and voluntary agencies. All care received will be in line with local authority and Government policy and guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The specific services accessed by each participant as part of their CAU will be captured in service use diaries.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">Participants randomised to the CAU arm of the trial will not be offered either intervention (ETPB or MB) in THRIVE on completion of data collection. However, participants may access Triple P International and Mellow Parenting programs as part of their CAU, where these are offered through social work or third-sector organisations within NHS GGC and NHS A&amp;A. Uptake of other parenting programmes outside of THRIVE will be captured in the service use diary.</p>

                <title>Trial group organisation</title>
                <p id="Par77">Post randomisation the group sessions will be organised by administrative staff within the trial research team and delivered in community settings, such as local supermarket community rooms or hospital antenatal education rooms. A taxi service will be provided, first, to ensure safe transport of participants to and from the group venue sessions and second, with the aim of reducing anticipated transportation barriers and thereby supporting attendance. The trial administrator will contact participants by phone or text to invite them to sessions, with reminders sent on the day of each group session to maximise group attendance. Attendance at each session will be recorded in an attendance register by group facilitators.</p>
                <p id="Par78">Participation in all aspects of THRIVE will be voluntary, and some participants may choose not to attend any or to attend only some of the group sessions. In these situations, the research team will seek to record the reason for non-attendance. For MB, participants who do not attend either of the first two group sessions will not be invited to subsequent sessions, but will still be eligible for follow-up data collection. For ETPB, participants will be invited to all antenatal group sessions regardless of attendance at previous sessions.</p>
                <p id="Par79">THRIVE group facilitators will be independent of the trial, have a variety of health and social care professional backgrounds, and be employed by NHS GGC and NHS A&amp;A. In order to avoid contamination between intervention arms in the trial group, facilitators will be randomly allocated to deliver only one intervention, the only exception being those with prior knowledge of an intervention - in this instance they will be allocated to deliver that intervention. Training will be conducted by qualified trainers from the host organisation of each intervention.</p>

A broader societal perspective will also be adopted to allow for the possibility of costs and outcomes arising beyond the NHS and PSS, such as housing, education, employment and justice. To facilitate measurement of data on resource use, all participants will be asked to keep a service use diary recording attendance at NHS, social care, local authority and voluntary organisations for both mother and child. The diary will be used as an aide memoir to collect mother and child data between baseline and follow up, and will be used to measure additional and unintentional cost burden/savings associated with the intervention. Participants will additionally be asked to complete a health and social care resource-use questionnaire at follow up based on the same information as the diary.</p>
                <p id="Par107">Up-to-date unit costs will be attached to quantities of resource use to generate mean costs per study participant.

This trial aspect will rely on linking published associative data and any short-term primary outcomes identified in the trial with long-term costs and benefits in health and education, and other effects such as the effect on employment. Routine data, such as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] collected by health and social care professionals when the child is around 30 months old, will facilitate the measurement of longer-term outcomes including social and emotional wellbeing, language development, educational attainment, incidences of maltreatment or neglect and placement of children onto the “risk register”/into child protection services. Future linkage will also assess the costs of health, social care and broader education and employment impacts.

Our quantitative data collection procedure will consist of completing repeat questionnaires with trained researchers (including Good Clinical Practice training), all of whom will have undergone criminal background checks and have significant experience of working with vulnerable groups. Whilst the questionnaire consists of well-established measures that are not known to be problematic, it is possible that participants may become upset whilst completing the questionnaires. All researchers will receive training in how to handle participant distress and will follow NHS guidance relating to patient confidentiality and protection, including vulnerable adult and child protection procedures. A “useful contacts” sheet will be given to all participants to signpost them to relevant service providers.</p>

                  <p id="Par141">We will be working with vulnerable women at a sensitive period in their lives, and some activities, such as being asked to reflect upon past experiences, may have the potential to cause distress: however, other research suggests asking about adverse childhood events does not cause measurable distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Furthermore, we believe that this risk is minimal because both interventions are designed to reduce stress through positive action and the development of coping strategies. In addition, the group facilitators will undergo training to work with this group of women and will be able to provide empathetic support and signpost participants to services should they require additional support. The group dynamics may help to reduce stress/distress to participants by providing a supportive and considerate atmosphere in which issues can be discussed. However, it must be recognised that the delivery of ETPB and MB within group settings carries a risk that participants might choose to discuss issues raised with others outside of the group setting. As the focus of the group sessions is more on activities and active discussion rather than disclosing personal histories, the risk of this occurring is low. Nevertheless, to promote respect and confidentiality amongst participants the intervention facilitators will work with them to establish group rules about confidentiality, especially in relation to social media. Furthermore, the bringing together of vulnerable participants may result in the formation of positive or negative group interactions and social networks. Group facilitators will be given the adequate support and resources necessary to signpost participants to appropriate services. At all times, groups facilitators will adhere to NHS guidance relating to patient confidentiality and protection, including vulnerable adult and child protection procedures, and report any concerns about participants to both the PM and their line manager at the NHS GGC Clinical Research Facility; the CI will also be kept informed and be able to influence decision-making.</p>

As previously discussed, structures are in place for group practitioners and researchers to follow should incidents occur relating to the safety of participants and/or their children. When there is a health risk or medical emergency, procedures will be followed including alerting emergency services, GPs or social work services as appropriate. Incidents of this nature, or serious adverse events (SAEs), will always be reported to the PM who will inform the CI.</p>

              <p id="Par155">THRIVE will explore if women with additional health and social care needs and their infants benefit from participating in group-based antenatal and early postnatal interventions plus CAU more than from CAU alone, and whether these interventions are cost-effective. The interventions are ETPB and MB (see “The interventions”). In particular, we aim to investigate if the interventions in addition to CAU can improve maternal mental health and mother-infant relationships relative to receiving routine care alone.</p>
              <p id="Par156">The participants we aim to recruit are traditionally described as a “hard to reach” population, and THRIVE will be one of the largest definitive trials to date in this population in the perinatal period. We will be monitoring referrals by midwives and social care pathways and be open to innovation to increase the number of referrals and their quality (in terms of eligibility for the trial and communication of referral criteria).</p>
              <p id="Par157">We anticipate the results of the trial will add to the literature on perinatal help and help inform policy and practice in supporting women with additional health and social care needs during antenatal and early postnatal periods.</p>

                <p id="Par160">MH is the Chief Investigator for THRIVE and has overall responsibility for its conduct. MH has extensive experience as a grant holder, of running trials and the development and evaluations of complex interventions for vulnerable populations. AW, a Senior Lecturer in Clinical Psychology and a clinical psychologist, has experience in perinatal clinical psychology and maternal mental health and will manage the coding of mother-infant interaction in the trial. KB, in conjunction with DW, is the strategic lead on the process evaluation. KB and DW have extensive experience of conducting process evaluations of complex social interventions. EM is an experienced health economist, having led on the economic evaluation of the UK trial of The Oxfordshire Home Visiting Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and will lead the economic evaluation element of THRIVE. AM will manage randomisation, the database and processing, statistical analysis and reporting. As the THRIVE lead statistician AM will also hold an active role on the Data Monitoring Committee. PW conducted a pilot study of MB in NHS A&amp;A and NHS GGC, which provided significant information contributing to the design of THRIVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The remaining co-investigators have a wealth of experience in a diverse range of fields including infant mental health, child protection issues, infant language development and parenting. They also provide links to the NHS GGC that will be vital in supporting MH and the research team to meet the trial outcomes and objectives.</p>
