                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Depression is usually managed in primary care, but most antidepressant trials are of patients from secondary care mental health services, with eligibility criteria based on diagnosis and severity of depressive symptoms. Antidepressants are now used in a much wider group of people than in previous regulatory trials. We investigated the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in patients in primary care with depressive symptoms ranging from mild to severe and tested the role of severity and duration in treatment response.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The PANDA study was a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of patients from 179 primary care surgeries in four UK cities (Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York). We included patients aged 18 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms of any severity or duration in the past 2 years, where there was clinical uncertainty about the benefit of an antidepressant. This strategy was designed to improve the generalisability of our sample to current use of antidepressants within primary care. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a remote computer-generated code to sertraline or placebo, and were stratified by severity, duration, and site with random block length. Patients received one capsule (sertraline 50 mg or placebo orally) daily for one week then two capsules daily for up to 11 weeks, consistent with evidence on optimal dosages for efficacy and acceptability. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 6 weeks after randomisation, measured by Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item version (PHQ-9) scores. Secondary outcomes at 2, 6 and 12 weeks were depressive symptoms and remission (PHQ-9 and Beck Depression Inventory-II), generalised anxiety symptoms (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item version), mental and physical health-related quality of life (12-item Short-Form Health Survey), and self-reported improvement. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2013-003440-22 (protocol number 13/0413; version 6.1) and ISRCTN, ISRCTN84544741, and is closed to new participants.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Jan 1, 2015, and Aug 31, 2017, we recruited and randomly assigned 655 patients—326 (50%) to sertraline and 329 (50%) to placebo. Two patients in the sertraline group did not complete a substantial proportion of the baseline assessment and were excluded, leaving 653 patients in total. Due to attrition, primary outcome analyses were of 550 patients (266 in the sertraline group and 284 in the placebo group; 85% follow-up that did not differ by treatment allocation). We found no evidence that sertraline led to a clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks. The mean 6-week PHQ-9 score was 7·98 (SD 5·63) in the sertraline group and 8·76 (5·86) in the placebo group (adjusted proportional difference 0·95, 95% CI 0·85–1·07; p=0·41). However, for secondary outcomes, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental (but not physical) health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health. We observed weak evidence that depressive symptoms were reduced by sertraline at 12 weeks. We recorded seven adverse events—four for sertraline and three for placebo, and adverse events did not differ by treatment allocation. Three adverse events were classified as serious—two in the sertraline group and one in the placebo group. One serious adverse event in the sertraline group was classified as possibly related to study medication.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Sertraline is unlikely to reduce depressive symptoms within 6 weeks in primary care but we observed improvements in anxiety, quality of life, and self-rated mental health, which are likely to be clinically important. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.</p>

              <p id="para30">A more important criticism of the existing evidence is that most trials have used eligibility criteria based on diagnoses and severity.

Most antidepressants are now prescribed in primary care without any standardised assessment of depressive symptoms. It is difficult to generalise existing results to patients currently receiving treatment for depression.</p>
              <p id="para40">Some studies have argued that antidepressants are more effective for patients with more severe symptoms<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but most,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> although not all,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> meta-analyses of individual patient data do not support this.

                  <p id="para70">Existing evidence on the effectiveness of antidepressants has been comprehensively summarised in a recent network meta-analysis by Cipriani and colleagues, which reported small benefits of all antidepressants compared with placebo. This meta-analysis included double-blind, randomised controlled trials published up to Jan 8, 2016, of adults meeting diagnostic criteria for depression. We updated this search for articles published up to Jan 31, 2019. We also searched for trials including patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for depression. We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, for studies published in English, with the search terms “depress*” OR “dysthymi*” OR “adjustment disorder” OR “mood disorder” OR “affective disorder” OR “depress* symptoms” AND “antidepress*”. We did not find any individual trials of antidepressants compared with placebo in people with depression published since the review by Cipriani and colleagues. We found two systematic reviews of patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms. Most trials were done in secondary care, with patients who met diagnostic criteria and specified severity thresholds. These trials had many methodological limitations, were usually done several decades ago for regulatory purposes, and were generally of poor quality, with 82% rated by Cipriani and colleagues as having a moderate or high risk of bias. Some primary care trials have been done, but with similar limitations. Most studies of patients with subthreshold depression were low quality and reported inconsistent findings.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">To our knowledge, the PANDA trial is the largest placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant not funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We did not restrict eligibility by specifying lower or higher thresholds of depression severity but relied instead upon clinical uncertainty. This improved generalisability to the relevant population in primary care. In our primary analyses, we did not find convincing evidence that sertraline led to clinically important reductions in depressive symptoms within six weeks, although there was weak evidence of a small benefit at 12 weeks. In secondary analyses, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>

                  <p id="para110">Sertraline leads to reduced anxiety symptoms and self-reported improvements in mental health within 6 weeks, but any effect on depressive symptoms takes longer to emerge and is more modest. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the symptoms that are likely to improve so that they can consider alternative management of depressive symptoms that might not respond.</p>

Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion avoids diagnostic or severity criteria and leads to a sample that is more generalisable to the population currently receiving antidepressant medication. Clinical uncertainty relies upon variation between doctors in how they make decisions and, with a sufficient number of doctors, this variation in practice leads to a wide and heterogeneous group of participants in the trial, reflecting clinical equipoise within the field.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In our case, because primary care physicians do not use standardised assessments of depression, we expected trial participants to have a range of depressive symptom severity. Clinical uncertainty is also the ethical basis for randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Exclusion criteria were antidepressant treatment in past 8 weeks; comorbid psychosis, schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar disorder, dementia, eating disorder, or major alcohol or substance abuse; and medical contraindications for sertraline.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para150">There were two methods of recruitment to the study. First, patients were referred during GP consultation. Second, GP practices searched computerised records for patients who presented with depression or depressive symptoms in the past two years. Patients were told that they had been referred to the study because their GP had identified them as having depression or low mood. A researcher then contacted patients by telephone to confirm eligibility. Since it was possible that some patients might not currently have depressive symptoms, researchers asked “firstly, I need to ask you do you want treatment for your depression at the moment?”. If the answer was no, the patient was excluded. Before randomisation, the patient's GP was asked to approve inclusion in the trial and could exclude the patient if there was not clinical uncertainty.</p>

                <p id="para190">We assessed patients' depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item version (PHQ-9; available range 0–27, higher scores indicating more severe symptoms), a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in the past 2 weeks that is widely used in primary care.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Self-report questionnaires avoid the possibility of observer bias associated with clinically rated outcomes<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the PHQ-9 might be more responsive to change than other self-report measures.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We also assessed depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).

We assessed generalised anxiety symptoms with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item version (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a self-report measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks, with possible scores ranging from 0–21 and higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. We derived separate physical and mental health-related quality of life scores with the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Possible scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</p>

The total score in three categories was used for stratification. The severity score was used for the hypothesis that the treatment effect varied according to the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline. The CIS-R asks about duration of depressive symptoms with the following categories: less than 2 weeks, between 2 weeks and 6 months, between 6 months and 1 year, between 1 year and 2 years; between 2 years and 5 years; between 5 years and 10 years, and more than 10 years.

Self-reported improvement was assessed by asking patients, “compared to when we last saw you, how have your moods and feelings changed?”.

All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). We compared the proportion of patients in each group who were categorised as adherent with Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> test. Physical symptoms that could be SSRI side-effects were compared by group with independent <italic>t</italic>-tests. Analyses of adherence and physical symptoms were done at each follow-up visit. We report serious adverse events during the trial according to treatment allocation.</p>
                <p id="para260">The primary analysis was a linear regression of log-transformed PHQ-9 scores at 6 weeks, adjusted for baseline PHQ-9 score and stratification variables (severity assessed by CIS-R in three categories, duration in two categories, and site). Regression coefficients from this model were the difference in geometric means of log-transformed PHQ-9 scores between randomised groups. We exponentiated this regression coefficient to report the treatment effect as a ratio of the (geometric) mean PHQ-9 score at 6 weeks in those allocated to sertraline to the (geometric) mean PHQ-9 score at 6 weeks in those allocated to placebo. The null value was 1 and proportions below 1 indicated fewer symptoms in the sertraline group. For example, a coefficient of 0·89 reflects PHQ-9 scores that were 11% lower in the sertraline than placebo group.</p>
                <p id="para270">The proportional scale was chosen on the basis of model comparison between different scales. This choice was supported by previous work showing benefits for choosing the scale. These benefits include variance stabilisation and overcoming the issue of baseline dependence.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A proportional model is also plausible, as it seems unlikely that a treatment would lead to the same difference in means in those starting at a high score compared with those with a low score.</p>
                <p id="para280">Given our interest in the relationship between severity and treatment effect, we included baseline depression CIS-R scores in the primary analysis. The primary analysis was also done without the CIS-R depression score, to examine the possible influence of collinearity. We investigated how robust findings were to the model specification by comparison with a Poisson model.</p>
                <p id="para290">We calculated linear multilevel models for continuous secondary outcomes (PHQ-9, BDI-II, GAD-7, and SF-12 physical and mental health quality of life) with log-transformed PHQ-9, BDI-II, and GAD-7 scores and raw SF-12 scores, as stated in the analysis plan. Logistic multilevel models were calculated for binary secondary outcomes (remission on PHQ-9 and BDI-II, and self-reported improvement). Models included continuous baseline measurement of the outcome, CIS-R depression severity score, and stratification variables. For primary and secondary outcomes, we report interactions between treatment allocation and baseline CIS-R depression severity score and duration.</p>
                <p id="para300">For sensitivity analyses, we reported primary and secondary outcomes after adjustment for variables that were possibly imbalanced at baseline, which were identified using descriptive statistics. We investigated possible clustering within surgeries by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient using multilevel models, with a random intercept for surgeries. We reported the treatment effect from this multilevel model to assess whether clustering had an influence.</p>
                <p id="para310">We did two sensitivity analyses to investigate the possible effect of missing data. First, we adjusted for baseline variables associated with missing outcome data. Second, we used multiple imputation by chained equations to replace missing data. We assumed missingness was dependent on observed data and imputed 50 datasets. Imputation models included variables from our models and variables associated with missing data, with pooled results obtained using Rubin's rules.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Our post-hoc analyses are detailed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 4)</xref>.</p>

              <p id="para460">In our primary analysis, we did not find convincing evidence that sertraline led to a greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared with placebo within 6 weeks. However, in our secondary analyses we found weak evidence that sertraline reduced depressive symptoms at 12 weeks compared with placebo. This effect was small, but does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important effect on depressive symptoms by 12 weeks.</p>
              <p id="para470">In our secondary analyses, we found evidence that sertraline reduced generalised anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks and 12 weeks compared with placebo. We also found evidence that sertraline led to better mental (but not physical) health-related quality of life and self-rated improvement in mental health.</p>
              <p id="para480">Although results from secondary analyses should be interpreted with caution, statistical evidence for all our secondary outcomes (except depression) was strong. In particular, self-reported improvements in mental health can be used to calculate minimal clinically important differences and can be regarded as patient-centred indicators of clinically meaningful change.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Depressive and anxiety symptoms often occur together and comorbid anxiety symptoms have been associated with poorer quality of life in people with depressive symptoms.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> We have found important evidence that sertraline can lead to clinical benefits for patients in primary care with depressive symptoms. However, these benefits occur mainly through improvements in anxiety symptoms and quality of life rather than reductions in depressive symptoms.</p>
              <p id="para490">We found no evidence that severity or duration of depressive (or anxiety) symptoms affected treatment response, although analyses using interaction terms lacked statistical power. We found that duration of symptoms was not associated with outcome once severity of symptoms had been accounted for, suggesting that an interaction with treatment response is unlikely.</p>
              <p id="para500">Sertraline has a similar pharmacological profile to other SSRIs and acts via a similar mechanism.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Therefore, we would expect our results to apply to other SSRIs when used in this population. Generalising our findings to antidepressants of other classes is more difficult, although there are similarities in the mechanism of action of all commonly used antidepressants.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para510">To our knowledge, the PANDA trial is the largest individual placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant not funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Our trial had more attrition than predicted but recruited more participants than our target and had power to detect an 11% reduction in symptoms—enough to detect a clinically important difference. Clinical trials are often criticised for using narrow inclusion criteria, which can reduce external validity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> We used clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion, which avoids reliance upon diagnostic or severity criteria that have never been validated as an indication for antidepressants. Participants in our study ranged from those with very few depressive symptoms to those with severe depressive symptoms, therefore our results are more readily generalisable to the population currently receiving antidepressants in primary care than are the results of previous trials. Many people in our sample had very severe depression, suggesting that there is uncertainty about prescription of antidepressants in primary care at all levels of severity.</p>
              <p id="para520">Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion could have potential disadvantages. If patients with few depressive symptoms were less likely to respond to antidepressants, this might have reduced the treatment effect, but we did not find any suggestion of this. We also observed strong evidence of a treatment effect for anxiety symptoms despite our broad inclusion criteria.</p>
              <p id="para530">Reliance upon clinical uncertainty will exclude those for whom a clinician is certain that antidepressants are indicated. We would expect people with the most severe depression to be somewhat underrepresented in the trial. However, this effect should be modest given the very wide range of depression severity in our sample. Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion requires many clinicians to participate in a study to encompass the whole range of clinical practice. We included 179 practices from four UK cities, therefore it is unlikely that we are reflecting idiosyncratic practice. Instead, our sample most likely reflects the diverse decisions made by many doctors over a broad range of uncertainty.</p>
              <p id="para540">There are marked similarities between the behaviour of doctors and patients in primary care within high-income countries, despite divergent health systems. Antidepressant prescribing has increased in all high-income countries over the past two decades.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> A similar trial in other high-income countries would probably identify participants over a wide range of depression severities and include many people with anxiety symptoms. Our main conclusions about the benefits of sertraline on anxiety rather than depressive symptoms should be generalisable to other high-income countries.</p>
              <p id="para550">In the PANDA trial, 115 (46%) participants on sertraline thought they were taking the active drug at 6 weeks compared with 52 (19%) participants on placebo. In other SSRI trials that have assessed patient beliefs about the medication that they are taking,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> only one study<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> found evidence that patients can distinguish active treatment from placebo. We considered two possible explanations for this finding in our trial. First, patients detected an improvement in their symptoms, therefore thought they were taking sertraline. Second, patients could detect being on sertraline because of physical or psychological effects that we did not measure. We found no evidence that side-effects differed by study group, therefore it is unlikely that reported adverse effects systematically led to a difference in patients guessing whether they were on sertraline or placebo.</p>
              <p id="para560">The possibility that adverse effects of antidepressants could lead to unblinding and an inadvertent placebo effect has been raised previously.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref> Such a placebo effect should lead to a difference in all outcomes. In our trial, anxiety, quality of life, and self-reported improvement measures showed greater changes than depressive symptom measures. This observation reduces the likelihood that differences between sertraline and placebo were explained purely by the possibility of unblinding.</p>
              <p id="para570">Medication was encapsulated so participants could, in principle, break open the capsule and discover if there was a tablet included. We are aware of three incidents when this occurred. All three participants stopped the study medication once this had occurred and we do not think the encapsulation of the medication had an overall effect on the blinding of assessments in the trial.</p>
              <p id="para580">Patients from record searches had less severe depressive and anxiety symptoms but were more likely to have taken antidepressants previously. These differences had no influence on treatment effects (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 19–21</xref>). Current practice in UK primary care is to engage with patients' views and to share decision making.<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> Therefore, patients who present to clinicians with mental health problems and ask for antidepressants will usually be prescribed these. Patients we identified through record searches who wanted treatment for their depressive symptoms are also those for whom there might be clinical uncertainty. GPs could exclude anyone who was recruited through record searches.</p>
              <p id="para590">Our finding that sertraline was not effective for depressive symptoms at 6 weeks is inconsistent with previous studies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Antidepressants could have an effect on depressive symptoms that is not large enough to be detected in a trial of this size. A meta-analysis by Cipriani and colleagues<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> reported a standardised difference in means of −0·27 (95% CI −0·34 to −0·21) for sertraline versus placebo at a median follow-up of 8 weeks. This effect size is considerably larger than the −0·09 (−0·23 to 0·05) standardised difference in means from our trial at 6 weeks so the explanation of our trial being too small to detect the effect reported by Cipriani and colleagues<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> seems unlikely. Our findings at 12 weeks of a −0·18 standardised mean difference (95% CI −0·33 to −0·03) are closer to the result reported by Cipriani and colleagues.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para600">Previous studies have used observer-rated scales to assess depression, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Unlike our self-reported scales, these measures allow interviewer discretion and increase the possibility of observer bias. Beneficial effects of sertraline on anxiety and self-reported improvement might therefore lead to a so-called halo effect, such that observers rate depressive symptoms as improved. There is evidence that observer rating can bias results of depression and anxiety assessments.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The Hamilton Depression Scale also contains questions on the physical and psychological symptoms of generalised anxiety, which we found were affected by sertraline.</p>
              <p id="para610">Our results suggest that the main benefits in the first 6 weeks of treatment with sertraline are on reduction of anxiety symptoms, such as worry and restlessness, rather than an improvement in depressive symptoms. Any effect on depressive symptoms takes longer to emerge and is more modest. However, an improvement in anxiety symptoms in someone presenting with depression could lead to a clinical benefit. In cases where there is uncertainty about prescribing an antidepressant, the presence of anxiety symptoms, such as worry and restlessness, could indicate an increased likelihood of benefit. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the symptoms that are likely to improve so that they can consider alternative management of depressive symptoms that might not respond.</p>
              <p id="para620">Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.</p>
              <p id="para630">We did not find evidence that treatment response for either anxiety or depressive symptoms varied according to the severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms, even within this heterogenous group of participants. There could be subgroups within this population that did not benefit from the anxiety reducing effect; however, in the absence of any evidence for such subgroups we conclude that our results should be generalisable to the broad group of people included in our study.</p>
              <p id="para640">In conclusion, our finding that sertraline affects anxiety more quickly than depressive symptoms has potential implications for understanding the mechanisms of antidepressant treatment. Depressive symptoms could take longer to reduce than anxiety symptoms and some of the reduction might be explained by the earlier effects on anxiety. Our results also challenge our reliance on placebo-controlled studies that have been done primarily for regulatory purposes. Investigation of pharmacological treatments after regulatory approval is needed. SSRIs are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world and yet we still have an imperfect knowledge of their clinical effectiveness and indications for their use.</p>
