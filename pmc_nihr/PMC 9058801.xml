                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>UK National Health Service/Health and Social Care (NHS/HSC) data are variably shared between healthcare organisations for direct care, and increasingly de-identified for research. Few large-scale studies have examined public opinion on sharing, including of mental health (MH) versus physical health (PH) data. We measured data sharing preferences.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design/setting/interventions/outcomes</title>
                  <p>Pre-registered anonymous online survey, measuring expressed preferences, recruiting February to September 2020. Participants were randomised to one of three framing statements regarding MH versus PH data.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Open to all UK residents. Participants numbered 29 275; 40% had experienced an MH condition.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Most (76%) supported identifiable data sharing for direct clinical care without explicit consent, but 20% opposed this. Preference for clinical/identifiable sharing decreased with geographical distance and was slightly less for MH than PH data, with small framing effects. Preference for research/de-identified data sharing without explicit consent showed the same small PH/MH and framing effects, plus greater preference for sharing structured data than de-identified free text. There was net support for research sharing to the NHS, academic institutions, and national research charities, net ambivalence about sharing to profit-making companies researching treatments, and net opposition to sharing to other companies (similar to sharing publicly). De-identified linkage to non-health data was generally supported, except to data held by private companies. We report demographic influences on preference. A majority (89%) supported a single NHS mechanism to choose uses of their data. Support for data sharing increased during COVID-19.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Support for healthcare data sharing for direct care without explicit consent is broad but not universal. There is net support for the sharing of de-identified data for research to the NHS, academia, and the charitable sector, but not the commercial sector. A single national NHS-hosted system for patients to control the use of their NHS data for clinical purposes and for research would have broad support.</p>

At the ‘patient’ level, the Venn diagram shows the overlaps between information that directly identifies a person, research identifiers (RIDs or pseudonyms), and health information, with simple examples. Anonymous health data may also exist in aggregated form, distinct from patient-level data; this aggregated form is the norm for public distribution. The level of identification risk and the research information governance requirements vary with the resulting categories of data. All examples are fictional.

              <p>What do patients and the public want now? We studied views on the sharing of identifiable health data (for clinical purposes) and de-identified health data (for research) within the UK. We examined data destinations ranging from local NHS services to public distribution. We distinguished MH and physical health (PH) data, and for research also structured data (coded information) versus free-text data (e.g., narrative information typed by clinicians).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We asked about data linkage for research.

                <p>The inclusion criteria were current residence in the UK and informed consent. The ability to take an online survey (alone or supported) was implicit. Participants under 16 years required the permission of their parent or guardian to participate and were asked to report whether they had assistance.

The study was adopted onto the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) portfolio; 216 general practice (GP) surgeries and 154 large healthcare organisations (e.g., acute care Trusts, MH Trusts, community hospitals, ambulance Trusts) supported recruitment.

                <p>We analysed using R v3.6.3.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> We analysed categorical associations via χ<sup>2</sup> tests, and effects on ordinal Likert-type scales (phrased linguistically to approximate interval scales) via analysis of variance (ANOVA). With a large sample size, the central limit theorem means that the distribution of means and mean differences tends to normal even though the parent population is non-normal, and ANOVA is robust to non-normality,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref> permitting ANOVA of discrete dependent variables. Scales measuring likelihood were quantified as −2 very unlikely, −1 unlikely, 0 not sure, +1 likely, +2 very likely. Yes/no scales were quantified as −1 no, 0 not sure, +1 yes. Models involving within-subject terms were analysed using the lmer and lmerTest packages, using type III sums of squares, and are expressed thus (~, ‘is predicted by’; A×B, interaction; A*B denotes the inclusion of main effects A and B and their interactions). Statistics are shown to three significant figures (or as integers for percentages reported as annotations on figures or in the abstract/discussion) and degrees of freedom (df) are rounded to integers. We set α=0·05, and report ‘NS’ for ‘not significant’ and ‘VLP’ for a very low p (VLP) value, p&lt;2·2×10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>
                <p>Opinions on sharing clinical/identifiable data were analysed using a model termed C1: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*nature*framing*pandemic+(1|subject)</italic>. ‘Destination’ had four levels (local, regional, national, UK-wide), ‘nature’ had two (PH, MH), and framing had three (neutral, MH concern, holistic). We followed up nature×framing interactions by analysing MH and PH data separately using the simplified model C1B: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*framing+(1|subject)</italic>.</p>
                <p>To examine the effects of demographic factors and experience, we used a larger model, C2: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*nature*framing*pandemic+age+gender+ethnicity+education+sexuality+religion+nation+imd_quartile+nssec+mh_experience*nature+(1|subject)</italic>. This was only possible for people who provided all necessary demographic information. Levels for demographic factors were as per <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>, plus sexuality (two levels: heterosexual/straight, LGBT+ (including homosexual/gay/lesbian, bisexual, other/self-described)) and NS-SEC (five levels). We did not include all interaction terms for demographic factors (as formal tests of ‘intersectionality’ effects) because of the combinatorial explosion this would entail; instead, this model tests main effects of demographic factors plus the specific hypothesis that MH experience affects sharing of MH/PH data differentially.</p>
                <p>Opinions on sharing de-identified data for research were analysed using model R1: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*nature*detail*framing*pandemic+(1|subject)</italic>. ‘Destination’ had six levels (NHS, academia, charities, companies conducting treatment research, other companies, publicly); ‘detail’ had two levels (structured only, free text); other factors were as before. To examine nature×framing interactions, we used the simplified model R1B: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*framing+(1|subject)</italic>. For demographic analysis, we used model R2: <italic toggle="yes">sharing~destination*nature*detail*framing*pandemic+age+gender+ethnicity+education+sexuality+religion+nation+imd_quartile+nssec+mh_experience*nature+(1|subject)</italic>.</p>

This monotonic effect, when participants were asked to rate each destination and nature separately, had not been evident in the one-from-many question about health data in general, asked previously (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). People were slightly more willing to share PH than MH data. There were significant but very small effects of the framing statement, primarily that ‘MH concern’ framing reduced willingness to share MH data. In the whole-sample analysis (model C1), there were highly significant effects of destination (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>3,169348</sub>=6490, VLP) and nature (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,169484</sub>=6080, VLP), as well as interactions including nature×framing (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,169484</sub>=78·4, VLP) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 6A</xref>). This interaction was driven primarily by a simple effect of ‘MH concern’ framing to reduce sharing for MH data (model C1B: PH data, no effect of framing (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,24461</sub>=1·18, NS); MH data, effect of framing (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>2,24157</sub>=8·36, p=0·000234); pairwise comparison within MH data, MH concern vs neutral, p=0·00443). Framing effects were also lessened for geographically broader destinations. Effect sizes are reported further below.</p>
                <p>For research purposes (with de-identified data), destination was an extremely strong driver of preference (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>5,535334</sub>=87 800, VLP) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3D–I</xref>). On average, people expressed strong support for sharing to the NHS, academia, or national charities for research purposes. For NHS sharing, the most popular destination, 89·2% (PH data, structured only), 85·2% (MH data, structured), 81·6% (PH data, free text), and 78·7% (MH data, free text) of participants rated themselves ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to share. Support and opposition were approximately equally balanced for sharing to profit-making companies researching treatments. There was strong net opposition to sharing to other types of companies, approximately equal to that for sharing publicly. Only 20·6% (PH data, structured only), 17·6% (MH data, structured), 16·4% (PH data, free text), and 14·9% (MH data, free text) rated themselves ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to share to other types of companies. There was a small but significant preference for sharing PH (vs MH) data, and likewise higher preference for sharing structured-only versus free-text data. In the whole-sample analysis (model R1), there were highly significant effects of destination, nature, and detail, plus interactions including destination×nature×detail (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 6B</xref>). Framing effects included nature×framing, though simple framing effects were not significant for PH or MH data separately (model R1B). Effect sizes are reported further below.</p>

                <p>Preference varied according to demographic factors and experience of MH illness. For clinical purposes, there were several demographic effects (model C2; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref> shows significant terms with effect sizes). Age was a significant factor, with the age bands most willing to share being 25–44 and 75+, and the 18–24 band being least willing. Males were more willing to share data than females. Those of minority ethnicity were less willing to share than those of white ethnicity. There was a main effect of education, and across educational levels, those of Level 3 were most willing and those of Level 4+ least willing. Those of minority religions were less willing to share. Those from the most-deprived IMD quartile were also less willing. There were no significant effects of sexuality (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,12334</sub>=2·21, NS), NS-SEC (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>4,12335</sub>=1·32, NS) or nation (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>3,12335</sub>=2·13, NS). Personal experience of MH illness specifically reduced willingness to share MH data for clinical purposes (nature×MH experience).</p>
                <p>For research purposes, significant effects were similarly observed for age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and IMD quartile (model R2, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). The age distribution was clearly U-shaped, with greater willingness to share among the youngest and oldest groups. As before, there was no effect of sexuality (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,12336</sub>=1·58, NS). There was no effect of education (<italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>4,12348</sub>=2·15, p=0·072), but there was an effect of nation (with people living in Wales more willing to share and those in Scotland less so, relative to England), and of socioeconomic status (NS-SEC; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>). People with MH experience were significantly more likely to share MH data for research purposes (nature×MH experience, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic><sub>1,296111</sub>=6·15, p=0·0132).</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>Many respondents believed that health data are shared UK-wide for clinical purposes without explicit consent, when sharing is usually more limited. A majority (76%) supported such sharing, though a significant minority (20%) opposed it. Geographically broad sharing was endorsed, though with stronger support for more local destinations. People preferred to share PH (vs MH) data, but this was less important than the destination.</p>
                <p>For research, with de-identified data, there was strong net support for sharing without explicit consent to the NHS, academic research institutions, and research charities. There was net ambivalence regarding private companies researching treatments, and strong net opposition for sharing to other companies or publicly. There was a small preference for sharing PH over MH data (a smaller difference than for clinical purposes), and greater support for structured-only data over de-identified free text. There was net support for research linkage to state and university data sources, but opposition regarding data held by private companies.</p>
                <p>Framing statements influenced MH/PH preferences, but only to a small degree. Age, gender, ethnicity, education, religion, and IMD were associated with willingness to have health data shared or linked, though not nearly as strongly as destination/source. Personal experience of MH conditions was associated with reduced willingness to share MH data for clinical purposes, but greater willingness to share it for research. After COVID-19 lockdown, there was greater willingness regarding already-preferred destinations.</p>
                <p>Respondents endorsed a suggested UK-wide system allowing patients to control the clinical/research uses of their data and to sign up for participatory research, with 89% saying they would be likely or very likely to use such a system. In commenting, respondents frequently emphasised the importance of data security and that NHS data should not be made available to private or third-party companies without specific permission. Comment themes reflected the tensions previously noted in this area, including about healthcare and research benefits, security, governance, trust, and vulnerable groups.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43–45</xref></p>

                <p>The major weakness is that the sample remained under-representative of some groups despite weighting, with potential for unmeasured selection (including self-selection) bias, reducing generalisability.

                <title>Destination and purpose</title>
                <p>The Caldicott framework (1997)<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and reviews (2013, 2016),<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12</xref> regarding safe information sharing for direct clinical care, included the principle that the ‘duty to share information can be as important as the duty to protect patient confidentiality’<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and noted that information was often not shared when it should be, for fear of inappropriate disclosure.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> That was despite legislation creating a duty on providers to share information with professionals when that is likely to facilitate the individual’s health or social care, disclosure is in their best interests, and they do not or are not likely to object.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> That is in essence an opt-out system. This legislation conflicted with some prior studies of public opinion.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> We provide more background on relevant legislation in the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental discussion</xref>, S3.2. The 2016 Caldicott review noted low public understanding around how health information is used, but ‘an expectation that information is shared for direct care’.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We observed net support for such sharing that varied with geographical destination and was by no means universal, but was nevertheless strong.</p>
                <p>In relation to research and other non-clinical activities, the recommendation that people be able to opt out from personal confidential data being used beyond their own direct care<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> led to the NHS NDO.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> This relates to the use of CPI (identifiable information) for purposes such as research, conducted under NHS Act Section 251 (§251) approvals.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 52</xref> It does not apply to direct clinical care, local audit or service evaluation, or de-identified information.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50 51</xref> Our study and others show it remains unknown to many.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Furthermore, it is not simple (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental discussion</xref>, S3.2) and we suspect many do not fully understand its scope. Conversely, from the researcher’s perspective, §251 approval is often still required for linkage studies in which researchers never see identifiable information: there is no standardised ‘trusted third-party’ system for centralised linkage of identifiable information, and inconsistent adoption of de-identified linkage methods.</p>
                <p>‘Destination’ was by far the strongest driver of preference for sharing and linkage. This pattern is established: willingness to allow researchers/clinicians access to health data, but far greater reservations about industry.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> An important basis for this is mistrust of the security and/or motives of commercial organisations,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26 55</xref> as our participants noted.</p>

                <p>A common demographic theme was that minority groups (of ethnicity, religion, and sexuality) and deprived groups were less willing to share. This might reflect experience of disadvantage to, or discrimination against, these groups.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56 57</xref> Ethnicity has had mixed effects on preference for national electronic health record (EHR) systems.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In our study, age effects were generally biphasic, with higher willingness amount the youngest and eldest. Youth may be associated with familiarity with data and/or greater support for EHRs,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and older age with an increasing burden of illness, itself associated with support for national EHR systems.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Educational effects were relatively inconsistent, being small and present for clinical and linkage preferences though in quantitatively different ways, and not being significant for research preferences. Males were slightly more willing to share than females. Similar results have been observed before,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> but not always;<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58 59</xref> one reason might be gender-based healthcare discrimination.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Higher support for research sharing in Wales may relate to established national research systems there;<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 62</xref> the reasons for reduced willingness in Scotland are unclear, but similar systems there are younger.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Those with personal experience of MH illness were less willing to share identifiable MH data for direct care. This may reflect experience of discrimination or stigma<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64 65</xref>—which can have disproportionate effects in subgroups.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65 66</xref> However, the same people were more willing to share de-identified MH data for research, potentially reflecting increased prioritisation of MH research.<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></p>
                <p>Demographic variations in preference may reflect differences in perception of current data rules or security practices, reasons for concern about uses of health data, or degree of concern. UK law prohibits variation of policy according to these factors.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> Better understanding and public information may be required to address these groups’ concerns,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 69</xref> but improvements in health equity are also required.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 56</xref> However, the effect sizes of these demographic predictors were not large enough to override the net support for data sharing, given the right destinations.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Participants supported a central system for patients to control the uses of their data, and likewise a single NHS mechanism to sign up for active research participation. There is a trade-off between the scientific desirability of everyone contributing de-identified data, including to avoid bias,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76 77</xref> and the desirability of individual control over data use.<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref> As we suggest below, a reasonable balance might be a central system to opt out from identifiable clinical use, identifiable (§251) research use, or de-identified research use of one’s data, and to opt in for participatory research. This would complement efforts to improve people’s access to their own data.<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></p>
              <p>The majority support that we observed for clinical sharing without explicit consent perhaps makes such sharing reasonable as a default (opt-out) position, given the potential advantages for many people’s own care, subject to strict IG rules (who has access, and when). Under UK data protection laws, the legal basis for NHS organisations to hold patient data is not consent (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental discussion</xref>, S3.2). The Caldicott principles require relevant information sharing for direct care under many circumstances,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12</xref> and NHSX (NHS User Experience) have set out the IG requirements for regional ShCRs, several of which are already in operation (and may use opt-outs), and for cross-ShCR sharing.<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> However, a significant minority of participants in our study opposed clinical sharing without explicit consent, mandating (we suggest) at least a public information campaign about opt-outs, sufficiently targeted to reach groups most concerned about data sharing, if broader sharing were to occur, to conform to the Caldicott principle of ‘no surprises’.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>There was strong net support for NHS, academic, and charity researchers accessing de-identified health data. Opt-outs are often offered, even if they are not legally required, for research using de-identified data (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental discussion</xref>, S3.2). A standard method for conducting such research is via a trusted research environment (TRE).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 61 81–83</xref> Approved researchers come ‘into’ the secure environment, which can be highly controlled, to interact with relevant data (e.g., pseudonymised; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). After analysis, aggregation, and other statistical disclosure control (SDC),<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> results go ‘out’ for publication (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The principle is of the ‘five safes’: safe people, safe projects, a safe setting, safe data, and safe outputs.<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> The lower preference for sharing de-identified free-text data versus de-identified structured data is congruent with the increased sensitivity of free-text data, and the fact that technical methods for de-identifying free text remain imperfect; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85 86</xref>additional safeguards surrounding that kind of data are justified.</p>
              <p>We did not examine preferences regarding research uses of identifiable data, except about being contacted for direct research participation and about awareness of the NDO. The NDO only applies to work using identifiable data without consent (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental discussion</xref>, S3.2). Separately, some argue that it should be easier to gain permissions to conduct research using identifiable or potentially identifiable data, as part of an ethical duty to participate in research.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> We provide no evidence to suggest changes to the operation of this process, but we found strong support for a central mechanism to control the uses of one’s data and to sign up for direct research participation.</p>
              <p>In contrast to the support for NHS/academic/charity research, respondents did not support research sharing to private companies. Some have suggested this is addressable in part by public education.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We suggest respecting public preference, and not giving commercial organisations direct access to patient-level NHS data for research, even de-identified, without consent. (This is distinct from the common NHS practice of employing companies, such as EHR software providers, to manage NHS data securely for clinical purposes.) We think that this does not rule out all industrial research uses of data, which could happen according to at least three methods. The first is via consent, as for commercial treatment trials. Second, companies could collaborate with NHS/academic researchers. For example, an artificial intelligence company could provide an untrained algorithm; NHS staff could train it on patient-level data; the company could receive a trained algorithm back while never having access to the data (assuming verification that the algorithm cannot ‘embed’ detailed data features during training). Third, methods exist whereby software queries come ‘in’ to the TRE, and semi-automatic or automatic SDC occurs before results go ‘out’.<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88–90</xref> This allows research to take place without researchers having access to patient-level data, and can also support ‘federated’ queries across sites. Data that have undergone suitable SDC (e.g., aggregation) can be published, and are therefore suitable for industrial access if desired. Regardless, as our participants commented, the NHS might charge for such access,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 91</xref> and full transparency is essential. Formal, consultation-based standards governing this NHS–commercial interface would be desirable.</p>
              <p>Some noted the need to control the nature of information sharing in greater detail, and this would need further detailed consultation. Our data may help to frame this. There is likely to be a trade-off between the level of fine-grained control offered and a need for simplicity in a nationwide system; our effect sizes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>) suggest, for example, that ‘destination’, and whether free text or only structured data are involved, should be prioritised over other factors such as MH versus PH data.</p>
              <p>Governance of UK health data must be transparent and reflect the views of patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 16</xref> Regardless of legal authority, it is important that health data are processed in ways that have a ‘social licence’.<xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> As the UK Government seeks to change data legislation<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref> and emphasise health data in its science strategy,<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref> we hope this study contributes to the conversation.</p>
