                  <title>Rationale</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The effectiveness of universal immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been evident in many countries. However, the global impact of PCV is limited by its cost, which has prevented its introduction in several countries. Reducing the cost of PCV programmes may facilitate vaccine introduction in some countries and improve the sustainability of PCV in EPIs in low-income countries when they transition away from subsidised vaccine supply.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PVS is a real-world field trial of an alternative schedule of one dose of PCV scheduled at age 6 weeks with a booster dose at age 9 months (i.e. the alternative ‘1+1’ schedule) compared to the standard schedule of three primary doses scheduled at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age (i.e. the standard ‘3+0’ schedule). Delivery of the interventions began in late 2019 in 68 geographic clusters and will continue for 4 years. The primary endpoint is the prevalence of nasopharyngeal vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage in children aged 2–260 weeks with clinical pneumonia in year 4. Secondary endpoints are the prevalence of vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage among all ages in year 4 and the incidence of radiological pneumonia in children enrolled to receive the interventions. Additional disease and carriage endpoints are included.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the cohorts and populations, and follow-up criteria, to be used in different analyses. The SAP defines the endpoints and describes how adherence to the interventions will be presented. We describe how analyses will account for the effect of clustering and stratified randomisation. The SAP defines the approach to non-inferiority and other analyses. Defining the SAP early in the trial will avoid bias in analyses that may arise from prior knowledge of trial findings.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p id="Par30">The Gambian Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) introduced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in 2009 and PCV13 in 2011, using the standard schedule of three doses in early infancy. Compared to the pre-vaccine period, in 2016–2017, there was a 92% reduction in the incidence of vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the 2–59-month age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. PCV also prevents the acquisition of VT pneumococcal carriage, with resulting indirect herd protection effects in the population. However, the prevalence of nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of VT pneumococci in young children remains around 15% (author’s own data), having fallen from 47% in the pre-vaccine period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The global impact of PCV is limited by its cost, which has prevented its introduction in several countries. Reducing the cost of PCV programmes may facilitate vaccine introduction in some countries and improve the sustainability of EPI programmes in low-income countries when they transition away from subsidised vaccine supply through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p>
                <p id="Par31">This pragmatic cluster-randomised, non-inferiority field trial is being conducted in the Basse and Fuladu West Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (BHDSS and FWHDSS) in rural Gambia. Cluster-wise delivery of the schedules at EPI clinics over 4 years in distinct geographic populations will allow direct and indirect effects of the schedules on pneumococcal transmission and disease to develop within each geographic population cluster. Because the incidence of IPD and radiological pneumonia has fallen greatly with PCV vaccination, such endpoints cannot be primary endpoints in this trial. We have chosen NP carriage of VT pneumococci in children with clinical pneumonia as the primary endpoint. Disease measures are included, primarily related to safety. We also include a number of additional pneumococcal carriage endpoints at the community-level.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Using the framework of Halloran et al., for study designs to measure different effects of vaccines and vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], this trial aims to estimate and compare the overall public health effects of the two PCV schedules. Overall public health effects include the indirect effects of widespread vaccination on unvaccinated individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The combination of direct and indirect effects of widespread vaccination on vaccinated individuals is termed the total effects of vaccination and vaccination programme. The overall public health effects of the vaccination programme depend on the weighted average of indirect effects on unvaccinated individuals and the total effects on vaccinated individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par33">The primary endpoint analysis will use the population-level population with observations in year 4 after the development of the direct and indirect effects of the schedules (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All children aged 2–260 weeks with clinical pneumonia in year 4, and resident in the trial area, whether enrolled to receive trial interventions or not, will be included in the analysis. The analysis will provide information combining the direct and indirect effects of the PCV schedules on VT pneumococcal transmission with interpretation related to the individual resident child.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Analysis framework for populations/cohorts, observations/follow-up, and outcome measures</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Endpoint<break/>Designation</th><th>Population/cohort</th><th>Observation/follow-up</th><th>Endpoint</th><th>Effect measure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primary</td><td><sup>a</sup>Resident children and clinical pneumonia</td><td>Continuous surveillance</td><td><sup>b</sup>VT carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Secondary</td><td><sup>c</sup>Enrolled children</td><td><sup>d</sup>Intention-to-treat</td><td>Radiological pneumonia</td><td>Incidence ratio</td></tr><tr><td>All resident population</td><td>Cross-sectional</td><td><sup>e</sup>VT carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="24">Tertiary</td><td><sup>a</sup>Resident children and clinical pneumonia</td><td>Continuous surveillance</td><td><sup>f</sup>NVT and <sup>g</sup>Spn carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Age 6–12 weeks no PCV</td><td>Cross-sectional</td><td><sup>h</sup>VT carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td><sup>c</sup>Enrolled children and clinical pneumonia</td><td><sup>d</sup>Intention-to-treat</td><td>VT, NVT, and <sup>g</sup>Spn carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td><sup>i</sup>Enrolled children received intervention and clinical pneumonia</td><td><sup>§§</sup>Per-protocol</td><td>VT, NVT, and <sup>g</sup>Spn carriage</td><td>Prevalence ratio</td></tr><tr><td>Resident children</td><td>Continuous surveillance</td><td>VT, NVT, and <sup>g</sup>Spn IPD</td><td>Incidence ratio</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Radiological pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia and VT carriage</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hypoxic pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hospitalisation</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Mortality</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>Enrolled children</td><td><sup>d</sup>Intention-to-treat</td><td>VT, NVT, and <sup>g</sup>Spn IPD</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia and VT carriage</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hypoxic pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hospitalisation</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Mortality</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Enrolled children received intervention</td><td><sup>j</sup>Per-protocol</td><td>Radiological pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>VT, NVT, and Spn IPD</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Clinical pneumonia and VT carriage</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hypoxic pneumonia</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Hospitalisation</td><td>“</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“</td><td>Mortality</td><td>“</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Population-based population aged 2–260 weeks. <sup>b</sup>Primary endpoint specified in year 4 and also calculated as tertiary endpoints in years 1, 2, and 3. <sup>c</sup>Cohort enrolled to receive interventions. <sup>d</sup>Events counted from enrolment to end of follow-up. <sup>e</sup>Secondary endpoint specified in year 4 and also calculated as a tertiary endpoint in year 3 (all ages and age-stratified). <sup>f</sup>Calculated in years 1, 2, 3, and 4. <sup>g</sup>Spn = all pneumococcal carriage. <sup>h</sup>In year 4. <sup>i</sup>Cohort enrolled and received interventions PP. <sup>j</sup>Events counted from 14 days post-PCV1 to end of follow-up</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par34">The trial includes two secondary endpoints (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The secondary endpoint of radiological pneumonia incidence will include all children enrolled to receive the interventions and function primarily as a safety endpoint. This individual-level cohort will experience the direct effects of the different PCV schedules and their increasing indirect effects over 4 years. The radiological pneumonia endpoint offers reasonable specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to detect a potential difference in the incidence of this important disease endpoint. However, limited frequency and statistical power precludes specification of a non-inferiority hypothesis for this endpoint. We will present a point estimate and confidence interval indicating the potential range of values of the incidence rate ratio of radiological pneumonia in the two groups. An additional secondary endpoint will be VT pneumococcal carriage at the community-level in all ages in year 4. This population-level measurement of VT carriage will include direct and indirect effects after 4 years of intervention delivery in the population.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Tertiary endpoints will include year 4 measurement of VT carriage in 6–12-week-old infants who have not yet been immunised with PCV. This analysis will relate only to indirect effects in this important age group. Endpoints specifying non-vaccine type (NVT) pneumococcal carriage will compare the effects of the schedules on potential ‘serotype replacement’ in carriage that follows vaccine-induced reductions in VT carriage. Additional disease endpoints will further inform the safety of the alternative schedule (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Specification of multiple complementary endpoints means that overall interpretation of the trial results will require synthesis of all the available information.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Analyses using the population-level population will compare the impact of the schedules relating to the total population, as is appropriate for decision-making in mature immunisation programmes. Analyses will also be conducted in the individual-level cohort enrolled to receive the intervention. Individual-level cohort analyses will provide information on the biological effects of the schedules, particularly related to the relative safety of the two schedules that can most easily be interpreted in the light of the wide range of settings where the schedules could be used. Differences between per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of the individual-level cohort will relate mainly to delays of receipt of scheduled doses and incorrect administration of schedules, which will differ from one setting to another.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The setting is a rural African location where over 75% of vaccination is provided through outreach visiting villages only once per month. The age at vaccination may therefore be different from that which applies in urban African settings, where vaccination may be more frequently available. The conduct of the trial has enhanced service delivery for the primary series of doses by a marginal degree so the age at vaccination in the trial is largely representative of the situation that would pertain should the alternative schedule be introduced in the routine EPI. However, the timing and coverage of the PCV booster dose at 9 months of age may have been enhanced to some degree. Thus, ITT analysis using the individual-level cohort will show the impact of the alternative schedule under a particular set of vaccination delivery circumstances that may not represent a routine setting. Analysis in the population-level population most clearly defines the conditions needed to combine all direct and indirect effects of the schedules in the population. The individual-level cohort PP results can most easily be compared between different study sites. The trial will include mathematical modelling of schedule effects on VT carriage with varied coverage of the alternative schedule PCV booster dose. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the analysis framework, specifying the populations and cohorts, observations and follow-up, endpoints, and effect measures.</p>

                <p id="Par38">The trial aims to account for the direct and indirect effects of vaccination with PCV13 at the population-level. We aim to test whether transition from the standard schedule to an alternative schedule, with doses scheduled at 6 weeks and 9 months of age, is non-inferior to continued use of the standard scheduling of doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.</p>

This rural Gambian population is the same as that included in an earlier trial that established the efficacy of PCV9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and effectiveness of routine infant vaccination with PCV13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The schedule tested in the PCV9 trial (doses scheduled at 6, 10, 14 weeks of age) is the same as the standard schedule in this non-inferiority trial. Efficacy of PCV9 was established using the endpoint of radiological pneumonia while the primary endpoint in this trial is VT carriage prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia. This trial includes radiological pneumonia as a secondary (safety) endpoint.</p>

                  <p id="Par66">The trial area of the BHDSS and FWHDSS consists of 68 contiguous geographic units within which resident infants are assigned to attend the one EPI clinic in that geographic area. All the geographic clusters in the BHDSS and FWHDSS were eligible for the trial. The geographic clusters of villages were mapped and designed to minimise the interaction of children in different clusters through school attendance. The average cluster population is 4000, although with significant variability. Group allocation of infants enrolled at EPI clinics is determined by the allocation of the village of residence.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par68">An independent statistician prepared the randomisation lists. All clusters were randomised at the beginning of the trial using a blocked scheme to ensure similar numbers of clusters were assigned to each group. Randomisation was stratified by (1) location (BHDSS or FWHDSS) and (2) a binary variable of ‘high’ or ‘low’ cluster-level incidence of clinical pneumonia (which correlates with VT pneumococcal carriage prevalence). Randomisation was carried out using the above stratification until restricted selections were achieved in which Basse and Bansang towns were in either trial group (the only two hospitals in the trial area are in Basse and Bansang), there was a balance in terms of the presence of a health facility in allocated clusters (i.e. six in one group and five in the other group), and there was balance on total population size between the two groups (i.e. &lt;10% difference in the two groups). Random allocation was performed and revealed in a public event in which one of 100 valid randomisation lists was randomly selected.</p>
                <p id="Par69">All resident infants are eligible for enrolment in the trial, according to the cluster allocation of their village of residence. Consent is sought for the enrolment of infants at EPI clinics to receive the interventions. Consent is also sought for the investigation of patients presenting to health facilities who are under surveillance for clinical endpoints, and also from pneumococcal carriage survey participants.</p>

                  <title>Non-inferiority margin</title>
                  <p id="Par70">We determined the non-inferiority margin using the concept of ‘largest loss of impact of the current treatment that would be clinically acceptable’, an approach recommended by the US FDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The non-inferiority margin uses a relative metric as the relative effect of the standard schedule is likely to be constant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The introduction of the standard schedule has reduced NP VT prevalence in children from 47 to 13%, i.e. a 72% reduction (author’s own data). Baseline risk may change over time, so an absolute value for the non-inferiority margin may not provide a reliable measure of the difference in impact of the two schedules.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">Given the advantages of the alternative schedule, the non-inferiority margin will be a 15% loss of the impact of the standard schedule; this value is supported by empiric survey data. In March 2017, an online survey was sent to 72 individuals involved in pneumococcal vaccine research, policy, and clinical care. Valid responses were received from 19 respondents. The survey question presented 10 hypothetical results of VT prevalence in the two trial groups, on a scale of increasing ‘loss of impact’ associated with the alternative schedule, from a baseline of no loss (i.e. a 0% loss of impact) up to a 50% loss of impact. Respondents were asked to consider themselves as decision-makers in their national immunisation programmes, requested to consider a change to their national programme from the standard to the alternative schedule based on the results of the trial. Respondents selected one option corresponding to the ‘loss of impact’ which would sway their decision against introducing the alternative schedule. Using the metric of a percentage loss of impact of the standard schedule which would sway decisions against the new schedule the mean value was a 22.2% loss of impact. The results of the survey support use of a non-inferiority margin that the alternative schedule be associated with a ≤15% loss of impact compared to the standard schedule.</p>
                  <p id="Par72">The prevalence of NP carriage of VT pneumococci in the BHDSS among young children with clinical pneumonia from Jan–Sept 2015 was 17% and fell to 15% in Oct–Dec 2015. Assuming VT prevalence of 13% in the standard schedule group at the end of the trial, a 15% loss of impact translates to prevalence in the alternative schedule group of (1 − [0.72 − (0.72 × 0.15)]) × 47% = 18.3%. The non-inferiority margin is expressed in terms of the prevalence ratio outcome measure as 18.0/13.0= 1.38. We used changes in VT prevalence to inform the non-inferiority margin because reductions in VT carriage following the introduction of PCV can predict the impact of PCV on IPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and because carriage prevalence is proportional to the rate of pneumococcal transmission.</p>
                  <p id="Par73">For the secondary endpoints of VT pneumococcal carriage prevalence in population-based surveys and among infants aged 6–12 weeks unimmunised with PCV, we will also use the non-inferiority margin of a ≤15% loss of impact in the alternative compared to standard schedule.</p>

                  <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                  <p id="Par74">Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcome of NP carriage of VT pneumococci in children aged 2–260 weeks with clinical pneumonia. Initial sample size calculations assumed an equal number of 60 participants measured for the primary endpoint in each cluster, that is, 2040 in each group and 4080 in total. Using Basse data from 2015, we assumed the prevalence of VT carriage to be 13% in both the standard and alternative schedule groups. The alternative schedule will be considered non-inferior if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the prevalence ratio is ≤1.38 (0.18/0.13 = 1.38). Using Basse data, we estimated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to be 0.01–0.02. We calculated study power using the methods of Farrington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and Donner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Using the more conservative value for ICC of 0.02, a minimum number measured for the primary endpoint per cluster of 60, with 34 clusters per arm (with design effect of 2.18) and <italic>α</italic>=0.05, a sample size of 2040 per arm will provide 93% power to test the non-inferiority of the alternative schedule.</p>

The simulated data were designed to be similar to the villages included in this trial with respect to the mean carriage prevalence, as well as the variability in prevalence across clusters. Using 1000 simulated populations, each consisting of 68 clusters of 60 individuals, baseline prevalence of 10% and a largest acceptable increase of 4%, i.e. from 10% to 14% (i.e. non-inferiority prevalence ratio of 0.14/0.10=1.40), study power was ≥85% in most scenarios.</p>
                  <p id="Par76">During the piloting of trial procedures, it became clear that the number of patients measured for the NP carriage endpoint would be quite variable among clusters with less than 60 patients in some clusters. Further simulations using local data on the variable numbers expected per cluster in 1 year (<italic>N</italic>=3948, median=33, range 7–506) and assuming VT prevalence of 16% in both groups demonstrated trial power of 90%. In order to maximise trial power, the primary outcome will be measured in all eligible patients in each of the 68 clusters with a total number ≥4080 included in the final year 4 analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par77">In the community carriage surveys in years 3 and 4, we will sample 60 residents in each of the 68 clusters. The same assumptions and methods of power calculation as for the primary endpoint will apply. We assume ICC=0.02, 15% baseline VT carriage prevalence in both groups, and a ≤1.38 prevalence ratio derived from the non-inferiority margin of a ≤15% ‘loss of effect’ compared to the standard schedule. If the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of our prevalence ratio comparing the alternative to the standard schedule clusters is ≤1.38, then the alternative schedule will be considered non-inferior. Following these assumptions, the community carriage surveys in years 3 and 4 will have power &gt;94% if we collect 4080 samples evenly across 68 clusters (i.e. 60 per cluster).</p>
                  <p id="Par78">Power for the tertiary endpoint of VT prevalence in PCV unimmunised infants aged 6–12 weeks (assume VT carriage prevalence of 10%) will be similar to that for the primary endpoint. The study is not powered to determine non-inferiority for other endpoints.</p>
                  <p id="Par79">As opposed to the non-inferiority hypothesis that is specified for the primary endpoint in year 4, we will specify a superiority hypothesis for the analysis of year 2 data on VT prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia. Setting a 5% level of significance with a two-sided test, power of 80%, with ICC=0.02, and assuming prevalence of VT carriage in the control group is 22%, we wish to detect an absolute difference of ≥7%. That is, the smallest clinically significant difference that we wish to detect is equivalent to prevalence of 15% versus 22% in the two groups and a prevalence ratio of 15.0/22.0=0.68. Given these parameters, if we measure the endpoint in 25 individuals per cluster, we would need to include 29 clusters in each group, that is, a total of 58 clusters. We will measure the endpoint in all 68 clusters using all the available measurements of the endpoint in year 2.</p>

                  <p id="Par82">The trial may be stopped early if there is evidence that the risk of pneumococcal disease is greater in one compared to the other trial group. Examples of such findings are group-wise differences in the incidence of VT IPD, radiological pneumonia, or hospitalisation. Although the correlation between the prevalence of VT carriage and disease risk is unclear, and carriage is not a measure of disease risk, the DMC may also gain appreciation of trial safety from the measures of VT carriage in children with clinical pneumonia and in community surveys. Rather than specify a formal stopping rule, the DMC will regularly view the accruing data, considering the overall pattern of results, including the consistency of any effects, the potential for effects to change over time, particularly the accumulation of indirect effects over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and the potential for cluster-specific events of a temporal nature.</p>
                  <p id="Par83">If the DMC recommends that the trial be stopped early, a joint meeting of the DMC, TSC, and Central Stakeholder Committee will make a recommendation to the Sponsor regarding post-trial procedures, including whether a dose of PCV be administered to children in a group found to be inferior.</p>

                    <title>Primary endpoint</title>
                    <p id="Par105">Estimation of the impact of the schedules in the population incorporates both direct and indirect effects of the schedules in those aged &lt;5 years in the geographic area. Measurement of the primary endpoint in year 4 of intervention allows time for the development of potentially differential impacts of the two schedules. The primary endpoint will be measured in all resident children aged 14–1826 days (2–260 weeks) presenting to health facilities in the study area with clinical pneumonia in year 4, assigning them to each group according to the group allocation of their village of residence, and regardless of whether the child was enrolled as an infant to receive the study intervention or number of PCV doses received (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Children eligible for selection for measurement of the primary endpoint will be (a) born in the HDSS, (b) resident in the HDSS in year 4, (c) aged 2–260 weeks on the day of presentation, and (d) present with clinical pneumonia at a health facility in the trial area. Neonates aged &lt;14 days are excluded as pneumococcal carriage is low at this age and to avoid potential ascertainment bias due to clinical events in the early neonatal period that are unrelated to pneumococcal transmission. The primary endpoint is a measure of VT prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia and does not require follow-up. VT carriage prevalence in each trial group will be calculated with the denominator being number of children eligible for measurement.</p>
                    <p id="Par106">PVS is a pragmatic trial under real-world conditions that aims to compare the impact of the two schedules in the population, taking into account direct and indirect effects. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates how coverage of the schedules will change over the 4 years of intervention, and by extension the timeline over which the impact of the schedules will develop. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A shows the projected coverage of the trial standard schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks) increasing over time (shaded area) in the allocated clusters. The projected coverage of the national standard schedule (2, 3, 4 months) decreases over time. A small proportion of children in the population never attend EPI clinics (~5%) and so maximum coverage is &lt;100%. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B shows the projected coverage of the alternative schedule (6 weeks, 9 months) increasing over time (shaded area). Children in the population who never attend EPI clinics never receive PCV (~5%) and a proportion of children decline consent for the study and receive the standard schedule (~3%). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that in year 4, coverage of the alternative schedule will still be increasing and not yet have reached maximal coverage. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B illustrates that in year 4, children represented by the shaded section will experience the direct and developing indirect effects of the 1+1 schedule, while those represented by the unshaded section will experience the direct effects of the 3+0 schedule and the developing indirect effects of the 1+1 schedule. Thus, in year 4, the majority of alternative schedule children aged 2–260 weeks will be experiencing the direct and indirect effect of the 1+1 schedule but a small proportion will be experiencing a mixture of effects of the standard and alternative schedules.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study timeline of percentage vaccination coverage over time among all resident children aged 0–260 weeks in the <bold>A</bold> standard 3+0 and <bold>B</bold> alternative 1+1 schedule groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6900_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                    <p id="Par107">The primary endpoint will be analysed at the population-level including all resident children aged 2–260 weeks, born in the HDSS, who present with clinical pneumonia in year 4 assigning them to each group according to the group allocation of their village of residence regardless of whether the child was enrolled as an infant to receive the study intervention and regardless of PCV schedule or number of doses received (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Eligible children will be aged 14–1826 days on the day of presentation to the health facility during year 4. The first day of study intervention is defined as the day on which all eligible infants in the population had an opportunity to be enrolled. The first dose of study intervention was administered on 2 September 2019 and the first day on which all eligible infants in the population at the time had an opportunity to be enrolled was 7 October 2019. Thus, the first day of year 4 of intervention will be 7 October 2022. Year 4 surveillance will begin on 1 November 2022.</p>

                    <p id="Par108">The population-level prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage will be measured in years 3 and 4 using age-stratified random samples of all residents in the HDSS (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Age-stratified random samples of 60 participants will be selected in each cluster with a total sample size of 4080 in each year. Ten individuals in each randomly selected household will be randomly selected, 2:2:2:1:1:1:1 according to the age stratification (0–11 months, 12–23 months, 24–59 months, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, 15–44 years, and ≥45 years). The prevalence of VT carriage will be calculated for each cluster using the number of enrolled participants as the denominator.</p>
                    <p id="Par109">The population-level prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage in infants aged 6–12 weeks unimmunised with PCV will be measured in year 4 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Eligible infants will be born to women resident in the HDSS, present to an EPI clinic, be 42–84 days of age, and not yet be immunised with a first dose of PCV. Sixty infants in each cluster will be randomly selected from eligible infants. The prevalence of VT carriage will be calculated for each cluster using the number of enrolled infants.</p>
                    <p id="Par110">The incidence of radiological pneumonia will be calculated in each year of the study in population-level cohorts and over the 4-year period of intervention. Population-level cohorts will include all resident children 0–1826 days of age with follow-up starting on the day of birth or day of migration into the HDSS, or the follow-up start date, whichever is later. Follow-up ends at death, migration out of the HDSS, at 1826 days of age, or the end of the follow-up period, whichever is earlier. Follow-up observation time for children will be assigned according to the group allocation of their village of residence at the beginning of follow-up, regardless of later episodes of internal migration, whether the child was enrolled as an infant to receive the study intervention, and regardless of the PCV schedule or number of doses received. Repeated events in an individual will be included as the overdispersion parameter in the negative binomial model will account for the non-independence of these events. Follow-up observation time for children will be assigned according to the group allocation of their village of residence taking into account later episodes of internal migration, but regardless of whether the child was enrolled as an infant to receive the study intervention and regardless of the PCV schedule or number of doses received.</p>
                    <p id="Par111">Analysis of VT IPD incidence will be calculated in each year of the study and over the 4-year period of intervention, at the population-level including resident children 0–1826 days of age with follow-up defined as for radiological pneumonia.

The individual-level ITT cohort will be used to calculate the prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage in resident study participants presenting with clinical pneumonia in year 4. The individual-level ITT cohort will include all resident participants enrolled to receive study interventions who present with clinical pneumonia, assigning them to the study groups according to the allocation of their village of residence at enrolment, regardless of age at enrolment, the schedule, or number of doses received. The denominator in prevalence calculations will be the number of eligible children with clinical pneumonia. Repeated events in one individual will be included with the related non-independence of events accounted for in the cluster-level effect included in the GEE model.</p>
                  <p id="Par119">The individual-level PP cohort will be used to calculate the prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage in study participants presenting with clinical pneumonia in year 4.

                  <p id="Par122">Individual-level cohort analyses using ITT and PP cohorts will calculate the incidence of radiological pneumonia and VT IPD. VT IPD is the most specific endpoint able to detect potentially differential efficacy of the two schedules; however, small numbers of events will limit the power to detect differences. Radiological pneumonia is an endpoint of unknown, but likely only modest specificity, and may be able to detect differences between the schedules. Although numbers of events are significant, the number is limited and may not have sufficient power to detect differences. Individual-level analyses using ITT and PP cohorts will also calculate the incidence of clinical pneumonia, hypoxic pneumonia, clinical pneumonia associated with NP carriage of VT, NVT, any pneumococci, hospitalisation, mortality, non-pneumococcal bacteraemia, and diarrhoea.</p>

Interpretation will relate to whether the prevalence of VT carriage in a child who lives in a geographic area allocated to the alternative schedule is not greater than the non-inferiority threshold when compared to a child who lives in a geographic area allocated to the standard schedule.</p>

The contrast between the two groups will be presented as a prevalence ratio, with ratios expressed as the prevalence in the alternative compared to standard schedule group. To account for cluster-level non-independence, the primary analysis will use generalised estimating equations (GEE) with a log link, binomial family, and exchangeable correlation structure. The primary analysis GEE model will include the stratifying covariates used in the randomisation of clusters: (i) cluster location in BHDSS or FWHDSS, (ii) cluster high or low baseline incidence of clinical pneumonia. Analysis will not include the other variables used to restrict the randomisation lists to ensure balance in the other baseline characteristics (see the ‘Randomisation’ section) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

                  <p id="Par162">The risk of measuring the endpoint in resident children aged 2–260 weeks with clinical pneumonia is dilution of potential differences between the two groups as a small proportion of children in their 4th year of life living in alternative schedule villages in year 4 will not have received the trial intervention and will experience the indirect effects of the alternative schedule but the direct effects of the standard schedule, introducing potential bias towards the null. This potential bias should be quite limited as the difference in direct effects of the schedules should be negligible in the 4th year of life.</p>

We will calculate incidence rate ratios for radiological pneumonia and hypoxic pneumonia among those who received PCV per-protocol (see the ‘Definition and assessment of adherence to the intervention’ section). We will count events from 14 days after administration of the first dose of PCV, before administration of the second dose (alternative schedule group), and ≤288 days of age (9 months and 2 weeks). We will also count events from 7 days after administration of the second dose of PCV (alternative schedule group) and &gt;288 days of age. These analyses will isolate the period of potential inferiority before the booster dose in the alternative schedule group.</p>

                <p id="Par185">PCV13 is a licensed product with an excellent safety profile. Safety at the individual level is best evaluated by comparison of infants enrolled at EPI clinics to receive the trial intervention schedules. In these safety analyses, the effects of the two schedules will not be diluted by the inclusion of children who may not have been enrolled to receive the interventions, as is done in population-level analyses. Thus, any differences between the two schedules will be more likely detected in these individual-level analyses. Individual-level ITT and PP safety analyses will include the endpoints of VT IPD, radiological pneumonia, and mortality incidence (see the ‘Individual-level cohort incidence endpoints’ section).</p>
                <p id="Par186">Serious adverse events (SAE), which will primarily be events of hospitalisation and deaths at home detected by the HDSS, will be reported in each group at the population-level (residents aged 0–260 weeks) and individual-level in infants enrolled to receive the interventions. Events of radiological pneumonia and VT IPD will be deemed SAEs of special interest, and reported in each group at the individual-level in enrolled infants.</p>
                <p id="Par187">Unsolicited reactogenicity events within 7 days of a dose of PCV recorded at EPI clinics will be reported in each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Severe adverse reactions to doses of PCV will be reported for each group, specifically episodes of anaphylaxis and severe local reactions. The probability of suspected unexpected severe adverse reactions (SUSAR) to doses of PCV will be reported based on the probability of any SAE in the 3 days following administration of dose two (age 10 weeks) or dose three (age 14 weeks) of PCV in the standard schedule group compared to 3-day period following these age points in the alternative schedule group. Similarly, we will compare the probability of an SAE in the 3 days following administration of the booster dose at age 9 months in the alternative schedule group compared to the 3-day period following this age point in the standard schedule group. These probabilities will be compared to indicate signals of potential SUSARs related to PCV.</p>
