                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to “shield” to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged ≥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of −0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI −2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI −1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI −0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months −0.87 (95% CI −1.56 to −0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (−1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (−1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (−4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (−4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (−2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (−2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The <underline><bold>B</bold></underline>ehavioural <underline><bold>A</bold></underline>ctivation in <underline><bold>S</bold></underline>ocial <underline><bold>I</bold></underline>so<underline><bold>l</bold></underline>ation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and replication will be explored in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In March 2020, a pandemic due to a new virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared. The first wave reached the United Kingdom within a short period of time, and, in March 2020, the UK governments (including devolved nations) administered a national stay-at-home order (“lockdown”), which included instructions for people to follow physical social distancing and self-isolation guidelines and recommendations for strict isolation (“shielding”) for the most vulnerable (such as those with long-term conditions (LTCs) and older people) in order to protect their own and others’ health and to avoid a sudden increase in demand on the National Health Service (NHS). Shielding orders were eased in the second half of 2020 but were reintroduced in January 2021 as part of a further lockdown in response to subsequent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) waves. Many people with LTCs have remained avoidant of social contact in order to protect themselves from COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, irrespective of official guidance [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Similar recommendations and restrictions were also set in place in many healthcare systems around the world.</p>
              <p>The mental health of the population has deteriorated during COVID-19 [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many report social isolation, and the incidence of depression and anxiety has increased for older people and those with medical vulnerabilities [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A plausible mechanism for this is that COVID-19 restrictions have led to disruption of daily routine, loss of social contact and heightened isolation, and increased loneliness, which are each powerful precipitants of mental ill health [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Anticipating these behavioural and psychological consequences, a rapid review published in <italic toggle="yes">The Lancet</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] highlighted the detrimental impacts on mental health of quarantine, but offered limited advice on how this could be mitigated.</p>
              <p>Social isolation, social disconnectedness, perceived isolation, and loneliness are known to be linked to common mental health problems, such as depression in older people [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The impairments in quality of life associated with depression are comparable to those of major physical illness [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and is also known to be detrimental to physical health and life expectancy [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Loneliness is not an inevitable consequence of social isolation, and strategies to prevent or mitigate loneliness were recognised as a population priority even before COVID-19 [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There are a number of promising interventions that focus on using social networks [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or adapting the strategies central to cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is recognised that strategies that, for instance, maintain social connectedness could be important in ensuring the population mental health of older people [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], particularly during the pandemic [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in the planning for post-pandemic recovery [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If a brief effective intervention for depression and loneliness could be delivered at distance (such as via telephone) and at scale, then this would lead to significant benefits to the NHS and society. This could potentially mitigate the immediate and longer lasting psychological impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations, including older people and those with LTCs [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our research collaborative has previously developed, with input from older adults and carers, a credible intervention that can potentially meet these needs in populations of older people [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and we have evaluated this in older populations with high rates of multiple LTCs [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Behavioural activation (BA) is a practical treatment that explores how physical inactivity and low mood are linked and result in a reduction of valued activity [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Within BA, the therapist and patient work together to develop a collaborative treatment plan that seeks to reinstate (or replace, if former activities are no longer possible) behaviours that connect people to sources of positive reinforcement (meaningful activity), including social connectedness. However, this has not yet been tested in a large-scale clinical trial or in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where social isolation is more prevalent. Small-scale trials of BA delivered to socially isolated older people have produced encouraging preliminary results [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but there is not yet sufficient research evidence to support whole-scale adoption or to inform the population response to COVID-19.</p>
              <p>Along with many researchers working in the field of mental health, we were keen to use our existing research expertise and research capacity to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore adapted our previous and ongoing work programme in early 2020 to answer the following question: “Can we prevent or ameliorate depression and loneliness in older people with long-term conditions during isolation?”.</p>
              <p>In this paper, we present the rationale and results of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of manualised BA, adapted specifically to be delivered at scale and remotely (via the telephone or video call) for older adults who may have become socially isolated as a consequence of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use behavioural approaches to prevent loneliness and depression in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this pilot RCT, we sought to assess the feasibility of recruiting and randomising participants to a trial of BA, of delivering the intervention, and of retaining participants in the trial. The primary clinical outcome was depression severity, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), at 1 month post-randomisation; secondary clinical outcomes were health-related quality of life, anxiety, and perceived social and emotional loneliness.</p>

The BASIL pilot is designed to provide key information on methods of recruitment, intervention uptake, retention, experience of the BA intervention for our target population, and acceptability of the intervention and training for intervention practitioners (hereafter BASIL support workers (BSWs)).</p>
                <p>The COVID-19 responsive BASIL trials programme is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under grant RP-PG-0217-20006 and was adopted by the NIHR Urgent Public Health programme on May 28, 2020 [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The protocol for the BASIL pilot study was preregistered (ISRCTN94091479) on June 9, 2020, and recruitment took place between June 23 and October 15, 2020 (18 weeks in total). Older adults at risk of loneliness and depression as a consequence of social isolation under COVID-19 restrictions were recruited from primary care registers in the North East of England. They were randomised to receive either usual primary care from their general practice or BA intervention in addition to usual care (see below for full description of usual care and BA intervention).</p>

                <p>After consent, eligible participants completed a baseline questionnaire over the telephone with a study researcher. Consent was obtained, either in written form or via verbal consent [recorded] over the telephone. Participants were then randomised and informed of their group allocation (intervention or usual care with signposting). Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio using simple randomisation without stratification. Treatment allocation was concealed from study researchers at the point of recruitment using an automated computer data entry system, administered remotely by the York Trials Unit and using a computer-generated code. Owing to the nature of the intervention, none of the participants, general practices, study clinicians, or BSWs could be blinded to treatment allocation. General practitioners (GPs) were informed by letter of participant treatment allocation. Outcome assessment was by self-report, and study researchers facilitating the telephone-based outcome assessment were blind to treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>Intervention (BA)</title>
                <p>The intervention (BA within a collaborative care framework) has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and was adapted for the purposes of the BASIL trial. Within the BASIL BA intervention, the therapist (BSW) and participant worked together to develop a collaborative treatment plan that sought to reinstate (or replace, if former activities were no longer possible because of social isolation and/or LTCs) behaviours that connect them to sources of positive reinforcement (valued activity). BA has the potential to address depression and loneliness in the presence of social isolation in this way [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the simplicity of BA made it suitable for delivery in the context of COVID-19.</p>
                <p>Intervention participants were offered up to 8 sessions over a 4- to 6-week period delivered by trained BSWs, accompanied by participant materials. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a BASIL BA workbook. This booklet was modified to take account of government guidance regarding the need for social isolation/physical distancing and enforced isolation for those people most at risk (“extremely vulnerable” people). For example, the BASIL booklet discussed ways to replace activities that are no longer possible with ones that preserve social distancing while helping participants stay connected with the activities and people important to them; illustrative patient stories included in the booklet were modified to take account of COVID-19 restrictions. Examples of replacement activities from the BASIL self-help manual are presented in <xref rid="pmed.1003779.box001" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>. BA acknowledged the disruption to people’s lives and usual routines and encouraged the establishment of a balanced daily routine. The intervention also recognised that participants may be worried about the current situation due to COVID-19 and suggested strategies to help cope.</p>

                    <p>BA pays particular attention to the function the behaviour holds for an individual and that reinforcement is determined functionally. An important consequence of this view is the idea of functional equivalence. A specific form of a behaviour may have served a particular function for a person; however, that behaviour may no longer be possible due to physical health problems or COVID-19 lockdown. In this situation, an aim of treatment was to identify a functionally equivalent behaviour that is different and therefore still possible despite physical changes or shielding, but which may serve the same function for a person. Below are 2 illustrative examples of functionally equivalent goals from the BASIL self-help manual.</p>

                <p>All intervention sessions were delivered remotely via telephone or video call, according to participant preference. The first session was scheduled to last approximately 1 hour, with subsequent sessions lasting approximately 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>Depression symptom monitoring at each intervention session was undertaken using a validated depression scale (the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) with scores guiding decision-making by BSWs and guided by supervision provided by clinical members of the study team. Where risk or significant clinical deterioration was noted, the participant was supported to access more formal healthcare interventions (including mental health care) via their GP. Where feasible and where considered appropriate and acceptable by the participant and BSW, the intervention was extended to include involvement of a participant’s informal caregiver/significant other. Intervention participants continued to receive their usual care/treatment (where this was feasible given COVID-19) alongside the BASIL intervention, and no treatment was withheld.</p>

                <p>The primary objective for this pilot trial was to obtain estimates of key feasibility measures including rates of recruitment, randomisation, retention, intervention delivery, and engagement.</p>
                <p>The primary clinical outcome was self-reported symptoms of depression, assessed by the PHQ-9 [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The PHQ-9 was also administered at screening to ascertain risk of self-harm or suicide and again at baseline, 1 and 3 months post-randomisation. The primary time point was 1 month. Other secondary clinical outcomes measured at baseline, 1 and 3 months, were health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)) [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], anxiety (measured by the GAD-7) [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale), and questions relating to COVID-19 circumstances and adherence to government guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The PHQ-9 is scored from 0 to 27, the GAD-7 from 0 to 21, and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale from 0 to 11 (emotional subscale from 0 to 6 and social from 0 to 5), for each a higher score indicates a worse outcome. The physical and mental health component scores of the SF-12v2 range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health. We also tested our ability to collect resource use data, but these data are not summarised or described, since there was no planned economic evaluation in this pilot trial.</p>

                  <p>The primary aim of the BASIL pilot trial was to test the feasibility of the intervention and the methods of recruitment, randomisation, and follow-up [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sample size calculations were based on estimating attrition and standard deviation (SD) of the primary outcome. We aimed to recruit 100 participants. The intervention was delivered by BSWs and allowed for potential clustering by BSWs assuming an intercluster correlation (ICC) of 0.01 and mean cluster size of 15 based upon previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The effective sample size was therefore 88. Anticipating 15% to 20% of participants would be lost to follow-up (based on 17% in the CollAborative care and active surveillance for Screen-Positive EldeRs with subthreshold depression (CASPER) trial of older adults [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), this would result in an effective sample size of at least 70 participants, which is sufficient to allow reasonably robust estimates of the SD of the primary outcome measure to inform the sample size calculation for a definitive trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

There was reasonable balance in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, but with some differences including a larger proportion of females, and current and former smokers, and fewer participants shielding in the usual care group than the intervention group; however, given the sample size, each participant per group equates to approximately 2 percentage points, so even small numerical imbalances equate to more noticeable imbalances in proportions.</p>

The number of sessions completed range from 0 to 8 (median of 6 sessions) out of a total of up to 8 sessions. Participants preferred telephone over video contact. Sessions lasted a mean of 36.7 minutes (SD 15.7). Two participants withdrew from the intervention (after completing 1 and 2 sessions, respectively); one participant stated their reason for withdrawal was that they felt “well,” and the intervention was “not for them” as they were already engaging in BA-related activities. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention.</p>

                <p>Intervention participants were invited to be interviewed following completion of the 1-month follow-up and conclusion of their participation in the BASIL pilot intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 participants who completed the BA intervention. A study participant who did not complete the BASIL intervention was interviewed as a “non-completer.” All 9 BSWs who delivered the BASIL intervention were interviewed between August 2020 and November 2020. All interviews were conducted over the telephone, digitally recorded with consent and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts formed the basis for analysis. We summarise the key findings from a thematic analysis [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and subsequent changes to the BASIL intervention ahead of the BASIL main trial. Analysis sensitised by the TFA [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] will be reported separately.

                  <title>Recruitment and study eligibility</title>
                  <p>Study recruitment methods appeared to be generally acceptable and clear:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“The doctor gives you a warning that this is about to happen [be contacted] and then you’re prepared when somebody phones up that it’s not a scam, a con, which is what I don’t worry about it because I know how to deal with it but to some people it could be worrying.” (OA16)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some participants, generally participants without symptoms of depression at study entry and also some BSWs, raised the importance of more targeted recruitment to the BASIL intervention:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“I do think just some consideration needs to be given to who we’re targeting, maybe it’s not quite so useful for people on the threshold of depression and feel that they’re doing quite well.” (BSW 04)</p>
                    <p>“I think possibly it needs to be more targeted, so anybody who has a painful medical condition or who lives alone who is isolated. Certainly I think it would benefit [people who are isolated] a lot. I think the wide spread that you have currently can be more targeted. [it could be] more focused and more helpful.” (OA02)</p>

                  <title>Intervention delivery and content</title>
                  <p>Remote delivery of the intervention by telephone was acceptable. Although video calls were offered, these were not taken up by participants. Some participants and BSWs reported they would have preferred face-to-face intervention delivery, had this been possible. One participant suggested that those with hearing difficulties would find telephone delivery more difficult. The number and frequency of intervention sessions were acceptable, although one participant reported that they would prefer 1 session per week to allow them time to implement agreed activities and plans. Some BSWs reported that it could be difficult to stick to the 30-minute timing for more complex or isolated cases, where meetings took longer.</p>
                  <p>The BASIL BA self-help booklet was thought to be engaging, and people found the mood/behaviour cycle understandable. However, some participants—those with few depression symptoms at study entry—found this model of limited relevance. Several participants reported that they would use the booklet after the intervention ended:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“So, in days of darkness I’ll be able to flick through it [the booklet] and say, that’s what that was all about, how to break things down and not get upset about them and not let them get you down.” (OA06)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The patient stories in the booklet were reported to be relevant, although some participants reported that booklet activity examples could ideally be more varied. Both BSWs and participants found activity planning to be sometimes difficult, especially where some services were shut under lockdown conditions. Planned activities may therefore need to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

                  <p>The process evaluation led to intervention adaptations for the BASIL main trial, including refining the study eligibility criteria, adaptions to the self-help booklet to make reference to a wider range of example activities, making reference to modifying goals, bringing discussion of “functional activities” forward, and providing a large print version of the self-help booklet when needed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The BASIL trial is an external pilot trial designed to test acceptability of an adapted intervention and to refine trial procedures and design prior to undertaking a full-scale trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our main finding is that higher-risk older people with LTCs living under COVID-19 restrictions were receptive to an approach to participate in a trial of a behavioural intervention. When offered BA, they preferred telephone contact rather than an offer of technology-enabled video calling. Levels of engagement with BA were high, with a greater proportion completing 6 or more planned sessions. Some people with LTCs declined the BASIL offer of telephone support.</p>
              <p>In qualitative interviews, it was clear that those with very mild depression and good adaptation to socially-isolating restrictions were not an appropriate target group. This has led us to refine and target our intervention in a fully powered trial, and we will now only focus on older people who have some depressive symptoms above a threshold and at risk of further deterioration in mental health.</p>
              <p>Although underpowered to test effectiveness, the between-group comparisons using CIs included benefit for BA in mitigating levels of depression at 3 months. For our measure of loneliness, there was good evidence of benefit and was unlikely to be a chance finding. Our preliminary analysis is in line with a CI approach to the interpretation of pilot trials [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and we are keen not to overinterpret the positive finding of mitigating loneliness using BA. However, this is an encouraging finding that triangulates with the theoretical basis of BA in social isolation and the evidence of engagement and feasibility in the pilot trial. This justifies the need for a full-scale trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where the consistency of this effect will be tested with greater levels of power and precision. The BASIL+ trial (the fully powered follow-on trial) is now underway and is preregistered (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN63034289" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN63034289</ext-link>) to reflect the design adaptations from the pilot study.</p>
              <p>The BASIL trial and nested qualitative work adds to an emerging literature on the use of psychological interventions that incorporate cognitive or behavioural strategies to address loneliness and its causal role in depression [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Research to date has shown behavioural approaches to be highly effective in the treatment of depression among older people [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the preliminary results of the BASIL trial lend support to this approach in the face of COVID-19 restrictions and in mitigating loneliness [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A fully powered trial of BA is now underway, and in time, this will report on the short- and long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a scalable behavioural psychosocial intervention. This will add to an emerging trial-based literature to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions that target loneliness [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our pilot trial was also undertaken rapidly and during the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. As such, we, along with other researchers undertaking trials during COVID-19, have had to adapt the methods used to generate randomised evidence. We have shown that it is possible to deliver trials with adaptations to minimise patient contact and streamline recruitment procedures. This makes us confident that this is an efficient method of participant engagement and follow-up for future trials, both under COVID-19 and beyond the pandemic [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is of note that the time elapsed between the onset of the pandemic and the recruitment of the first participant was less than 3 months. We chose to study the impact of a plausible psychosocial intervention to mitigate depression and loneliness in an at-risk population of older people with multimorbidity. Population surveys under COVID-19 have shown that younger people are also at risk of loneliness [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and psychological deterioration [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is important that interventions to tackle the higher rates of depression and loneliness in all age groups are also developed and evaluated. Finally, we note that we worked with experts by experience at all stages of the design and delivery of the BASIL trial, and we believe the high levels of engagement reflect the positive contribution made by older people with lived experience in the BASIL programme.</p>
              <p>The BASIL study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. Finally, we acknowledge that we have relied on self-reported activity and social contact, and we ultimately do not know if this did in fact increase as a consequence of the intervention. The BASIL trial remains in follow-up, and we will report 12-month outcomes when these become available.</p>
              <p>At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was predicted that there would be significant impacts on public mental health [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including loneliness and depression, as a consequence of pandemic restrictions. This has come to pass [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and population surveys indicate increased reports of loneliness and reports of depression [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The pandemic has also prompted a number of studies to understand the impacts of COVID-19 [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but there have been very few studies to evaluate psychosocial interventions to mitigate psychological impact [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To our knowledge, BASIL is the first study to report trial-based evidence.</p>
              <p>A clinical priority and policy imperative is to identify a brief and scalable intervention to prevent and mitigate loneliness, particularly in older people [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The preliminary results are in line with potential benefit for this intervention in mitigating loneliness at 3 months. We will now test the short- and long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness. This evidence may prove to be useful in improving the mental health of populations during the time of COVID-19 and also in mitigating depression and loneliness in socially isolated at-risk populations after the pandemic has passed [<xref rid="pmed.1003779.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the opportunity to review this pilot study, looking at behavioural activation in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is an important, interesting, and well written manuscript, and I have only a few comments below.</p>
              <p>Page 5 - how were "older adults at risk loneliness and depression as a consequence of social isolation under COVID-19 restrictions" specifically defined? What were the risk factors?</p>
              <p>Page 7 - I would like to see some more detail on the intervention itself. I'm particularly interested in examples of the "replacement" activities suggested to participants. </p>
              <p>Page 12 - There look to be quite considerable differences between the treatment and control groups at baseline, including differences in gender, LTC type, smoking status, education, and current circumstances. The authors do note the differences but state that there was a "reasonable balance in baseline characteristics". I am not sure I agree with this statement. Could the authors discuss this as a limitation further? </p>
              <p>There are also some differences between PHQ-9 at baseline, and the ES within groups at one month and comparable for both the treatment and control groups (around 0.2). There are some shifts in severity categories (table 2) that look different between groups, however it is not clear whether this is significant. Have the authors looked at reliable improvement or reliable improvement, which would allow us to see whether the movement above or below clinical thresholds is significant? If not for the pilot, then as part of the full-scale trial?</p>
              <p>I am impressed by the high levels of engagement. Do the authors have any thoughts on the reasons for this or comparable studies that have (or have not) achieved such high completion rates?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting paper describing an external pilot trial of a behavioural activation programme for older adults with long term health conditions. The paper is clearly written and the trial appears to have been conducted and reported in accordance with the ISRCTN-registered protocol. Changes to the trial aims and design from the originally funded programme, in response to the pandemic context, are clearly described. Learning from this pilot trial and resulting changes to the protocol for the future main trial are also clearly set out. </p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>1. Process evaluation: report how many and which people were involved in data analysis, coding transcripts and reviewing/developing a coding frame. </p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p>1. I think the authors should report statistical comparisons between groups for all of the secondary outcomes or none of them. Loneliness is only listed as one of several secondary outcomes in the ISRCTN protocol - after anxiety. Just reporting one secondary outcome risks looking like the authors have cherry-picked the most positive result. The descriptive data for GAD-7 looks a lot less promising - was this result significant? To avoid any chance of misinterpretation, I think the authors should also avoid saying that non-significant results "favoured" the intervention group (p15 and throughout). </p>
              <p>2. I think the abstract should be correspondingly amended - just report the feasibility outcomes and primary outcome, or all secondary outcomes too.</p>
              <p>3. The appendices reporting the characteristics of the participants and support workers should be more clearly labelled to make it clear that these are the characteristics of those participating in the qualitative interviews</p>
              <p>The accompanying qualitative interviews are only reported very briefly, but this may be due to space constraints, and it's good to see a separate publication will follow which can do more justice to this work. It is helpful to have even the brief summary of findings provided here. </p>
              <p>4. The brief summary of study adaptations on p.17 could be helpfully described more fully - in an appendix if space is short in the main paper. </p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>Overall I thought the discussion was clear, fair and to the point. I think the authors are right to conclude that this pilot demonstrates clearly that a trial of this intervention is feasible and acceptable, and there is an exciting signal of efficacy for loneliness (less clear for depression - see below). I think two limitations should be briefly acknowledged and one conclusion qualified. </p>
              <p>1. The authors should acknowledge as a limitation that they haven't measured, or even apparently got an indication from the qualitative interviews, of whether the intervention did increase people's activity or social contact with others. The process evaluation hasn't been able to determine whether the intervention achieved the intended behaviour change which may lead to reduced depression or loneliness.</p>
              <p>2. The authors should also acknowledge more explicitly that the pilot study took place in the highly unusual covid pandemic context, when many older adults with long term conditions were shielding or diligently socially-distancing. It can't be certain that recruitment and retention would be as easy or outcomes would be similar in a changing covid or post-covid context. (Although I agree with the authors that their recruitment and retention rates are so good, it bodes well for non-covid contexts too.)</p>
              <p>3. I think the concluding statement on p.19 is overstated " The preliminary results are in line with potential benefit for this intervention at 3 months". For the primary depression outcome, mean PHQ-9 scores for the treatment group dropped by less than a point during the study; the three month between-groups comparison offers no indication of efficacy; and even at the top end of the confidence intervals, the between group difference is less than two points, i.e. less than the threshold on PHQ-9 for when patients are likely to notice a meaningful change (Kounali et al. 2020). This should be briefly discussed and the conclusion qualified accordingly. I agree the results are more promising for loneliness. </p>
              <p>And finally, it's good news that a full trial of the revised programme is already underway.</p>
              <p>4. Please provide the ISRCTN reference number for the full trial and a reference for the weblink so this can be easily found by interested readers. </p>

              <p>Reviewer #3: Thanks for the opportunity to review your manuscript. My role is as a statistical reviewer, so my questions and comments focus on the study design, data, and analysis presented. I have put general comments and questions first and followed these with queries relevant to a specific part of the manuscript (with a page and paragraph number reference).</p>
              <p>This manuscript presents 'BASIL', a pilot RCT that tests an intervention of behavioural activation against usual care in older adults (&gt;65) with chronic health conditions from general practices in the UK. The behavioural activation component was delivered remotely with the COVID-19 restrictions in mind. The primary aim of the pilot was assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Investigators also collected PHQ9 and other secondary measures including HR-QOL, anxiety, and loneliness. </p>
              <p>94% of participants were in 1-month follow-up, and 90% at three months of follow-up, with a high proportion of patients recruited after screening. The qualitative component indicated good acceptability of the BA as well. All together indicating a promising piloted intervention. This is an impressive effort as it was organised and run during the first wave of COVID-19 (and to think I was just moping around at home in my trackpants during the same time-period). I have some queries that I would like resolved but this manuscript should be considered again after revision.</p>
              <p>How was the missing data accounted for in the analyses? It looks as though a complete case analysis was used, which I think is fine considering efficacy isn't the main consideration, but it should be clear that this approach was used and what the limitations are of assuming MCAR. </p>
              <p>Was the study conducted across all the UK or focused in a particular region?</p>
              <p>P3, Paragraph 3. Could you add the number of available sessions to the info about median session completed, e.g. (median 6 sessions out of 8 available)?</p>
              <p>Paragarph 4. 'unlikey to be due to chance' seems like a clumsy way to describe this - maybe 'good evidence' is better? </p>
              <p>P4, Paragraph 1. Would it be better to qualify 'social isolation' as 'physical social isolation'?</p>
              <p>P6, Paragraph 2. Could the complete list of physical conditions be included somewhere in the manuscript (even as a supp appendix)? There is list of some in Table 1 but there are quite a few people with 'other'. </p>
              <p> P7, Paragraph 4. What was the typical type of care that risky patients were referred to? How many were referred to more formal healthcare interventions during the study? </p>
              <p>P9, Paragraph 1. Is the SAP available to be reviewed with the manuscript? Also, could the full protocol be attached, I tried to follow the reference number in the methods but got the 'page not found' each time I tried to load it (user error hopefully).</p>
              <p>Clustering by BSW was included in the sample size calculations, was this also accounted for in the main analyses?</p>
              <p>How was baseline adjusted for? By using a change-score in the analysis, or by including the baseline score as a covariate ('ANCOVA' approach)? </p>
              <p>Were the key assumptions of the general linear model checked, e.g. distribution of residuals, linearity of baseline score (assuming the ANCOVA approach was used), no highly influential observations? </p>
              <p>P12, Table 1. Could you add a footnote clarifying the differences between 'Shielding' and the other distancing/isolating categories?</p>
              <p>P12, Paragraph 1. Yes, a bit of imbalance but probably about what you would expect for that number of baseline characteristics and nothing I'd be too worried about. </p>
              <p>P15, Paragraph 1. Is the unadjusted mean difference presented in the results? The easiest way to add this would probably be to add a column to the Table 3.</p>
              <p>This is the first time statistical significance has been mentioned - what level of alpha was used? Or was this based on the confidence limits? It might be better to just discuss the CI for scores and talk about the relative level of evidence for efficacy e.g. no evidence, some evidence, good evidence etc. (not that I would expect to see this for a pilot study). </p>
              <p>P18. Paragraph 1. My own view on pilot studies (there is a good discussion about this in Westlund and Stuart 2018: <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1098214016651489" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1177/1098214016651489</ext-link>) is that the theoretical grounds for why an intervention may work, along with the feasibility and acceptability are what really drive the justification for a full evaluation. The efficacy findings are promising but I don't think it's these that justify a full study.</p>
              <p>Figure 1. It would be easier to track the withdrawls and incomplete data if these weren't cumulative - I couldn't figure out whether patients are discontinued if they did not complete a questionnaire at month 1, e.g. in the usual care arm the number of patients goes from 49 to 45 (loss of 4), but there is 1 full withdrawal and 4 incomplete questions. Did one of the patients fully withdraw and also not complete questionnaire? </p>
              <p>Supp Appendix</p>
              <p>Table 1. It would be easier to read the table with the columns for completers and non-completers next to each other. Some more detailed table titles would be helpful - I assume 'non-completers' are participants in the intervention arm who didn't complete the modules, not study non-completers.</p>

              <p>Supplementary files</p>
              <p>Please replace 'gender' with 'sex' in your SAP file </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors have addressed my previus comments. I have no further comments. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors have adequately addressed my previous comments except in these two respects:</p>
              <p>Results comment 1: The authors said they have removed the term "favoured" where this was used to describe non-significant differences between groups. But they haven't in lines 430 and 432: I still think they should.</p>
              <p>Results comment 2: I recommended that the abstract should just report the primary outcomes and the feasibility outcomes; or all the secondary outcomes, not just selected secondary outcomes. The authors said they have amended the abstract to incorporate this suggestion. They have now listed all the secondary outcomes in the abstract methods, but in the abstract results, they still report the results for one secondary outcome (loneliness) but not the other secondary outcomes. I think they should amend this as I suggested, and report results for all secondary outcomes or none in the abstract. </p>
              <p>If the authors address these two points to the editors' satisfaction, I think this paper is very suitable for publication in PLOS Medicine without need for further review. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Thanks for the revised manuscript and responses to my original queries.</p>
              <p>I have reviewed the SAP - this matches the analysis described in the manuscript, thanks for including this.</p>
              <p>The changes and responses all address my original review well and I have no further requested revisions.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Prof. Gilbody, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues and the Academic Editor, Prof. Vikram Patel, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Behavioural activation to prevent depression and loneliness among socially isolated older people with long term conditions: the BASIL COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-21-02049R3) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>medicinepress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Thank you again for submitting to PLOS Medicine. We look forward to publishing your paper. </p>
              <p>Sincerely, </p>
