                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>To improve quality of care for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), a structured model for integrated OA care was developed based on international recommendations. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of this model in primary care.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We conducted a cluster-randomised controlled trial with stepped-wedge cohort design in 6 Norwegian municipalities (clusters) between January 2015 and October 2017. The randomised order was concealed to the clusters until the time of crossover from the control to the intervention phase. The intervention was implementation of the SAMBA model, facilitated by interactive workshops for general practitioners and physiotherapists with an update on OA treatment recommendations. Patients in the intervention group attended a physiotherapist-led OA education and individually tailored exercise programme for 8–12 weeks. The primary outcome was patient-reported quality of care (OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire; 0–100, 100 = optimal quality) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported referrals to physiotherapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and orthopaedic surgeon consultation; patients’ satisfaction with care; physical activity level; and proportion of patients who were overweight or obese (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). In all, 40 of 80 general practitioners (mean age [SD] 50 [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] years, 42% females) and 37 of 64 physiotherapists (mean age [SD] 42 [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] years, 65% females) participated. They identified 531 patients, of which 393 patients (mean age [SD] 64 [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] years, 71% females) with symptomatic hip or knee OA were included. Among these, 109 patients were recruited during the control periods (control group), and 284 patients were recruited during interventions periods (intervention group). The patients in the intervention group reported significantly higher quality of care (score of 60 versus 41, mean difference 18.9; 95% CI 12.7, 25.1; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) and higher satisfaction with OA care (odds ratio [OR] 12.1; 95% CI 6.44, 22.72; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) compared to patients in the control group. The increase in quality of care was close to, but below, the pre-specified minimal important change. In the intervention group, a higher proportion was referred to physiotherapy (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.08, 5.73; <italic>p =</italic> 0.03), a higher proportion fulfilled physical activity recommendations (OR 9.3; 95% CI 2.87, 30.37; <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001), and a lower proportion was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.08, 0.80; <italic>p =</italic> 0.02), as compared to the control group. There were no significant group differences regarding referral to MRI (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.13, 2.38; <italic>p =</italic> 0.42) and proportion of patients who were overweight or obese (OR 1.3; 95% CI 0.70, 2.51; <italic>p =</italic> 0.34). Study limitations include the imbalance in patient group size, which may have been due to an increased attention to OA patients among the health professionals during the intervention phase, and a potential recruitment bias as the patient participants were identified by their health professionals.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this study, a structured model in primary care resulted in higher quality of OA care as compared to usual care. Future studies should explore ways to implement the structured model for integrated OA care on a larger scale.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of pain and disability in the adult population worldwide and a major contributor to years lived with disability [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prevalence of OA increases with age, and with an aging population and the epidemic of obesity, it is set to rise [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The costs of treatment and work-related losses represent a considerable economic burden [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recommended first-line core treatments include patient education, self-management, exercise, and weight reduction [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When non-pharmacological and pharmacological care fail, joint replacement offers an effective approach, although it is costly and associated with medical and surgical risks [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The demand for joint replacement is expected to accelerate and quadruple by 2030 with the increasing prevalence of OA [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Decisions on joint replacement involve conventional radiographs, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually considered unnecessary [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>An evidence-to-practice gap for OA care has been identified internationally, with poor uptake of non-pharmacological approaches such as patient education and exercise treatment in contrast to surgical treatment [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, as 22%–68% of joint replacements are considered inappropriate [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is important to improve the uptake of non-surgical care. A small number of best practice initiatives to improve the quality of OA care have shown promising but somewhat diverging results [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Inspired by these previous initiatives [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and based on international recommendations for OA care [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the SAMBA model for integrated care for patients with hip and knee OA [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was developed by the research team for evaluation in a randomised controlled trial. SAMBA is an acronym formed from the Norwegian project title, ‘SAMhandling for Bedre Artrosebehandling i kommunehelsetjenesten’, which can be translated as ‘improved management of patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis in primary healthcare’.</p>
              <p>The main aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of the SAMBA model in primary healthcare. We hypothesised that compared to usual OA care, the SAMBA model would increase the uptake of best practices for OA, demonstrate higher patient satisfaction with care, and increase beneficial lifestyle characteristics (physical activity, healthy weight). We hypothesised that compared with usual care, the SAMBA model would offer improvements in referral pathways, e.g., more general practitioner (GP) referrals to physiotherapy, more discharge reports from physiotherapy to referring GPs, and fewer GP referrals to MRI and orthopaedic surgeons.</p>

                <p>We performed a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cluster-RCT) with a stepped-wedge cohort design between 15 January 2015 and 20 October 2017. The study was conducted in 6 neighbouring municipalities (clusters) north of Oslo, Norway, with approximately 100,000 inhabitants in total. The stepped-wedge design is explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002949.g001">Fig 1</xref> and in the published study protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

                    <p>All 6 municipalities (clusters) started the trial simultaneously with a control phase (general practitioners and physiotherapists providing usual care). At predefined time points about every second month, one by one the municipalities crossed from the control to the intervention phase (use of the SAMBA model) in a randomised order. Light cells in the figure represent control periods, and dark cells represent intervention periods. The asterisks indicate the timing of the interactive workshops before switching to the intervention phase. Patients recruited to the study during the control phase in any cluster constituted the control group, whereas patients recruited during the intervention phase constituted the intervention group. All patients responded to the baseline questionnaire and follow-up questionnaires at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline. <sup>a</sup>Large municipalities (clusters) had &gt;20,000 inhabitants.</p>

                <p>Potential eligible patients were identified at clinical visits by the GPs and PTs using the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 45 years with symptomatic hip and/or knee OA diagnosis verified clinically or radiologically by the GP. Patients who did not understand Norwegian or who had 4 joint replacements (hip + knee), inflammatory rheumatic disease, malignant illness, or any other major condition that restricted their ability to adhere to the intervention were excluded [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Immediately before study initiation, the municipalities were randomly allocated to 1 of the 6 sequences for time of crossover from the control to the intervention phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002949.g001">Fig 1</xref>) using a computer-generated list of random numbers provided by a statistician. To ensure a mix of municipality sizes in the randomised sequence, stratification on the number of inhabitants (less than versus more than 20,000) was performed. The randomised order was concealed to the clusters until soon before the switch. It was not possible to blind the involved GPs, PTs, or patients, but a statistician blinded for group allocation performed the statistical analyses of the primary outcome.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The SAMBA model for integrated OA care was developed by the research team and comprised a structured pathway for patients with OA through the healthcare system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002949.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The model included a GP consultation, a PT-led OA education and exercise programme (ActiveA), an optional healthy eating program, and a GP review consultation. The GPs were instructed to explain the OA diagnosis and treatment alternatives, provide pharmacological treatment when appropriate, and suggest referral to physiotherapy. The PT-led patient OA education programme was group-based and lasted 3 hours. This was followed by an 8–12 week exercise programme with twice weekly 1-hour supervised group sessions (5–10 patients per PT). Based on patient examination, the PT prescribed individually tailored resistance exercise programmes to increase muscular strength. The pool of recommended exercises was selected from previous OA exercise studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Dose recommendations were based on acknowledged international guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and included gradually increasing the dose towards 2–4 sets with 8–12 repetitions and 60%–70% of 1 repetition maximum, or more if tolerated. The PTs were instructed to closely monitor the patients’ exercise performance and regularly provide appropriate individual adjustments of the exercise programme for progression. When the patient could perform 2 extra repetitions in the last set, the resistance was increased (‘the 2+ principle’). The patients were encouraged to add a third home-based session consisting of 30–60 minutes of cardiorespiratory exercise like brisk walking, running, or bicycling.</p>

                <p>The model intends to improve the quality of OA care through delivery of evidence-based recommendations for OA care, focusing on the core treatments, first-line analgesics, and facilitating multidisciplinary collaboration. Informed by theoretical models [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and previously developed behaviour change interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], a strategy [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was designed to facilitate the use of the model among GPs and PTs in primary healthcare in the intervention phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002949.s003">S3 Text</xref>). Tailored interactive workshops for GPs and PTs were arranged in close proximity to the time of crossover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002949.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and reflected the main intervention, ensuring the use of the model in the intervention phase. Other strategies to facilitate the use of the SAMBA model in the intervention phase included summarised treatment recommendations, regular telephone reminders, quarterly letters with feedback, and biannual outreach visits known to be effective in primary care (see details in the published protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p>

The workshop included an update on OA epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment recommendations. Education in delivery of a patient OA education programme, individually tailored semi-standardised exercises, performance testing, and healthy eating and weight reduction strategies was given. The PTs received access to the ready-to-use patient OA education programme (PowerPoint file and manuscript) and access to a database with recommendations for resistance exercises and dose.</p>

                <title>Control</title>
                <p>During the control phase, the GPs and the PTs delivered usual care and were naïve to the SAMBA model. Usual care may include infrequent GP visits, pharmacological therapy, and occasionally a referral to physiotherapy. Patients included during the control phase were allowed to receive physiotherapy, but not to attend the patient OA education programme nor the individually tailored exercise programme, prior to 12 months post-baseline. Physiotherapy provided to patients with knee OA may include exercise, but also often includes several other treatment modalities (e.g., massage, traction/mobilisation, stretching, and electrotherapy) showing moderate or low quality of evidence, or no evidence, in systematic reviews [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>

Information on the patients’ age, sex, previous or planned joint replacements, and comorbidity was collected by the study coordinator during telephone screening. Other patient characteristics and OA-disease-related information, including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score/Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living subscale (KOOS/HOOS ADL subscale), were self-reported at baseline. The GPs and PTs self-reported demographics and practice information in a questionnaire.</p>

                <title>Primary outcome measure</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was patient-reported quality of OA care at T<sub>6</sub> measured with the OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire version 2 (OA-QI v2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002949.s004">S4 Text</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. OA-QI v1 was developed in 2010 based on published quality indicators (QIs) for OA care identified in a literature search and further refined via expert panels and patient interviews [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and was slightly revised in 2015 [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. OA-QI v2 reflects current OA care guideline recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and includes 16 QI items related to patient OA education and information, regular provider assessments, referrals, and pharmacological treatment. An example of an item with response alternatives is as follows: ‘Have you been given information about osteoarthritis from a health professional? Yes/No/Don’t remember’.</p>
                <p>All items have ‘Yes’, ‘No’, and ‘Not applicable’/‘Don’t remember’ as response options. Each QI item was considered passed if the patient had checked ‘Yes’ and was considered ‘eligible’ if the patient responded ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for that item. On the patient level, the QI pass rate was calculated as the total number of items passed divided by the number of eligible items for each patient (in percentage), ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best quality of care score. On the group level, the mean total pass rate was calculated.</p>
                <p>Previous applications of the questionnaire have showed acceptable measurement properties including reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The test–retest reliability for the total pass rate was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.89) [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All predefined hypotheses to assess construct validity were confirmed, and responsiveness was acceptable, with 3 of 4 predefined hypotheses confirmed [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Minimal important change for the total pass rate was assessed to be 20.4 on the 0 to 100 scale [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. OA-QI v1 has been previously tested in UK primary care in a cluster-randomised trial and has been shown to be responsive to the use of national recommendations for OA care [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

                <p>Physical activity was reported using 3 items on frequency (never/less than once per week/once per week/2 to 3 times per week/4 or more times per week), duration (less than 15 minutes/15–30 minutes/31–60 minutes/more than 60 minutes), and intensity (no sweat/sweat [moderate]/exhausted [vigorous]) [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Using an index from a previous study [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we calculated the proportion of patients ‘fulfilling’ versus ‘below’ recommendations. Corresponding to the physical activity recommendations at the time of that study, ‘fulfilling’ was 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 60 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week, or a combination of these.</p>
                <p>The proportion of patients who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was defined using patients’ self-reported body height at baseline and body weight at follow-ups.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis by comparing OA-QI v2 mean total pass rate in the control versus the intervention group. Multilevel mixed models with random intercepts were fitted to adjust for the effect of clustering (municipality), participant (patient), and repeated measures over time. This model accounts for dropout under a missing at random assumption. The primary outcome was assessed with a linear model, whereas the secondary outcomes were assessed with logistic models except for patient satisfaction with OA care, which was assessed applying multilevel ordered logistic regression models. All regression models included an interaction term of follow-up time point and group, and were adjusted for age, sex, and secular time (number of months between study initiation and the patient entering the study). Statistical analyses were performed with STATA/IC 14.</p>

              <p>The evidence-to-practice gap for OA care and the diverging results in previous studies aiming to improve OA care highlight the need for care models that increase adherence by practitioners to recommendations for OA care. This cluster-RCT assessing a structured model in primary healthcare is, to our knowledge, among the first to show an increased uptake of core OA treatment recommendations among GPs and PTs. Patients in the intervention group reported significantly higher quality of care than patients in the control group, and had better outcomes for 4 of the 6 secondary outcomes related to satisfaction with care, referral pathways, and beneficial lifestyles.</p>
              <sec id="sec026">
                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p>The observed between-group difference in OA-QI v2 mean total pass rate at 6-month follow-up (T<sub>6</sub>) indicates that the use of the structured OA care model successfully improved the delivery of OA care among GPs and PTs in primary healthcare in this study. While the mean total pass rate at baseline in this study was comparable to that in previous studies [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the mean total pass rate at T<sub>6</sub> for the intervention group was higher than the pass rates in most previous studies. The increase in mean total pass rate in the intervention group was comparable to the increase observed in a Norwegian longitudinal patient cohort study including a patient OA education programme [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Despite the significant between-group difference, the increase in mean total pass rate in the current study did not meet the minimal important change for this outcome measure, but was very close.</p>
                <p>Among previous studies aiming to improve OA care, a UK cluster-RCT [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] implementing a model OA consultation in general practice and a Dutch randomised controlled trial [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with interactive clinical workshops for PTs resulted in improved guideline adherence. The UK cluster-RCT [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] resulted in increased referral rates to physiotherapy, as did the current study. However, in a Dutch cohort study implementing a stepped OA care strategy in general practice, the provided care became only modestly consistent with the strategy [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This conflicting result may be due to differences in design, settings, and models to improve OA care. The current study and the UK cluster-RCT [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] had a multidisciplinary approach, whereas the 2 Dutch studies focused on either PTs [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or GPs [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Targeting more than one health profession may add beneficial effects including improved multidisciplinary collaboration, integrated care, and consistent patient information.</p>
                <p>The mean total pass rate in the intervention group at T<sub>6</sub> indicates that there is a potential for even further improvements in provided care. Looking at individual quality of care items in OA-QI v2, the improvement was particularly evident for core treatment elements related to patient information, self-management, and exercise. This would be expected as these core elements were the main focus of the study intervention, and an improvement on all individual OA-QI v2 items would not be realistic in this study. The improvement for provision of core treatments is in line with the UK cluster-RCT, in which the intervention also resulted in higher uptake of core guideline recommendations [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By scrutinising the individual QI item pass rates, ideas for further improvements of the care model may be generated, e.g., regarding advice and support on weight reduction.</p>

                <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                <p>The study intervention had a positive effect on patient satisfaction with care, patient physical activity, and referral rates to PTs and orthopaedic surgeons. The complex intervention in this study means that there are many factors that could have contributed to the higher patient satisfaction with care, e.g., the structured approach to OA care or the updated knowledge among GPs and PTs on current OA care recommendations. Unfortunately, it is not possible to disentangle the effect of the different factors in this study. The increase in PT referrals and the decrease in referrals to orthopaedic surgeons demonstrate that the GPs in this study adhered to the structured OA care model and that the patient participants exploited the core treatments before considering referral for surgical consultation.</p>
                <p>However, the intervention showed negligible effects on MRI referrals and on the proportion of patients who were overweight or obese. Regarding MRI, fewer referrals at T<sub>6</sub> as compared to baseline were observed in the intervention group, but there was also a decrease in the control group. The reason for the decrease in the control group is unknown, but may be related to the relatively high referral rate at baseline for both groups, which reduced the number of candidates for MRI referrals at follow-up time points. Although the structured care model included an optional healthy eating program, an intensive diet may have been required to observe an effect on the patients’ BMI and the proportion of patients who were overweight or obese over the time period studied here [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The study has several strengths including the robust but pragmatic study design, the multidisciplinary approach, and the large patient sample. The stepped-wedge design was chosen since it allowed all clusters to test the intervention, and the GP and PT training could be done in one cluster at the time over a longer period. However, the complexity of the stepped-wedge design makes reporting of study methods and results more challenging as compared to more traditional designs.</p>
                <p>The current study also has some limitations. One is the unbalanced group size caused by a higher patient recruitment rate during the intervention phase. This could be related to the stepped-wedge design and the GPs’ and PTs’ workshop participation, which likely increased the attention towards OA patients and access to PT-led OA education and exercise groups. We do not think this has influenced the generalisability of the sample, but because the patient participants were identified by their GPs and PTs, recruitment bias may potentially exist. Furthermore, self-reported QI pass rates, referrals, and body weight may be somewhat inaccurate due to recall bias and misconception, but the inaccuracy is likely to be similar across the groups. However, patients in the intervention group may have overestimated their physical activity levels more than those in the control group, potentially leading to bias.</p>
                <p>Clinically effective and cost-effective treatments applied to large numbers of people with OA could result in substantial population health gains and reduced costs. We have demonstrated the uptake of recommended treatments in the SAMBA model in routine clinical practice. Clear estimates of the potential for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SAMBA model of care from the patients’ and societal perspectives are still needed.</p>

                <title>Implications for clinicians, policy makers, and future research</title>
                <p>People with hip and knee OA represent a large, common patient group for GPs and PTs, and the provision of local, interdisciplinary workshops may facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and ensure delivery of consistent patient information. When GPs and PTs are guided in the steps of structured, evidence-based care models, people with hip or knee OA may receive care that is more in line with current recommendations for OA care. Previous research has shown that people with knee OA have an almost 2-fold increased risk of sick leave and a 40%–50% increased risk of disability pension [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and that the costs of hip and knee OA are substantial [<xref rid="pmed.1002949.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hence, policy makers could consider facilitation of early secondary prevention strategies aiming to reduce the burden of the disease, which may potentially reduce the direct and indirect costs for the individual and the society. In addition, facilitation of treatment in groups (e.g., patient education and exercise sessions) represents an opportunity to provide access to care for more patients and to lower the costs compared to treating individual patients. A further improvement of the structured model may be included in future research, as well as exploring ways to implement the structured model for integrated OA care on a larger scale. The recent focus worldwide on healthcare overuse behaviours could be utilised to strengthen the work on preventing overuse of unnecessary treatments in OA care (e.g., opioids and imaging).</p>
