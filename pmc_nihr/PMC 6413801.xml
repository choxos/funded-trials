                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>This study aimed to compare the change in health-related quality
of life of patients receiving a traditional cemented monoblock Thompson
hemiarthroplasty compared with a modern cemented modular polished-taper
stemmed hemiarthroplasty for displaced intracapsular hip fractures.</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a pragmatic, multicentre, multisurgeon, two-arm, parallel
group, randomized standard-of-care controlled trial. It was embedded
within the WHiTE Comprehensive Cohort Study. The sample size was
964 patients. The setting was five National Health Service Trauma
Hospitals in England. A total of 964 patients over 60 years of age who
required hemiarthroplasty of the hip between February 2015 and March
2016 were included. A standardized measure of health outcome, the
EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, was carried out on admission and
at four months following the operation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of the 964 patients enrolled, 482 died or were lost to follow-up
(50%). No significant differences were noted in EQ-5D between groups,
with a mean difference at four months of 0.037 in favour of the
Exeter/Unitrax implant (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.014 to 0.087,
p = 0.156), rising to 0.045 (95% CI 0.007 to 0.098, p = 0.09) when
patients who died were excluded. The minimum clinically important
difference for EQ-5D-5L used in this study is 0.08, therefore any
benefit between implants is unlikely to be noticeable to the patient.
There was no difference in mortality or mobility score.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Allowing for the high rate of loss to follow-up, the use of the
traditional Thompson hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of the displaced
intracapsular hip fracture shows no difference in health outcome
when compared with a modern cemented hemiarthroplasty.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Worldwide, 1.3 million patients sustain a fracture of the hip each
year, leading to1.75 million disability-adjusted life years lost,
and accounting for 1.4% of the total healthcare burden in established
market economies.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In
the United Kingdom, there are 70 000 such fractures each year which
is forecast to increase to 100 000 by 2020.<sup><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Around
half of these are intracapsular fractures which are usually treated
using a hemiarthroplasty;<sup><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> around 19 000 hemiarthroplasties
are performed each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<sup><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The Thompson prosthesis is a generic monoblock hemiarthroplasty
designed 65 years ago and is intended for cemented implantation
(Fig. 1).<sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> As
it is a monoblock, there is limited scope for adjustment of length
and offset. At five years, the cemented Thompson stem has a published
survival of 95%; the list price, as published and available from
trust finance departments, is £327, including United Kingdom Value
Added Tax (VAT).</p>

            <p>The Exeter hip arthroplasty system (Stryker Ltd., Newbury, United
Kingdom) is widely used as a total hip arthroplasty (THA) system
in arthritis of the hip.<sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Used
with the large Unitrax femoral head (Stryker), the Exeter stem may
now be used as a hemiarthroplasty; as a modular system, this has
the advantage of allowing changes in length and offset following
cementation (Fig. 2). While the Exeter stem has excellent long-term
survival in THA, no data exists regarding its use as a hemiarthroplasty with
the Unitrax head. The list price of this implant combination, as
published and available from trust finance departments, is around
£1442, including VAT.</p>

            <p>The Orthopaedic Device Evaluation Panel (ODEP) produces ratings
for THA prostheses used in the United Kingdom, based on length of follow-up
and quality of evidence.<sup><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In
the United Kingdom, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
has recommended the use of ‘proven’ cemented stem designs with an
ODEP rating of at least 3B (97% survival at three years) when used
as a THA, explicitly advising against the use of the Thompson prosthesis.<sup><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the absence of
randomised trials, this guidance was based on data from studies
of THA and from expert opinion. In fact, no hemiarthroplasty has
an ODEP rating, including the Thompson and the Exeter/Unitrax hemiarthroplasty.</p>
            <p>The aim of this trial is to compare the change in health-related quality
of life of patients receiving a cemented monoblock Thompson <italic>versus</italic> a
cemented modular polished taper stem (Exeter/Unitrax) for displaced
intracapsular fractures requiring hemiarthroplasty.</p>

quality of life at
four months post injury between patients over 60 years of age with
an AO/OTA type B3 fracture (displaced, intracapsular) of the hip

                <p>The primary objective was to compare observed differences in
patients’ health-related quality of life between the trial treatment
groups at four months post-injury. The secondary objectives were
to compare mortality, mobility score, reoperation and cause, length
of acute ward stay and revision at four months. We also measured
radiological leg length discrepancy as per Bidwai and Willett.<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

with the United Kingdom Core Outcome Set for Hip Fracture Research.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This includes
the EQ-5D-5L at baseline (retrospective, prior to fracture) and
four months post-fracture.<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Four
months represents a routine follow-up point for the National Hip

EQ-5D-5L provides a score of 0 in the event of mortality, ensuring
patients that die during the follow-up period can be included in
the final assessment. EQ-5D correlates strongly with a hip-specific
patient-reported outcome measurement, the Oxford Hip Score, and
is as responsive to changes over time in patients having hemiarthroplasty.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Radiographs and notes (operation note and discharge summary)
were studied in order to capture perioperative complications, length
of hospital stay, and discharge address. Radiological neck lengths
were calculated using standard hospital-based radiology software
and scored by two independent orthopaedic surgeons (see Supplementary material
for a full list of the CORNET
Collaborators). These measurements were repeated and a mean value
identified for each patient. Standardization was achieved using a
known value to provide a sizing ratio for radiological measurements

                <p>The primary outcome measure was health related quality of life
according to the EuroQol five domain questionnaire (EQ-5D). Groups
were compared on an intention-to-treat basis at four months from
the index fracture. In order to avoid overestimating the effects
of the intervention or treatment pathway, we used death-adjusted
estimates.<sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The
differences between treatment groups were assessed using an independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test
with p-values less than 0.05 considered significant.</p>
                <p>As a sensitivity analysis, regression analyses were performed to
adjust for any imbalance between treatment groups in patient baseline
(pre-injury) EQ-5D, age and gender. The fixed effects linear regression
model was generalized by adding a random effect for recruiting centre
to allow for possible heterogeneity in patient outcomes due more
generally to the recruiting centre. The mixed-effects regression
was the definitive analysis and was undertaken using the specialist
mixed-effects modelling functions available in the software package
R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). EQ-5D data were assumed to be approximately normally distributed.<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Secondary analyses (mortality, walking ability, length of stay,
complications and radiological neck length) were undertaken using
the above strategy for approximately normally distributed outcome
measures. For dichotomous outcome variables, mixed effects logistic
regression analysis was undertaken with results presented as odds
ratios (OR) (and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) between the trial groups.</p>

                <p>The target of 964 patients was recruited between Feb 2015 and
March 2016 (Fig. 4), and was faster than estimated thanks to the
efforts of the CORNET trainee research collaborative. Of 964 patients
recruited, 704 (73%) were women, and the mean age was 83.7 (7.3)
for the Thompsons group and 83.9 (7.9) for the Exeter/ Unitrax group.
The mean length of surgery was 80 minutes (42 to 205) for the Exeter/Unitrax
and 70 minutes (27 to 197) for the Thompson. A total of 47 patients
crossed over to the other treatment group, 15 of whom crossed over
to an Exeter/Unitrax and 32 to a Thompson; this generally happened
when the alternative implant system was unavailable at the time
of surgery (Table I).</p>

              <p>Of the 964 patients recruited, 482 had a valid EQ-5D at four months
(50%) (Table I). Of these, 283 self-responded (60%) and 186 were
reported by a proxy (40%) (Fig. 5). At four months, including patients
who had died, the adjusted mean EQ-5D-5L was 0.321 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.348,
n = 303)<italic/>in the Thompsons group and 0.379 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.358,
n = 315)<italic/>in the Exeter group, giving a mean difference
of 0.037 (95% CI -0.014 to 0.087, p = 0.156) in favour of the Exeter/Unitrax.
Excluding patients who had died, this difference was 0.045 (95%
CI -0.007 to 0.098, p = 0.09) (Table II). Dimensions of health at
four months are shown in Table III.</p>

              <p>This trial found no evidence of a difference in health-related quality
of life for patients with displaced intracapsular hip fracture treated
with a traditional Thompson hemiarthroplasty compared with a modern cemented modular hemiarthroplasty.
The difference between the two was not statistically significant
and did not reach the accepted minimum clinically important difference
of 0.08. In terms of secondary outcomes, walking status, mortality
and radiological neck length measurements were similar in the two groups.
There was a small difference in length of stay favouring the Exeter/Unitrax
implant.</p>
              <p>This large multicentre randomized controlled trial benefitted
from a pragmatic design using the United Kingdom Core Outcome Set
for hip fracture research including a patient-reported primary outcome
measure (EuroQol (EQ)-5D) that is known to be suitable for proxy
use. The benefits of this are that the trial could include the cohort
of hip fracture patients with cognitive impairment and is generalizable
to this population. Patients were blinded to their treatment allocation.</p>
              <p>Recruitment was more rapid than predicted due in part to the involvement
of the CORNET trainee collaborative. This group of orthopaedic trainees
could ensure that suitable patients were appropriately randomized
outside normal office hours, increasing the efficiency of the trial.
Use of trainee collaboratives has numerous benefits to clinical
research and should be considered carefully during initial trial
design.<sup><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A limitation of this trial was the large number of withdrawals. As
50% of those enrolled in the trial withdrew, the trial did not quite
reach the 90% planned statistical power, which would have required
data from 337 patients in each group, but easily passed the sample
size required for 80% power (252 in each group). The number of patients
who withdrew was higher than anticipated but not wholly unexpected
in a trial involving a particularly frail older population. The
results of this trial should not be extrapolated to the patients
who were excluded because they were having a total hip arthroplasty.
THA is generally offered to patients who have higher pre-injury
walking status. Recent research suggests that more patients would
benefit from total hip replacement than currently receive it.<sup><xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The follow-up period for this trial was four months. The long-term
survival of these implants is not examined. Previously, survival
analysis performed on the Thompson stem has demonstrated stem survival of over 95% at five years, and a
mortality of 70% at six years, with no revision surgery beyond this point.<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> No comparable
data exist on the Exeter/Unitrax prosthesis. More recent evidence
from a 12-year follow-up of patients treated with either total hip
arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty has demonstrated a mortality rate
of 20% overall with no difference between functional outcomes, mortality
or complications.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This trial provides some evidence that the Thompson hemiarthroplasty
can offer a comparable outcome with a modern modular stem in this
patient group. The Thompson is considerably lower in cost than the
more modern hemiarthroplasty implants recommended by NICE.</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Take home message:</bold>
              </p>
              <p>- A cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty may provide similar health-related
quality of life compared with modern implants for patients with
a displaced intracapsular fracture of the hip.</p>
