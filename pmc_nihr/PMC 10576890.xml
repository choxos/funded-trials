                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Older patients often experience safety issues when transitioning from hospital to home. The ‘Your Care Needs You’ (YCNY) intervention aims to support older people to ‘know more’ and ‘do more’ whilst in hospital so that they are better prepared for managing at home.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the YCNY intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Forty acute hospital wards (clusters) in England from varying medical specialities will be randomised to deliver YCNY or care-as-usual on a 1:1 basis. The primary outcome will be unplanned hospital readmission rates within 30 days of discharge. This will be extracted from routinely collected data of at least 5440 patients (aged 75 years and older) discharged to their own homes during the 4- to 5-month YCNY intervention period. A nested cohort of up to 1000 patients will be recruited to the study to collect secondary outcomes via follow-up questionnaires at 5-, 30- and 90-day post-discharge. These will include measures of patient experience of transitions, patient-reported safety events, quality of life and healthcare resource use. Unplanned hospital readmission rates at 60 and 90 days of discharge will be collected from routine data.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">A process evaluation (primarily interviews and observations with patients, carers and staff) will be conducted to understand the implementation of the intervention and the contextual factors that shape this, as well as the intervention’s underlying mechanisms of action. Fidelity of intervention delivery will also be assessed across all intervention wards.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">This study will establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the YCNY intervention which aims to improve patient safety and experience for older people during transitions of care. The process evaluation will generate insights about how the YCNY intervention was implemented, what elements of the intervention work and for whom, and how to optimise its implementation so that it can be delivered with high fidelity in routine service contexts.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par26">For older people and those with complex needs, the transitional period of moving from hospital to home poses various risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As many as one in five patients experience an adverse event during this time; an estimated 62% of these could be prevented or ameliorated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Over the last decade, emergency readmission rates have been increasing with around 30% of all readmissions estimated to be avoidable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Older people have the highest rates of readmissions suggesting that this group have the greatest need for support to improve transitions of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">A meta-analysis of 92 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions to improve transitional care for older people observed a significant reduction in hospital readmissions at multiple time points up to 12 months post discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The interventions tended to be highly complex, adopting multiple and variable components, and commencing and ending at different time-points. Consequently, delineating which components are the active ingredients is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is some suggestion however that interventions which seek to enhance patient capacity to ‘reliably access and enact’ post-discharge care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] or which emphasise patient education and promote self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] are most likely to be effective.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Qualitative evidence increasingly shows that patients and their carers have a central role in supporting safe care throughout the care pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Patient involvement in care <italic>during</italic> the hospital stay (through retaining knowledge and capability to undertake usual care activities) may be a key mechanism for enhancing patients’ capacity to ‘reach-in’ to the health care system enabling them to optimise their care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, patient involvement in hospital care is not intuitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and is unlikely to be enacted without intervention or support. The mechanism for doing this has not been fully explored.</p>
              <p id="Par29">To address this knowledge gap, the Partners At Care Transitions (PACT) programme of research evaluates how and whether greater involvement of older patients and their families during a hospital stay can improve patient experience and safety at transitions of care. The Your Care Needs You (YCNY) intervention aims to support older people to <italic>know more</italic> and <italic>do more</italic> whilst they are in hospital. By preparing people during their hospital admission, they will be better supported to manage their health when they get home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">The intervention comprises both fixed and flexible components that can be tailored to the context of each participating ward — a so-called hybrid intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This aligns with recent research which suggests that interventions should be standardised by the function of a component, rather than standardising interventions according to the specific form that they take [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our early work and feasibility cRCT identified that patients were positive about the intervention; however, without encouragement from staff, patients were unlikely to do more than read the information provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Based on these findings, we refined the intervention and implementation strategy and we now seek to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the YCNY intervention.</p>

                <p id="Par39">A cluster RCT of the YCNY intervention versus care-as-usual in older people during the transition from hospital to home. Forty wards that routinely provide care for people aged 75 years and older, from up to 11 National Health Service (NHS) hospital Trusts in England will be randomly allocated to one of two arms: YCNY or care-as-usual (control). A process evaluation will also be conducted on a maximum of eight intervention wards to understand how the intervention is delivered, received, and used by staff and patients and how this is shaped by contextual factors.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The SPIRIT checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], is available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par41">The cRCT will be conducted across NHS-funded, inpatient hospital wards that provide care for mostly older people and agree to participate in the trial. This may include older peoples’ medicine, intermediate care, respiratory medicine, orthopaedics, cardiology, surgical and stroke wards. Acute medical admission wards, and wards without regular medical input will be excluded.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Eligible patients will be 75 years and older, discharged to their own or a relative’s home, have stayed on a participating ward for at least one night, and be willing and able to provide informed consent. Where possible, informal carers will be recruited if patients lack capacity. Patients will be excluded if: they require an interpreter; are expected to be discharged to a nursing/care home or intermediate care/rehabilitation bed; are at end of life; live out of area; or have been admitted for psychiatric reasons (other than delirium or dementia).</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par43">Wards will be randomly allocated in an equal allocation ratio (1:1) with 20 randomised to the Intervention and 20 to care-as-usual. Random allocation will be undertaken independently by the York Trials Unit (YTU) with minimisation using minimPy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and stratified by ward type (speciality), the percentage of patients over 75 years (split by ≤66% and &gt;66%, based on the feasibility cRCT) and NHS trust.</p>

              <sec id="Sec8">
                <title>Patient population and sample size</title>
                <p id="Par44">Based on findings of similar interventions targeting readmission in a systematic review by Leppin and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and an underlying risk of readmissions of 18% for older patients (based on local hospital statistics), we anticipate an absolute difference in readmission at 30 days between control and intervention wards of between 4% and 6%. We therefore plan for a 4.5% reduction in readmissions at 30 days. Assuming 80% power, alpha = 0.05, intraclass correlation coefficient ) = 0.01, average cluster size = 140 (30–40 older people discharged per month from 40 wards for 5 months) and 10% attrition rate, 5440 participants are needed.</p>
                <p id="Par45">It would not be efficient to design the study to recruit and consent 5440 patients. Instead, we will use routinely collected data to explore readmission rates and include individual data collection of a nested cohort of participants within this larger sample. We will power the nested individual data collection cohort for our secondary outcome of quality of transitions. This will be measured by the Partners At Care Transitions Measure (PACT-M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] which produces an overall score between 0 and 67. Assuming a mean difference of 2.7 points, which equates to a reduction of around half an adverse event and a standard deviation of 9 (based on data from the feasibility cRCT), 170 patients per group are required (80% power, alpha = 0.05). Allowing for clustering this would increase to (assuming equal clusters of 25 patients and an ICC of 0.05) 374 patients per group. Allowing for 25% attrition (based on projected results from our feasibility study) we will recruit 500 patients per group (1000 total) which would require 40 clusters. We assume an ICC of 0.05 in the absence of published data indicating the most appropriate ICC for this setting and particular outcome.</p>

                  <title>Aims and underpinning programme theory</title>
                  <p id="Par47">YCNY aims to improve the safety and experience of older patients as they transition from hospital back to their own homes. Our earlier work to model transitional care identified four key activities that patients hand over responsibility for, at the point of hospital admission, and then assume (to varying degrees) once they are discharged home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These are managing their health and wellbeing, medications, daily activities, and escalating care needs.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">The underpinning programme theory of YCNY posits that supporting patients to <italic>know</italic> and <italic>do</italic> more whilst they are in hospital, will help patients be better prepared for managing at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par53">In addition, ward staff will consider how they currently support patient involvement with respect to the four key activities, and what else they can do to enhance this. The actions that the teams decide to undertake (the flexible staff-facing intervention components) will not be prescribed — they will be left to vary according to staff preferences, current activities/initiatives on the ward that already address the four key activities, and their patient population.</p>

                  <p id="Par54">The intervention will be supplemented with, and supported by, an ‘implementation package’ informed by the barriers and facilitators to engagement that we have previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the ‘Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivation’ Behaviour change (COM-B) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Initial engagement and set-up of the intervention will be facilitated by researchers although trusts will vary in the extent to which they want to lead on/have support for these set-up activities. The process will involve four key stages outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>YCNY set-up and implementation steps</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7716_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

Specifically, ward facilitators will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par56">Motivate staff to engage with the intervention by promoting it as a way to consistently support good patient involvement and communication between staff, patients and carers. Suggestions such as helping patients to write down questions and reminding them (how and when) to use the booklet, responding to resultant queries and showing it to family members will be offered. The breadth of opportunities to use the booklet lends itself to a multidisciplinary team approach so motivating all staff to engage with the intervention in various ways will be key.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par57">Ensure that staff feel confident to introduce and engage with the booklet and film.

This is to ensure that YCNY becomes usual care on the intervention wards. In the trial, however, only those meeting our eligibility criteria (i.e. adults aged 75 years and over and returning to their own or a relative’s home) will be recruited to follow-up. Recruitment will start on completion of the intervention embedding period. Patients who consent to the trial are likely to have been exposed to the intervention, although this will not be a condition of participation.</p>

It is important that this particular patient population is included in this study to promote inclusivity in research and enhance generalisability. Capacity will be assessed during the screening process and initial approach.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par127">Transitions from hospital to home can be risky, particularly for older people who often have complex health and social care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although limited, there is some evidence that interventions that support patient involvement offer a promising way to improve transitional care outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The PACT programme of research therefore evaluates whether supported involvement of older patients and their families in hospital improves patient experience and safety at transitions of care. Through our earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] we have designed an intervention that supports patients to ‘know more’ and ‘do more’ during their hospital stay so that they can manage their care at home post-discharge. The present study assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention through a cRCT. As with any complex intervention various challenges are anticipated throughout the study. The particular challenges of delivering this trial at this time (whilst health services are under sustained pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic) are outlined below.</p>
              <sec id="Sec37">
                <title>Recruitment and follow-up</title>
                <p id="Par128">The trial feasibility study was conducted in 2019/2020, just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the targets for the trial were refined based on the findings from the trial feasibility study. For example, our estimates for attrition at follow-up, originally estimated at 10%, were adjusted to 25% based on the trial feasibility findings. As a consequence, our recruitment target increased from 20 to 25 patient participants per ward. We do not know what the impact of the pandemic will be on patients’ desire or ability to participate in research, particularly in this older population. Furthermore, we anticipate that increasing pressure on community services is likely to impact on recruitment and follow-up rates as patients who are medically fit for discharge to home are kept in hospital (acute or intermediate care) until care packages are available. Thus, our recruitment target might be extremely challenging to meet and might still underestimate attrition. We do not, however, anticipate any particular challenges to obtaining the routine data on readmissions.</p>

              <sec id="Sec38">
                <title>Contamination</title>
                <p id="Par129">In our trial feasibility study, we found that only one patient moved between an intervention and control ward. This suggested that our approach to minimise contamination, through recruiting wards that were not on the same care pathway, was successful. However, we know that since the start of the pandemic ward/bay closures are more frequent and there is a chance of more patient movement, and therefore greater contamination, between intervention and control wards than was experienced during the feasibility study.</p>

                <title>Implementation of the intervention</title>
                <p id="Par130">We anticipate that many of the contextual challenges that impacted the delivery of the intervention during the feasibility study will exist during the cRCT. The pandemic has undoubtedly placed additional stresses on our health services that are likely to impact on the capacity of staff to deliver the intervention. We know that a sizeable percentage of nurses have experienced burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder, and compassion fatigue (to patients and to each other) leading to staff absences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our intervention will necessarily create some additional work for staff, however, we hope that by asking them to reflect with empathy and compassion on patient involvement they will engage with YCNY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
