                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">In contrast to evidence for interventions supporting victim/survivors of domestic violence and abuse (DVA), the effectiveness of perpetrator programmes for reduction of abuse is uncertain. This study aims to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a perpetrator programme for men.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Pragmatic two-group individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) with embedded process and economic evaluation. Five centres in southwest England and South Wales aim to recruit 316 (reduced from original target of 366) male domestic abuse perpetrators. These will be randomised 2:1 to a community-based domestic abuse perpetrator programme (DAPP) or usual care comparator with 12-month follow-up. Female partners/ex-partners will be invited to join the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The intervention for men comprises 23 weekly sessions of a group programme delivered in voluntary sector domestic abuse services. The intervention for female partners/ex-partners is one-to-one support from a safety worker. Men allocated to usual care receive no intervention; however, they are free to access other services. Their partners/ex-partners will be signposted to support services.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Data is collected at baseline, and 4, 8 and 12 months’ follow-up. The primary outcome is men’s self-reported abusive behaviour measured by the Abusive Behaviour Inventory (ABI-29) at 12 months. Secondary measures include physical and mental health status and resource use alongside the abuse measure ABI (ABI-R) for partners/ex-partners and criminal justice contact for men.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">A mixed methods process evaluation and qualitative study will explore mechanisms of effectiveness, judge fidelity to the intervention model using interviews and group observations.</p>
                  <p id="Par6">The economic evaluation, over a 1-year time horizon from three perspectives (health and social care, public sector and society), will employ a cost-consequences framework reporting costs alongside economic outcomes (Quality-Adjusted Life Years derived from EQ-5D-5L, SF-12 and CHU-9D, and ICECAP-A) as well as the primary and other secondary outcomes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par7">This trial will provide evidence of the (cost)effectiveness of a DAPP. The embedded process evaluation will further insights in the experiences and contexts of participants and their journey through a perpetrator programme, and the study will seek to address the omission in other studies of economic evaluations.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par16">Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is a violation of human rights that harms the physical and mental health of victim/survivors and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The mental health problems associated with DVA include depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and alcohol and substance misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Children affected by DVA are at risk of poor school achievement, externalising and internalising behaviour, and have poor adult mental health and increased risk of perpetrating or experiencing DVA as adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both women and men suffer DVA (annual prevalence in England and Wales 6.9% women and 3.0% men aged 16 and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), although its prevalence, frequency and severity are greater in women, as is sexual violence and coercive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The annual cost to the economy for DVA is high, estimated in England and Wales as over £66 billion in 2018. As a result of the physical and emotional harms experienced by victim/survivors, DVA costs include lost output due to time off work, costs to the health service, housing costs, criminal justice system costs and victim/survivor support services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par17">Given the harmful effects of DVA, evidence is needed for effective preventive interventions, including reduction of perpetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] recommendation for the commissioning and evaluation of ‘tailored interventions for people who perpetrate DVA’. While provision of such services remains patchy in the UK and is absent in many countries, there has been an increase in programmes focusing on both individual and group work with perpetrators in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of perpetrator interventions is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Vigurs et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] note that evidence regarding the effectiveness of DVA perpetrator interventions is ‘equivocal’ although Gondolf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported evidence of reduced physical violence in those attending four well-established perpetrator interventions across the USA. The uncertainty about programme effectiveness arises from variations in research methodologies, programme design, lack of clarity about attrition from groups, outcomes and the difficulty in identifying specific elements of programme content that might contribute to behaviour change due to insufficient focus on these elements by programme evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Following their review of European evaluations, Lilley-Walker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] recommend that a more robust study of perpetrator interventions would require a range of elements including a control group design, a larger sample than that found in most evaluations, a comprehensive range of outcome measures, inclusion of data from partner victim/survivors and qualitative, as well as quantitative, methodologies. Where there is reporting of effectiveness in evaluations, the effect sizes are small and of questionable value. Consequently, although Project Mirabal did reveal encouraging ‘steps towards change’ for men attending domestic abuse perpetrator programmes (DAPPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], many UK local authority commissioners have been slow to fund DAPPs because the evidence base is unconvincing.</p>
                <p id="Par18">To address the uncertainty about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of DAPPs and to address the lack of methodological clarity and other problems found in existing studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the REPROVIDE study has been designed as a pragmatic, individually randomised controlled trial with an embedded process evaluation. Given the anticipated challenges of recruitment and retention of perpetrators and their partners or ex-partners—hereafter referred to as (ex)partners—to a perpetrator programme randomised trial, we conducted a pilot study before progressing to the full trial. This ascertained that it is possible to recruit, randomise and retain both male perpetrators and their female partners/ex-partners, to collect the outcome data, and that the trial design is broadly acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par19">Since the 1980s, group approaches ranging from voluntary support groups to structured interventions in prisons has been the most common form of DAPPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Group interventions are more common because of the opportunities for peer learning, with participants more ready to change able to help others not yet at that stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most programmes combine structured, feminist psycho-educational approaches (also referred to as the Duluth model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) combined with cognitive behavioural therapy and empathy building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Positive changes reported for perpetrator programmes include better communication, parenting and interpersonal relationships, more responsibility for behaviour and control of behaviour, more empathy and self-awareness, less aggression and improved skills development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par20">Given the empirical and theoretical controversy over perpetrator intervention models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and in line with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], we developed our perpetrator intervention based on existing evidence and in consultation with a range of practitioner, researcher and policy stakeholders, including key collaborators Respect, a UK membership body and leaders in perpetrator work (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.respect.uk.net/">https://www.respect.uk.net/</ext-link>). We also involved patient and public involvement (PPI) groups—specifically, women who had experienced domestic abuse and men who had completed a programme for domestic abuse.</p>

                <p id="Par24">Participants of the trial are male perpetrators of abuse aged 21 and over, who can speak English well enough to participate in a group intervention, and who recognise a need to change some abusive behaviours, and their female (ex)partners aged 18 and over (see Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although male recruitment into the study is not conditional upon female (ex)partner’s agreement to participate, the research team must be provided with her contact details. This is to ensure that she is signposted to appropriate support or, if the male recruit has been randomised to the intervention arm, for the intervention service to be able to provide integrated support and to manage risk in accordance with Respect standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The requirement for contact details means that the research team can also ensure she is offered the opportunity to participate in the study, allowing measurement of (ex)partner outcomes and articulating their experience through interviews.

                  <p id="Par28">We undertook an evidence synthesis of existing domestic abuse perpetrator programmes to identify their key ingredients and limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We used this to inform a modified two-stage Delphi consensus meeting with an invited range of DVA experts: representatives from Respect, practitioners from domestic violence services, the criminal justice system, general practice and academic researchers, the findings of which informed the group programme and manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A pilot trial confirmed it was feasible to recruit, randomise and retain male perpetrator and female victim/survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Following the pilot, the main trial includes formal integration of the relapse prevention group (RPG) (discussed in more detail below), and additional emphasis on exercises to help with trauma. A theory of change was developed to summarise and capture key aspects of the intervention (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Theory of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7612_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                  <title>Domestic abuse perpetrator programme</title>
                  <p id="Par29">The DAPP intervention is a 23-week group programme with an initial full risk assessment and at least three additional one-to-one sessions. The two-and-a-half-hour weekly sessions are delivered by two DAPP facilitators (ideally, male/female dyads to model good gender role behaviours) from the local provider organisation. The programme runs as a rolling programme allowing new intakes of participants to join every 4 or 5 weeks. Intake weeks depend on the session focus, with certain sessions (such as <italic>Sexual Respect</italic>) being considered too difficult to be an introductory session for a new group member. The sessions are structured to follow the REPROVIDE DAPP manual whose elements include goal identification and goal setting, recognising abuse, denial and minimisation, intents of violence, basic anger management, identifying urges to perpetrate abuse and cooling down strategies, basic cognitive behavioural therapy, effects of DVA on partners and children, participant’s own childhood experiences, impacts on children, active listening, conflict resolution, masculinity, beliefs and expectations, sexual respect, attachment styles, building empathy, loving relationships, emotional abuse and accountability.</p>
                  <p id="Par30">Individual sessions led by the DAPP coordinator are tailored to participants’ needs following initial and ongoing assessment with referrals and signposting to other services as needed, such as specialist support for substance abuse. Possible individual interventions may include deconstructing specific incidents of abuse or planning discussions with partners or children. To support quality assurance for the programmes, all our delivery partner organisations were already Respect-accredited or in the processes of accreditation.</p>

The WSW assesses risk and provides support and advocacy. The support is offered either face-to-face by telephone or online (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>: RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC). Contact is tailored to need. To manage risk for the (ex)partner and any children, the DAPP facilitators and the WSW regularly share information on an ongoing basis. In some cases, a male participant may have two (ex)partners receiving support. In these cases, where possible, a second WSW would support the second partner.</p>

We will, for example, seek to gain feedback on experiences of the intervention (male and female intervention participants) and a better understanding of any changes in abusive behaviours during the study period (all male and female participants). Using topic guides, likely questions for male and female control participants will include whether they felt they were being monitored in any way while being part of the trial. We will interview some professional referrers and staff in different provider roles (DAPP coordinator, group facilitator, managers) regarding their experiences of referring to or delivering the group intervention and of supporting (ex)partners. Data will be collected on the context of the intervention at each centre partly through interviews and a few observations of the group sessions at each centre. Contextual data will also be captured through ongoing gathering of external information such as information about alternative DAPP providers in each centre and dates the COVID-19 lockdown rules changed (different for England and Wales). These qualitative data will help articulate likely challenges in future implementation (if the intervention proves cost-effective) and help to interpret the quantitative results. Interviews will be recorded on an encrypted device and stored securely on university servers. They will be transcribed and anonymised, and coded thematically by members of the research team, with some interviews being coded by more than one researcher to ensure inter-rater reliability.</p>

If eligible and interested, a participant information sheet will be sent electronically or by post according to preference. If the potential participant is happy to proceed, a date and time will be agreed for a joint recruitment and assessment meeting with the potential participant, researcher and local DAPP coordinator. At the recruitment meeting, the researcher checks the potential participant’s ID, understanding of the study and re-checks eligibility, while the DAPP coordinator assesses suitability to potentially join a perpetrator group programme. If there are any concerns about lack of understanding, motivation or risk, the meeting may be paused, and another appointment made if more investigations are needed, or the potential participant requires more time to think. The process may be stopped altogether if it is felt inappropriate to recruit the potential participant or if he decides he no longer wishes to proceed. If the participant is happy to proceed, signed informed consent is taken by the researcher, and contact details of the participant’s (ex)partner[s] (up to two (ex)partners per male participant), general practice and any other agencies (mental health, substance misuse or social workers) will be requested.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par52">In all power calculations, we have assumed a 2:1 allocation ratio (intervention: control) and applied a two-sided significance level of 5%. Our initial assumption was that a total of 219 participants would be available for analysis which, after inflation to allow for 40% attrition gives a total recruitment target of 366 participants (244 intervention and 122 control).</p>
                <p id="Par53">The (primary) power calculation used the power command in Stata 15.1, which yielded 79% power for an effect size of 0.4 standard deviations (0.4SD). While there is no established minimal clinically important difference on the ABI-29 scale, baseline data from male perpetrators in a group support study in the US using the ABI-30 found a standard deviation of 11 giving a detectable effect size corresponding to 4.4 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Such a difference is considered plausible and of a magnitude worthwhile detecting if the intervention had such an effect.</p>
                <p id="Par54">The design of the intervention allows a rolling intake of participants in the various groups; therefore, there is potential for clustering in that arm (with no such effects in the control arm). The degree of this effect (essentially one of additional inefficiency/compromise on power) will depend on the degree of clustering, the number of intervention groups and the extent to which these groups overlap as men enter and leave them. All of these are difficult to predict; the latter in particular means that a clear definition of a cluster is very likely to be elusive. Hence, we have not allowed for this in the above power calculation but have explored the potential for such clustering effects using the clsampsi command in Stata 15.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, with a (conservative) intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, the above sample size would yield a power of 80% to detect a 0.435SD effect size. The originally planned sample size would therefore have about 80% power to estimate an effect size of between 0.4 to 0.435 SD, covering situations with zero/negligible clustering and for a conservative ICC.</p>

                <title>Reduction in sample size</title>
                <p id="Par55">Due to difficulties experienced in meeting the original target for recruitment, primarily from the first 18 months of recruitment being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an extended recruitment period, a reduction of 50 in this target was subsequently approved by the Programme Steering Committee (PSC), Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC), and the funding body. Using the SD of 10.7 derived from 201 baseline measurements in this trial and again assuming 40% attrition, the revised sample size of 316 to be recruited provides approximately 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.43SD under the primary assumption of no clustering. This slightly revised target difference, corresponding to 4.6 ABI-29 scale points (compared with the original of 4.4), was still deemed plausible and worth detecting to drive implementation of the programme after the trial.</p>

The intervention and study design are built on a broad evidence base, with input and consultation from experts, stakeholders and PPI members and with particular emphasis on the safety and health outcomes of the female victim/survivor partners and ex-partners.</p>
              <p id="Par102">The embedded process evaluation will provide further insights in the mechanisms and barriers, experiences and contexts of participants and their journey through a perpetrator programme. Economic evaluations have been absent in prior studies of perpetrator programmes. Therefore, this study seeks to address this omission and will benefit from the use of broader perspectives.</p>
