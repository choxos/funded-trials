                  <p>Sliding hip screw fixation is well established in the treatment of trochanteric
fractures of the hip. The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System builds on the
successful design features of the sliding hip screw but differs in the nature of
the fixation in the femoral head. A randomised pilot study suggested that the
X-bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System might provide similar health-related quality of
life while reducing the risk of revision surgery when compared with the sliding
hip screw. This is the protocol for a multicentre randomised trial of sliding hip
screw versus X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System for patients 60 years and over
treated for a trochanteric fracture of the hip.</p>

Patients aged 60 years and older with a trochanteric hip fracture are potentially
eligible. Participants will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to either sliding
hip screw or X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System. Otherwise, all care will be in
accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. A
minimum of 1128 patients will be recruited to obtain 90% power to detect a
0.075-point difference in EuroQol-5D health-related quality of life at 4 months
postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes include mortality, residential status,
revision surgery and radiographic measures. The treatment effect will be estimated
using a two-sided t-test adjusted for age, gender and cognitive impairment based
on an intention-to-treat analysis.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Due to an increasing incidence, hip fractures now place a very large burden on current
healthcare systems. Approximately 1.5% of the total healthcare budget in established
market economies is currently spent on the care of patients sustaining a hip
fracture.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Research focusing on optimising
current treatment pathways and assessing new treatment options in this clinical area is
crucial.</p>
              <p>Hip fractures can be subdivided into intracapsular and extracapsular fractures.
Approximately half of all hip fractures are extracapsular, and the great majority of
these are trochanteric fractures, that is, a fracture in the region between the greater
and lesser trochanter.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The rationale for fixation
of these fractures relies on controlled collapse at the fracture site allowing bone ends
to compress and union to occur before potential metalwork failure.</p>
              <p>Sliding hip screw (SHS) fixation is well established in the treatment of extracapsular
fractures, and in many fractures, SHS is effective at allowing controlled
collapse of the fracture with consequent mechanical stability leading to healing of the
fracture.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> However, in some hip fractures,
there is deficient bone to share load with the fixation device. Rather than controlled
collapse along the line of the screw, the screw may cut out from the head of the femur
leading to failure of the fixation and damage to the hip joint.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Revision surgery, to either refix or replace the proximal femur, is
complex, and the outcomes are poor in this frail group of patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>The X-Bolt Dynamic Hip Plating System (XHS) builds on the successful design features of
the SHS by having a plate attached to the lateral femur and a single telescoping screw
in the femoral head but differs in the nature of the fixation in the head. Expanding
flanges are deployed to engage and compress the surrounding cancellous bone improving
fixation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Trochanteric fractures rely on the
quality of fixation in the femoral head to prevent cut out, and the poor bone quality
encountered in the patients sustaining these fractures is often a contributor to
failure. Our pilot work has demonstrated that there may be a reduced risk of revision
using the XHS compared with the SHS.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>This is the protocol for a multicentre, multisurgeon, parallel, two-arm, randomised
controlled trial. This trial protocol is based on the trial protocol for the pilot
trial.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This trial will be embedded within the
World Hip Trauma Evaluation Comprehensive Cohort Study.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The study will include a two-way superiority comparison between XHS and
SHS.</p>

                <p>Patients with a hip fracture are a clinical priority for urgent operative care. They
will undergo surgery on the next available trauma operating list. All patients with a
fracture of the hip are in pain and have received opiate analgesia. It is therefore
understandable that the majority of patients find the initial period of their
treatment in hospital confusing and disorienting. Similarly, patients’ next of
kin, carers and friends are often anxious at this time and may have difficulty in
weighing the large amounts of information that they are given about the injury and
plan for treatment. In this emergency situation, the focus is on obtaining consent
for surgery (where possible) and informing the patient and any next of kin about
immediate clinical care. It is often not possible for the patient or relative/carer
(consultee) to review trial documentation, weigh the information and communicate an
informed decision about whether they would wish to participate. The consent procedure
for this trial will reflect that of the surgery, with the clinical team assessing
capacity before taking consent for the surgical procedure, and this capacity
assessment then being used to decide on the proper approach to consenting to the
research. An appropriate method, in line with the mental capacity act and approved by
a National Research Ethics Committee, will then be used to gain either prospective or
retrospective consent from the patient or appropriate consultee by a Good Clinical
Practice (GCP)-trained, appropriately delegated member of the research team.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Allocation sequences will be generated at random by the trial statistician.
Allocation will be assigned using secure, online randomisation via a distant
computer generated system administered by Oxford Clinical Trials
Research Unit, University of Oxford. Participants will be enrolled by the
operating surgeon or trial research associates. Participants will be assigned to
their treatment allocation before surgery.</p>
                <p>The treatment allocation will be stratified by trial centre. The surgery will be
performed under the care of any of the consultant surgeons in the collaborating
centres. The large number of surgeons—previous experience in similar trials
suggests over 200 surgeons will take part—and the wide skill mix should
eliminate any ‘surgeon effect’ such that stratification by surgeon is
not required. In order to negate bias in the self-reported health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) outcome measures (EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L)), participants will be
blinded to the treatment allocation. The operating surgeon cannot be blinded to the
allocation and will take no part in the assessment of the trial outcomes. Patients
will be kept blinded until the completion of the trial when the blind is broken.
There will be no formal analysis of the success of the blinding.</p>

                  <p>Participants will usually be assessed in the emergency department. Diagnosis of a
fracture of the proximal femur will be confirmed by a plain radiograph as per
routine clinical care. Supplementary imaging will be at the discretion of the
treating clinical team. Routine investigations, anaesthetic assessment, antibiotic
and venous thromboembolic prophylaxis will be used as per local policy.</p>
                  <p>A regional or general anaesthesia technique will be used for every participant.
Perioperative analgesia will be achieved by combining a local anaesthetic nerve
block (femoral and lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, fascia iliaca or lumbar
plexus) using either a nerve stimulator or ultrasound-guided technique,
periarticular anaesthetic infiltration, intravenous paracetamol 1 g
intravenous infusion and opiate analgesia as clinically indicated.</p>
                  <p>All participants will have an attempted closed reduction of their fracture. The
lower limb will be supported on a fracture table. Internal fixation with either
device will be performed following the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Postoperative analgesia will be prescribed intraoperatively and reviewed by the
responsible clinical teams as appropriate. In the postoperative period, as per
standard of care, participants will undergo an initial physiotherapy and
occupational therapy trauma assessment. A full social, cognitive, premorbid
function and falls history will be obtained and documented. Participants will be
given the relevant NHS Trust Patient Information packs. An initial treatment plan
with objectives will be made, recorded and commenced. The aim of this plan will be
for participants to mobilise through early, active, full weight bearing.
Participants will be discharged from the acute orthopaedic trauma ward at the
earliest safe opportunity to the most appropriate discharge destination as
determined by the multidisciplinary clinical team.</p>

Fracture Database and the point at which recovery following hip fracture plateaus.
Parsons <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that
EQ-5D improved after surgery to around 4 months, with little evidence for subsequent
improvement after this time-point. However, complications and potential revisions
will need to be reviewed up to a minimum of 1 year postsurgery. In addition,
longer term follow-up to 12 months is recommended by the Medical Research Council for
investigations of all complex interventions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
Copies of the participants’ routine ‘operation note’ and

                <p>The best available evidence we have from data collected during the WHiT and WHITE

points.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The best available evidence for
what constitutes a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for EQ-5D that is
worth detecting comes from a review of MCID estimates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> After reviewing the literature, they estimated a median value of 0.08
for the MCID for EQ-5D-3L. Using a conservative estimate of the standard deviation
(SD=0.33), this suggests a standardised effect size of approximately 0.24, a
‘small to moderate effect’ based on Cohen’s criteria.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Taking a conservative approach, we considered
three possible target different values of 0.07, 0.75 and 0.08.</p>

distribution, which Parsons <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggests is reasonable, and a 1:1 allocation ratio, then if the true
difference between the experimental and control group EQ-5D means is in the range
0.07–0.08, we will need to recruit the below number of participants in each

patients declining consent to further follow-up and incapacity, so we have assumed
that only 60% of recruited study participants will be available at the definitive
endpoint at 4 months. This gives a total sample size of 844 for 80% power and 1128

corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated whenever possible. The primary outcome
measure, EQ-5D-5L at 4 months post surgery, will be analysed by calculating
the adjusted treatment effect by using linear regression to compare the EQ-5D-5L
score at 4 months (with a zero value imputed for those who died by this time point)
between the treatment arms, adjusting for age, gender and cognitive impairment.</p>
                <p>A sensitivity analysis of EQ-5D-5L score at 4 months with adjustment for the
retrospective baseline EQ-5D-5L score in addition to age, gender and cognitive
impairment will also be performed to enable the influence of this factor to be
evaluated. Additionally, a two-sided t-test for differences between SHS (control) and
XHS will also be used to calculate an unadjusted treatment effect both for EQ-5D with
and without zero for those who died. Some outcome data are likely not to be available
due to lack of completion of individual data items, declining consent for further
follow-up or general loss to follow-up. Where possible, the reasons for data
‘missingness’ will be ascertained and reported. The nature and pattern
of the ‘missingness’ will be carefully considered, including in
particular whether data can be treated as missing completely at random. Missing data
may be imputed in sensitivity analyses if considered beneficial to the interpretation
of the main findings. Any imputation methods used for scores and other derived
variables will be carefully considered and justified. Reasons for ineligibility,
non-compliance, withdrawal or other protocol violations will be stated and any
patterns summarised.</p>
                <p>Secondary measures will be analysed using generalised linear models with adjustment
for centre, baseline EQ-5D-5L, age, gender and cognitive impairment as appropriate.
EQ-5Q-5L at 12 months will be analysed with the same sensitivity analyses as the
primary outcome. Data will be summarised with point estimates of mean and SD, 95%
CIs, or proportion and risk ratios. Differences between SHS and XHS will be analysed
