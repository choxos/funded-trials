                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Acute psychological stress, as well as unusual experiences including
hallucinations and delusions, are common in critical care unit patients and have
been linked to post-critical care psychological morbidity such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Little high-quality research has
been conducted to evaluate psychological interventions that could alleviate
longer-term psychological morbidity in the critical care unit setting. Our
research team developed and piloted a nurse-led psychological intervention, aimed
at reducing patient-reported PTSD symptom severity and other adverse psychological
outcomes at 6 months, for evaluation in the POPPI trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre, parallel group, cluster-randomised clinical trial with a
staggered roll-out of the intervention. The trial is being carried out at 24 (12
intervention, 12 control) NHS adult, general, critical care units in the UK and is
evaluating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led
preventative psychological intervention in reducing patient-reported PTSD symptom
severity and other psychological morbidity at 6 months. All sites deliver
usual care for 5 months (baseline period). Intervention group sites are
then trained to carry out the POPPI intervention, and transition to delivering the
intervention for the rest of the recruitment period. Control group sites deliver
usual care for the duration of the recruitment period. The trial also includes a
process evaluation conducted independently of the trial team.</p>

South Central - Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15/SC/0287). The
first patient was recruited in September 2015 and results will be disseminated in
2018. The results will be presented at national and international conferences and
published in peer reviewed medical journals.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>More than 170 000 patients are admitted to adult, general, critical care units in
the National Health Service (NHS) each year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It
has been estimated that approximately 50% of critically ill patients suffer serious
emotional distress, and up to two-thirds have unusual experiences such as hallucinations
and delusions, while in the unit.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Emotional
distress, including severe symptoms of anxiety, low mood and panic, may be caused by a
range of stressful experiences that are common in the critical care unit: fear of dying;
invasive treatments such as mechanical ventilation; pain and discomfort; inability to
communicate; and terrifying hallucinatory delusions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4–6</xref> The hallucinations and delusions of critical
care unit patients have been linked to delirium, the provision and withdrawal of
sedative and other psychoactive drugs, effects of illness (such as sepsis), immobility,
and sensory and sleep deprivation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 7</xref>
Critical care unit hallucinations frequently have horrifying themes such as conspiracy
to kill by staff, torture, poisoning, demons, extortion or organ theft;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> thus a vicious cycle of stress, confusion and
terror is common for critical care unit patients.</p>
              <p>Experiencing acute psychological stress in the critical care unit, or having frequent
memories of hallucinations and delusions, are among the identified risk factors for
longer-term post-critical care post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression,
anxiety or cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5
9–13</xref> Systematic reviews of survivors of critical care identified high
rates of PTSD (median 20%)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 14</xref> and depression
(median 30%),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> months or years after
leaving critical care. Patients who develop serious long-term psychological distress are
at much higher risk of further physical morbidities and mortality,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> representing a serious burden to patients, to
their carers and to NHS.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref></p>
              <p>Little high-quality research has been conducted to evaluate psychological interventions
that could alleviate the emotional distress experienced by patients in critical care,
with a view to preventing longer-term psychological morbidity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The introduction of valid psychological assessment tools for use
with critical care patients (eg, the intensive care psychological assessment tool
(IPAT))<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> has made evaluation of psychological
interventions more feasible. Research informing the best timing to provide psychological
interventions suggests that postdischarge (eg, at 6 weeks<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> or at outpatient follow-up clinics<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) may be too late, and earlier intervention could be more beneficial.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In today’s NHS, practitioner psychologists
are still a scarce resource, and a more pragmatic approach would be to standardise brief
evidence-based psychological interventions to be carried out by existing critical care
staff, who would be given the necessary training.</p>
              <p>Our research team developed and piloted a nurse-led psychological intervention for
critical care unit patients which commences within the unit and is based on up-to-date
evidence concerning psychological techniques that are effective in: (A) reducing acute
emotional distress, (B) reducing the impact of unusual experiences such as
hallucinations and delusions and (C) preventing PTSD after a trauma. These are all
psychological problems commonly associated with admission to critical care. We
hypothesised that these existing evidence-based psychological interventions could be
modified to reduce the stress and trauma experienced by critical care unit patients, and
be delivered by specially trained, well-motivated critical care nurses. There is an
urgent need to evaluate their effectiveness in the critical care unit setting.</p>
              <p>This protocol was informed by the Psychological Outcomes following a nurse-led
Preventative Psychological Intervention for critically ill patients (POPPI) feasibility
study (ISRCTN61088114) which looked at feasibility and acceptability of both the
intervention and the trial procedures.</p>

individual sites will be randomised (4:4) in their second month of recruitment. It
is necessary to randomise on a cluster (‘site’), rather than
individual level to avoid contamination of usual care, as it would not be possible

intervals and recruit patients over a 17-month period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Control group sites will deliver usual care for the
duration of the recruitment period. Intervention group sites will deliver usual
care from months 1 to 5. Usual care is defined as patients receiving
psychological support or treatment at the discretion of the treating clinician(s)
following standard practice at their site.</p>

                  <p>After month 5, intervention group sites will undergo a 1-month transition period,
during which they will transition from delivering usual care to delivering the
intervention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). At the beginning
of the transition period, all POPPI nurses at a site will attend a 3-day POPPI
nurse training course. Following the training course and completion of a local
intervention site initiation visit, the POPPI nurses and local education/research
teams will commence delivery of the POPPI intervention. During the transition
period, each POPPI nurse should deliver stress support sessions to at least one
recruited patient, identified (using the IPAT) as being stressed and at high risk
of psychological morbidity. In parallel, the POPPI nurses and local
education/research teams will encourage culture change in their unit to create a
therapeutic environment. This will be done by ensuring all clinical critical care
staff complete the POPPI online training and through other educational activities
(eg, seminars and short presentations, bedside teaching and display of materials
reinforcing key messages from the POPPI online training). At the end of this
transition period, the POPPI nurses will undergo a skills development assessment.
Following the transition period, the intervention will be delivered until the end
of the recruitment period.</p>

                  <p>The POPPI nurse training course is a 3-day central course to train POPPI nurses in
their new role. The focus of the course is on learning and practising the skills
required to deliver the stress support sessions with patients. The course was
designed by the trial team in consultation with experts in medical education and
cognitive behavioural therapy training, and is delivered by a psychologist, two
senior nurses and a research assistant.</p>
                  <p>The course will cover:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Understanding critical care patients’ stress (including patient
representative talks and videos)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Learning the skills needed to deliver stress support sessions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Content of each of the stress support sessions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Observing (in person and expert videos) example stress support

                  <p>Associated materials include: a precourse theory booklet, a training folder and
POPPI nurse training manual on the three stress support sessions; a tablet
computer with a ‘relax and recover’ app for patients to use with
help from nurses and family; and a self-help booklet and digital video disc (DVD)
for patients to take home.</p>
                  <p>The POPPI nurse role also includes; encouraging clinical staff in their units to
complete the POPPI online training; promoting the screening of patients with IPAT;
and teaching good communication skills and psychological care (reinforcing key
messages from the POPPI online training) at the bedside. These tasks will be
completed in conjunction with the research/education teams at each intervention
site as a team approach and training will be provided by the trial team at
intervention site initiation visits held locally.</p>

provide debriefing and support following the training course. Debriefing and
support will focus on enhancing nurses’ skills and discussing
patients’ cases. The first debriefing and support session will be carried
out once a POPPI nurse has delivered stress support sessions to their first
patient. Once all POPPI nurses at the site have delivered stress support sessions
to at least one patient each, the POPPI training team will visit the POPPI nurses
in their units to offer further support. During the visit, POPPI nurses will also
undergo a skills development assessment, to ensure they meet the required
standards for delivering the sessions. If necessary, further support and training
will be offered prior to the delivery of further sessions with patients. POPPI
nurses will continue to receive debriefing and support either via telephone call
or site visit.</p>

                  <title>Creating a therapeutic environment</title>
                  <p>Each intervention group site will create a therapeutic environment by encouraging
culture change in their unit. This will be facilitated by ensuring all clinical
critical care unit staff complete the POPPI online training and by teaching and
modelling good communication skills and psychological care at the bedside. The
POPPI online training is an online training course designed to aid the creation of
a calm, less stressful environment by reducing stressors in the environment and
using good communication with patients. The POPPI online training takes
approximately 30 min to complete and comprises five sections (understanding
the stresses of intensive care patients, reducing stress and fear in patients,
communicating with distressed patients, inspiring patients with confidence and
hope, and summary and assessment). Local research teams will enumerate all
clinical critical care staff at the start of the transition period, and then
monthly thereafter to ensure new staff members are registered for the POPPI online
training.</p>
                  <p>In addition, intervention group sites will ensure that POPPI materials are clearly
displayed (eg, posters) and distributed (eg, pocket cards) throughout the

trusting relationship with patients, so patients can discuss concerns which they
might feel embarrassed or worried about communicating, and to reduce emotional
distress. There are three common components to each stress support session:
starting the session; building rapport; and finishing the session. In addition,

                  <p>The three stress support sessions are to be delivered by the same POPPI nurse
ideally within 1 week, with the first stress support session starting as
soon as possible, but within 48 hours following IPAT assessment. Each
session lasts approximately 30 min and ideally (at least) the first session
is delivered in the critical care unit, but sessions can be delivered elsewhere in
the hospital if the patient moves. If a patient shows signs of distress or fatigue
during the session, then the session can be stopped and a new visit can be
arranged at a more appropriate time. The State-Trait Anxiety

                  <p>All participants will be sent a follow-up questionnaire by the ICNARC CTU
6 months postrecruitment. The questionnaire contains the PTSD Symptom Scale
– Self-Report version (PSS-SR),<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the EuroQoL health questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and a health services and resource use questionnaire.
Questionnaire packs include a self-addressed stamped envelope and a pen for ease
of return. Non-responders will be telephoned 3 weeks later to check whether
they have received the questionnaire and, if preferable, they will be given the
option to complete the questionnaire over the telephone. If completed
questionnaires received at the ICNARC CTU indicate the presence of signs of
serious stress, anxiety or depression, a referral letter from DW (lead
clinical investigator) will be sent to the patient’s GP or the local PIs at
the recruiting site.</p>

collected via the patient follow-up questionnaire at 6 months postrecruitment.
In addition, data will be linked to CMP and will include demographics,
surgical status, acute severity of illness and duration of organ support, and
duration of critical care unit stay. Support for the collection and use of
patient-identifiable data has been approved for CMP by the Patient Information
Advisory Group (PIAG) under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006—approval number:
PIAG 2-10(f)/2005. Survival at 6 months will be ascertained through NHS
Digital. All data are managed in accordance with ICNARC CTU standard operating
procedures.</p>
                <p>The process evaluation will consider both quantitative and qualitative data.
Mixed-methods data will be collected for all three component parts of the
intervention, to elucidate the degree to which the intervention was delivered as
intended. Quantitative data will include the rate of online training uptake,
treatment fidelity of the stress support sessions, and routinely collected screening
and recruitment data. At intervention group sites, qualitative data will be collected
in the form of researcher observations, interviews with staff and structured field
notes. An independent researcher will observe and discuss the delivery of the
intervention with the POPPI nurses and wider critical care unit staff, exploring
clinician experiences including those relating to barriers and facilitators to the
delivery of the intervention. The process evaluation will also incorporate visits to
a purposively selected sample of control group sites. Qualitative data will be
collected to understand wider trial processes including strategies to ensure/promote
recruitment, and any changes in unit practice from baseline.</p>

significant difference in the mean PSS-SR at 6 months between patients
recruited during the intervention period at intervention sites compared with
patients recruited at control sites using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM)
at the individual patient level (patients nested within sites and time periods)
including a random effect of site and a fixed effect of period (baseline or
intervention), and adjusted for site-level factors included within the restricted
randomisation algorithm.</p>
                  <p>For the primary outcome, the link function will be the identity link (ie, linear
regression) and standard errors will be estimated using a jackknife variance
estimate, which has been demonstrated in simulation studies to maintain the size
of the test.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
                  <p>A secondary analysis will adjust for prespecified baseline factors associated with
poor psychological outcome (eg, sedation) and ability to resource and deliver the
intervention (eg, size of critical care unit, teaching status) at both patient and
site levels. Results of GLMMs will be reported as differences in means, 95% CIs
and P values.</p>
                  <p>Analyses of secondary outcomes will be conducted using GLMMs, with the identity
link (ie, linear regression) for continuous secondary outcomes, reported as
differences in means, and the logit link (ie, logistic regression) for binary
secondary outcomes, reported as ORs.</p>
                  <p>The above analyses will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention among all
patients meeting the inclusion criteria and consenting to follow-up, based on the
intention-to-treat principle. A further secondary analysis will use structural
mean models with an instrumental variable of allocated treatment to estimate the
efficacy (adherence-adjusted causal effect) of the stress support sessions among
those patients consenting to psychological assessment and stress support sessions,
assessed as being at high risk of psychological morbidity and receiving stress
support sessions.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>

of years that parametrical curves predict excess mortality compared with
the age-gender matched general population, after which we will assume that
all-cause death rates were those of the age-gender matched general population. In
the base case, quality of life calculated at 6 months will be assumed to
apply to each subsequent year of life, after allowing for decrements in quality of
life according to advancing age. We will project lifetime costs by applying
morbidity costs estimated at 6 months over the period of excess mortality.
Predicted survival and HRQoL will be combined to report lifetime QALYs, and to
project lifetime incremental costs, incremental QALYs and incremental net benefits
for the alternative strategies of care. Sensitivity analyses will test whether the
results are robust to methodological assumptions (eg, specification of the
statistical model, extrapolation approach, alternative HRQoL assumptions and
learning curve effects).</p>

                  <title>Final review of assumptions in pretrial power calculation</title>
                  <p>During recruitment, in consultation with the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and
Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC), a review of assumptions underlying
the pretrial power calculation was conducted once outcome data were available for
patients recruited during the 5-month baseline period in both
the intervention group and control group sites. This review, undertaken
using data available on 9 August 2016, identified the following re-estimations of
the assumptions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mean (10.3) and SD (10.8) of PSS-SR</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICC of 0.087 (95% CI 0 to 0.192) (with mean, SD and ICC estimated using
all available data from a previous observational study, the feasibility
study and the baseline period of the cluster-RCT)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Treatment effect of a reduction of 4.2 points on PSS-SR—estimated
by retaining the same effect size as a multiple of the within-site SD</p></list-item><list-item><p>Harmonic mean of the number of patients completing follow-up (30.7 per
site per annum —corresponding to 12.8 in a 5-month period)
estimated using observed data from the baseline period</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p>This review established that the planned design had an anticipated 78% power under
the observed parameter estimates (allowing for uncertainty in the between-site
variation, between 73% and 85% power).</p>
                  <p>Consequently, the decision was taken to extend recruitment in all sites to the end
of planned recruitment for the final group of eight sites (corresponding to an
harmonic mean of 16.5 patients completing follow-up per site during the
intervention period, allowing for the variation from 5 months to
9 months duration across sites, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure
1</xref>). With this extension to recruitment, the planned design had an
anticipated 85% power (allowing for uncertainty in the between-site variation,
between 79% and 91% power). It was anticipated that, with this extension to
recruitment, the estimated total number of patients recruited would be 1378.
Recruitment continued to be monitored to ensure 1378 or more patients were
recruited. A final decision to extend recruitment by an additional 2 months
in all sites was taken to ensure this minimum number was achieved. A protocol
amendment was implemented to reflect this review of assumptions and the extension
to the recruitment period.</p>
