                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Deprescribing of antihypertensive medications for older patients with normal blood pressure is recommended by some clinical guidelines, where the potential harms of treatment may outweigh the benefits. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>A Markov patient-level simulation was undertaken to model the effect of withdrawing one antihypertensive compared with usual care, over a life-time horizon. Model population characteristics were estimated using data from the OPTiMISE antihypertensive deprescribing trial, and the effects of blood pressure changes on outcomes were derived from the literature. Health-related quality of life was modeled in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and presented as costs per QALY gained.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In the base-case analysis, medication reduction resulted in lower costs than usual care (mean difference £185), but also lower QALYs (mean difference 0.062) per patient over a life-time horizon. Usual care was cost-effective at £2975 per QALY gained (more costly, but more effective). Medication reduction resulted more heart failure and stroke/TIA events but fewer adverse events. Medication reduction may be the preferred strategy at a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY, where the baseline absolute risk of serious drug-related adverse events was ≥7.7% a year (compared with 1.7% in the base-case).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Although there was uncertainty around many of the assumptions underpinning this model, these findings suggest that antihypertensive medication reduction should not be attempted in many older patients with controlled systolic blood pressure. For populations at high risk of adverse effects, deprescribing may be beneficial, but a targeted approach would be required in routine practice.</p>

                <p>Despite some uncertainty regarding model inputs, due to a lack of evidence in this older population, these findings suggest that antihypertensive medication reduction should not be attempted in most older patients with controlled systolic blood pressure. Further research is required to understand the risks and benefit of antihypertensive medication reduction in older people at high risk of adverse effects from blood pressure lowering.</p>

            <p>Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Antihypertensive treatment has been shown to be very effective at preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) across many different populations, including those with advancing age.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, most randomized controlled trials focusing on older people<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> do not include those patients with significant frailty and multi-morbidity who are prescribed many medications to treat their conditions.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> As a result, clinical guidelines<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> recommend caution when prescribing antihypertensive treatment in these older adults, due to a lack of evidence on efficacy and concerns about the potential for drug related harm.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Increasingly, deprescribing of antihypertensive medications is being encouraged in patients with controlled blood pressure,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> where the potential harms of treatment<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> may outweigh the benefits. It is also seen as a mechanism to reduce polypharmacy, since the most common comorbidity in older people is hypertension<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and most patients will need multiple antihypertensive medications to control their blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Indeed, it has been suggested that deprescribing treatment prescriptions which no longer provide benefit could be cost-saving for health care providers.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, there is very little evidence to support the practice of deprescribing antihypertensives.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The OPTiMISE (Optimising Treatment for Mild Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly) trial sought to address this evidence gap through a randomized, open label, noninferiority trial of antihypertensive deprescribing (withdrawal of one antihypertensive) versus usual care.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In 569 participants aged 80 years or older, antihypertensive deprescribing was shown to be possible with no difference in the proportion of participants with controlled systolic blood pressure (&lt;150 mm Hg) between groups at 12-week follow-up. There were also no differences in serious adverse events or health-related quality of life, although blood pressure did increase modestly (3/2 mm Hg) in the deprescribing group.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> While this trial suggested that antihypertensive deprescribing was safe in the short-term, the long-term impacts on clinical outcomes remain unknown, as do the cost implications of this strategy if it were to be adopted in routine clinical practice.</p>
            <p>The present study aimed to extrapolate results from the OPTiMISE trial to assess the longer-term cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive deprescribing from a National Health Service/Personal Social Services perspective, using a Markov model with individual patient level simulation.</p>

                <p>A Markov patient-level simulation was undertaken in TreeAge 2019 (TreeAge Software, Inc, Williamstown, MA) to model the 2 treatment strategies (usual care and withdrawal of one antihypertensive agent). This type of Markov model tracks the costs and consequences of individual patients passing through the model, with characteristics (taken from OPTiMISE patient-level data)<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> free to vary between patients. The model was run over a life-time (maximum of 20 years) time horizon to capture all relevant long-term costs and consequences, with a 3 month time cycle.</p>

                <p>Within each 3-month time cycle, a patient had a risk of suffering a cardiovascular event, an antihypertensive-related serious or minor adverse event, or death (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18726" ext-link-type="uri">Figure S1</ext-link>). Possible cardiovascular events were coronary heart disease (stable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction), heart failure, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Antihypertensive-related adverse events were acute kidney injury, hospitalized and nonhospitalized falls, hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, and electrolyte imbalance. Ten-year cardiovascular risk was calculated for each individual patient using the QRisk2 algorithm.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In the absence of robust published estimates in this older population, an assumption of greater CVD risk was applied to those with CVD conditions by applying a multiplier of 1.5, based on expert clinical opinion. The distribution of coronary heart disease and stroke/transient ischemic attack events was dependent on age and gender,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and heart failure risk was dependent on age.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The risk of minor and serious adverse events (serious falls, acute kidney injury) from antihypertensive treatment were obtained from SPRINT (Systolic blood Pressure Intervention Trial) data in those aged 75 and over (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>

                <p>In the base-case analysis, medication reduction resulted in lower costs than usual care (mean difference £185) but also lower QALYs (mean difference 0.062) per patient over a life-time time horizon (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The ICER for usual care was £2975 per QALY gained (more costly, but more effective), meaning that usual care was highly cost-effective at the £20 000/QALY threshold. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that usual care was the most cost-effective option in 99.0% of iterations at the £20 000/QALY threshold, and 99.7% at £30 000/QALY, with almost all replications of the model in the Western half of the plane (fewer QALYs for medication reduction; Figures <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Using a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY in the threshold analyses, medication reduction may be the preferred strategy (as the ICER for usual care exceeds £20 000/QALY), where the baseline absolute risk of serious drug-related adverse events was &gt;7.7% a year for each individual in the model (compared with the base-case value of 1.7%; Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Additional threshold analyses suggested that patients had to gain &gt;0.017 of utility per year from having their medication reduced (compared with the base-case value of 0) for this intervention to become the preferred strategy (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both analyses assume that decision makers are willing to forgo small QALY gains to reduce costs.</p>
                <p>Assuming medication reduction conferred no additional risk (relative risk=1) for CVD simultaneously resulted in usual care no longer being cost-effective, with an ICER of £178 631 per QALY (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18726" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3</ext-link>). Usual care was still cost-effective when applying the upper and lower 95% CIs of the relative risks of cardiovascular events. Applying the same approach for the adverse events did not change the findings of the primary analysis and in some cases usual care became dominant (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18726" ext-link-type="uri">Table S3</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>When the model time horizon was reduced to 5 years, maintaining antihypertensive prescription (usual care) remained cost-effective. The results were also robust when reducing the timeframe of the effect of the intervention (in terms of increased blood pressure) from life-time to 1 year through to 10 years, halving absolute cardiovascular risk, and when using the lower 95% CI of the observed systolic blood pressure change (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18726" ext-link-type="uri">Table S4</ext-link>). Usual care was also estimated to be cost-effective in subgroup analyses by frailty and number of cardiovascular conditions present at baseline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18726" ext-link-type="uri">Table S5</ext-link>).

                <title>Main Findings</title>
                <p>The primary finding of this study was that usual care, compared with antihypertensive deprescribing, was more expensive (due to higher medication costs) but results in more QALYs and has an ICER of £2975 per QALY. This indicates that usual care of continuation of antihypertensive drugs is highly cost-effective compared with deprescribing. The lower QALYs associated with the antihypertensive deprescribing strategy occurred due to a projected increase in cardiovascular events (particularly heart failure) caused by a modest sustained increase in systolic blood pressure. Antihypertensive deprescribing was only the preferred strategy when patients were assumed to have a high baseline risk of serious adverse events (eg, were at high risk of falling or experiencing acute kidney injury in the next year).</p>
                <p>Many of the model inputs had considerable uncertainty or required assumptions to be made, due to a lack of evidence in this older population. Based on currently available data, these findings suggest that antihypertensive medication reduction should not be attempted in most older patients with controlled systolic blood pressure. In some specific populations at particularly high risk of adverse drug events, antihypertensive deprescribing may carry some benefits so a targeted approach may be needed if deprescribing is to be adopted in routine clinical practice.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Weaknesses</title>
                <p>The present analyses were informed by robust data from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing antihypertensive deprescribing with usual care in a primary care setting. Participants recruited to this trial were representative of the general population aged 80 years and older registered at practices in primary care.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This trial was limited to just 12 weeks of follow-up, meaning that the long-term effects of antihypertensive deprescribing had to be modeled on the basis of observed differences in blood pressure. For the base case analysis, such differences were assumed to be sustained over a lifetime which may not reflect experience in routine practice, although sensitivity analyses shortening the period in which a blood pressure difference existed from 1 to 10 years did not affect the primary findings of the analysis. This short period of follow-up in the trial meant that estimates of treatment safety and efficacy had to be taken from previous treatment intensification trials which are likely (and by design of OPTiMISE) to have recruited a different population to that considered for deprescribing.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Estimates of CVD risk (which drove the observed differences in QALYs) were based on the best available cardiovascular risk score (QRisk2), which was not developed or validated for individuals aged 85 years or older.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Also, while the OPTiMISE trial recruited a population of patients similar to the general older population in primary care,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> based on the sample size of the trial there may be some uncertainty around some of the parameters included in the model such as age and baseline cardiovascular risk. Changing these values in a sensitivity analysis did not alter the primary findings.</p>
                <p>Ninety-eight percent of OPTiMISE trial participants were living with multiple long-term conditions which could carry competing risks eclipsing future CVD events. These could not be taken into account in the present analysis due to a lack of evidence. The present model was complex, requiring a number of assumptions related to the risk of CVD, and adverse events for which there is little evidence in this population. This meant it was not possible to add further complexity relating to treatment changes following cardiovascular events, terminal care costs or the impact of recurring events which often occur in real world practice. Such uncertainty, and reliance on data from antihypertensive intensification trials may have favored cost-effectiveness of the usual care strategy.</p>

                <title>Findings in the Context of Existing Literature</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive deprescribing in older adults aged 80 years and above. Indeed, few studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of deprescribing of any medication classes in routine clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Two analyses based on data from the D-PRESCRIBE (Developing Pharmacist-Led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly) trial<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> examined the cost-effectiveness of NSAIDS<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> and sedative deprescribing.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> In contrast to the present analyses, these studies found deprescribing of these medications to be a cost-effective intervention, both in terms of saving money and increasing health related quality of life. Although our analysis found antihypertensive deprescribing to be cost saving too, it is possible that the disutility from adverse events related to NSAID and sedative prescribing is higher than that from antihypertensives, resulting in fewer QALYs gained from stopping antihypertensive treatment. This was supported by sensitivity analyses which suggested that an increasing disutility associated with antihypertensive treatment prescription would have resulted in deprescribing becoming the preferred strategy. However, such a gain was not observed in the original trial over 3 months of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Indeed, there was no significant difference in EQ-5D-5L index between the 2 trial arms and a change of the magnitude modelled in this sensitivity analysis was outside the 95% CI for the observed difference.</p>

                <title>Implications for Clinical Practice</title>
                <p>Although based on data with some uncertainty, this study suggests that antihypertensive deprescribing may not be cost-effective in older patients aged 80 years and older, and therefore, should not be attempted in patients with controlled systolic blood pressure as a routine policy. This is important for guideline and policy makers, who are increasingly encouraging physicians to think about deprescribing chronic medications where the benefits of treatment no longer outweigh the harms.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Sensitivity analyses conducted here were able to identify scenarios where this might occur, notably, in those with a high risk of medication related adverse events. However, it is currently difficult to determine who these patients might be in routine practice. For other treatments, such as anticoagulants, tools exist which can help physicians quantify an individual’s risk of bleeding which may be increased by treatment.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Similar tools predicting adverse events related to antihypertensive treatment would help target deprescribing at those most likely to benefit, although this requires further research. In the interim, for physicians wishing to reduce antihypertensives prescriptions in older patients under their care, tools such as the electronic frailty index<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> or QAdmissions score<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> may be considered as a proxy to determine higher risk patients.</p>

                <title>Perspectives</title>
                <p>The present analysis found that deprescribing of antihypertensive medication in older adults was cost saving but resulted in fewer quality adjusted life years gained when compared with usual care. Although sensitivity analyses suggested that such a strategy may be preferred when targeted at individuals at high risk of adverse events, the lack of robust data regarding the underlying risk in this population, and the long-term effects of deprescribing preclude firm recommendations being drawn. While reducing polypharmacy in the elderly may still be a desirable policy, these data suggest that it may be better to attempt withdrawal of medications that do not reduce major clinical events.</p>
