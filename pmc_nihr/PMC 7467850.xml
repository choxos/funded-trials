                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, current strategies are struggling to control the burgeoning hypertension epidemic. Dietary interventions such as inorganic nitrate or folic acid supplementation could represent promising strategies for reducing blood pressure (BP) in this setting.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs2">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>This feasibility study explores the effects of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation, alone or in combination with folic acid, on BP in Tanzanian adults with elevated BP in Tanzania.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted. Forty-seven middle-aged and older participants (age: 50â70 y, BMI: 26.3â29.1Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly assigned to 3 conditions for a period of 60 d: <italic>1</italic>) high-nitrate beetroot juice (â¼400Â mg nitrate) and folic acid (â¼5Â mg folic acid) (NÂ +Â F), <italic>2</italic>) high-nitrate beetroot juice and placebo (NÂ +Â P), or <italic>3</italic>) nitrate-depleted beetroot juice and placebo (PÂ +Â P). Clinic and 24-h ambulatory BP and measurements of compliance in plasma (nitrate and folate concentrations) and saliva (nitrate and nitrite) were obtained at baseline, 30 d, and 60 d.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Baseline resting systolic and diastolic BP (mean Â± SD) was 151.0Â Â±Â 19.4Â mm Hg and 91.8Â Â±Â 11.7Â mm Hg, respectively. Compliance to the interventions was high (&gt;90%) in all groups which was confirmed by the significant increase in nitrate and folic acid concentrations in plasma and saliva samples in the treatment arms. After 60 d, 24-h systolic BP dropped by â10.8Â Â±Â 9.8Â mm Hg (<italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.001), â6.1Â Â±Â 13.2Â mm Hg (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.03), and â0.3Â Â±Â 9.7Â mm Hg (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.83) in the NÂ +Â P, NÂ +Â F, and PÂ +Â P groups, respectively. There was a significant decrease in 24-h diastolic BP in the NÂ +Â P group (â5.4Â Â±Â 5.0Â mm Hg, <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.004), whereas changes were not significant in the NÂ +Â F (â1.8Â Â±Â 8.1Â mm Hg, <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.32) and PÂ +Â P (1.6Â Â±Â 8.3Â mm Hg, <italic>P</italic>Â =Â 0.43) groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Dietary inorganic nitrate represents a potential nutritional strategy to lessen the hypertension epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings support the rationale for future long-term investigations exploring the efficacy of dietary nitrate for lowering BP and attenuating cardiovascular disease risk in this setting.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and neurodegeneration, and is a major contributor toward disability and premature mortality (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In 2010, 28.5% of adults living in high-income countries and 31.5% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) had hypertension worldwide (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Almost two-thirds of all hypertensive individuals live in LMICs, and the highest rates of hypertension are found in Africa where 46% of adults aged â¥25 y have raised blood pressure (BP) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In Sub-Saharan Africa (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), this condition was the sixth leading cause of disability, accounting for &gt;11 million disability-adjusted life years, in 2010 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and was estimated to have caused over half a million deaths and 10 million years of life lost in 2010 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>The United Republic of Tanzania is a low-income country, where current management strategies are struggling to control the burgeoning hypertension epidemic. Indeed, a study from our group conducted in Tanzania found that only one-third of hypertensive individuals had previously been diagnosed, only one-sixth of those diagnosed were on antihypertension treatment, and only one-sixth of those being treated exhibited adequate BP control (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These findings highlight the need for improved diagnosis of hypertension in Tanzania. They also demonstrate the crucial need to explore alternative ways of reducing BP in this setting.</p>
              <p>Dietary interventions could play an important role in this regard. Firstly, dietary interventions may help by reducing the strain on resource-limited health care systems, where the availability and affordability of medication are often restrictive. Secondly, individuals may be more receptive to consuming bioactive foods or nutritional supplements, rather than antihypertensive medications, owing to the reduced risk of side effects and negative cultural perceptions of Western medicine (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Two dietary interventions that offer promise in this regard are inorganic nitrate and folic acid.</p>
              <p>Dietary inorganic nitrate, which serves as a substrate for the pleiotropic gasotransmitter nitric oxide (NO), is found in large quantities in green leafy vegetables and beetroot (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and has attracted considerable interest in the past decade as a nutritional antihypertensive agent (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In their seminal study, Larsen et al. (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) reported a 3.7Â mm Hg decrease in diastolic BP after 3 d supplementation with sodium nitrate. Subsequently, Webb et al. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) reported a â¼10.4Â mm Hg and â¼8.0Â mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, 2.5â3 h after acute ingestion of nitrate-rich beetroot juice. Similar benefits have also been reported in a group of African-American women (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A recent meta-analysis reported overall reductions in systolic and diastolic BP of 4.8Â mm Hg and 1.7Â mm Hg, respectively, after dietary nitrate supplementation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Folic acid has also attracted attention as a potential BP-reducing nutritional compound. It has been demonstrated to improve endothelial function and reduce BP: effects which may be underpinned by improved NO synthase coupling, scavenging of superoxide, and a reduction in homocysteine (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Given that dietary nitrate and folic acid operate, at least in part, through separate mechanisms, it is possible that they may elicit additive or synergistic effects on BP. If shown to be effective, the consumption of nitrate- and folic acidârich foods could be encouraged to help combat raised BP levels in Tanzania, with potential applications in other African countries. However, there are presently no data on the combined effects of consuming these 2 nutritional supplements, nor their efficacy in this setting.</p>
              <p>The objective of this feasibility study was to obtain information on the effects of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation, alone or in combination with folic acid supplementation, on BP in a group of adult individuals with elevated BP living in the United Republic of Tanzania. Specifically, we utilized resting clinic blood pressure measurements (CBPMs) and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to examine changes in systolic and diastolic BP. Blood and saliva samples were collected to evaluate compliance to the interventions (folic acid and nitrate) and measure biomarkers of NO production.</p>

Measurements were taken at the research sites at baseline (day 0), interim (day 30), and at the end of the study (day 60). A telephone interview was conducted â¼15 d after commencing the intervention to assess participant adherence and any health and safety concerns. Participants were asked to maintain their usual dietary habits, physical activity level, and consumption of alcohol and caffeinated drinks during the trial. They were also asked to avoid using mouthwash during the study period, given that this is known to diminish the physiological effects of dietary nitrate (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). All capsules (used for administering folate and folate placebos) were stored in identical white containers showing the individual participant code, the number of capsules, the expiry date, and storage and prescription instructions. Subjects were provided with a form to record the time of supplement consumption and any problems they had with the interventions. The intervention groups were as follows.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>A formal statistical calculation of the sample size was not possible owing to the lack of data on the effects of dietary nitrate on cardiometabolic outcomes in sub-Saharan African populations. Therefore, we calculated our sample size using the approach for pilot trials proposed by Whitehead et al. (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). A sample size of 15 participants/arm would allow the detection of a medium effect size (Î´ = 0.30â0.70) with a power of 0.80 and a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;Â 0.05. In addition, we also used data from a published trial testing the effects of dietary nitrate on BP in hypertensive British patients to further support the appropriateness of the sample size calculation (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The trial reported a significant effect of inorganic nitrate supplementation on systolic 24-h ABPM after 6 wk of supplementation in 68 drug-naÃ¯ve hypertensive patients. The difference in mean systolic BP between the nitrate and placebo groups was â7.7Â mm Hg (95% CI: 4.1, 11.2 mm Hg) with an effect size of 0.39. Applying an ANOVA model for repeated measures, we estimated that 14 participants/group (total sample size: 42) would be sufficient to detect a significant difference between the placebo and the nitrate intervention group with a <italic>P</italic> level of 0.05 and 80% power. Our study aimed to recruit 48 patients (16/group) to allow for a 10% dropout rate during the study.</p>

Baseline differences between groups were tested using univariate ANOVA for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate differences between the 3 interventions, changes in the outcome variable over time, and whether the changes over time were different between the interventions (interaction term). Post hoc analysis [Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD)] was conducted to evaluate significant changes within each intervention after 30 d and 60 d compared with the respective baseline values. The distribution of residuals was checked for normality. ANOVA was used to test differences in changes from baseline between the 3 intervention groups. Post hoc analysis (Fisher's LSD) was conducted to evaluate significant differences for the NÂ +Â P and NÂ +Â F interventions compared with the placebo group (PÂ +Â P). Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the associations of changes in biomarker concentrations with changes in diastolic and systolic BP. In addition, correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association between changes in salivary nitrite measured by the salivary strips and chemiluminescence.

Gastrointestinal symptoms were the primary reason for participants to skip a daily dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>).

              <p>The principal original finding of this study is that dietary supplementation with nitrate-rich beetroot juice, alone or in combination with folic acid, results in clinically significant reductions in BP in drug-naÃ¯ve Tanzanian adults. These findings have important implications for the treatment of hypertension and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
              <p>The effects of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation on BP have been investigated in previous studies, with a recent meta-analysis reporting overall reductions in both systolic (â 4.8Â mm Hg) and diastolic (â 1.7Â mm Hg) BP consequent to nitrate consumption (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The majority of previous investigations have explored the effects of acute or short-term nitrate ingestion on BP, were conducted in high-income countries (typically in the United States, United Kingdom, or Sweden), and examined the effects of nitrate alone, without exploring possible additive or synergistic effects with other compounds. Our study is unique, because of the prolonged (60-d) supplementation period, Sub-Saharan African setting, and inclusion of a nitrate plus folic acid experimental arm. We found that nitrate supplementation alone elevated markers of NO bioavailability, reduced clinic and ambulatory systolic BP by â¼10Â mm Hg, and lowered diastolic ambulatory BP by â¼7Â mm Hg. These BP reductions are similar in magnitude to those reported by Webb et al. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) after acute nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion (resting clinic BP: â¼10/8Â mm Hg reduction) and Kapil et al. (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) after 4 wk of nitrate-rich beetroot consumption (ambulatory BP: â¼8/5Â mm Hg reduction). To contextualize our findings, a meta-analysis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) demonstrated that a 10Â mm Hg reduction in systolic BP would be expected to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, coronary artery disease by 17%, stroke by 27%, heart failure by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%. Because participants exhibited relatively few side effects to nitrate consumption, and compliance was good, this suggests that nitrate could represent an effective nutritional agent to reduce BP and improve cardiovascular health in Tanzania.</p>
              <p>Inorganic nitrate and folic acid have been proposed to reduce BP via different mechanisms (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that combined supplementation with these 2 compounds could elicit greater BP-reducing effects than nitrate alone. Although we found similar effects of nitrate plus folic acid compared with nitrate alone on systolic ambulatory BP (â¼7Â compared with â¼10Â mm Hg), combined supplementation with these 2 compounds had no effects on diastolic ambulatory BP or clinic-based BP. Tentatively, this may indicate that the BP-lowering effects of nitrate are partly diminished (but still clinically relevant) when this inorganic anion is ingested alongside folic acid, although further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis and to investigate potential mechanisms. Interestingly, previous studies have indicated that the wider dietary context can modulate the effects of inorganic nitrate on BP. For example, 1 study found that the antihypertensive effects of nitrate were abolished when this compound was consumed alongside thiocyanate-rich vegetables such as broccoli (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), whereas another suggested potential BP-increasing effects of nitrate when consumed alongside dietary sulfate (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>Conversely, we recently found that the BP-lowering effects of nitrate supplementation were enhanced with coadministration of vitamin C (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Understanding the interactions between nitrate and other dietary components represents an important area of exploration for future studies. It is noteworthy that plasma homocysteine tended to be lower in the nitrate plus folic acid condition in our studyâan effect previously well established with folic acid consumption (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Because elevated homocysteine concentrations have been associated with increased risk of CVD, this could represent a BP-independent mechanism through which nitrate and folate combined could reduce CVD risk. Longer-duration studies exploring the effects of nitrate alone, or in combination with folate, on BP and hard clinical endpoints (e.g., CVD incidence and mortality) would be valuable in the future.</p>
              <p>Our results provide proof-of-concept that dietary nitrate supplementation may represent an effective way of reducing BP in hypertensive Tanzanian individualsâeffects that were verified both in a controlled clinical environment and in a free-living setting via 24-h ambulatory monitoring. A key question to address going forward is whether similar benefits can be achieved through consumption of whole foods such as nitrate-rich salads which can be grown locally in Tanzania and produced at a low cost, rather than having to rely upon commercial nutritional supplements such as the highly concentrated beetroot juice used in this study. Blekkenhorst et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) recently explored the efficacy of a nitrate-based whole-food intervention on BP in a group of Australian individuals with mildly elevated BP. Those authors observed excellent compliance (â¼98%) to a 4-wk intervention with nitrate-rich vegetables, which resulted in a mean increase in nitrate intake of â¼150Â mg/d. However, BP was not reduced, which may be due to the relatively modest amount of nitrate consumed, background diet, participantsâ characteristics, or other methodological factors. Ensuring a sufficiently high nitrate dose verified before intervention in an âat-riskâ population with raised BP may help maximize the chance of observing a beneficial effect of nitrate-rich foods on BP in future studies (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Further research into the long-term compliance to a nitrate-based intervention is also warranted. In this regard, we showed here potential utility of salivary strips for verifying nitrate consumption in a free-living setting, which substantiates previous laboratory research (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the present study provides preliminary evidence that dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation, alone or in combination with folic acid, represents a potential nutritional strategy to help combat the burgeoning hypertension epidemic in Tanzania and other Sub-Saharan African countries. These findings support the rationale for future long-term investigations exploring the efficacy of dietary nitrate for reducing BP and attenuating CVD risk in this setting and other LMIC settings.</p>
