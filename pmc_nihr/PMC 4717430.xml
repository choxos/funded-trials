                  <p>Molecular characterisation of tumours is increasing personalisation of cancer therapy, tailored to an individual and their cancer. FOCUS4 is a molecularly stratified clinical trial for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. During an initial 16-week period of standard first-line chemotherapy, tumour tissue will undergo several molecular assays, with the results used for cohort allocation, then randomisation. Laboratories in Leeds and Cardiff will perform the molecular testing. The results of a rigorous pre-trial inter-laboratory analytical validation are presented and discussed.</p>

                  <p>Wales Cancer Bank supplied FFPE tumour blocks from 97 mCRC patients with consent for use in further research. Both laboratories processed each sample according to an agreed definitive FOCUS4 laboratory protocol, reporting results directly to the MRC Trial Management Group for independent cross-referencing.</p>

Two samples gave discrepant results; in one a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation was detected only in Leeds, and in the other, a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation was only detected in Cardiff. pTEN and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) resulting in 6/97 discordant results for pTEN and 5/388 for MMR, resolved upon joint review. Tumour heterogeneity was likely responsible for pyrosequencing discrepancies. The presence of signet-ring cells, necrosis, mucin, edge-effects and over-counterstaining influenced IHC discrepancies.</p>

              <p>Molecular characterisation of tumours is leading to increasing personalisation of cancer therapy tailored to an individual and the target cancer. FOCUS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCLINPATH2015203097F1">figure 1</xref>) marks a significant advancement in terms of clinical trial design.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It aims to stratify patients to novel targeted agents by a prospective, progressive molecular stratification process. Following patient registration, archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour samples from patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) will be sent from collaborating centres to undergo mutation and immunohistochemical testing at one of the two centralised testing laboratories in Leeds and Cardiff, to allow the allocation of patients into molecular cohorts, within which there is a specific randomised comparison.</p>

              <p>The current panel of molecular markers selected for the trial is based on biomarkers which have been identified or are hypothesised as having the capacity to predict responses to specific targeted therapies. The trial is designed to allow the panel to progressively change during the life span of the trial, with identification of novel biomarkers and new treatment approaches being incorporated for differing biomarker-defined cohorts.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Mutational analysis of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> is already used routinely to determine suitability to receive anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> Mutational status of <italic>BRAF</italic> is becoming widely recognised as a prognostic marker, with the presence of an activating mutation in stage IV being associated with very poor prognosis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> has been implicated in driving signalling through the AKT pathway, which is a feature in up to 30% of CRC. While not being used initially to randomise patients, mismatch repair (MMR) status is being determined in order to further stratify patients in the post-randomisation phase.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to carry out a pre-trial analytical validation between the two designated biomarker testing laboratories in Leeds and Cardiff, in order to identify the inter-observer laboratory agreement on 97 samples of stage IV CRC and to ensure that laboratory testing was accurate and fit for purpose in both laboratories.</p>

                <p>Ninety-seven FFPE tumour resection blocks, from patients previously entered into either the FOCUS3 trial<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> or consented outside clinical trial to the Wales Cancer Bank (WCB), and stored with prior consent for further use in research, were retrieved from the WCB. The matched diagnostic biopsy blocks were also retrieved in 14 cases, to reflect the fact that 20–40% of patients in FOCUS4 will only have biopsy samples available for analysis. From the outset, these biopsies were only intended to be used for pTEN immunohistochemical analysis. For the purpose of this validation, the blocks were anonymised before sending to the biomarker teams in the laboratories in Cardiff and Leeds. All blocks were initially sent to the Cardiff laboratory for processing, before being forwarded to Leeds for identical processing. Both laboratories were therefore able to carry out all assay analyses completely independently, representative of the process of analysis from sample receipt, to the reporting of the results to the Clinical Trials Unit.</p>

                <title>Sample processing</title>
                <p>A series of 5 µm thick sections were taken from each block, the first of which was used for H&amp;E staining, to identify the area of greatest tumour density, and the rest made available for DNA extraction and whole section (w/s) immunohistochemistry (IHC). From the residual blocks, tissue microarrays (TMAs) were then created comprising four 0.6 mm tumour tissue cores and one core, if available, of ‘tumour-associated’ normal tissue. In order to reduce tissue use, the TMAs were only prepared once, in Cardiff, and then shipped to Leeds, where sections were cut and used for IHC.</p>

                <p>The spare sections from the resection blocks were marked out for the richest areas of neoplastic cell content, using the corresponding H&amp;E-stained section as a guide, and macrodissected. DNA was extracted in Leeds using the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Skelton House, Manchester, England, UK), and in Cardiff using the manufacturer's standard protocol, on the QIAGEN EZ1 (QIAGEN, Skelton House, Manchester, England, UK).</p>

Pyrosequencing was carried out in each lab using a PyroMark Q96 (QIAGEN, Skelton House, Manchester, England, UK) (see online supplementary appendix 1). A negative water control and a positive control for each assay were included in every sample run. Raw data files were used to generate pyrograms for interpretation by qualified personnel.</p>

                <p>All four immunohistochemical analyses were carried out on a DAKO Autostainer Link 48 (DAKO, Ely, England, UK) using DAKO pre-programmed protocols, available with the Autostainer. Antigen retrieval was performed in the accompanying PT-Link chamber with High pH DAKO Target Retrieval Solution, according to manufacturer's instructions (DAKO, Ely, England, UK). Slides were rinsed with DAKO wash buffer prior to loading into the Autostainer. DAKO ready-to-use antibodies were used for MLH1 (IR079), MSH2 (IR085) and MSH6 (IR086). DAKO PMS2 (M3674) was used at a dilution of 1:40. Sections from the two validation TMAs were stained with each Ab, then corresponding whole sections were also stained in cases where the cores appeared negative or equivocal or for cases where all cores had been lost from the TMA section. Tumours were deemed positive, if any proportion of the tumour nuclei was positively stained, or negative, where all discernible tumour nuclei were negative, in the local presence of positively staining stromal and infiltrating lymphocytic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCLINPATH2015203097F2">figure 2</xref>). Any samples appearing wholly negative with respect to both tumour and stromal components were deemed to be of indeterminate status.</p>

                <p>Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using the DAKO Autostainer Link 48 (DAKO, Ely, England, UK). Antigen retrieval was carried out in the accompanying PT-Link chamber with High pH DAKO Target Retrieval Solution, according to manufacturer's instructions. Slides were rinsed with DAKO wash buffer prior to loading into the Autostainer. DAKO pTEN Ab (M3627) (DAKO, Ely, England, UK) was used at a pre-determined dilution of 1:100. Both validation TMAs were stained, along with all corresponding whole sections. The presence and intensity grade of cytoplasmic staining in the tumour component was noted (0=negative; 1=weak cytoplasmic staining, less intense than the surrounding stroma; 2=moderate cytoplasmic staining, where staining is equal in intensity to the adjacent stromal staining and 3=strong cytoplasmic staining, where staining is stronger in intensity to the adjacent stromal staining) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCLINPATH2015203097F3">figure 3</xref>). For the purposes of randomised stratification of patients, any positive result was reported as ‘no loss’ of pTEN; whereas the negative result was reported as ‘absence’ of pTEN. Three FFPE cell lines (LNCaP, pTEN negative; ZR-75-1, a weak expresser of pTEN and MCF7 which overexpresses pTEN) were used to create a mini control TMA, which was stained along with each section. A suspension was generated from each cell line, which was subsequently spun down, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF), added to 12% Noble agar at a 1:1 ratio, processed and paraffin embedded. Three cores were taken from each and embedded into a new paraffin block to create the mini ‘control TMA’. A section of this was cut onto the same slide as each of the 97 validation samples.</p>

                  <p>According to the design of the FOCUS4 trial, it is planned to carry out an initial screen of the IHC-based biomarkers on TMAs, to identify those tumours which are positive for pTEN, and thus require no further investigation. The corresponding whole sections from tumours which appear negative, or give an equivocal result on the TMAs, will subsequently be stained for pTEN. The two validation TMAs were therefore stained with the pTEN antibody, and the results were compared with those of the corresponding 97 whole sections. In Leeds, there were 80 concordant cases and two discordant cases. It was not possible to compare the remaining 15 tumours because 11 of them were completely missing from the TMA, due to loss from core drop-off and the cores from the remaining four cases contained no tumour cells. In Cardiff, there were 83 concordant cases and six discordant cases. The remaining eight tumours were not comparable because the cores had fallen from the TMA in seven of these, and the final tumour was not assessable on the whole section, due to insufficient tumour tissue.</p>

                  <p>Fourteen resection samples also had the matched biopsy available for a pTEN protein expression comparison. Only 8/14 (57.1%) gave concordant results, with both the biopsy and the resection being positive. In four samples, the biopsy was scored negative, whereas the resection was positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="JCLINPATH2015203097F4">figure 4</xref>). One case showed the reverse of this, while in the final case, the resection was positive, but the biopsy was equivocal, and hence unscorable.</p>

                      <p>Discrepant cases were so labelled, where a result of the whole section staining for a particular case was generated in both laboratories, but these results differed. One sample (V007) was discrepant for all four proteins, and one other case (V442) gave a discrepant result for PMS2 only.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The FOCUS4 clinical trial is designed to provide a further significant step forward on the road to more effective biomarker driven, adaptive trial design in solid tumour oncology, where the opportunity to add putative predictive biomarkers to the current panel will be possible. In order for this type of trial to succeed, there must be complete confidence in the abilities of the laboratories carrying out the biomarker assay procedures. To this end, the rigorous pre-trial analytical validation was meticulously planned and carried out over several months in both laboratories, with 97 anonymised advanced CRC FFPE resection blocks and 14 matched biopsy blocks. It needed to be demonstrated that the samples could be processed and concordant results could be obtained in a timely manner. By transferring the samples between laboratories for processing, this ensured that each site was independently responsible for the total assay procedure from preparation of their own sections to the completion of assay, including interpretation, scoring and reporting of the results, and in transferring these directly to the MRC for collation; this kept each laboratory blinded to the results obtained in the other laboratory.</p>
              <p>There was a very high concordance rate between the pyrosequencing results. Out of 97 resection samples assayed across all mutation hotspots, there were only two samples producing a different outcome, both within <italic>PIK3CA</italic>. It has to be acknowledged that the sensitivity of pyrosequencing lies somewhere between 5% and 25% mutant alleles in a background of WT alleles, so that in cases where low-level mutations are present, they may not always be detected. Tumour heterogeneity is a further complicating factor which could account for the failure to detect a mutation, particularly where a different part of the same FFPE block is sampled for testing<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> as was the case in this validation exercise. It is acknowledged that the in-house pyrosequencing assays have slight variations in the primer and probe sequences. The high concordance rates during this validation, and a previous validation prior to the FOCUS3 trial,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> have convinced us that these differences are non-consequential. During the course of the FOCUS4 trial, it is expected that both laboratories will advance to a Next Generation Sequencing platform, revalidate the changed technique and in doing so, increase the sensitivity of mutation detection to between 1% and 5%.</p>
              <p>The fact that there were only six (6/97, 6.2%) cases discordant between the two laboratories for pTEN, and only five (5/388, 1.3%) discrepancies for the MMR antibodies, was reassuring. Several factors were thought to contribute to the differences observed. These included the amount of necrosis observed within the tumour, and also the presence of excessive levels of mucin. Staining artefacts such as over-counterstaining and ‘edge effect’ were also noted to cause interpretation difficulties. One tumour (V007), which showed discrepant results for each of the five antibodies, was a signet-ring cell cancer. A large proportion of signet-ring cells were found to be bloated with mucin and as a result, had very scant cytoplasm available to show the presence of pTEN staining in a 5-µm thick section. A consensus opinion was agreed for each protein, but it was felt that in future, tumours showing unusual morphology should undergo joint review by both laboratories prior to reporting the results.</p>
              <p>When the 14 matched biopsy samples were stained with the pTEN antibody, it was surprising to see that six of the tumours showed discrepancies between the biopsy and resection. In order to understand this further, an interrogative approach was adopted towards the samples and their processing, initially focused on biopsy material. It transpired that in the five samples where the biopsy was negative or equivocal and the resection specimen positive, that the biopsies had been taken and processed in one hospital, where at the time, acidified formalin-fixation was routinely used, while the resection specimen was taken in another hospital, where neutral buffered formalin was used. From the extensive data gathered for the COIN Trial,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the use of acidified formalin appeared to have ceased in all laboratories in the UK since 2005 because of its deleterious effect on DNA, with formol saline or neutral buffered formalin being adopted widely as less deleterious fixatives.</p>
              <p>Recent work has focused on the poor reproducibility of pTEN IHC scoring<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and indeed within the published literature the quoted rates of pTEN-negative tumours in CRC vary greatly. Here we have rigorously undertaken analysis of this biomarker, including full workup from FFPE blocks in two independent laboratories and following independent scoring, have shown closely adherent results. The addition of cell-line control TMAs to each slide will continue throughout the FOCUS4 trial.</p>
              <p>It has been demonstrated here that two reference laboratories can independently obtain highly concordant biomarker results across a wide panel of assays on a large number of samples. Unfortunately, there was insufficient material remaining at each laboratory to repeat all assays and ascertain the local reproducibility rates for all assays. This exercise has highlighted issues which can potentially make interpretation more difficult, so that should they arise during the course of the FOCUS4 trial, a web-linked protocol is now in place to allow joint discussion between laboratories. It has also been agreed that a continuous inter-laboratory validation will take place for the duration of the trial, with each laboratory supplying three samples on alternate months to the other laboratory for confirmatory testing. Each laboratory will also continue to participate in the UK NEQAS molecular genetic analysis of CRC external quality assurance (EQA) scheme; this currently (as of 2013) includes analyses for <italic>KRAS, NRAS</italic>, <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>. With all these measures in place, we are confident that molecular testing will continue to be delivered with high and exacting standards from these designated testing laboratories. Going forward in personalised medicine trials, we would recommend the use of centralised testing, identical protocols, pre-trial validation of techniques, continuous quality control and independent review of the testing by the trials unit.</p>
