                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There are increasing rates of internalising difficulties, particularly anxiety and depression, being reported in children and young people in England. School-based, universal prevention programmes are thought to be one way of helping tackle such difficulties. This protocol describes a four-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, investigating the effectiveness of three different interventions when compared to usual provision, in English primary and secondary pupils. The primary outcome for Mindfulness and Relaxation interventions is a measure of internalising difficulties, while Strategies for Safety and Wellbeing will be examined in relation to intended help-seeking. In addition to the effectiveness analysis, a process and implementation evaluation and a cost-effectiveness evaluation will be undertaken.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Overall, 160 primary schools and 64 secondary schools will be recruited across England. This corresponds to 17,600 participants. Measures will be collected online at baseline, 3â6 months later, and 9â12âmonths after the commencement of the intervention. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Moreover, a process and implementation evaluation (including a qualitative research component) will explore several aspects of implementation (fidelity, quality, dosage, reach, participant responsiveness, adaptations), social validity (acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility), and their moderating effects on the outcomes of interest, and perceived impact.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial aims to address important questions about whether schoolsâ practices around the promotion of mental wellbeing and the prevention of mental health problems can: (1) be formalised into feasible and effective models of school-based support and (2) whether these practices and their effects can be sustained over time. Given the focus of these interventions on mirroring popular practice in schools and on prioritising approaches that present low-burden, high-acceptability to schools, if proved effective, and cost-effective, the findings will indicate models that are not only empirically tested but also offer high potential for widespread use and, therefore, potentially widespread benefits beyond the life of the trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Well-established estimates in the United Kingdom suggest that one in eight children and young people experience mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and that these may be with associated with costly long-term consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the absence of effective or widespread processes for identifying those who experience mental health problems, or those likely to be at risk of such difficulties in the future, there has been an increasing focus on universal approaches to supporting childrenâs mental health and wellbeing. These universal interventions can act as a means to prevent the emergence of mental health problems and to intervene early in the emergence of any difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Schools are often viewed as a universal point of access to children and young people, offering an important opportunity to embed prevention and early intervention programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A number of reviews point to the effectiveness of school-based mental health programmes for the prevention and early intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], especially for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and behaviour problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While existing evidence makes a good case for the effectiveness of universal school-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], a number of areas require further clarity.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Firstly, with the exception of a small number of UK-based programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the basis for current practice in the UK is often research evidence originating from other countries, predominantly the US, with social and emotional learning (SEL) programmes such as Incredible Years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and PATHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] being highly popular. Other than the Incredible Years programme, which has been rigorously tested in a UK setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], rigorous and consistent evidence for SEL programmesâ effectiveness is sparse. Additionally, there are indications that some programmes do not always translate well when implemented beyond their countries of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Secondly, a scoping review of existing practice indicates a heterogeneous range of mental health support offered in schools, much of which is either novel, not based on tried and tested programmes, or involves a high level of adaptation from existing evidence-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, reasons for adaptation are often logical; these programmes, which have not been designed for the UK school context, frequently require tailoring for suitability and feasibility, which may be beneficial to outcomes. However, such adaptation also carries a risk of significantly âwatered-downâ implementation, which limits impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Three interventions were selected by the Department for Education in England to be developed for the current trial. The basis for selection was that these either: (a) were popular approaches being adopted by schools and, therefore, likely to have high acceptability and feasibility, as well as potential for wider adoption if found to be effective; or (b) showed early promise but currently lacked a robust evidence base, specifically regarding implementation in schools. The interventions were: (1) Mindfulness Practices, (2) Relaxation and (3) Strategies for Safety and Wellbeing, based on the principles of âProtective Behavioursâ(PB). These interventions were piloted in a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] prior to this cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Learning from this resulted in: (a) more activities being provided for each intervention, (b) distinct age-appropriate resources for primary or secondary school teachers to use and deliver and (c) a greater distinction between âmindfulness practicesâ and ârelaxationâ.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Mindfulness Practices</title>
                <p id="Par9">Mental health interventions incorporating mindfulness elements have proven effective in treating and preventing various psychological and physical difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most research that has been conducted thus far included adult samples; however, there is increasing evidence for the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. More specifically, MBI in youth have been shown to significantly increase positive affect, optimism, attention and social-emotional competence while decreasing dysfunctional behaviour and emotion dysregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A number of recent reviews of MBIs in youth have highlighted their impact on cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] including mental health and positive wellbeing, noting that the effects appear to be strongest for emotional problems. Although mindfulness has a rapidly growing evidence base, and a large-scale trial is already taking place in UK secondary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], many of the approaches investigated involve intensive programmes requiring extensive staff training and scheduling in school-based classes. Brief approaches to implementing mindfulness practices could provide a feasible alternative for busy schools.</p>

                <title>Relaxation</title>
                <p id="Par10">Relaxation and mindfulness exercises have long been suggested to incorporate similar underlying processes and thus lead to similar outcomes. However, more recent research has emphasised the significant differences between these two concepts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Relaxation exercises differ from mindfulness exercises in that with the former the individual is asked to focus specifically on relaxation, such as through deep breathing and muscle relaxation, whereas in mindfulness the individual is asked to pay attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way, such as through meditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A study conducted by Jain and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] relating to a relaxation intervention and a mindfulness intervention found that in adults both interventions led to a significant decrease in distress, while positive mood increased. When applied to young people, there is evidence that both mindfulness and relaxation techniques (RT) can reduce emotional difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par11">The effect of RT has been frequently studied in both adults and young people suffering from various acute or chronic medical conditions, such as cancer or asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Research investigating the effects of RT with respect to different psychopathological conditions has been lacking. However, there is consistent evidence for the alleviating effects of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety, stress and depression symptoms in clinical and non-clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and for autogenic training on stress and anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and guided imagery on depression, anxiety and stress in psychiatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">There are few studies investigating the impact of solely RT on childrenâs mental health, with some evidence indicating positive effects on anxiety and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Relaxation also forms a common thread in many school-based interventions aimed at improving internalising symptoms, including school-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Strategies for Safety and Wellbeing (SSW)</title>
                <p id="Par13">The development of SSW stemmed from emerging practice in some UK schools around teaching practical approaches to personal safety, known as âProtective Behavioursâ (PB). The PB model was developed in the US in 1970 as an anti-victim programme for children, adolescents and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The overarching aim of SSW is to increase skills for children around safety, mental health and wellbeing and how to access sources of support. Specifically, pupils are taught to identify (1) what feels safe/unsafe, (2) support networks, (3) coping and help seeking strategies, as well as to (4) recognise and understanding feelings and (5) challenge stigma around mental illness. This is broken down into an 8-week programme. Weeks 1â2 cover the topic âItâs safe to talk about mental healthâ and weeks 3â5 cover âWhat is safety and knowing when you are not safe?â. Week 6 focusses on âSpeaking about safety â who could you speak to?â, week 7 focusses on âStaying safe in friendshipsâ, while week 8 finishes with âSafe ways to manage emotions and network reviewâ. This fits with Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE) guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] in the following ways: pupils should be taught to (1) understand how and when they feel unsafe, (2) identify support networks, (3) identify how and from whom to seek help, (4) identify how to recognise and talk about emotions and (5) challenge stereotypes.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Although it has been observed that PB has been applied to schools in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], there is currently no peer-reviewed evidence for the effectiveness of PB programmes.</p>

A scoping exercise, conducted by the Department for Education in England, concluded that all three should be tested to contribute to the UK evidence base for effective interventions to improve mental health in children and young people.</p>

It is based on the concept of mindfulness as defined by Kabat-Zinn: âpaying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentallyâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and draws on a number of existing mindfulness models including the RAIN approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and the two-component model of mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The Mindfulness intervention consists of mindful breathing exercises and other activities focussed on self-awareness of sensations, emotions and thoughts. The exercises are divided into three types: (1) those focussing on the mind; (2) those focussing on the body; (3) those focussing on the world.</p>
                    <p id="Par71">School staff complete a half-day face-to-face training course delivered by two AFNCCF professionals that focusses on practising mindfulness exercises. A mindfulness manual â either a primary or secondary school-specific version â is provided. Both manuals contain 21 different activities, as well as suggestions for recommended apps and interactive online games. Mindfulness is delivered to school classes in classrooms for around 5 min each school day at a time chosen by the deliverer, from January to April in the first instance, and this is the period in which implementation is monitored. However, schools are encouraged to continue to practice for 1 year.</p>

                    <p id="Par72">This Relaxation intervention was also developed for the trial by the AFNCCF Schools Programme (lead developer: Dr. Rina Bajaj). The intervention consists of relaxation exercises focussing on two main themes: (1) deep breathing and (2) progressive muscle relaxation. School staff complete a half-day face-to-face training course focussing on experiential exercises, delivered by AFNCCF professionals. Manuals containing 20 different activities are provided (primary and secondary school versions). These manuals also include recommendations of apps, videos and interactive online games.</p>
                    <p id="Par73">Similar to the Mindfulness model, relaxation exercises are delivered in classes for around 5 min each school day, at a time chosen by the deliverer. School staff alternate every week between deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation activities. Relaxation is delivered to school classes in classrooms from January to April in the first instance, as this is the period in which implementation is monitored. However, schools are encouraged to continue to practise for 1 year.</p>

                  <p id="Par107">Qualitative implementation and process data will be collected at two time points. The first time point will take place at mid- to late-implementation of each of the interventions. Twelve schools will be recruited from the main sample as qualitative case study schools; one school per intervention in each of the four areas of England (north west, north east, south west, south east). This will not include Usual Practice schools. Case study schools will be recruited via expression of interest, to maximise the likelihood of engagement with the qualitative research, and sampled based on variation in their usual provision around mental health, drawing on data from two items in the first Usual Provision Survey:

                  <p id="Par111">While the case study schools could be selected on multiple bases, these contextual factors are those of particular interest to the trial, in terms of how they could affect the implementation and take-up of the interventions within the schools.</p>
                  <p id="Par112">Face-to-face or telephone interviews will be conducted with two to three members of staff (including a school senior leadership team member and a staff member delivering the intervention) and one to two focus groups will be conducted face-to-face with pupils (with approximately four to five pupils in each focus group) at each school. Pupils will be selected via expression of interest, and up to 10 will be invited to participate due to risk of attrition or pupils declining to take part. Learning from the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] indicated that this sample size would yield a large amount of rich qualitative data, while still being manageable in terms of the research teamâs capacity.</p>
                  <p id="Par113">The interviews/focus groups will be semi-structured, enabling the research team to guide the conversation according to their topics of interest, while at the same time allowing participants to raise issues around these topics that are pertinent to them. All interviews/focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
                  <p id="Par114">The topics that the interviews with staff will cover include:

                  <p id="Par124">A session of the intervention at each school will also be observed by the research team to gather contextual information about what the interventions look like on the ground. Field notes will be taken during the observation on the process of delivery, the layout of the room, and the atmosphere during delivery. Individual pupil or staff responses will not be recorded.</p>
                  <p id="Par125">The second time point will take place approximately 9â12âmonths after Time 1. At Time 2, we will conduct approximately five follow-up visits with five of the schools from Time 1 at which, according to implementation monitoring survey data, the interventions have been particularly well embedded to explore long-term impact and facilitators to (ongoing) implementation from staff and pupil perspectives. This will involve face-to-face or telephone interviews with one to two members of staff and one face-to-face focus group with pupils at each school. We will also explore potential barriers to long-term impact and implementation through a telephone interview with a staff member at approximately three schools at which, again according to implementation monitoring survey data, the interventions have not been particularly well embedded.</p>
                  <p id="Par126">Furthermore, as schools that express interest in taking part as a case study are likely to be the more engaged schools, at the second time point we will also conduct a small number of telephone interviews with staff at schools that have engaged less with the trial in general. This will allow us to gather data on the barriers that they may have experienced to engaging with the trial and could include schools that have dropped out of the trial.</p>

The design for the current trial is a between-school trial. To increase the efficiency of the design, we will use a single set of control schools as a comparator for all three interventions. The schools will be randomised to four groups (Usual Practice, Mindfulness Practices, SSW, Relaxation); around two to three of the schools in each arm will be primary schools and one to three will be secondary schools to accommodate the different numbers of classes and class sizes within each school type.</p>
                <p id="Par130">While cluster effects of emotional distress on school level are usually small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], no data on class-level clustering were available. To our knowledge, so far no study has looked into school-level intra-class correlations (ICCs) of help-seeking. We conducted a pilot study with <italic>N</italic>â=â2289 students nested within 113 classes within 17 schools and we found ICCs of .05 for the SMFQ and of .03 for the GHSQ (with upper borders of bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of .12 for the GHSQ and .13 for the SMFQ). The following sample size calculation is based on an ICC of <italic>Ï</italic>â=â.15, which is still conservative given the estimates found in the pilot (for a significance level of <italic>p</italic>â=â.05 and statistical power of <italic>Î²</italic>â=â.80).</p>
                <p id="Par131">Pre-test values of the outcome measures will be used as predictors of within-school variance. Since pre- and post-tests tend to be correlated, a conservative estimate of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>â=â.20 was used. Since only a small effect due to the intervention is expected, <italic>MDES</italic>â=â.20 was selected as the target effect size. On average, we assume primary schools to have two classes (with <italic>N</italic>â=â25 students each) and secondary schools to have six classes (<italic>N</italic>â=â20 students each). Finally, since the analysis of the primary outcome only compares each active treatment individually against the control arm, no correction of error rates was performed for these pre-planned directed hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par132">Accommodating the setting of a delivery from four different study areas, we aim to recruit 56 schools per arm (40 primary; 16 secondary with six classes each).

An intervention will be evaluated as potentially effective if the point estimate of the coefficient for the dummy variable coding the difference between intervention and control arm indicates a group difference in the hypothesised direction for the outcome and the cluster-bootstrapped 95% confidence interval does not include zero.

Additionally, for examining implementation, we will compare âintervention as deliveredâ from our survey data with âintervention as plannedâ. Where applicable, the latter can be used to determine the proportion of participating schools that can be deemed to have achieved at least a minimum standard of intervention delivery (e.g., âon treatmentâ status). To assess the relationship between implementation variability and outcomes, multi-level modelling will be used, in which we fit the implementation data noted above (or on treatment status derived from said data) as explanatory variables at the school or class level, to assess the extent to which they are predictive of intervention outcomes at the pupil level.</p>
                <p id="Par137">Qualitative interviews and focus group transcripts will be analysed using thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], using the NVivo version 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] data analysis software package. Up to three members of the research team will initially code or assign relevant extracts of the transcripts to broad overarching categories, derived âtop-downâ from the research questions (e.g., suggestions for improvement). The researchers will then break down the data (transcript extracts) coded within these overarching categories into themes and subthemes, derived âbottom-upâ from the data. A fourth member of the research team will then re-code 10â20% of the transcripts using the themes and subthemes derived from the data by the other members of the team. The purpose of the latter step is to help the original researchers to refine and reflect on their themes and subthemes, with the additional researcher suggesting edits or additions where necessary.</p>

              <p id="Par141">Ethics approval for this study was granted from University College London (UCL) Research Ethics Committee (6735/009 and 6735/014). Research data will be processed and stored in line with the General Data Protection Regulation. Schools that express an interest in taking part, and are deemed eligible, will be required to have a member of their senior leadership team sign a Memorandum of Understanding, and data-sharing agreement.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="Par143">Consent for pupils to take part will require different processing depending on the data being collected. For outcome (effectiveness) data, opt-out consent will be used when sending letters to parents/carers of pupils who have been selected by schools to take part. Parents/carers who wish to opt out their children will be asked to return an opt-out form to the research team. A survey password will not be created for pupils that are opted out, and this is flagged to schools in a timely manner to prevent these pupils from taking part in the surveys. GDPR-compliant data deletion processes will be enforced when pupils are opted out after taking part in the surveys.</p>
              <p id="Par144">Pupils whose parents have not opted out of the evaluation will be given the option to assent to take part through reading an online information sheet and ticking an online assent form. Pupils who start the survey can stop and/or opt out at any time. Pupils who do not tick the assent form will not be allowed to complete the survey. All information sheets outline confidentiality procedures for collecting, processing, and storing data. Teachers are asked not to look directly at pupilsâ screens when they are filling out answers. They are also provided with a crib-sheet of the more difficult words in the survey that young people may struggle with, in order for them to assist pupils from the front of the classroom.</p>

              <p id="Par149">For pupils under the age of 16 years, schools will send letters home to pupilsâ parents/guardians, and those that are happy for their young people to take part will be required to sign a consent form. Prior to focus groups taking place, pupils will be required to read an information sheet, and tick an assent form stating that they are happy to take part. Those who do not assent will not take part.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="Par153">AEs, defined as a negative, emotional and behavioural occurrence, or sustained deterioration in a research participant, will be captured as part of the study. This includes serious adverse events (SAEs) which are a threat to life: suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, hospitalisation due to psychiatric of use of substances, death including suicide. Other adverse events: violent behaviour, self-harm, or any other event that an individual feels it is important to report, will also be captured. School safeguarding leads will judge whether they believe the AE is likely related to the intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par154">The ongoing conduct and progress of this study is monitored by an independently chaired Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). On becoming aware of SAEs, the Principal Investigator or Trials Manager will report all SAEs, or AEs which are likely to be related to the intervention or research, to the DMC within two working days. AEs thought to be unlikely related to the intervention or research should be reported within five working days and will be collated and reported quarterly to the DMC. The UCL Research Ethics Committee will also be informed of AEs and SAEs using the same mechanisms. School and research safeguarding protocols will be followed as standard in addition to the reporting and documenting of AEs. The DMC is responsible for making recommendations to the Department for Education regarding the stopping or continuing of the trial.</p>
