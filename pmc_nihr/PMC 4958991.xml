                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Pooled data were examined from two ongoing open-label studies that enrolled patients who completed BLISS-52 or BLISS-76. Patients received belimumab every four weeks plus SoC. SLICC Damage Index (SDI) values were assessed every 48 weeks (study years) following belimumab initiation (baseline). The primary endpoint was change in SDI from baseline at study years 5–6. Incidences of adverse events (AEs) were reported for the entire study period.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population comprised 998 patients. At baseline, 940 (94.2%) were female, mean (SD) age was 38.7 (11.49) years, and disease duration was 6.7 (6.24) years. The mean (SD) SELENA-SLEDAI and SDI scores were 8.2 (4.18) and 0.7 (1.19), respectively; 411 (41.2%) patients had organ damage (SDI = 1: 235 (23.5%); SDI ≥ 2: 176 (17.6%)) prior to belimumab. A total of 427 (42.8%) patients withdrew overall; the most common reasons were patient request (16.8%) and AEs (8.5%).</p>
                  <p>The mean (SD) change in SDI was +0.2 (0.48) at study years 5–6 (<italic>n</italic> = 403); 343 (85.1%) patients had no change from baseline in SDI score (SDI +1: 46 (11.4%), SDI +2: 13 (3.2%), SDI +3: 1 (0.2%)). Of patients without organ damage at baseline, 211/241 (87.6%) had no change in SDI and the mean change (SD) in SDI was +0.2 (0.44). Of patients with organ damage at baseline, 132/162 (81.5%) had no change in SDI and the mean (SD) change in SDI was +0.2 (0.53). The probability of not having a worsening in SDI score was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.91) and 0.75 (0.67, 0.81) in those without and with baseline damage, respectively (post hoc analysis).</p>
                  <p>Drug-related AEs were reported for 433 (43.4%) patients; infections/infestations (282, 28.3%) and gastrointestinal disorders (139, 13.9%) were the most common.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Patients with SLE treated with long-term belimumab plus SoC had a low incidence of organ damage accrual and no unexpected AEs. High-risk patients with pre-existing organ damage also had low accrual, suggesting a favorable effect on future damage development.</p>

              <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition in which long-term damage may accrue over time as a consequence of both active disease and medication toxicities.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index (SDI) is a validated instrument that has been used in observational cohorts and clinical studies to quantify organ damage. Organ damage, measured by the SDI, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> SDI items represent irreversible damage occurring after the diagnosis of SLE,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and items present for at least six months become permanent scores, such that the SDI score cannot decrease.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Longitudinal studies of SLE cohorts have shown that mean SDI scores increase over time and that the majority of patients with SLE accrue organ damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Factors contributing to irreversible damage have been examined in prospective single-clinic cohort studies and multicenter inception cohorts that allow comparison within studies. Factors associated with an increased risk of organ damage include older age at SLE onset, Hispanic and African ancestry race/ethnicity, existing organ damage, chronic inflammation, hypertension, and chronic steroid exposure.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr9-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Patients with damage have consistently been shown to be at risk of accruing additional damage, both in inception and prevalent cohorts.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr12-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There is evidence that the use of antimalarials may potentially have a “protective” role against damage development. Use of antimalarials in patients with SLE has been associated with reduced disease flares, steroid-sparing effects, and favorable effects on a number of metabolic risk factors, with subsequent “protection” against accruing damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>

                <p>This study (201223) pooled data from two ongoing open-label, long-term, continuation studies, BEL112233 (NCT00724867) and BEL112234 (NCT00712933)), that enrolled patients who completed the parent studies BLISS-52 (BEL110752, NCT00424476)<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> or BLISS-76 (BEL110751, NCT00410384)<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203315625119">Figure 1</xref>). BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 patients were randomized to belimumab 1 mg/kg, belimumab 10 mg/kg, or placebo plus SoC for 52 or 76 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Patients who completed the parent studies were invited to participate in a long-term continuation study. Patients who received belimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo in the parent studies were administered belimumab 10 mg/kg in the continuation studies. Approximately one-third of patients received belimumab 1 mg/kg in a parent study and initially received that dose in the continuation studies. Study protocols were amended in March 2011 (BEL112233) and July 2011 (BEL112234), and 1 mg/kg patients were switched to 10 mg/kg. Both belimumab dosage groups were combined for the present analyses.

                <p>Baseline data were recorded prior to the first dose of belimumab (i.e. first belimumab dose in the parent study or first dose in the continuation study for those who previously received placebo). Visit intervals were defined using actual visit dates based on the 52-week SDI assessment in BLISS-52/76 and the 48-week protocol years in BEL112233/BEL112234. As the parent studies differed in length, SDI assessments and adverse event (AE) reporting were aligned by yearly intervals. The last study visit date was defined as the date of study exit (e.g. exit visit, death, withdrawal, last contact). If the patient was ongoing, and had not completed a study exit visit, the last study visit was defined as the data cutoff date (February 14, 2014). One patient had a last contact date recorded preceding the last infusion date; therefore, the last study visit was set as the final infusion date. Assessments following the last study visit were considered as follow-up and were not included.</p>
                <p>All studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All sites obtained ethics committee/institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to enrollment.</p>

As the SDI study year 5–6 analyses included 30 patients whose SDI assessment was completed prior to five full calendar years, a five-year completer subpopulation was analyzed that included all patients who completed an SDI assessment after at least five full calendar years (i.e. after day 1825) of belimumab exposure. A serologically active subpopulation defined as anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)-positive (≥ 30 U/ml) and with low complement (C) 3 or C4 at baseline was also examined.</p>

                <p>Records for 35 patients (MITT) reported at least one decrease in SDI. As decreases in SDI score are not permitted by definition, these patients were excluded from all SDI analyses.</p>
                <p>To eliminate bias in excluding these patients, a post hoc sensitivity analysis (worst observation carried forward, WOCF) was performed in which the highest SDI score for excluded patients was carried forward to subsequent assessments.</p>

In a change from the pre-planned analysis, patients who withdrew/completed prior to their first worsening were censored at their final SDI assessment prior to study exit/data cutoff, instead of last study visit date.

Of those who withdrew, patient request was the most common reason (168; 16.8%). A post hoc review of the data indicated that where provided, the two requests most often cited were a desire to conceive and logistical reasons (data not shown). Other common reasons for withdrawal were AEs (85; 8.5%), other (70; 7.0%), and investigator decision (48; 4.8%). The post hoc sensitivity (MITT) analysis showed that the majority of patients (271/307 (88.3%)) who withdrew and had an SDI assessment on the day of withdrawal had no change from baseline in SDI.

Both of these manifestations may be associated with higher rates of damage accrual and were exclusion criteria for the BLISS studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr16-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr17-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A lower rate of damage accrual may therefore be expected in our population. However, patients with previous renal activity could enroll in the parent studies; approximately 16% of BLISS patients had renal involvement by SELENA-SLEDAI, 10.6% had a British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) renal A or B score, and 20.4% had proteinuria &gt; 0.5 g/24 h,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> though these populations may not be reflective of the MITT population in our long-term extension study.</p>
              <p>There is no control group of patients who received only SoC in our study. Despite this limitation, the study indicates a low rate of organ damage accrual over time. Further, we explored damage accrual in patients with high and low levels of disease activity at baseline (SELENA-SLEDAI score ≤ 9 and ≥ 10) and observed similar rates of damage accrual between these subgroups. This was unexpected, as previous studies have shown that higher disease activity and/or major flares affect the risk of future damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We hypothesize that exposure to belimumab plus SoC may attenuate damage in a damage-prone population. Observational cohorts consistently find significantly greater rates of damage development in patients with pre-existing damage compared with those without.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In contrast, while there was a greater probability of new damage in our patients who had existing damage, the absolute rate of damage was low compared with other cohorts.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis to examine whether patients who withdrew from the studies did so because of organ damage; results were similar to those in the overall MITT population, suggesting that organ damage was not a key reason for study withdrawal.</p>
              <p>Potential mechanisms for the lower rate of damage accrual observed include better overall control of inflammatory disease activity, which could be due to lower steroid doses and reductions in flares. Disease flares contribute to future damage<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and belimumab has been shown in secondary analyses of pooled BLISS study data to reduce severe flares.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Corticosteroid use is also a key driver of future damage,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and several damage items have been shown to be strongly linked to steroid use.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In secondary analyses of pooled BLISS study data, belimumab use resulted in a higher proportion of patients with SLE achieving a stable steroid dose of &lt; 7.5 mg/day prednisone, compared with SoC.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The long-term effect of belimumab on damage accrual may be partly mediated through improving disease stability and/or steroid-sparing effects.</p>
              <p>Our study enabled assessment of long-term safety in a large population continuing on belimumab. In general, the long-term safety was consistent with the known safety profile of belimumab,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the incidence of SAEs of special interest was low and either remained stable or decreased over time. Although the “any-time post-baseline” incidences of opportunistic infections and depression reported here are higher than have been reported previously, in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (0.3% vs 2.3% and 5.8% vs 15.4%, respectively),<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> this reflects the longer duration of the present analysis. When considering each yearly interval separately, the rates are consistent with the shorter-term studies, and the incidences either remain stable or decrease over time.</p>
              <p>There were 85/998 (8.5%) study withdrawals due to AEs, up to data cutoff. In the only other long-term continuation study of belimumab, following a Phase II study that examined safety of belimumab plus SoC over seven years, the rate/100 patient-years of discontinuations because of AEs was 1.9–6.4% over each study year.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, comparison between these studies is limited due to differing study designs and populations. In the long-term Phase II extension study, AEs were measured in rates over calendar-year intervals, and patients were slightly older at study entry (mean: 43 vs 39 years), had a slightly longer disease duration (mean: 8.8 vs 6.7 years), a higher mean SELENA-SLEDAI (9.2 vs 8.2), and a higher percentage had at least one BILAG A or two BILAG B scores (64 vs 46%).</p>
              <p>This study has several strengths and limitations. We studied a large global population of patients with active moderate to severe SLE up to study years 5–6. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the infrequent reports of SDI decreases had little impact on the overall results or conclusions, indicating a low error rate. The entry criteria for the BLISS studies are comparable to a number of other non-renal lupus studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-0961203315625119" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> This provides important data on damage accrual among a subset of patients with lupus with active disease but without recent lupus nephritis and/or CNS involvement. Damage accrual data in lupus have traditionally come from observational cohorts, which include all-comers with disease. We recognize that our studies are ongoing, open-label studies with no placebo (SoC) data for comparison; therefore, results should be interpreted with some caution. Nevertheless, the comparable rates of damage accrual in patients with higher and lower disease activity, and between those with and without pre-existing damage, raise the hypothesis that belimumab plus SoC may help to control disease activity and/or spare corticosteroids, which overall may result in less long-term damage in SLE. It is worth noting that both belimumab dosage exposures were pooled and approximately one-third of patients were initially receiving a lower dose of 1 mg/kg. Finally, the continuation studies were designed to have 48-week years and as such do not align with calendar years. Thus, we presented data using a study year 5–6 window, where the majority of SDI assessments were performed more than five years after patients’ first dose of belimumab, and a five-year completer analysis. Over this long-term period, these safety and damage data retain validity.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, patients with moderate to severe SLE treated with belimumab plus SoC up to study years 5–6 had a low incidence of organ damage accrual, and no new safety issues were identified. Importantly, patients with pre-existing organ damage, who were therefore at higher risk for additional damage, also experienced low overall rates of damage. The hypothesis that belimumab may have beneficial effects on long-term damage development is one that now requires further investigation.</p>
