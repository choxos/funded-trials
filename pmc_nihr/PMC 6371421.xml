                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common lifelong condition affecting 1 in 100 people. ASD affects how a person relates to others and the world around them. Difficulty responding to sensory information (noise, touch, movement, taste, sight) is common, and might include feeling overwhelmed or distressed by loud or constant low-level noise (e.g. in the classroom). Affected children may also show little or no response to these sensory cues. These ‘sensory processing difficulties’ are associated with behaviour and socialisation problems, and affect education, relationships, and participation in daily life. Sensory integration therapy (SIT) is a face-to-face therapy or treatment provided by trained occupational therapists who use play-based sensory-motor activities and the just-right challenge to influence the way the child responds to sensation, reducing distress, and improving motor skills, adaptive responses, concentration, and interaction with others. With limited research into SIT, this protocol describes in detail how the intervention will be defined and evaluated.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This is a two-arm pragmatic individually 1:1 randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot of SIT versus usual care for primary school aged children (aged 4 to 11 years) with ASD and sensory processing difficulties; 216 children will be recruited from multiple sources. Therapy will be delivered in clinics meeting full fidelity criteria for manualised SIT over 26 weeks (face-to-face sessions: two per week for 10 weeks, two per month for 2 months; telephone call: one per month for 2 months). Follow-up assessments will be completed at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Prior to recruitment, therapists will be invited to participate in focus groups/interviews to explore what is delivered as usual care in trial regions; carers will be invited to complete an online survey to map out their experience of services. Following recruitment, carers will be given diaries to record their contact with services. Following intervention, carer and therapist interviews will be completed.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par40">Difficulties in sensory processing (SP) are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with prevalence estimates of 90–95% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Such difficulties relate to hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input and may occur due to impaired regulation of central nervous system arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This hyper-reactivity may be associated with challenging behaviour such as aggression (e.g. to communicate discomfort with noise/touch), or additional “safe space” needs in the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Impaired sensory processing may also be associated with poor motor control impacting on participation in daily life. There is substantial potential burden related to sensory processing difficulties for children with ASD, their carers, and families, and also to the National Health Service (NHS) in terms of treating associated difficulties such as behaviour problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Sensory processing difficulties also pose significant challenges in mainstream education settings. It is plausible that interventions targeting sensory processing difficulties could result in improvements across behavioural, social, and educational dimensions.</p>
              <p id="Par41">A variety of potential play-based therapies have been proposed, with a clear distinction between sensory-based interventions (SBIs) and sensory integration therapy (SIT). SBIs are usually sensory strategies applied to the child or made available to the child for regulation of their reactivity within the home or school environment. Current research into the effectiveness of these SBIs is insufficient to recommend their use, especially if they are not individualised to the child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">SIT is a clinic-based approach that focuses on the therapist-child relationship and uses play-based sensory motor activities designed to improve sensation processing and integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SIT shows some promise as a potential therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but underpinning evidence is limited. In particular, some of the reported evaluations involved interventions either poorly defining criteria for SIT fidelity or indeed not meeting them at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although SIT is currently offered by the NHS in some regions, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reported that available evidence was of low quality and, therefore, insufficient to recommend treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par43">The key aims of this trial are to: 1) evaluate the effectiveness of manualised Ayres Sensory Integration® therapy (SIT) on behavioural problems and adaptive skills, socialisation, carer stress, quality of life, and cost; and 2) describe current usual care (UC) in trial regions and clearly differentiate this from the proposed intervention (SIT).</p>

                <title>Sensory integration therapy</title>
                <p id="Par80">Those allocated to the intervention arm will receive 26 1-h sessions of SIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], delivered over 26 weeks: two sessions per week for 10 weeks (intensive phase), followed by two sessions per month for 2 months, and then one telephone session per month for 2 months (tailoring phase). A detailed assessment (SIT arm only) of sensory processing deficit will be undertaken (Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) along with clinical observations post-randomisation. Following this assessment, the data will be scored to generate an SIPT report and a hypothesis developed as to the nature of the underlying sensory difficulty affecting function. In addition, background history, and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] will be carried out. SIT uses the ‘just right’ challenge—a key principle of the sensory integrative approach—for each child and is therefore able to adjust the therapy to functional ability (as measured at baseline). Carers will be encouraged to observe or actively participate in sessions to facilitate engagement. Between sessions, carers may be given brief written guidelines of specific sensory-motor activities to support their child’s sensory integration. Success of these strategies will be discussed at the following session.</p>
                <p id="Par81">The intervention will be delivered by occupational therapists (typically NHS Band 7) trained in SIT and meeting fidelity criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in regional clinics which also meet fidelity. Initially, clinics will be located in South Wales and Cornwall with the potential for more to be included based on recruitment rates and therapist availability. For the duration of the trial, each intervention therapist will be paired with a mentor—a therapist independent to their clinic who is trained in both sensory integration and mentoring. The mentor will support the therapist in the assessment, interpretation, and intervention of the child. This is a critical part of the trial process that will help provide evidence of meeting intervention fidelity criteria. Mentoring sessions will be approximately 1 h long and provided ideally fortnightly during the first 2 months for the first participant during the intervention delivery phase, tapering to once per month or at least once every 6 weeks thereafter. A private, closed Facebook group for treating therapists to support each other will also be established. This is monitored by the research team to ensure that no personal information is included or discussed. Intervention therapists will provide therapy to participants recruited to the SIT arm only. Those participants receiving any form of usual care (such as provision of sensory strategies and/or face-to-face sessions delivered once per week or less) will be seen by occupational therapists not delivering SIT in the current trial.</p>
                <p id="Par82">After the participant has entered the trial, the therapist must remain free to give alternative treatment to that specified in the protocol, at any stage, if he/she feels it to be in the best interest of the participant.</p>

                <title>Fidelity assessment</title>
                <p id="Par83">Intervention delivery will be assessed using the Ayres Sensory Integration® Intervention Fidelity Measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The first two video recorded face-face sessions delivered to any participant for each therapist will be assessed purely to address any training issues at the earliest opportunity and to ensure ongoing fidelity can be rated. A sample of recorded sessions in the intensive phase will then be rated for fidelity by an independent SIT-trained therapist. Demonstration of adequate fidelity is defined as scoring 80/100 or above on the fidelity measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] across at least 80% of sessions sampled. An ‘effective’ dose for SIT has not yet been established; however, based on clinical experience and currently available evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] attending 13 of a possible 20 sessions delivered during the intensive intervention phase (two-thirds) is likely to indicate sufficient exposure.</p>
                <p id="Par84">Structural fidelity is assessed according to level of therapist training/qualifications, followed by a score of 85/110 for four areas: safety of the environment, detail and content of therapist-held records including therapist-carer collaboration in relation to goals set during therapy, physical space and equipment, and communication with carers.</p>
                <p id="Par85">We plan to identify suitable additional resources to use the video recording to look into fidelity of delivery in more detail. As part of this, we will include specific items to gauge the impact of non-specific therapist effects, using an adapted version of a tool developed for evaluation of psychosocial interventions for individuals with intellectual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par86">Usual care (UC) will be recorded by carers in a diary format. The current standard care pathway is variable across the UK, ranging from minimal contact/no specific treatment targeted at sensory processing, to provision of manualised SIT in some regions. However, within the proposed trial sites, we estimate that usual care will be much less intensive than the 26-week programme detailed above, ranging from some provision of sensory strategies not meeting full fidelity criteria for SIT (and should not occur more frequently than once per week) to no specific treatment. Notes will be kept according to usual policy. Usual care for ASD will also be recorded more generally, including any contact with NHS services (e.g. speech therapy, paediatrics, and CAMHS).</p>
                <p id="Par87">Usual care for the current trial will be assessed and fully defined following a brief pre-recruitment survey of therapists, and discussions (e.g. as interviews or focus groups) with carers and occupational therapists. The potential for contamination, if participants recruited to the UC arm receive enhanced/additional support from clinicians who are aware of their participation in the trial, is acknowledged; thus, there will be an examination whether the UC received differs in any way from the provision mapped out as a result of the scoping focus groups.</p>

The difference in mean costs for the treatment groups will be analysed using regression analysis and bootstrapping. NHS and PSS costs (or societal costs in the secondary analyses) over the 6 months will be regressed on treatment allocation, baseline ABC-I, site, severity of SP difficulty, and baseline costs.

Bootstrapping will be used to estimate a distribution around costs and behavioural outcomes and to estimate the confidence intervals around the ICER. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC), a recommended decision-making approach to dealing with uncertainty, will be generated by plotting these probabilities for a range of values of the ceiling ratio. Sensitivity analysis will be used to explore the sensitivity of the results from using a broader societal perspective (including NHS/PSS costs, education service costs, carer expenses, and lost productivity) than a narrower NHS/PSS perspective preferred by the NICE reference case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

We believe this research will benefit the NHS in terms of providing clear evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of this type of intervention, thereby informing clinical practice for this population. We also strongly believe that children and their families will benefit from receiving treatment informed by a more robust evidence base, whether or not SIT itself is effective. Furthermore, if SIT is effective, the proposed intervention could improve behavioural, functional, social, educational, and well-being outcomes for children and well-being outcomes for family carers. Sub-group analyses will also help to determine which children and families would be most likely to benefit, thereby maximising cost-effective roll-out.</p>
