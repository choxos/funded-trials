                  <p id="Par2">The study aimed to recruit 206 male or female subjects from the secondary care hospital setting across the UK and the Netherlands. Participants who were at least 18 years old, who reported inflammatory sounding joint pain (clinically suspicious arthralgia) and who were found to be positive for serum autoantibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were eligible for enrolment. All study subjects were randomly assigned to receive weekly injections of investigational medicinal product, either abatacept or placebo treatment over the course of a 52-week period. Participants were followed up for a further 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as the time to development of at least three swollen joints or to the fulfilment of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA using swollen but not tender joints, whichever endpoint was met first. In either case, swollen joints were confirmed by ultrasonography. Participants, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were all blinded to group assignment. Clinical assessors and ultrasonographers were also blinded to each other’s assessments for the duration of the study.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">There is limited experience of the design and implementation of trials for the prevention of inflammatory joint diseases. We discuss the rationale behind choice and duration of treatment and the challenges associated with defining the “at risk” state and offer pragmatic solutions in the protocol to enrolling subjects at risk of RA.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par35">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory immune-mediated disease of joints afflicting more than 500,000 subjects in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If not adequately treated, the condition leads to destruction of synovial joints and significant disability. RA is costly to individuals and their families; one third of patients with arthritis stop work within 2 years of onset because of the deterioration in quality of life associated with their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the UK, RA is costly to the economy; the cost is estimated to be in the region of £5 billion per year through direct costs to the National Health Service (NHS) and associated healthcare providers and indirect costs associated with early mortality and loss of productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">The introduction of therapeutic strategies that focus on early, intensive treatment with conventional synthetic and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has transformed the treatment of RA. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach leads to higher proportions of patients achieving periods of sustained clinical remission. This is associated with improved function and slowing or even prevention of joint damage over time. Indeed, intensive “treat-to-target” strategies in patients with very early RA can lead to extended periods of drug-free remission in a subset of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. If the pre-clinical phase of disease could be defined with accuracy, targeting therapy to those at highest risk of developing disease would have the potential to prevent or at the very least delay the onset of RA. Were such an approach to be successful, the disabling symptoms and signs of arthritis and the potential risks of unemployment could be prevented. Furthermore, the development of potentially life-threatening co-morbidities associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and infection, could be substantially reduced.</p>
              <p id="Par37">The combination of serum antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) and joint pain (termed arthralgia), in the absence of clinically detectable synovitis, is considered to most accurately define subjects at high risk of progressing to RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Data from longitudinal observational cohorts indicate that about 40% of high-risk subjects progress to clinically apparent arthritis within 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The combination of IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) and high serum ACPA levels defines those at highest risk; recent unpublished data indicate that the risk of developing disease in subjects with high titre ACPA in the absence of RF may be comparable to that in ACPA<sup>+</sup>RF<sup>+</sup> subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It follows from this that ACPA<sup>+</sup>RF<sup>+</sup> or ACPA<sup>+</sup>RF<sup>−</sup> arthralgia individuals would provide a valid target population for therapeutic intervention aimed at prevention of the syndrome we recognise as RA.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Abatacept is a fusion protein composed of the Fc region of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specifically, abatacept, a first-in-class co-stimulatory blocker, is a biologic DMARD that targets immune reactions early in the chain of events leading to inflammation in RA. It functions by interrupting the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells, attenuating the co-stimulatory signals required for T-cell activation, differentiation and effector responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This results in downstream immunomodulatory effects on other inflammatory cells of the immune system.</p>
              <p id="Par39">In patients with established RA, administration of abatacept is associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the signs and symptoms, physical function and health-related quality of life. It inhibits structural damage in a broad spectrum of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], including those with early or established disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and those with an inadequate response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, disease activity scores (DASs) have been shown to continue to improve beyond 12 months, indicating that the beneficial effects of co-stimulatory blockade not only are sustained but accumulate over extended periods of time.</p>
              <p id="Par40">In the ADJUST study, abatacept demonstrated good efficacy in patients with very early RA, including ACPA<sup>+</sup> patients with undifferentiated arthritis, delaying onset of RA when compared with placebo, and promoting sustained remission rates and reduced radiographic progression, even after therapy is withdrawn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. More recent phase III studies have confirmed the efficacy of weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections of abatacept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Clinical efficacy as measured by American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR 20) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) response was similar between SC abatacept and intravenous (IV) abatacept. Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance suggest that the drug has an acceptable safety profile, particularly with respect to infection.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Although abatacept has a very favourable safety profile, suggesting that this approach might be acceptable to individuals during the pre-clinical phase of RA, there were no published studies at the time of APIPPRA (Arthritis Prevention In the Pre-clinical Phase of RA with Abatacept) study protocol development investigating the acceptability of targeted treatment strategies during the pre-clinical phase of RA. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence the acceptability of this therapeutic approach and the willingness of at-risk subjects to participate in interventional studies will be fundamental to trial methodology and the success of preventative, personalised medicine in the future.</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p id="Par42">The principal objective of the study is to determine whether RA can be prevented or delayed if targeted immunotherapy is administered to subjects in whom autoantibody screening indicates a high risk of developing disease. Specifically, this study will test the hypothesis that the onset of arthritis in an “at risk” group can be prevented or delayed by weekly injections of abatacept for a period of 52 weeks.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par46">The APIPPRA trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind multi-centre trial undertaken at 31 specialist rheumatology clinics across the UK and the Netherlands. The trial was designed to ascertain the effectiveness of abatacept in ACPA<sup>+</sup>RF<sup>+</sup> or ACPA<sup>high</sup>RF<sup>−</sup> subjects with arthralgia who are deemed to be at high risk of developing RA. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive weekly injections of either abatacept or placebo treatment over the course of a 52-week period. This provides the best chance of establishing whether differences observed between the two groups are due to the treatment.</p>

Participants may be recruited by using a range of ethically approved methods, including during rheumatology out-patient clinics, following referral to recruiting centres from other rheumatology out-patient clinics, referrals from general practitioner (GP) practices through the routine referral pathway or patient identification centre (PIC) pathway, or through existing research databases and registries. Subjects may be identified by pre-screening of laboratory results for RF and ACPA.</p>

Placebo is supplied as identically labelled injections containing a sterile saline solution for SC administration. IMP is supplied as kits of four pre-filled syringes with coded label. Given that there are no guidelines or therapies licensed for treating subjects at risk of RA and that close monitoring of signs and symptoms until the development of swollen joints is standard of care, the use of placebo was deemed to be acceptable in this clinical trial.</p>

Abatacept (or placebo) will be injected weekly at the recommended dosage of 125 mg/mL for 52 weeks. Participants are trained to self-administer study drug subcutaneously (for the first injection) using the single-dose pre-filled syringe in accordance with local practices for the administration of biological therapy as part of standard care. Participants will be given 3 months’ worth of study medication at baseline and at each subsequent 3 monthly scheduled visits during the first 12 months. Participants will also be given information about the study drug, such as the Arthritis Research UK (now Versus Arthritis) Drug Information leaflet, in accordance with local practise.

At each scanning visit, designated sonographers will scan a core set of joints including (but not confined to) dorsal views of the wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP 1–3), proximal interphalangeal (PIP 2, 3) and metatarsophalangeal (MTP 2–5) joints. Grading of grayscale and power Doppler measurements will be documented by applying semi-quantitative scales dictated by atlases provided to each participating centre. The scanning process will be scheduled before treatment is initiated for the baseline scan, and within 2 weeks either side of scheduled 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month visits, if scans cannot be accommodated at the same time as scheduled visits.</p>

Ultrasound assessments and scores will be added to the electronic case report form upon completion of the imaging study and scores will be blinded to the supervising PI or clinical assessor. Anonymised copies of images will be either stored on CDs and securely mailed or sent electronically to a secure email address in a central unit so that scores can be reviewed to ensure consistency of assessments across centres.</p>

Screening assessment data will be entered by sites onto a web-based InferMed MACRO Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system hosted on a dedicated secure website by King’s College London, using only the participant’s initials and date of birth as identifiers (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The EDC system will automatically assign a unique participant identification number (PIN) to each participant as they are registered onto the EDC system. Participants who consent to screening but who are subsequently found to be ineligible will also be recorded in the EDC system for CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) reporting purposes. These procedures will operate in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP), meeting the requirements of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par138">Using time to development of arthritis as the primary outcome, or development of RA within 24 months of follow-up, according to 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria, a total of 52 study subjects need to present with this endpoint from 206 randomly assigned, based on the following information. It is conservatively anticipated that 40% of participants on placebo will develop arthritis. A sample size of 172 subjects would be needed to provide 80% power to detect a 50% relative reduction to 20% in the abatacept arm (a hazard ratio of 0.437) on the basis of a two-sided log-rank test at the 5% level of significance without loss to follow-up of any of the required 52 events. Therefore, 206 subjects (103 per arm) will be randomly assigned to allow for loss of events due to dropout, applying a conservative 20% inflation for dropout.</p>
                  <p id="Par139">Similar effect sizes are detectable for binary outcomes and for other time-to-event and proportion outcomes such as the development of RA according to ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria alone. For continuous secondary outcomes, such as DAS measures, a medium effect size difference in means (of size 0.5 of a standard deviation, or SD) between the arms, based on the two-sided unpaired <italic>t</italic> test at the 5% significance level, can be detected with 85% to 90% power if 146 to 172 subjects are followed up. In view of the number of required secondary outcomes, with 172 participants followed up, there is also 80% power to detect medium-sized effects in secondary outcomes (0.52 of a SD) using a secondly applied significance level of 1%. Analyses incorporating baseline adjustment or repeated measures data (or both) will provide increased precision.</p>
                  <p id="Par140">In view of the large number of secondary outcomes and the fact that the sample size was not set to detect powered effects specifically on the scale of these secondary measures, the use of a 1% level of significance goes only partway towards addressing the fact that multiple testing increases the chance that significant secondary findings are false. The results from secondary outcome analyses will be interpreted cautiously and in relation to the estimated confidence limits on the actual scale of the measures. Significance tests will be used sparingly and restricted where possible to address the stated hypotheses. Results that are significant in isolation will be interpreted less strongly than the set of results that are mutually supportive or that support the corresponding primary outcome or that are supported in previous research findings.</p>

                  <p id="Par148">The primary analysis approach will be an intention-to-treat (ITT) strategy, including sensitivity analysis for missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], sensitivity analysis for low compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and sensitivity analysis for use of forbidden rescue medication or potential informative dropout (described in the detailed statistical analysis plan).</p>
                  <p id="Par149">For each time-to-event outcome, including the primary outcome, Kaplan–Meier survival curves will be estimated. A Cox stratified proportional hazards regression model, accounting for the randomisation stratifiers in the form of nominal categorical variables, will be used to compare randomised arms and obtain an estimated hazard ratio for the treatment effect with 95% confidence interval. Participant follow-up is on a three-monthly basis, and there will be additional monthly phone calls when participants are able to additionally report on their progress. Days will be the unit of time within the model in order to fully capture the inevitable variation in the time from baseline to monthly contacts and to ascertained outcome events. Each participant who drops out will be included in the analysis and will be assumed not to have the event and be censored at the point of dropout. Time will also be censored for those reaching the 24-month follow-up without an event. Those with an event will not contribute any further time after the event. For the primary outcome, sensitivity analysis will be carried out. This includes an analysis assuming that those who have dropped out for reasons connected with disease severity are alternatively deemed to have had the event and an analysis assuming this alternative for those having experienced two affected joints.</p>
                  <p id="Par150">For each binary outcome, a stratified difference in proportions using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method will be used to compare arms accounting for the randomisation stratifiers in their nominal categorical form. For each continuous outcome, including DAS28, differences in the mean of the outcome between arms will be estimated by using a linear mixed effects regression model of the repeated measures of the outcome across follow-up. ‘Visit’ will be included in the model as a continuous covariate with full polynomial terms equivalent to including ‘Visit’ as a categorical factor. Outcome data will be included from the regular visits and from times of measurement, including at ultrasound visits. The model will have a heterogeneous variance first-order autoregressive covariance structure, where measurements at the non-regular visits are included in the variance part of the model at the nearest visit and are included in the mean part of the model in proportion to how the measurement was timed between two visits. The ‘visit’ covariate will be located with an origin at 24 months, so that the model with the interactions of the ‘time’ terms with the other included main effect covariates of study arm, the randomisation stratifiers, and the baseline of the outcome and its missing indicator will directly provide the estimate of the study arm effect and its standard error. The missing indicator method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] will be used to enable those participants having any outcome data, but with missing baseline data, to contribute to the estimate.</p>
                  <p id="Par151">Descriptive statistics will be reported for measures of acceptability, feasibility and safety. Percentage measures will be reported with exact 95% confidence intervals. There is no plan to have stopping rules. It is anticipated that the data monitoring committee (DMC) will request interim data on safety and will advise on further data required for monitoring and on trial statistician blinding status. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed from the study protocol prior to the availability of follow-up data for approval by the independent trial steering committee (TSC). The primary analysis will follow the ITT principle; that is, participants will be analysed in the groups to which they were randomly assigned irrespective of treatment received, using all available follow-up data from all randomly assigned participants, with a per-protocol analysis of compliers only, as defined in the statistical analysis plan. Alterations to the statistical analysis plan will require re-approval from the TSC.</p>

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p id="Par157">This study protocol describes a secondary prevention strategy for a common immune-mediated inflammatory disease targeting a phase of the disease process for which there is currently no recognised treatment. The trial will recruit one of the largest populations of “at risk” subjects to a randomised clinical trial described to date.</p>
                <p id="Par158">The APIPPRA study, designed by clinicians, experienced trialists and patients, is unusual in several respects. Rather than testing the acceptability and efficacy of an unlicensed IMP in a population of patients with established disease, this study will explore the effects of a licensed biologic DMARD in a population of otherwise healthy individuals deemed to be at risk of developing RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. When the study was first conceived, the phenotype of at-risk subjects was only beginning to emerge. In 2012, a EULAR working group published recommendations describing the natural history of RA, highlighting how each phase of the disease corresponded to distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These recommendations were informed in part by longitudinal observational studies of at-risk subjects. These and many other studies have been pivotal to stratifying those at highest risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], in whom therapeutic intervention is considered to be appropriate, and have provided a framework for estimating progression rates and for computing sample size calculations for our study.</p>
                <p id="Par159">The armamentarium for treating established RA has grown substantially over the last two decades, and this, together with intensive, target-driven treatment strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], has had a major impact on disease outcomes; remission rates have approached 40% within 6 months of commencing therapy. There is growing appreciation, however, that the efficacy of interventions may depend on the specific phase of the disease (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). For example, it remains to be determined whether targeting inflammatory cytokines during the pre-clinical phase of RA at a time when the inflammatory burden of disease is minimal would be as beneficial as immunomodulatory drugs. Clinical trials of corticosteroids, for example, have not demonstrated durable clinical outcomes in the at-risk population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Co-stimulatory blockade with abatacept targets one of the earliest phases of the disease process—attenuating <italic>de novo</italic> activation of self-reactive T cells by antigen-presenting cells. Abatacept has proven efficacy in early and established RA, but the drug has never been tested in subjects prior to the onset of clinically apparent arthritis. Nonetheless, the presence of disease-associated autoantibodies in serum indicates that the autoimmune process has already started and so we hypothesise that interrupting these immune reactions with abatacept is a biologically plausible approach. Furthermore, there are currently no other licensed therapies available with a comparable safety profile that target adaptive immunity. Finally, the duration of IMP exposure used in the APIPPRA study is largely empirical. Clinical trials of abatacept in patients with recent-onset type I diabetes, however, have documented durable outcomes beyond the period of therapy, suggesting that immune modulation might be more profound, or sustained, if used at the earliest detectable point in the disease course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Whether co-stimulatory blockade induces immunological tolerance, on the other hand, requires further investigation.</p>
                <p id="Par160">The primary endpoint of the APIPPRA trial is the time to the development of clinically swollen joints or fulfilment of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA, whichever endpoint is met first. Three swollen joints were chosen for the first primary outcome since this was the median number of swollen joints identified from cohorts of at-risk subjects at the time of development of clinically apparent arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In routine practice, this is very often the point in the disease course when physicians see patients with inflammatory arthritis for the first time. The validity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA is underpinned by an intention to treat with disease-modifying drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and so including these criteria as a co-primary outcome (by achieving a score of at least 6) reduces the risk of exposing study subjects to placebo, or to IMP that has proven inadequate to suppress signs and symptoms, at a time when standard therapy for new-onset RA would be deemed appropriate by the supervising physician. Clinical assessments are notoriously subjective, especially when inflammatory joint disease is in the very earliest stages. To define primary endpoints with precision, we opted to confirm the presence of synovitis in clinically swollen joints by ultrasonography. For these imaging assessments and for the duration of the study, clinical assessors and ultrasonographers are blinded to each other’s joint scores to limit bias. For consistency of scoring, all ultrasonographers undergo study-specific training and have access to a reference atlas of images for all joints to be assessed.</p>
                <p id="Par161">A key outcome of the APIPPRA study will be to determine whether intervention at this phase of the disease is considered to be acceptable to the high-risk subject. To this end, we have included as part of study assessments questionnaires that probe in more detail people’s perception of risk. We anticipate that the APIPPRA study will allow us to better define the at-risk state on the basis of data we acquire from questionnaires that probe deeper into clinical phenotypes, from the monitoring of images of symptomatic joints by ultrasound over time, and from immune phenotypes acquired from analysis of biological samples. This information then can be exploited in future studies to identify those most likely to progress over pre-defined time periods, on the one hand, while minimising exposure of individuals to an intervention they may never need.</p>
