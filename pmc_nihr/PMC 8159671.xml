                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Patient experience of nursing care is correlated with safety, clinical effectiveness, care quality, treatment outcomes and service use. Effective nursing care includes actions to develop nurseâ€“patient relationships and deliver physical and psychosocial care to patients. The high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus compromises nursing care. No evidence-based nursing guidelines exist for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, leading to potential variations in patient experience, outcomes, quality and costs.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>we aim to recruit 840 in-patient participants treated for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus from 14 UK hospitals, to a cluster randomised controlled trial, with embedded process and economic evaluations, of care as usual and a fundamental nursing care protocol addressing specific areas of physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care where potential variation may occur, compared with care as usual. Our coprimary outcomes are patient-reported experience (Quality from the Patientsâ€™ Perspective; Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaire); secondary outcomes include care quality (pressure injuries, falls, medication errors); functional ability (Barthell Index); treatment outcomes (WHO Clinical Progression Scale); depression Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), anxiety General Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2), health utility (EQ5D) and nurse-reported outcomes (Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals). For our primary analysis, we will use a standard generalised linear mixed-effect model adjusting for ethnicity of the patient sample and research intensity at cluster level. We will also undertake a planned subgroup analysis to compare the impact of patient-level ethnicity on our primary and secondary outcomes and will undertake process and economic evaluations.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Patient experience of nursing care is correlated with safety, clinical effectiveness, care quality, treatment outcomes including mortality and overall service use.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â€“7</xref> Nursing care is a key determinant of patient experience<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and satisfaction.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Effective nursing care includes the establishment of compassionate nurseâ€“patient relationships known as â€˜relational nursing careâ€™ in order to facilitate the physical and psychosocial care work undertaken by nurses to meet the fundamental care needs of patients such as nutrition, hydration, skin integrity, personal care, mobility, hygiene, breathing, elimination and mental well-being.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p>
              <p>Measuring patient experience is analogous to collecting a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in that both are â€˜<italic>a measurement based on a report that comes directly from the patient (ie, study subject</italic>)â€™.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, whereas a PROM captures â€˜<italic>the status of a patientâ€™s health condition without amendment or interpretation of the patientâ€™s response by a clinician or anyone elseâ€™</italic>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a patient-reported <italic>experience</italic> measure (PREM) is a measure of a patientâ€™s perception of their personal experience of the healthcare they have received.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Two PREMs for evaluating patientsâ€™ experiences of nursing have been developed and tested; the Relational Aspects of Care Questionnaireâ€”RACQ)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 16</xref> and the Quality from the patientâ€™s perspectiveâ€”QPP.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref></p>
              <p>The combination of COVID-19 symptoms and high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses unique challenges for physical, psychosocial and relational nursing care. Previously, the 2003 SARS outbreak demonstrated that nursesâ€™ ability to provide compassionate fundamental care was compromised: â€˜<italic>The establishment/maintenance of therapeutic nurse-client relationship required additional time given the barriers of mask, gloves and gowns</italic>. p4<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> â€˜<italic>Restrictions on visitors were difficult for staff because family members are usually involved in the social, psychological and, to some extent, physical care of patientsâ€™</italic>. p6<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> â€˜<italic>Interaction time decreased, and patients began to feel more abandonedâ€™</italic>. p28<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>During the development of our trial protocol described below, we found no international evidence-based guidelines for nursing hospitalised patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the majority of whom are not invasively mechanically ventilated. This leads to the potential for variations in patient experience, treatment outcomes, care quality and costs, as reported by nurses who responded to our survey, also described below. Although individual nurses, teams and organisations reported rapidly adapting their procedures to nurse these patients, compared with usual nursing care, we as yet do not know how to optimise nursing care for the specific challenges of nursing patients with COVID-19, including mitigating the impact of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), nor how effective these adaptations are in terms of these important outcomes.</p>
              <p>Between July and October 2020, we developed a clinical nursing protocol. We undertook a rapid review<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> of published literature to identify the evidence for the effectiveness of, and barriers to, fundamental nursing care procedures in patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or other conditions requiring isolation, in terms of overall patient experience, care quality, functional ability and treatment outcomesâ€”PROSPERO registration number: CRD4202020091.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We also ran a UK-wide survey of nurses and nonregistered care staff working with hospitalised patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus who were not invasively ventilated to identify respondentsâ€™ views on â€˜missed careâ€™,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> barriers to care and innovation strategies respondents had adapted to meet the fundamental care needs of such patient. We obtained research governance approval from the Health Research Authority (IRAS project ID: 287288, protocol number 1920/31) and ethical approval from the University of Exeter research ethics committee (no: 20/07/256) for this survey. We then convened three consensus development panels<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26â€“28</xref> of nurses, and patients with experience of hospitalisation with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to agree the content and design of the clinical nursing protocol. We will report the results of our systematic review and survey elsewhere.</p>
              <p>In the COVID-NURSE trial, our objectives are: (a) to compare care as usual and an evidence-based nursing protocol for patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus against care as usual, in terms of patientsâ€™ reported experience of transactional and relational nursing care, care quality, treatment outcomes and costs and (b) to compare the effects of using the clinical protocol on nursesâ€™ moral distress</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>We will undertake a cluster randomised controlled superiority trial<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> with embedded iterative process<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and economic evaluations<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> between 02 November 2020 and 18 October 2021). Our initial funded, approved and registered design was a rapid-cycle cluster randomised controlled trial<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> with three review â€˜wavesâ€™. Like adaptive trial designs, rapid cycle trials embed <italic>a priori</italic> opportunities into trial designs to enable review and minor adaptions to interventions between waves. We also planned to pair match 18 trial sites according to two variables with a potential impact on outcomes: (1) ethnicity, where being of black, Asian and minority ethnicity (BAME) increases the risk of SARS-COV-2 infection compared with white individuals and where people of Asian ethnicity may be at higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and (2) research intensity which is associated with improved hospital outcomes.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We planned to classify ethnicity according to the latest census data for the local authority in which a hospital is located (low (&lt;68%) vs medium (68% to 74%) vs high (&gt;74%) non-BAME categories based around an overall mean of 71% non-BAME admissions. We planned to classify research intensity according to two categories: research intensive versus not research intensive, where research intensive is defined as â‰¥0.1 unique recruiting studies in the 2019â€“2020 Q4 open data from National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) divided by number of inpatient elective admissions in Januaryâ€“March 2020, and nonresearch intensive is &lt;0.1.</p>
                <p>Since submitting this protocol for peer review by this journal, experience enrolling wave 1 sites during Octoberâ€“January 2021 taught us that our ideal situation is subjected to considerable stress as sites adapt to a rapidly changing situation on the ground, facing significant clinical and research pressures. Although we successfully recruited three pairs (six sites) of sites matched as above for our planned first wave during Octoberâ€“December 2020, operational difficulties caused by (a) the trial not being prioritised for National Health Service (NHS) research infrastructure resources and (b) the impact of the second wave of the SARS-COV-2 virus on nursing sickness levels, led to very significant delays to site opening. Our six wave one sites were unable to start data collection concurrently, delaying our planned wave 1 review. Furthermore, we recruited several other sites for waves 2 and 3 for which we could not find a match on the variables listed above. These issues threatened to prevent us from recruiting to time and target within the funded period (July 2020â€“April 2021). Therefore, in order for the trial to recruit sufficient sites and participants and for us to retain our ability to review and make minor amendments to the intervention in response to process data on fidelity and acceptability, we amended the design to a simple cluster randomised trial, with an embedded iterative process evaluation. As a consequence, as part of the statistical analysis plan, we will also adjust for ethnicity of the patient sample at cluster level and, where patient outcomes are tested, at patient level rather than prerandomisation. Finally, we revised our sample size calculations, see below and obtained additional funding to continue the trial for a further 6 months from the previous planned end date of 18 April 2021. We began data collection on 18 January 2021 and plan to continue until the end of August 2021.</p>

                  <p>In order to preserve intervention blinding across trial control sites, we have not included the full clinical guideline here. To do so would potentially unblind nurses working in control cluster sites. Although it is an ethical principle to make a full intervention protocol available for peer and reader scrutiny, there is a competing and equal ethical principle to preserve control cluster integrity and prevent contamination of control sites. This ensures that all participants in a trial contribute their data to a study that is neither compromised nor subjected to significant potential biases. Trials with compromised blinding are often rejected in systematic reviews or lead to uncertain conclusions. Below is a summary, therefore. However, we commit to making all written and online materials available to the scientific and clinical community free of charge at the conclusion of the trial, to include a free to access Massive Online Open Course supporting the intervention. In the interim, we will refuse no reasonable request to view our guideline, having assured ourselves that a request will not compromise intervention blinding.</p>
                  <p>The protocol consists of four elements adapted from the methods used successfully in a previous cluster randomised controlled trial to significantly increase handwashing by nurses and care staff<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>: a guideline, trigger reminder posters, staff education programme and leadership from ward managers and senior nurses.</p>
                  <p>The clinical guideline consists of 26 potential strategies that can be used by nurses to address barriers to physical, relational and psychosocial nursing care identified in our survey and systematic review. In our survey,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> eight barriers were ranked within the top five in at least one component of the three physical, relational and psychosocial care areas. These were wearing PPE, the severity of patientsâ€™ conditions, inability to take items in and out of isolation rooms without donning and doffing PPE, lack of time to spend with patients, lack of presence from specialised services, for example, physiotherapists, lack of knowledge about COVID-19, insufficient stock and reluctance to spend time with patients for fear of catching the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
                  <p>From this data, we grouped the guideline strategies thematically into actions which address: (a) communication with patients, with patientsâ€™ significant others, between patients and their significant others, between nurses and between nurses and other members of the care team, (b) the organisation of fundamental nursing care activities, (c) addressing the values of patients and their significant others, (d) delivering specific fundamental nursing care interventions, (e) identifying and responding to the mental health and well-being needs of patientsâ€™ and their significant others.</p>
                  <p>The trigger posters contain key information on these same strategies to remind nurses to use them. The online educational resource includes video testimony from patients, carers, nurses and scientists about these same care activities and is hosted on the Open Universityâ€™s â€˜FutureLearnâ€™ platform.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Finally, the guideline includes advice to managers on organising care teams, educating and supporting members of their nursing teams, information on this also delivered via the â€˜FutureLearnâ€™ platform.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>
                  <p>We will monitor clinical protocol fidelity and acceptability as part of our process evaluation and modify our guideline, educational and leadership strategies iteratively, making minor adjustments to these elements according to findings from our process evaluation quantitative and qualitative data. We will embed any changes to the protocol in the subsequent experimental intervention sites.</p>

                <title>Target sample size</title>
                <p>Using published formulae by Hayes and Moulton,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> we calculated our patient participant sample size based on an estimate of the minimum clinically important difference for the QPP of 0.2 and the typical within-unit standard deviation (0.6), supplied by the measure developers and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.02. We have examined a number of potential scenarios, taking into account different cluster sizes and different between-cluster SD values informed by between-country differences on measures, estimated to provide 90% and 80% power. Based on conversations about feasibility with NHS clinical leaders, with a cluster size of 60 the trial would generate over 80% power with six clusters per arm and 90% power with seven clusters in each arm. However, because power calculations in cluster trials with a small number of clusters can be especially sensitive to the approximation used for df, we used a range of alternative approaches (no small sample adjustment, Satterthwaite approximation and Kenward-Rogers approximation; cluster-level linear regression) to explore the robustness of the sample size calculations. While these tended to estimate reduced power at each number of clusters compared with a formula-based power calculation, an estimate of 14 clusters (7 per arm) generated power of greater than 80% in every case. This number of clusters is fairly robust to number of patients per cluster. Even assuming under-recruitment leading to 50 patients per site, power is maintained at greater than 80%. Therefore, we will aim to recruit 840 patient participants. Although we have not powered the sample size on nurse participant outcomes, in consultation with clinical colleagues in our investigator and advisory groups, we anticipate that around 50 registered nurses and healthcare support workers will be involved in the direct care of these patient participants leading to a recruitment target of 700 registered nurse and nursing care worker participants, including student nurses.</p>

              <p>The strengths of this study include that it is the first randomised controlled trial of a fundamental care clinical nursing protocol for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the intervention relates specifically to these patients admitted to inpatient wards who are not invasively ventilated. Our intervention programme theory will enable generalisation of our findings to other environments such as care homes, patients with other conditions requiring isolation and global health systems. In terms of limitations, the trial coprimary outcomes require patient participants to have capacity to consent and report their experience of care, and, therefore, we will be unable to collect and report data from patients who lack this capacity. In common with other cluster randomised controlled trials of behaviour change interventions, we are unable to blind nurses, participants or data collectors to trial arm allocation.</p>
              <p>Our research aligns with the WHO COVID-19 R&amp;D Roadmap priorities and research gaps,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> viz: â€˜to determine optimal clinical practice strategies to improve the processes of careâ€™. It includes â€˜rapid approaches to capture healthcare worker views (surveys, interviews)â€™ and a rapid ethnograph(y) in healthcareâ€™.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> It will, therefore, provide guidance to nurses attempting to overcome significant barriers to providing fundamental physical, relational and psychosocial care to patients, specifically those with the SARS-CoV-2 virus not invasively ventilated but with a generalisable programme theory suitable for adaptation to other care environments, other pandemics and other nations globally.</p>
