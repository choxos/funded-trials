                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Dupuytren’s contracture is a fibro-proliferative disease of the hands affecting over 2 million UK adults, particularly the white, male population. Surgery is the traditional treatment; however, recent studies have indicated that an alternative to surgery—collagenase clostridium histolyticum (collagenase)—is better than a placebo in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture. There is however no robust randomised controlled trial that provides a definitive answer on the clinical effectiveness of collagenase compared with limited fasciectomy surgery. Dupuytren’s intervention surgery vs collagenase trial (DISC) trial was therefore designed to fill this evidence gap.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The DISC trial is a multi-centre pragmatic two-arm parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assigned 1:1 to receive either collagenase injection or surgery (limited fasciectomy).</p>
                  <p id="Par3">We aim to recruit 710 adult participants with Dupuytren’s contracture. Potential participants will be identified in primary and secondary care, screened by a delegated clinician and if eligible and consenting, baseline data will be collected and randomisation completed.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The primary outcome will be the self-reported patient evaluation measure assessed 1 year after treatment. Secondary outcome measures include the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main Scale, the Michigan Hand Questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L, resource use, further procedures, complications, recurrence, total active movement and extension deficit, and time to return to function. Given the limited evidence comparing recurrence rates following collagenase injection and limited fasciectomy, and the importance of a return to function as soon as possible for patients, the associated measures for each will be prioritised to allow treatment effectiveness in the context of these key elements to be assessed.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of treatments, and a qualitative sub-study will assess participants’ experiences and preferences of the treatments.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par43">Dupuytren’s contracture is a fibro-proliferative disease, common in the White, male population, affecting over two million UK adults. The contracture forms nodules and cords at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, drawing down the finger into a flexed position. This results in an inability to straighten the finger, which impacts on a patient’s quality of life.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Surgical correction of the contracture, by dissecting the cords and removing them (limited fasciectomy), is the standard treatment in the UK and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over 17,000 of such operations occur in England each year, resulting in costs to the NHS of more than £60 million per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients may experience infection, delayed healing, nerve damage, pain, stiffness and recurrence in addition to more serious complications (e.g. vascular compromise and complex regional pain syndrome) which may delay recovery and impair function.</p>
                <p id="Par45">An alternative approved treatment for Dupuytren’s contracture is the dissolution of the cord by injecting an enzyme, collagenase <italic>clostridium histolyticum</italic> (collagenase), followed by manually snapping the weakened cord to correct the contracture. Collagenase was registered for use in the USA in 2010 and continues to be used frequently. European registration was completed in 2011; however, deregistration in Europe occurred in March 2020 due to commercial, rather than safety or efficacy, considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patient recovery may be delayed while short-term side effects (e.g. swelling, pain, skin splits) resolve and no long-term systemic effects have been identified. Tendon rupture however is a significant but uncommon complication which may require surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients treated may recover function and undertake routine tasks more quickly with collagenase injection than with surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">A further potential benefit of collagenase injection, over limited fasciectomy, is that the procedure can be conducted within a clinic setting by a variety of trained clinicians. Although patients do need to attend additional clinic visits to complete the procedure, they do not need to wait for and subsequently undergo surgery, thus releasing surgical capacity within the healthcare setting.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Initial clinical effectiveness studies comparing collagenase with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and a systematic review in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] indicated that collagenase is better than placebo, particularly for contractures affecting the MCP joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Observational data on recurrence of Dupuytren’s contracture (a change in extension deficit of 6° between 3 and 6 months, or 20° from 3 months to 1 year post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) suggest that it is higher following collagenase treatment than surgery 3 years after treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Current evidence of the cost-effectiveness of collagenase and surgical correction is based on small retrospective studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and so conclusions are limited.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Despite the existing available evidence, there is no robust randomised controlled trial evidence available on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of collagenase compared with limited fasciectomy surgery. There is also currently no robust evidence on the comparative recurrence rates of Dupuytren’s contracture following treatment with collagenase compared with limited fasciectomy surgery. A sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial is required to fill this evidence gap. Therefore, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned a full-scale RCT to provide a definitive answer on the effectiveness of these treatment options.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Overall, collagenase injections would have to not be inferior to limited fasciectomy surgery to permit recommendation for general use. The Dupuytren’s Interventions Surgery vs Collagenase (DISC) trial was designed as a pragmatic multi-centre, randomised controlled, non-inferiority, cost-effectiveness trial comparing injections of collagenase into the cord to surgical correction in the treatment of moderate Dupuytren’s contracture in adult patients.</p>

                  <p id="Par79">Collagenase injection (intervention) and limited fasciectomy (control) were identified as comparators by the UK National Institute of Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme as part of a commissioned call (15/102) to assess collagenase as a treatment for Dupuytren’s contracture.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">The justification for the choice of these two comparators was that the effectiveness of collagenase compared to placebo had been investigated in randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; however, its performance compared to established treatments had not been rigorously tested.</p>
                  <p id="Par81">Limited fasciectomy surgery is the standard treatment for Dupuytren’s contracture in the UK and Europe and hence was selected as the comparator.</p>

                  <p id="Par83">Separate cords can be injected (intervention) or operated on (control) at the same treatment visit; however, a reference cord (i.e. predominant) must be identified prior to randomisation, with follow-up assessments (e.g. recurrence, further procedures etc.) being based primarily on this cord.</p>

One will evaluate the effectiveness of a thank you card on participant retention; the other the effectiveness of a festive greetings card on participant retention. The inclusion of these SWATs was not planned at the outset of the trial, and therefore, due to the timing of identification and implementation (thank you cards decision December 2018, decision July 2019, implementation May 2019; festive greetings card implemented December 2019), it will not be possible to utilise a factorial design and so each will be handled as a separate SWAT.</p>
                    <p id="Par112">In the first SWAT, participants will be allocated to either receive a thank you card at 9 months post-randomisation or to not receive a thank you card. In the second SWAT, participants will be allocated to receive a festive greetings card or to not receive a card.</p>
                    <p id="Par113">All participants randomised into the main DISC Trial and who remain as fully participating (i.e. have not fully withdrawn, withdrawn from postal follow-up or have died) will be eligible and randomised for each of the two SWATs. The exception will be DISC participants due to receive a thank you card in December 2019 who will be excluded from the festive greeting card SWAT.</p>
                    <p id="Par114">The primary outcome of both embedded trials will be the difference in retention rate between those who receive the card, and those who do not. The cost per participant retained will serve as a secondary outcome for both SWATs. The thank you card SWAT will also assess the completeness of outcome data, and the Christmas card SWAT will assess time since intervention and response rate.</p>

                    <p id="Par116">An effective sample size of 568 participants (284 per arm) is required to obtain 90% power to assess non-inferiority of collagenase based on the upper limit of a two-sided 95% confidence interval (equivalent to a one-sided 97.5% CI) for the treatment difference (collagenase - surgery) at 1-year post-treatment, assuming a non-inferiority margin of six points and a standard deviation of 22 points. Assuming 20% attrition at the 1-year follow-up, the total target sample size is 710. The effective sample size of 568 is based on a (one-sided) independent samples <italic>t</italic> test of size 2.5%, neglecting information provided by informative baseline covariates (reference joint and baseline PEM score) and repeated measurements of the PEM.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par143">A detailed analysis plan will be agreed upon with the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee prior to the end of recruitment. Any subsequent amendments will be clearly stated and justified.</p>
                  <p id="Par144">Baseline data will be summarised descriptively by allocation and overall, both as-randomised and as-analysed. The as-randomised set will include all randomised patients, except any ineligible patients randomised in error. The as-analysed set will include all participants with primary outcome data for at least one post-treatment time point. Outcome data will also be summarised descriptively by allocation at all relevant time points. Continuous data will be summarised in terms of the non-missing sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range and range, and categorical data using frequencies and proportions. The flow of participants through each stage of the trial as well as data completeness will be illustrated in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par145">The primary analysis will include all participants with at least one post-treatment PEM measurement. The between-group differences (collagenase—surgery) in mean PEM score at each post-treatment time point, and two-sided 95% CIs, will be estimated using a covariance pattern model, with all post-treatment PEM measurements included as outcomes. Treatment group and time point and their interaction will be included as fixed effects. The model will also adjust for informative baseline covariates, namely study reference joint and baseline PEM score, as fixed effects and include random intercepts for the study recruitment site. The correlation between repeated measurements will be accounted for using an unstructured covariance matrix. This model will be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood, with degrees of freedom calculated using the Kenward and Roger method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The null hypothesis that collagenase is inferior to surgery will be rejected if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the estimated difference (collagenase—surgery) in means at 1-year post-treatment exceeds the non-inferiority margin of six points.</p>
                  <p id="Par146">Compliance with randomised treatments will be reported, and an instrumental variable estimator (assuming random allocation is a valid instrument) will estimate the Complier Average Causal Effect (i.e. the average causal effect of collagenase compared to surgery among the “complier” principal stratum). The primary analysis assumes missing outcome data are missing at random (MAR) conditional on the baseline covariates and non-missing outcomes included in the model. Multiple imputations will be used to make the MAR assumption more plausible, via imputation of missing outcomes conditional on additional informative pre- and post-randomisation variables. A mean score approach will also be used to explore the sensitivity of the results of the primary analysis to various systematic departures from MAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par147">Continuous secondary outcomes (URAM, MHQ, SANE and active/passive range of movement) will be analysed using similar covariance pattern models as used for the primary analysis. Categorical outcomes (recurrence, complications, further procedures and overall hand assessment) will be analysed by appropriate logistic regression models. Time elapsed between the initial treatment of the reference digit and receipt of further treatment to the reference digit will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Secondary analyses will focus primarily on interval estimation, as opposed to hypothesis testing, under either a non-inferiority or superiority testing framework.</p>

                  <title>Economic analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par148">The economic evaluation will estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of collagenase compared with surgical treatment.</p>
                  <p id="Par149">The short-term effect of collagenase and limited fasciectomy treatments will be assessed using a within-trial cost-utility analysis (CUA) with a 1-year time horizon. If collagenase is cost-effective in the short term, we will extrapolate cost-effectiveness estimates over time. Hence, the primary analysis will be a recurrence model based on DISC evidence. The outcomes of the model will be used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the two treatment options.</p>
                  <p id="Par150">Needle fasciotomy is also used as standard care in the NHS for the treatment of Dupuytren’s disease. Since the start of the trial, a number of literature review searches have been conducted to identify publications relevant in this area. Based on the evidence identified through this review, we will conduct a scenario analysis to assess the impact of incorporating needle fasciotomy into the comparison. Finally, a threshold analysis will be used to determine the threshold value of the effectiveness of limited fasciotomy and percutaneous needle fasciotomy, leading to these interventions being cost-effective. The analysis will be consistent with the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technological Appraisal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par151">Data on resource use and health-related quality-of-life will be collected alongside the trial. Intervention costs will be estimated according to injection and manipulation resource use. Surgical costs will be based on theatre and staff time, consumables and devices, and nights in the hospital after the procedure. The impact of the two interventions in the following costs will be collected using patients’ questionnaires and hospital forms (i.e. outpatient visits, hospital readmissions, A&amp;E visits, general practice, and community and personal health services). The primary analysis will follow an NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective consistent with that used by the NICE. A secondary analysis will also consider productivity costs and private expenditures.</p>
                  <p id="Par152">Health outcomes will be expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the EQ-5D-5L (i.e. collected at baseline; 2 and 6 weeks; 3, 6, 12 and 24 months). The EQ-5D-5L health states will be valued following the NICE position statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and utility scores will be converted into QALYs using the area under the curve analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par153">Costs and QALY data will be synthesised to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The probability that each intervention is cost-effective will be reported at the cost-effectiveness thresholds of £20,0000 to £30,000/QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and also £13,000/QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Regression methods will be used to allow for differences in prognostic variables. The pattern of missing data will be analysed and handled by multiple imputations if deemed appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par179">The DISC trial has been designed to provide a robust answer to guide the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture as regards the effectiveness of collagenase, in terms of patient-reported hand pain and functionality as assessed by the PEM. Overall, collagenase would have to not be inferior to limited fasciectomy surgery in order for it to be recommended for widespread use, and the DISC Trial will enable this comparison to be made. The study will assess rates of recurrence between the two treatments which is an important consideration for both patients and healthcare professionals when discussing available treatment options. Key also to patients, and the wider economy, is the return to function as soon as possible following treatment, which is also assessed within the DISC trial.</p>
              <p id="Par180">As noted, collagenase was withdrawn from the UK and European market for commercial reasons as of March 2020. The DISC trial team worked to secure sufficient stocks to continue recruitment to the contracted target. These efforts were driven by a clear steer by clinicians (site principal investigators and co-applicants) that results of this study continue to have an important bearing on treatment options offered to patients. These efforts were reviewed and supported by the funder (NIHR) and DISC trial oversight committees.</p>
              <p id="Par181">Collagenase continues to be produced and marketed in the USA for treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture. Therefore, this study would provide reliable information on which to base the reintroduction for clinical use in Europe. A similar study cannot be commissioned in the UK or Europe, given the current market withdrawal, making the DISC trial the only opportunity for a study in this region to collect reliable data in relation to the effectiveness of collagenase compared with limited fasciectomy. The results also provide a key component to a comprehensive assessment of treatment options for Dupuytren’s contracture. A plan of research for this is already underway with funding secured as part of the UK National Institute for Health Research-funded HAND2 trial [NIHR: 127393; ISRCTN: 18254597], which includes a package of work to bring together all treatment comparisons for Dupuytren’s contracture in an individual patient data network meta-analysis.</p>
