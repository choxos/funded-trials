              <abstract id="Abs1">
                <p id="Par1">Anxiety and depression are increasingly prevalent in adolescents, often causing daily distress and negative long-term outcomes. Despite the significant and growing burden, less than 25% of those with probable diagnosis of anxiety and depression are receiving help in England. Significant barriers to help-seeking exist in this population, with a scarcity of easily accessible, effective, and cost-effective interventions tailored specially for this age group. One intervention that has been shown to be feasible to deliver and with the promise of reducing stress in this age group is a school-based stress workshop programme for 16–18-year-olds (herein called DISCOVER). The next step is to rigorously assess the effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, of the DISCOVER intervention in a fully powered cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT). If found to be clinically and cost-effective, DISCOVER could be scaled up as a service model UK-wide and have a meaningful impact on the mental health of adolescents across the country.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par41">More than half of adult mental disorders have first onset before the age of 15 years, and almost three-quarters by the age of 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Emotional disorders of anxiety and depression are especially common in the adolescent years, causing marked distress and daily interference for 5% of teenagers at any given time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Anxious and depressed young people are more likely to suffer from poor social, educational, and occupational outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They are also vulnerable to substance abuse, early sexual activity, and self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Even sub-threshold emotional symptoms, which affect up to one-third of adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], increase the risk for long-term functional impairment and suicidal behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par42">Diagnosis of an anxiety disorder in childhood and adolescence is the most common risk factor for anxiety and depression in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] which may not be surprising given that the majority of childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders remain untreated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In fact, less than one-quarter of anxious and depressed youth are in contact with specialist child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A significant portion of young people choose not to disclose problems due to concerns about stigma and confidentiality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Factors such as inconvenient appointment times, transportation difficulties, long waiting lists, and high thresholds for specialist referral have also been identified as barriers to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, even when young people do access mental health clinics, there is limited provision of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based psychological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">Given these significant barriers to treatment access and the continuous rise in adolescent mental health issues, identification of effective and readily accessible resources and interventions is a public health priority. These also need to be scalable. One approach to improve accessibility is to use schools as a location for mental health services and care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In fact, given the rise in adolescent mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], researchers have begun to develop school-based mental health programmes to combat stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in adolescents.</p>
                <p id="Par44">A recent systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Feiss and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] identified 42 studies in the US evaluating school-based stress, anxiety, and depression interventions for adolescents. The majority of studies (35 of 42 identified) used ‘traditional’ (CBT-based) approaches, with most studies also utilising a group-based approach. Other approaches included meditation-based approaches and other holistic approaches. The meta-analyses provided somewhat encouraging results, reporting a modest reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms following school-based interventions focusing on those specific disorders. A slightly earlier meta-analysis performed by Werner-Seidler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] also found small but encouraging effects of programmes for depression and anxiety prevention, which remained at a 12-month follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The studies identified in these reviews typically reported intervention access on either a universal (provided to all students) or targeted basis (for students identified as exhibiting elevated or clinical symptoms). Both reviews reported that targeted programmes were more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than universal programmes. However, this is likely to be due to the floor effect of symptom reduction, due to a substantial number of participants in universal programmes not displaying elevated symptoms. Furthermore, whilst targeted approaches demonstrate greater effectiveness, they are also potentially disadvantaged by creating stigma around inclusion and excluding those who are at risk of developing issues but not currently exhibiting symptoms. A relatively novel option to address these issues is a self-referral model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], in which students can refer themselves to an intervention without having to go through a screening process. This approach has the potential to reduce stigma, emphasise autonomy (valued by adolescents), and allow for resources to be utilised most cost-effectively for those who require them.</p>
                <p id="Par46">A number of universal interventions in this age group have also used a digital CBT approach. Small to moderate effects have been found for anxiety reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and medium effects amongst female participants for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, whilst attractive in terms of reach, the dropout rates have been unacceptably high, with only an average of 30% of participants completing these programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">Importantly, the meta-analyses discussed above have demonstrated a lack of studies investigating these approaches specifically in older (16 +) adolescents. Studies included by Feiss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were from high schools and middle schools, with a total age range of 11–18 years. Those studies identified targeting older adolescents in high schools, still had a relatively broad age range of 14–18 years. Similarly, Werner-Seidler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] identified 25 of the overall 81 school-based depression/anxiety programmes as targeting older adolescents: with the mean age for this sub-set of studies ranging from 14 to 19 years. In fact, to date, there appears to be a lack of research into school-based interventions specifically for older adolescents (16 +), with just one small trial (<italic>N</italic> = 21) specifically focusing on a school-based intervention for anxiety and depression in the 16 + age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The lack of findings for school-based interventions specifically for 16–18-year-olds is especially meaningful when considering that distinctive mental health needs of older adolescents do not readily fall in line with ‘downward adaptations’ of adult treatments or ‘upward adaptations’ of child treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, evidence suggests the middle-to-late teen years to be a critical developmental period, with continued brain maturation and marked differences in sleep and coping mechanisms as well as significant social changes (e.g. increased autonomy and self-determination) compared to younger adolescents and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, this vulnerable period of change likely requires specific interventions tailored for this population.</p>
                <p id="Par48">In England, there has been a major development in increasing these types of mental health resources available in educational settings. In 2017, the government set out (in its green paper ‘Transforming Children and Young People’s Mental Health Provision’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to expand access to mental health care for children and young people in England. They proposed to achieve this by creating Mental Health Support Teams (MHST) to work between schools and child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to provide early intervention on mental wellbeing, as well as providing on-going training and support for a Senior Mental Health Lead in schools and colleges. MHSTs consist of educational mental health practitioners (EMHPs) and/or Children’s Wellbeing Practitioners (CWPs) and are located within educational settings across England, led by a designated senior leader. EMHPs and CWPs receive 12-month training to assess and support young people with common mental health difficulties, using low-intensity CBT approaches to address mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and behaviour difficulties. As of Spring 2022, 287 MHSTs were operational, covering over 4700 schools/colleges. The transformation plan aims to have nearly 400 MHSTs working with and in schools and colleges (and attended by almost 3 million pupils) by 2023.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Finally, the current literature demonstrates that data regarding ethnic background is often not fully reported. Whilst Feiss and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found race to moderate the effect of programme type, there was not sufficient data to decompose these interactions. Previous research has indicated that interventions may be less effective with those from more ethnically diverse backgrounds and racial minorities are often underserved in this area of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">Whilst there are promising results from school-based interventions for adolescents, there is a lack of easily accessible and effective prevention programmes that are designed specifically for older adolescents, targeting depression and anxiety in school settings. Furthermore, students from ethnic minorities are potentially under-represented. However, this problem might need to be redressed in different ways. In an important review, Naeem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] concluded that significant modifications are likely needed to make (high intensity) CBT accessible to non-Western cultures, with fully powered trials necessary for each of these adaptations. Whilst large trials with each population may not be realistically achievable, another approach is increasing the accessibility for ethnic minorities to current interventions, which may have a positive impact.</p>
                <p id="Par51">With these needs in mind, the DISCOVER workshop programme has been developed to (i) be clinically effective in reducing stress, (ii) offer cost-effectiveness in reducing stress, and (iii) increase uptake in harder to reach and treat groups (for example ethnic minority groups) by being easier to access (school-based and removal of screening measures) and by reducing stigma through neutral language. The content and delivery methods have been adapted from an established ‘well-being workshop’ model for working age adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Key elements of the adult workshops are (i) use of evidence-based CBT materials; (ii) group delivery at community sites; (iii) brief, 1-day duration; and (iv) a self-referral pathway. These features were reviewed by a Teenage Advisory Group and refined in an initial proof-of-concept study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The latest iteration of DISCOVER incorporates new, age-appropriate video material, a more interactive presentational style, and additional methods for personalisation and telephone follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par52">A feasibility study of DISCOVER, a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], was conducted in 10 schools with 155 year 12 and year 13 students (aged at least 16) (<italic>n</italic> = 155). Female and ethnic minority groups accounted for 81% and 57.4% of students, respectively. DISCOVER comprises a pre-workshop goal setting session, a 1-day workshop, and 1–3 follow-up telephone calls. In this feasibility study, 72.2% attended the full-day intervention, 11.1% attended part of the day, and 17.7% did not attend the workshop. Even though under-powered, significant reductions were found in depression (<italic>d</italic> = 0.27) and anxiety (<italic>d</italic> = 0.25) at the 3-month follow-up after controlling for baseline measures and schools.</p>
                <p id="Par53">A qualitative study exploring the feasibility and acceptability of DISCOVER using semi-structured interviews indicated that DISCOVER was generally feasible and acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Three groups of participants were purposively sampled to include students from ethnic minority backgrounds: students who attended the workshop (<italic>n</italic> = 15), students who showed interest initially but decided not to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 9), and school staff who helped organise the programme in schools. Students reported that the workshop helped them understand stress and related management techniques. They showed a preference for the school setting, interactive activities, and individualised approach between psychologists and students. School staff reported that the workshop was in line with school values. They also expressed a desire for more information regarding the workshop for follow-up support and described some logistical barriers of delivery, like timetable and shortage of available classrooms. The main reason for students not participating was their limited time.</p>

The trial will be a clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluation and will take place in 60 secondary schools across the UK. The two parallel arms will be (i) a psychological stress workshop programme (DISCOVER), consisting of a 1-day CBT workshop, pre-workshop goal planning session, and 1–3 follow-up phone calls, and (ii) a control condition, chosen as a comparator to represent normal school provision. The unit of randomisation will be the school, thereby minimising contamination between intervention and control arms. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up in both study arms. Timings will fit around the school year, within a 3-year timeframe, to enable recruitment over 2 school years.</p>

                    <p id="Par85">DISCOVER is a brief, intensive, group workshop-based stress management programme for 16–18-year-olds, to which they can self-refer. The programme was developed in collaboration with a Teenage Advisory Group (TAG) of 16–18-year-olds with the aim of improving engagement, offering effective treatment, and maintaining participants’ motivation and improvement to reduce relapse. The collaborative approach also allowed the workshop to be developed to be acceptable across ethnic groups and both sexes. The workshop is a day-long face-to-face workshop, accommodating up to 19 students and taking place at school/college over a single day. Permission for students to attend and miss curricular activities is obtained from staff in advance. Each workshop is co-facilitated by one master’s/postgraduate diploma level therapist and 2 assistants with a college-level qualification, not necessarily in psychology (e.g. EMHPS, CWP), and delivered in accordance with the DISCOVER manual. The workshop programme includes CBT coping techniques for managing mood, anxiety, and stress, delivered in non-stigmatising language. Prior to attending the workshop, students meet individually with one of the three workshop leaders to think about their personal goals, which they set at the end of the workshop day. The workshop is then followed by up to 3 ‘goal-review’ telephone calls.</p>

                    <title>Core content</title>
                    <p id="Par86">Each workshop begins with introductions and icebreakers. Psychoeducational content first focuses on a basic cognitive-behavioural model of emotional problems. A variety of presentation methods are used. Video clips involving teenage actors and group discussion are used to normalise young people’s experiences. Particular attention is given to personal, relationship, and academic stresses typical for the age group. CBT techniques for managing anxiety and mood problems are introduced and practised, supported by scripted role-plays, video demonstrations, and printed handouts. Behavioural strategies used include problem-solving and time management. Cognitive strategies include identification and challenging of negative thoughts.</p>

                    <title>Personalised follow-up</title>
                    <p id="Par87">Participants are encouraged to set clear personal goals at the end of the workshop. After 1 week, participants are followed up individually by one of the workshop leaders in a 20–30-min telephone call. The purpose of this ‘telephone goal review’ is to monitor progress and support incorporation of CBT skills into real-life situations. If needed, participants are given the option of receiving 2 further telephone goal reviews within the 12-week post-workshop period. Participants will be offered a total of 1–3 telephone consultations in order to refine their original goal(s) and/or address unforeseen barriers. These will all occur before the participant meets with the blinded research worker for administration of the follow-up outcome measures.</p>

At the start of the trial period, all participants will be provided with a signposting sheet detailing relevant resources and services available in the local area and online.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                <p id="Par89">Research workers will monitor for potential harm during data collection sessions: A standard risk assessment and management protocol will be carried out by a research worker at baseline using the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Additionally, in the intervention arm, workshop leaders will monitor for potential harm during workshop programme delivery and telephone contacts.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Any spontaneous or ASQ-related indications of risk will be referred to the trial manager, DISCOVER service lead, and school safeguarding lead, as appropriate. If the risk is judged to be ‘acute’ (i.e. in need of immediate safeguarding actions, as per usual clinical and school procedures), then the young person in question will be excluded from further study procedures and referred to the safeguarding team within the school.</p>
                <p id="Par91">Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The chief investigator (CI) also has the right to withdraw participants from the study in the event of SAEs or other reasons. As per the ‘Adverse event reporting and harms {22}’ section, all AEs/SAEs will be summarised and reported in the open report of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) which will also be circulated to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of participants should be avoided. Should a participant decide to withdraw from the entire study, all efforts will be made to report the reason for withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. Should a participant drop out from attending the workshop programme, every effort will be made to continue to obtain follow-up data, with the permission of the participant. Participants who wish to drop out of the intervention will be asked to confirm whether they are still willing to provide data at any remaining follow-up assessments (and will be encouraged to do so).</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par92">To ensure adherence to intervention protocols, the research worker (RW) will meet with students individually to obtain informed consent and collect baseline data. The RW will also conduct the follow-up assessments. As the intervention workshop and assessment measures will be carried out with a member of the trial team present, this will allow us to ensure all protocols are fully adhered to.</p>
                <p id="Par93">To ensure adherence to follow-up measures, each student will be contacted by the trial manager, and via designated school staff, (up to 5 times) for the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments, with visit windows of ± 4 weeks for the 3-month follow-up assessments and ± 6 weeks for the 6-month follow-up assessments. However, the research team will endeavour to ensure data is collected as closely as possible to the 3- and 6-month time points. Should follow-up appointment reminders fail, non-responders will be sent assessment questionnaires along with instructions for completion and asked to return these by post. In order to protect blinding, the RWs will remind the students at the start of each assessment that they are not to divulge whether they received the workshop or not.</p>
                <p id="Par94">In an effort to reduce attrition bias, and maintain good adherence to the study protocol, an incentive of Amazon vouchers will be offered to students who consent to take part in the study (£15) as well as complete measures at other time points (£15 for 3 months and £25 for 6 months).</p>

This has increased the number of schools from 54 to 60, increasing the number of students from 810 to 900, with 15 students per school (average). This will give 90% power to detect differences.

                  <p id="Par118">Targeted communications, augmented by posters and flyers, will be used to publicise the study at 60 schools and sixth form colleges. Students will then be informed at a school assembly about the study’s aims and methods, where a research worker will give a brief presentation about the study. Where possible, a male role model from within the school staff will also be present, for the purpose of promoting male engagement. Students will be invited to register their initial interest by attending a further small group information meeting. The information meeting will be offered during a lunchtime session at each school. Students will be reminded in advance by the relevant teachers. The session will be run by a research worker, and where possible, teachers and male role models will also be in attendance. Students will be shown a presentation giving more detailed information about the BESST trial and what they would need to do if they decided to take part in the trial. They will also be given a written Participant Information Sheet. It will be made clear that schools will be randomised into experimental and control schools following the first session of outcome measures and only 50% schools would receive the DISCOVER workshop programme. It will be explained to students that they receive a total of £55 gift vouchers for participating, regardless of which arm their school is randomised to. It will also be made clear that if more than the maximum number of students come forward, students will be randomly allocated to participate in the trial; those who are not allocated to participate will be provided with a signposting information document. There will also be opportunities for students to ask questions. Students who are unable to attend the group information meeting will be offered further information and the opportunity to ask questions either through their teacher or a research worker. Students will have at least 48 h after the information meeting to decide whether or not they wish to proceed. If they decide to proceed, an individual meeting will be arranged with the research worker to obtain informed written consent to participate and complete the assessment measures. Parents will only be informed about this decision when specifically requested by the young person. Student participation will be discontinued if they decide to withdraw at any point.</p>

The trial manager will communicate the covariate data to the KCTU-affiliated statisticians who will then generate the sequence. This allocation list will then be communicated to the trial manager who holds the randomisation key assigning A or B to intervention in order to implement the assigned allocations within the clusters.

                <p id="Par125">Research workers who are directly involved in data collection will remain blind to cluster allocation. Several steps will be taken to preserve blinding. First, blinded research workers will have minimal contact with workshop leaders prior to follow-up data collection. Second, unblinded members of the research team will liaise with research sites and participants to confirm practical arrangements for data collection, thereby minimising contact between blinded researchers and schools following baseline measures. Third, blinded research workers will use a standardised script during data collection to remind students not to disclose their allocation status. The blinded research workers will also display signs, containing similar reminders, during follow-up visits to schools. The trial manager will be unblinded, as they will coordinate the delivery of the DISCOVER programme. After approval of the first draft of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and health economic analysis plan (HEAP), the trial statistician and trial health economist will become pseudo blinded to the allocation coded as A or B. The trial health economist will become unblinded upon database lock to allow the intervention to be costed for those in the intervention group. The chief investigator, senior trial statistician, and senior health economist will remain blinded until the database lock. At which point, they will be pseudo blinded (aware of arms as A and B) until the analysis is fully interpreted. Any incidents of unplanned unblinding will be recorded.</p>

                <p id="Par158">A protocol deviator (PD) is defined as a breach from the protocol that is unlikely to influence the findings of the study. Where a PD is carried out, it will be noted with the Trial Management Group (TMG) minutes. A protocol violator (PV) is a breach from the protocol that may result in a change to the study findings. An incident that may result in a PV would be a participant not adequately fulfilling adherence to the workshop or completing the primary outcome assessment outside of the study window.</p>
                <p id="Par159">Missing data will be explored. The primary analysis will be on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population using a linear mixed model which allows for missing data under the missing at-random assumption using the approach recommended by Jakobsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]; further detail will be described in the SAP.</p>

The DMC will consist of a clinical chair and independent statistician, and one additional independent member, with the CI as an observer. An open DMC report will be prepared by the trial statistician. The DMC will make a recommendation to the TSC prior to a TSC meeting about the continuation of the trial. The DMC will review recruitment, retention, data quality, the primary clinical result, and adverse events. The DMC will meet at least annually.</p>

                <title>Adverse event reporting and harms {22}</title>
                <p id="Par165">BESST is a low-risk non-medical trial. Research workers from each site will note adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) at each follow-up interview and enter these into the MACRO database, and any SAEs or suspected SAEs that are recorded will be reported to the trial manager. Facilitators will record AEs/SAEs from the workshop and follow-up calls; all these events will be reported to the trial manager to enter onto the trial database. All AEs/SAEs will be summarised and reported in the open report of the DMC which will also be circulated to the TSC. SAEs will also be circulated to the DMC chair for review. Action will then be taken accordingly depending on implications for the conduct of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par166">We do not anticipate safety concerns arising as a direct result of the workshop programme, which is usually perceived as helpful by students. However, we will monitor adverse events carefully as one of our outcomes and ensure they are appropriately documented and addressed. Any that arise as a result of the workshop programme, however unlikely this may be, will be escalated to the independent DMC for review and opinion as to necessary adjustments to protocol. Adverse events of any kind will also be reported to the school safety officer, following school safety procedures.</p>
                <p id="Par167">Adverse events that are pre-existing and expected prior to the planned delivery of the DISCOVER programme (or matched delivery for participants in the usual care schools) will not be reported to the DMC.</p>

                <p id="Par170">We will disseminate our academic findings through high-impact open-access publications. Our main trial findings will be of national and international interest, and we aim to publish them in high-impact, peer-reviewed, open-access journals (e.g. <italic>Lancet</italic>, <italic>BMJ</italic>). We will ensure that the trial outcome is known to clinicians and academics by presenting our findings at relevant national meetings (e.g. Association of Child and Adolescent Mental Health) and International Conferences (World Congress of Behavioural and Cognitive Therapy; European Association of Cognitive and Behavioural Therapy).</p>
                <p id="Par171">Results will be made available to all participants and presented to teachers after the completion of the study. Young Advisors, as part of DISCOVER PPI, will help draft the results in different styles and formats using different media (video-blogs, tweets) that will be accessible for young people and their carers. Wide service user and public audiences will access background information and reports through a designated project website, and the contents and features of which will be co-produced by Young Advisors. We will also raise public awareness of our results through press releases and the media.</p>
                <p id="Par172">We will share our results with policymakers through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Programme for Children and Young People (IAPT-CYP) which is a national training programme which oversees the development of CAMHS training in evidence-based interventions. We will also disseminate our findings to the Department for Education and Department of Health in relation to the new national Green Paper initiatives, which detail plans for national-level frameworks to train graduate mental health workers who specifically run interventions in schools. This is particularly relevant to the dissemination of DISCOVER given that we are testing the delivery with a mix of clinical psychologists and 2 CWPs/EMHPs. We will also disseminate our findings to schools and academies, relevant education conferences, teacher training, clinical psychology training courses, and CAMHS courses, e.g. MSc in Child Mental Health at KCL.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par173">Previous research demonstrates a lack of easily accessible and cost-effective interventions for 16–18-year-olds seeking help for depression and anxiety. Long waiting times, stigma, inconvenient appointment times, transportation difficulties, and high thresholds for specialist referral are all barriers to young people receiving the care they need. The DISCOVER workshop programme addresses these barriers to provide a much-needed, easily accessible, resource that has been formulated specifically for this demographic.</p>
              <p id="Par174">As evidenced by our prior research investigating the feasibility of this programme in London schools, the intervention appeared accessible and acceptable to 16–18-year-olds. It also appeared to engage under-represented groups. The feasibility trial obtained results tentatively suggesting it also results in significant reductions in depression and anxiety.</p>
              <p id="Par175">We are now able to progress to the next stage of development and testing, with a full UK-wide clinical trial of the DISCOVER intervention with a much larger group of students in a fully powered cluster randomised controlled trial. The Brief Educational Workshops in Secondary Schools Trial (BESST) will allow us to extend our existing findings by examining 6-month outcomes of the intervention on depression and anxiety, examine mediators and moderators of change, and conduct a health economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This trial will also be able to generate much more robust evidence about accessibility, reach, acceptability, and impact. And a qualitative study is being carried out to examine processes leading to effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par176">Should these evaluations demonstrate positive findings, DISCOVER could provide a service model that can be utilised across the UK in school-based mental health provision to achieve a much-needed and very significant impact on the mental health of this adolescent age group.</p>
