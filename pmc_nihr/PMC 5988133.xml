                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Hyperglycaemia is common in the very preterm infant and has been associated with adverse outcomes. Preventing hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia has proved challenging. The development of real-time continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to inform treatment decisions provides an opportunity to reduce this risk. This study aims to assess the feasibility of CGM combined with a specifically designed paper guideline to target glucose control in the preterm infant.</p>

                  <p>The Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Neonatal Intensive Care (REACT) trial is an international multicentre randomised controlled trial. 200 preterm infants ≤1200 g and ≤24 hours of age will be randomly allocated to either real-time CGM or standard care (with blinded CGM data collection). The primary outcome is time in target 2.6–10 mmol/L during the study intervention assessed using CGM. Secondary outcomes include efficacy relating to glucose control, utility including staff acceptability, safety outcomes relating to incidence and prevalence of hypoglycaemia and health economic analyses.</p>

                  <p>The REACT trial has been approved by the National Health Service Health Research Authority National Research Ethics Service Committee East of England (Cambridge Central); Medical Ethics Review Committee, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and the Research Ethics Committee, Sant Joan de Déu Research Foundation, Barcelona, Spain. Recruitment began in July 2016 and will continue until mid-2018. The trial has been adopted by the National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network portfolio (ID: 18826) and is registered with anInternational Standard Randomised Control Number (ISRCTN registry ID: 12793535). Dissemination plans include presentations at scientific conferences, scientific publications and efforts at stakeholder engagement.</p>

              <p>In utero, glucose levels are normally maintained between 4 and 6 mmol/L,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> but infants born preterm are at risk of both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia have both been associated with increased mortality and morbidity of preterm babies.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Hyperglycaemia can lead to acute problems of a persistent osmotic diuresis and metabolic acidosis which can be difficult to control and has been associated with increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and patent ductus arteriosus.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hyperglycaemia has also been associated with increased long-term morbidity, including increased risk of retinopathy of prematurity.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6–8</xref> Hypoglycaemia is associated with characteristic occipital temporal lesions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Attempts to reduce risks associated with hyperglycaemia in adult and paediatric and neonatal intensive care (NICU) have resulted in increased risk of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> This is of particular concern for the very preterm infant in whom there is very varied insulin sensitivity, which increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition the developing brain appears to be particularly vulnerable to both hyperglycaemic<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and hypoglycaemic insults. Early postnatal glucose control may be an important modifiable risk factor for clinical outcomes. A recent Cochrane review has highlighted the need for further studies into the impact of interventions to improve glucose control in these infants.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Managing glucose control is dependent in part on methods of measuring and monitoring glucose levels. Within NICU glucose measurements are currently limited to intermittent blood sampling,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> with long periods when glucose levels are unknown. In contrast, other physiological parameters such as oxygen saturation, blood pressure and heart rate are all monitored continuously to prevent wide fluctuations. It is increasingly thought that fluctuations in glucose levels may also have a significant impact on long-term outcomes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The reason for the intermittent measurement is that current methodologies rely on blood sampling either from a central arterial line or by heel prick. Clinical care for preterm infants aims to reduce the frequency of handling<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and volume of blood sampled as this has been shown to improve outcomes.</p>
              <p>Developments in the measurement of glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus include continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) of interstitial glucose levels.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Real-time data on interstitial glucose levels now provides information on glucose trends with the potential for earlier intervention and prevention of both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. Benefits within adult intensive care remain controversial,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> however, the benefits in the setting of NICU may be more marked as blood glucose (BG) measurements are taken much less frequently in these small babies. There have also been key developments in the technology including extended life of sensors (previously 72 hours) and improved accuracy.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The latter is particularly relevant due to the threshold levels of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia (&lt;2.6 and &gt;10 mmol/L) which are more extreme than in adults and are at the limits of accuracy of many methods of glucose measurement.</p>
              <p>Blinded CGM has been used in preterm babies within clinical trials,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 20 21</xref> and studies of real-time devices have shown a benefit in providing early warning of and prevention of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Studies have not so far attempted to use CGM to guide clinical management to support the targeting of glucose control in preterm infants. A single-centre feasibility study of the real-time monitors demonstrated that sensor glucose (SG) values are comparable with BG values (Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Neonatal Intensive Care (REACT) feasibility study REC Ref: 14/EE/0127). Data from the feasibility study have helped to design this randomised controlled trial. This multicentre randomised controlled trial will determine whether real-time CGM, with support from a paper algorithm, can help improve the management of glucose control in terms of efficacy, safety and clinical acceptability. This will not only enhance the short-term management of glucose control in infants requiring intensive care but by reducing the risks associated with both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia may impact on long-term clinical outcomes.</p>

              <title>Trial objectives</title>
              <p>The REACT trial will evaluate efficacy, safety, utility and cost-effectiveness of real-time CGM in preterm infants in NICU. Our primary hypothesis is that the use of real-time CGM will improve the time a baby’s glucose levels (measured using CGM) remain within the target 2.6–10 mmol/L (widely accepted clinical target for glucose control), compared with standard clinical practice (with blinded CGM data collection). Secondary objectives include evaluation of clinical acceptability in the preterm infant (using staff and parent questionnaires) and safety in relation to the device itself and risk of hypoglycaemia.</p>

                <p>Babies will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio, into control and intervention arms of the study using a web randomisation system, Trans European Network ALEA software (TENALEA). This is an open study in which the clinical staff, research team and parents will be aware of the study arm and intervention. All babies will have a subcutaneous sensor inserted, Enlite (Medtronic) that will be linked to a Medtronic MiniMed 640G system and will be calibrated with point of care BG levels.

                <p>The MiniMed 640G system is indicated for glucose monitoring and for continuous delivery of insulin, for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons requiring insulin. Monitoring equipment only will be used for this study. The system being used comprises linking the Enlite sensor (Medtronic, Northridge, California, USA) using the Guardian 2 Link transmitter to the MiniMed 640G which then displays the glucose data in real time.</p>

                  <title>Sensor</title>
                  <p>The Enlite sensor (Medtronic) is a CGM sensor which received CE mark in 2013 (CE certificate No. 21024). The sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) comprises a disposable subcutaneous oxidase-based platinum electrode that catalyses interstitial glucose generating an electrical current every 10 s which is transmitted to a monitor for display and/or recording. The data will be recorded and/or displayed as an averaged value every 5 min, giving a total of 288 readings per day. Glucose values outside the range 2.2–24.0 mmol/L (40–430 mg/dL) are reported as &lt;2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) or &gt;24 mmol/L (430 mg/dL), respectively.</p>

                  <p>The sensor will be inserted subcutaneously (into the thigh) by hand, not using the standard insertion device, thus ensuring the sensor is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue. The sensors are soft and flexible, approximately 8.75 mm in length and are mounted inside a hollow needle to allow for subcutaneous insertion. Once the sensor is inserted the introducer needle will be withdrawn, and the sensor attached to a small Guardian 2 Link transmitter (CE Mark 2013; Certificate No. 8858) for data transfer to the MiniMed 640G system for data viewing. The sensor will then be secured with a clear occlusive dressing (again trimmed to ensure minimal contact with the infant’s skin), so that the insertion site can be inspected daily. A blood sample will be required in every 12 hours to ensure calibration of the sensor. Sensors will be removed after 7 days.</p>

A sample size of 200 participants will enable a treatment effect of a 10% increase in the mean value of the primary endpoint to be detected with 90% power using a two-sided 5% significance test in the primary analysis. Based on a consensus of expert opinion a difference of 10% is believed to be of minimal clinical relevance. It is expected that a small number of patients will be withdrawn from the study.

              <p>All babies will be recruited within 24 hours of birth at one of the NICUs that has been approved for study participation. Due to the short time frame from birth to recruitment potentially eligible babies will be identified in a number of ways: (1) liaison with the obstetric team to highlight mothers at risk of preterm delivery, (2) liaison with the neonatal transport team to identify babies who have been born in local units being transferred to a study centre and (3) liaison with the NICU clinical team of study centres. Screening of eligible patients will be undertaken in collaboration with the clinical team and families approached only if considered eligible and the families consent to being approached about study involvement. Screening logs will be reviewed regularly by the coordinating centre to identify any issues around recruitment.</p>
              <p>The REACT recruitment centres are level 3 NICUs. They have been selected either because of their previous experience of using CGM in the preterm infant, or they are centres with a proportionately large number of babies which would fulfil the study inclusion criteria and represent an international range of clinical practice and thus provide generalisability of the intervention. The first patient was recruited in July 2016, and the end of study is planned for November 2018.</p>

The TSC is composed of five to six independent members and has a Charter defining the member’s roles and responsibilities. The TSC provide advice, through its chair, to the chief investigator and report to trial sponsor and trial funder.</p>
              <p>Safety will be assessed continuously during each baby’s stay in NICU. The frequency of AE and SAE as defined by The International Conference on Harmonisation and that would normally require reporting within a clinical trial is anticipated to be high in the population being studied despite the low risk of the study intervention. Following discussions with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and in accordance with regulatory guidance which allows for exceptions in such circumstances a modified reporting plan was agreed.</p>
              <p>Any ADE will be recorded and reported to the coordinating centre. All device deficiencies that might have led to a serious ADE (SADE) if suitable action had not been taken; intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less fortunate, will be reported to the Sponsor as for SAEs/SADEs. AEs will be recorded in the notes and some will be captured as exploratory outcomes as part of the CRF. SAEs are common in this population, therefore, the MHRA requested the following expectation for safety reporting:</p>

                <p>The following expected SAEs will need to be recorded in the CRF (safety log) and reported using the safety report form to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the event: (1) death, (2) culture positive infection, (3) severe hypoglycaemia (&lt;2.6 mmol/L), (4) seizures, (5) any other related SAE.</p>

Clinical trial authorisation has been granted by the MHRA (REF: CI/2016/0011). Written approvals will be received from individual hospital sites prior to recruitment. Approvals have also been obtained from Medical Ethics Review Committee, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam and Heath Care Inspectorate (REF: 2017–1 398434/VlO 14949), The Netherlands and the Research Ethics Committee, Sant Joan de Déu Research Foundation, Barcelona, and Ministry of Health Social Services and Equality (REF: 591/16/EC), Spain. The chief investigator will ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in conformity with the medical devices regulations and any relevant amendments. The findings of the trial will be prepared and presented at national and international meetings and conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals by the academic team.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The REACT trial is an international multicentre trial which will randomise 200 preterm babies (≤1200 g and ≤24 hours of age) to receive either real-time CGM or standard clinical management of glucose control (with blinded CGM data collection). This study will determine if real-time CGM can support better targeting of glucose control in these babies reducing the risk of both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. This has the potential to impact on both the acute management, and in the future on outcomes of preterm babies who are at risk from glucose dysregulation.</p>

              <p>This project is funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) Programme, an MRC and NIHR partnership and supported in terms of statistical support and data management by the Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit. The authors are thankful for the support of the Cambridge NICU team who helped to shape the RCT design based on feedback from the feasibility study and members of the Department of Paediatrics in Cambridge for support with trial set-up. They also wish to thank all the families who are currently and will be taking part in the study. It is also important to acknowledge all the members of the clinical teams who help to identify potentially eligible babies but moreover take the time and effort within a busy clinical environment to take on the additional engagement with the practicalities of a new study and new way of caring for babies. We also need to acknowledge the independent members of the TSC and DSMC who helped to finalise the protocol. REACT is a portfolio adopted study and receives support from the UK Children’s Research Network.</p>
