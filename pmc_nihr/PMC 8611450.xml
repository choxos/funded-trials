                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>A mobile app, BlueIce, was codesigned with young people with a history of self-harm to provide them with more accessible and available evidence-based support at times of distress. A preliminary evaluation found that BlueIce was acceptable, safe and used by young people and helped to reduce self-harm. The present study is designed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding BlueIce to usual Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is a single-blind, randomised controlled trial comparing usual CAMHS care with usual care plus BlueIce. A total of 138 adolescents aged 12–17 with current or a history of self-harm will be recruited through the Oxford Health National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust via their CAMHS clinician. The primary outcome is self-harm at 12 weeks assessed using the Risk Taking and Self-Harm Inventory for Adolescents. Secondary outcomes include mood, anxiety, hopelessness, general behaviour, sleep and impact on everyday life at 12 weeks and 6 months. Health-related quality of life and healthcare resource utilisation data will be collected at baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months. Postuse interviews at 12 weeks will determine the acceptability, safety and usability of BlueIce.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Self-harm is defined as the deliberate act of causing damage to one’s body, for example, through self-poisoning or self-cutting.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It is very prevalent, with around 17.2% of adolescents and 13.4% of young adults being estimated to self-harm.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Rates of self-harm are more likely to reduce in young adults compared with younger adolescents.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Most self-harm occurs in secret with comparatively few episodes, resulting in hospital presentations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> The most common reasons for self-harm include tension relief, escape from intolerable psychological pain, self-punishment and to show others how bad they are feeling.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> While suicide is less prevalent among younger adolescents, it is the third most common cause of death in young people.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Self-harm has consistently been cited as a risk factor for later suicide attempts.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Studies have demonstrated that adolescents’ non-suicidal self-harm is a strong predictor of future suicide attempts in young adults.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Findings such as these highlight the importance of intervening with those who are self-harming in preventing future suicides<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Research has identified risk factors for self-harm, including negative and stressful life events such as childhood maltreatment; self-harm or attempted suicide of a family member; drug and alcohol abuse; psychological factors such as feelings of hopelessness, perfectionist traits, emotional dysregulation or diagnoses of psychological disorders; lower sociodemographic status and being female.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 12–14</xref> Protective factors which may help reduce or prevent self-harm include better access to social support, higher levels of self-esteem and receiving support from parents as well as being able to re-evaluate one’s own thoughts and beliefs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence-based interventions for self-harm in children and adolescents are scarce. Few studies have evaluated cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) or problemsolving.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Family therapy does not appear effective.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> There is some support for dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> and for mentalisation-based treatment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, a Cochrane review concluded that there is not much evidence on which to draw conclusions on the effects of interventions for adolescent self-harm and recommended that therapeutic assessment, metallisation, dialectical behaviour and CBT warrant further evaluation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Recent reviews have identified new studies evaluating DBT with adolescents and suggest that DBT does now meet criteria for a well-established treatment for self-harm.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> With recent advances in technology, the use of digital interventions to aid the delivery of mental health interventions has become more widespread. The National Health Service (NHS) is encouraging the use of technology to improve access to, and the availability of, support and interventions, and to reduce demands on mental health services.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>There are currently over 15 000 mobile (m)health apps available worldwide, with around 5000 of these targeted at mental health.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Apps offer an accessible way of delivering and supporting mental health interventions for young people since over 80% of 12–15-year olds own a smartphone.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Alongside improving accessibility to support, mHealth apps are available 24/7, provide a means for symptom monitoring between face-to-face meetings, may be a preferable method of accessing support for some young people and provide a route around barriers such as stigma. mHealth apps may also help to lessen the demand on healthcare resources.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 27 28</xref> However, the evidence base surrounding healthcare apps is severely lacking, with research unable to keep pace with the speed of their development.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, the safety, efficacy and acceptability of most apps are unknown.</p>
              <p>In terms of self-harm and suicide prevention, mhealth appears very acceptable and appealing to young people and offers a way of providing immediate support at times of crisis. However, hardly any suicide or self-harm prevention apps have been developed with a recent systematic review identifying only four.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Similarly, systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy of technology and mhealth interventions in preventing suicide or self-harm in adolescents<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and university students<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> have raised similar concerns. In addition, the availability of self-harm prevention apps is extremely limited with few being available for clinical use.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> While these reviews all highlight the potential of self-help apps, further research is required to determine their efficacy in self-harm and suicide prevention with clinical populations.</p>
              <p>In response to the above, a self-help app, BlueIce, was codeveloped with young people with a lived experience of self-harm.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It is designed to support self-management of distress and reduce self-harm behaviours. BlueIce has 24/7 accessibility and is a prescribed app to be used alongside face-to-face Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> BlueIce is password protected and all data are stored locally on the phone.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It meets all minimum standards required for NHS accredited apps.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
              <p>An initial open study to determine safety, acceptability and usability found that 73% (19/26) of BlueIce users reported a reduction or cessation of self-harm at the 12-week follow-up.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> No participants reported an increase in self-harm during the study. Postuse reductions in symptoms of anxiety and depression were also reported with 88% (29/33) of users electing to keep the app at the end of the study.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
              <p>The aims of this trial are to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of adding BlueIce to usual face-to-face specialist mental healthcare in the reduction of self-harm in adolescents.</p>

                  <title>Mood lifting</title>
                  <p>If the young person rates their mood as low, they will automatically be routed to the mood lifting section. Alternatively, if at any time the young person would like to access this section, they can do so directly from the main menu. This section contains a menu of mood lifting and distress tolerance activities, personalised according to the interests of the young person. The activities are designed to counter the common reasons why young people self-harm (to punish themselves, emotional relief, feeling hopeless) and draw on common methods used in CBT and DBT. The mood-lifting section includes eight activities: (1) photo library: the young person can upload and save photographs, inspirational quotes and pictures that are associated with happy memories or which might make them feel good. These can be reviewed when low to help the young person remember the positive things in their life; (2) music library: a music player is included where the young person can upload and store music they enjoy, and which has a positive effect on how they feel. This playlist can be readily accessed when the young person is low as a way of improving their mood; (3) physical activities: the young person can identify physical activities they enjoy such as sporting activities (eg, going for a run or riding a bike) or other aerobic activities such as walking the dog. The young person can access their personalised list when low and be reminded about what they can do to get active to improve their mood; (4) mood changing activities: BlueIce includes a section of activities that make the young person feel good. These could be things like making a cake, watching an episode of a favourite TV series, reading a book, playing with a pet. These provide the young person with a prompt list of activities they can use to change their mood when feeling down; (5) relaxation and mindfulness exercises: audio-recorded instructions for a 10 min mindfulness session, calming visualisation and a quick controlled breathing exercise (4–7–8 breathing) are included. These can be used to help the young person manage any unpleasant emotions or distressing thoughts; (6) identification of negative thoughts: this section includes a thought diary where the young person can record any troubling thoughts that are racing through their head. These can be directly typed into BlueIce where they are saved and can be reviewed at a later date. This allows identification of any themes that could be addressed during face-to-face work with their clinician; (7) ride it out: this section draws on ideas from DBT and helps the young person to tolerate their distress. This includes instructions for an ice dive, a sensory toolbox and a ‘pros and cons’ balance sheet for self-harming; (8) call a friend: the final section contains the phone numbers of 3–5 people who the young person could contact if they were feeling low and in danger of self-harming. These would be people who make them feel happy and those they could talk with about how they are feeling. This section prompts the young person to reach out to others.</p>

                  <p>Our primary outcome is self-reported self-harm assessed by the self-harm inventory of the RTSHIA. The RTSHIA was developed in the UK for use with adolescents (aged 11–19 years).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The self-harm inventory consists of 18 items and assesses the presence and frequency of a range of intentional self-injuries (eg, cutting, burning, self-hitting, self-poisoning). The frequency of each item is rated on a 4-point scale (never, once, more than once and many times) over a defined period. At baseline, the young person is asked to consider the 6 months before their initial assessment. For the 12-week and 6-month assessment, the young person considers the 3-month period since their last assessment. Each item is then scored (0, 1, 2, 3) and totalled to provide a current self-harm score. The RTSHIA has good reliability and validity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 35</xref> We will analyse total scores and use this information to categorise changes in self-harm from baseline to 12 weeks and 6 months as reduced/stopped versus same/increased.</p>

The MFQ has high criterion validity and correlates well with other measures of depression.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A total score of 27 and above is associated with major depression, 20 with mild depression and 16 with no mood disorder. The Hopelessness Scale for children, adapted from Beck’s Hopelessness Scale,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> consists of 17 true–false items measuring hopelessness and negative expectations for the future. Items endorsed as ‘true’ are summed, with higher scores indicating greater hopelessness. The Hopelessness Scale for children has been widely used within adolescent samples and has consistently demonstrated strong psychometric properties.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> is a 47-item questionnaire with items corresponding to DSM-IV criteria for anxiety in the areas of social phobia, separation anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and for major depressive disorder. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale of frequency (never 0; sometimes 1; often 2; always 3), which are summed to produce subscale and total anxiety scores. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> is a widely used behavioural screening questionnaire consisting of 25 items assessing emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and/or inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behaviour. Each item is rated as not true (0), somewhat true (1) or certainly true (2). A total difficulty score is calculated by summing scores from all subscales except the prosocial. In addition, an impact supplement assesses the degree of distress created by the child’s difficulties and the degree to which they interfere with home life, friendships, classroom learning and leisure activities. The five items are summed to produce a total ‘impact on everyday life’ score, which ranges from 0 to 10. The Sleep Condition Indictor (SCI)<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> is an eight item self-report measure, assessing sleep and impact on daytime functioning over the past month on a 5-point scale.

We will follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension for reporting RCTs and will follow recommended guidelines for analysis of our data.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Our primary analysis at 12 weeks will be analysed on an intention to treat principle. Although we are not expecting a significant amount of missing data at 12 weeks, the impact of missing data will be assessed by comparing baseline covariates for missing and non-missing cases. In the event that there is evidence of bias being introduced into the analysis, then further consideration, including but not limited to multiple imputation, will be given regarding how to address this.</p>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics will summarise baseline characteristics for each arm and patterns of missing follow-up data will be explored. We will also undertake a per protocol analysis of our primary outcome, total scores on the RTSHIA. Regression analysis adjusting for baseline minimisation variables of age, gender, mood and self-harm frequency will be undertaken. We will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which we adjust for prognostic variables for which there is a baseline imbalance between intervention arms. Further sensitivity analyses will use multiple imputation to deal with missing data.</p>
                  <p>Similar regression analyses will be conducted for secondary outcomes (linear regression for numerical outcomes and logistic regression for binary outcomes). All secondary outcome measures will be compared between the groups and will include summary statistics and CIs for measures of effect size.</p>
                  <p>Analysis of the 6-month data will be included in a repeated measure analysis to investigate the maintenance of any effect seen at 12 weeks. Analysis of the 6 month follow-up data will be undertaken using a repeated measures analysis of variance with both the 12 weeks and 6-month data being included and adjusted for the baseline. The analysis will also be adjusted for the baseline minimisation variables: age, gender, mood and frequency of self-harm as proposed for the primary analysis at 12 weeks.</p>

                <p>An independent Study Steering Group (SSG) will be established to monitor progress, advise the investigators in general scientific and management issues and ensure that there are no major deviations from the study protocol. The SSG will include an independent chair, and at least two other independent members with research experience with young people with mental health problems and/or self-harm. The SSG will also include two young people from the Oxford Health participation group. The SSG will meet at least once per year. The lead applicant will inform the SSG Chair who may call additional meetings when there are matters arising from the conduct or management of the trial that might require their advice</p>
                <p>A Data Monitoring Committee was not convened as there was no panned interim analysis. Adverse events were reviewed by the SSG.</p>

                <p>For the purposes of this trial, adverse events are defined as increases in extent of self-harm or suicidal ideation regardless of whether they are casually related to the trial procedures. Serious adverse events are those requiring hospital admission. All adverse and serious adverse events will be reported to the project leader and will be reviewed by the SSC.</p>
                <p>Clinicians will be requested to inform study researchers should a young person experience an adverse event during their participation in the study. At both follow-up visits, the young person (and parent if under 16) will be asked whether any adverse events have occurred and whether they think the study is having any negative effects on their mental health and self-harm frequency.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is little research evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of self-harm in adolescents. Intervening with those who self-harm is important since self-harm during adolescence is a significant risk factor for future suicide attempts and completed episodes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> The development of mHealth apps to support mental health interventions for adolescents offers a novel and accessible way of providing support at times of crisis. However, while technology offers many potential benefits, few apps to prevent self-arm have been developed and there is a lack of evidence regarding their efficacy, safety and acceptability.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <sec id="s3-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This is the first adequately powered RCT of a digital self-help app codesigned with, and used by, young people aged 12–17 years in receipt of specialist mental health services. This study will add to the evidence-base and will document the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding a self-help app to usual care. If benefits are identified, BlueIce app can be widely made available to young people attending specialist CAMHS to provide help at times of distress.</p>
                <p>As it is not feasible to blind participants to allocation, the research team is aware of the need to maintain equipoise and to present the two interventions to referring clinicians and participants in a balanced way. Researchers will remain blind to treatment arm and, if this is inadvertently broken, subsequent assessments will be conducted by another member of the research team. Similarly, following guidance from our participation group, those allocated to usual care will be provided with BlueIce at their final, 6-month assessment.</p>
                <p>We have minimised the possibility of contamination between the trial arms. BlueIce is a prescribed app and is not freely available to download and use. Those allocated to UC+BI will be sent a single use download code. Once activated, BlueIce will automatically be installed on the participant’s smartphone and the access code will no longer work. Participants are, therefore, unable to share/pass the app/access code to others.</p>
                <p>Finally, this project will evaluate the use of BlueIce as a prescribed app, used in conjunction with a specialist mental health intervention. Future research will be required to evaluate the use of BlueIce as a standalone, freely accessed self-help app or the mechanisms underpinning any effects.</p>
