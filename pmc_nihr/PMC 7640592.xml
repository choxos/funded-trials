                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Frailty is highly prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients, leading to poor outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of intradialytic exercise is feasible for frail HD patients, and explore how the intervention may be tailored to their needs.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Mixed-methods feasibility.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Setting and participants</title>
                  <p>Prevalent adult HD patients of the <italic>CYCLE-HD</italic> trial with a Clinical Frailty Scale Score of 4–7 (vulnerable to severely frail) were eligible for the feasibility study.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants in the exercise group undertook 6 months of three times per week, progressive, moderate intensity intradialytic cycling (IDC).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>Primary outcomes were related to feasibility. Secondary outcomes were falls incidence measured from baseline to 1 year following intervention completion, and exercise capacity, physical function, physical activity and patient-reported outcomes measured at baseline and 6 months. Acceptability of trial procedures and the intervention were explored via diaries and interviews with n=25 frail HD patients who both participated in (n=13, 52%), and declined (n=12, 48%), the trial.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>124 (30%) patients were eligible, and of these 64 (52%) consented with 51 (80%) subsequently completing a baseline assessment. n=24 (71% male; 59±13 years) dialysed during shifts randomly assigned to exercise and n=27 (81% male; 65±11 years) shifts assigned to usual care. n=6 (12%) were lost to follow-up. The exercise group completed 74% of sessions. 27%–89% of secondary outcome data were missing. Frail HD patients outlined several ways to enhance trial procedures. Maintaining ability to undertake activities of daily living and social participation were outcomes of primary importance. Participants desired a varied exercise programme.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Frailty, ‘a multidimensional syndrome of decreased physiological reserve leading to increased vulnerability to minor health stressors’, is highly prevalent within the haemodialysis (HD) population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Increasing frailty is associated with worsening outcomes, including mortality, hospitalisation, falls, reduced Health-Related Quality of Life, psychological well-being, physical function, ability to undertake activities of daily living (ADLs) and increased symptom burden.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref></p>
              <p>Despite this, frailty is not static and evidence suggests that some factors associated with frailty are amenable to change.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While the possible mediating role of exercise has been discussed, to the best of our knowledge, no original studies have examined the feasibility or effectiveness of an exercise programme for people living with frailty and receiving HD.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> To date, exercise interventions for HD patients have focused on intradialytic exercise, most commonly delivered by means of a cycle ergometer (intradialytic cycling, IDC), yet little is known about whether this is the most appropriate training stimulus for frail HD patients.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition, HD treatment can be poorly tolerated by frail patients and therefore IDC may represent an additional stressor to which these patients are particularly vulnerable.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> European renal best practice guidance highlights a need for studies which identify how exercise programmes should be more specifically tailored to the needs of frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> yet to date, there has also been no exploration of the needs, barriers and facilitators to exercise from the perspectives of people living with frailty and receiving HD themselves.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effects of IDC for HD patients living with frailty by: (1) estimating rates of eligibility, recruitment, retention, exercise adherence and outcome acceptability; and exploring (2) the potential benefits of IDC across a range of secondary outcomes and (3) the perceptions of frail HD patients in relation to participating in clinical research, IDC and a tailored exercise intervention.</p>

In addition to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the <italic>CYCLE-HD</italic> trial (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental material 1</xref>), the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), a risk stratification tool, was used to identify vulnerable to severely frail participants (CFS score 4–7).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The CFS has good predictive abilities in an HD population, good construct validity when compared with the Frailty Index, is less burdensome that the Frailty Phenotype and has been validated in an HD population.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref></p>

Sixty-four participants (52%, 95% CI 42.5% to 60.7%) consented. Reasons for declining were lack of time or family support and reluctance to undergo outcome testing, or to be randomised. Those who declined to participate had a median age of 73 (IQR 67–81) years. N=35 (58%) were female and n=25 (42%) male.

The time taken to complete the Sit to stand five repetitions test (STS5, a component of the SPPB) also increased in the usual care group (suggesting a deterioration in function), but was maintained in the exercise group, resulting in an overall difference of 5 s (95% CI −4 to 15) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP7">online supplemental material 7</xref>).</p>

While sedentary time was increased in the exercise group on all days compared with the usual care group, this appeared to be offset by increases in light PA and moderate PA, and maintenance (although of low levels) of vigorous PA versus maintenance or deterioration across the same metrics in the usual care group (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP8">online supplemental material 8</xref>). For PROMs, outcomes were largely unchanged, except for the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) score, which appeared to deteriorate in the exercise group and increase in the usual care group, resulting in an overall difference in score of 4.93 (95% CI −0.94 to 10.80) and the mental component summary score of the SF12 which improved in the usual care group, resulting in an overall difference in score of 4 (95% CI −3 to 10). Exercisers appeared to have a greater perception of the benefits of exercise compared with those in the control group (3, 95% CI −4 to 11) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP9">online supplemental material 9</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Declining to participate was underpinned by a perception that the trial could worsen overall health, particularly among those who had not previously participated in research or had recently commenced HD. Female participants believed that exercise was predominantly for men and that they were already doing enough daily activity, while participants living with moderate to severe frailty viewed ageing as an inevitable decline unlikely to be influenced by exercise. Motivators included a sense of altruism, and the perception that participation could provide opportunities to improve individual outcomes; learn about their own health and access better healthcare. Participants felt that recruitment could be enhanced by the effective use of non-verbal communication, rapport building, adaptation to study documentation and actively involving family members in the recruitment process, as family support was often a prerequisite to participation (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Maintaining mobility, and the ability to undertake a range of ADLs and social roles were viewed as key outcomes for a future trial. Only 13 (52%) participants in the qualitative study agreed to complete a falls diary and many reported they preferred falls information to be collected during HD treatment. The majority who had fallen rarely reported them to healthcare professionals, believing that they were an expected consequence of HD or having experienced their concerns about falls being overlooked. Consequently, falls prevention was not viewed as a key outcome.</p>

Vulnerable and mildly frail participants (CFS 4–5) were particularly open to group-based exercise in the community or gym, which they felt would provide motivation through camaraderie with others. However, access barriers due to HD treatment, complex health needs and lack of transport were common. Participants also described feeling self-conscious exercising among ‘normal’ people. Home-based exercise was preferred by those with moderate to severe frailty (CFS 6–7) due to easier access, greater flexibility and relevance to their daily activities. Despite this, concerns about lack of space and safety were highlighted by those who lived alone, while those with family were concerned about overburdening or injuring them by asking for support.</p>

                    <title>Preparation</title>
                    <p>Participants lived with a range of debilitating symptoms, most frequently fatigue, pain and dyspnoea. Often daily activity alone was felt to be enough of a challenge. Common impacts of exercise (eg, breathlessness while exercising) were interpreted as worsening symptoms or damage, and many participants were uncertain if exercise would be suitable or beneficial. They indicated that the reason for exercising needed to be sufficiently compelling. They wanted to know what to expect prior to exercising, and individualised goal setting was advocated to build motivation and appreciate improvements.</p>

                    <p>Key components described were whole body resistance, aerobic and balance training. Many participants described being unable to get up once they had fallen and felt that practising this was also important. Routine PA was viewed as more purposeful than structured exercise ‘for the sake of it’ and participants spoke of their enjoyment of being outside and engaging in meaningful and physically active hobbies.</p>

                    <p>Supervision was viewed as essential to select, teach and progress exercises. Individual tailoring which considered the impact of disability, comorbidities and fluctuating symptoms was important, and a choice of exercises, for example swimming, dancing and yoga, was associated with increased enjoyment and engagement. Moderate to severely frail participants wanted the programme to be progressed in a supportive and collaborative manner. Those who were vulnerable or mildly frail wanted to be ‘pushed’ and progressed in a more assertive manner.</p>
                    <p>Having a companion (typically peers, family or friends) was viewed as helping to overcome access barriers and provide socialisation and mutual motivation. The sharing of experience was also seen as a powerful means of challenging preconceptions about exercise ability, although participants with moderate to severe frailty raised concerns about feeling embarrassed or ‘judged’ if they were less able.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>These results suggest that an RCT of IDC is feasible for frail HD patients with adaptation to increase outcome acceptability and eligibility rates. Adherence to IDC was high and it was viewed as a safe and efficient use of HD treatment time. Secondary outcomes also suggest that, for HD patients with a CFS of 4–7, IDC may mitigate deterioration in exercise capacity, endurance and functional muscle strength, increase PA behaviour (steps/day) and reduce falls incidence. Despite this, participants described a preference for a multicomponent programme that prepared them for exercise, offered variety, companionship and individualised supervision. No single preferred environment for the delivery of this intervention was identified, but appeared to be influenced by frailty grade and individual factors.</p>
              <p>27%–89% of secondary outcome measure data were missing, and, overall, this progression criterion was not achieved. Given that secondary measures are often insufficiently powered, reducing the number collected within a future trial may improve completion.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Falls were not of primary importance to participants, and this aligns with SONG-HD data which did not identify falls as a key outcome.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Our findings suggest that accurately capturing prospective falls data may be challenging due to under-reporting, and yet, retrospective falls data collection does not fully reflect the incidence and impact of falls, particularly those which do not require an ED visit or hospital admission. Given the high incidence of falls in this population, capturing falls data may be important in a future trial, and regular prospective recording of information relating to falls as a part of routine practice at the dialysis unit is recommended, in line with participant feedback.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This would provide both clinicians and researchers with higher quality data for use in both prospective and retrospective studies, and to inform clinical care.</p>
              <p>Further exploration and validation of meaningful measures for HD patients living with frailty is also warranted. Some of the functional measures (the STS60 and ISWT) included were too challenging. In the absence of a core set of functional outcome measures for older people, or people receiving HD, we suggest that the SPPB may be the most appropriate and feasible method of capturing information about mobility and function. Although challenges with ceiling effects have been identified, this measure had the lowest levels of non-completion within this study, and has demonstrated good test-retest reliability in HD patients and excellent validity and responsiveness to change following an intervention in older adults.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> To date, measures of basic and instrumental ADL ability and participation have rarely been used in exercise studies in an HD population. These outcomes were, however, highlighted as important within this study, and have also been included in guidelines and core outcomes sets for HD and older people, warranting their inclusion in future exercise studies relating to frail HD populations.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 30 31</xref></p>
              <p>The results of this study indicate that changes to eligibility criteria and screening processes are required. As only patient participants were interviewed, it was not possible to gain any insight on this aspect of feasibility from the qualitative component. Importantly, the challenges of identifying eligible participants do not appear to be unique to this study and a multicentre trial may be required.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
              <p>Higher proportions of older, female and more severely frail HD patients declined to participate and the qualitative data indicated this was due to negative perceptions relating to participation in both exercise and research. Such findings clearly have implications for the external validity of a future trial and the reach of the intervention at the point of implementation.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> To address this, this study suggests recruitment strategies which use effective non-verbal communication skills to build rapport and explore participants’ perceptions of the intervention and the research process, and subsequently provide balanced information about the study, may lead to more representative recruitment. A sense of equipoise may be preserved by emphasising altruism, access to potentially enhanced care, and an opportunity to learn about their health (which were all identified as motivators to participation), rather than the potential individual benefits of the intervention itself. Involving families and/or peer supporters who have experience of the study and intervention in the recruitment process and introducing opportunities for participants to observe the exercise intervention may also be beneficial. Ultimately, the selection of these strategies will depend on the resources available and the need to strike a balance between conducting a trial with high internal and external validity and going beyond what is pragmatically possible to engage patients in the intervention at the implementation phase.</p>
              <p>This study suggests that IDC may reduce the incidence of falls resulting in ED visits and hospital admissions in frail HD patients potentially by attenuating a decline in exercise capacity, PA behaviour and function at levels shown to be clinically meaningful in other long-term conditions.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> This indicates that preventing deterioration may be as valuable, and more attainable, as improving outcomes in a frail population. Despite this, frail participants experienced difficulties achieving the proposed level of exercise and maintaining motivation in the face of varying symptomology. Exercise programmes have a dose–response, and these factors may have reduced participants physical capability to exercise and achieve optimal benefit, despite the overall good level of adherence. Clinical decision support tools have been used in other populations to rationalise exercise prescription, progression and amendment in the presence of varying symptomology and a similar approach may be beneficial for frail HD patients.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>
              <p>This study indicates that participants desire a multicomponent exercise programme, and require an intervention that addresses their particularly low levels of PA. While step count and time spent in light and moderate PA increased following IDC, these were below PA recommendations for older people.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> To date, PA interventions for HD patients have predominantly centred around walking, which may not be appropriate for those living with frailty.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–40</xref> This study suggests that functional training (task-orientated exercise which engages multiple muscle groups) and PA that focuses on ‘doing more’ of these usual tasks may be more acceptable and efficacious. To date, two studies have employed similar approaches with non-frail HD patients. One study demonstrated significant improvements in lower extremity performance and the other a non-significant improvement in physical function and maintenance of other domains within the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) compared with the control group.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> In older people without CKD who are living with frailty, functional training included as part of a multicomponent exercise programme is beneficial across a range of outcomes, including greater ability to rise from the floor following a fall.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 43–46</xref> A similar approach to exercise prescription may be warranted in a frail HD population.</p>
              <p>Numerous barriers and facilitators to exercise were identified within this study, which have implications for the design of a programme. The use of theory is crucial in the development of effective interventions and the behaviour change wheel (BCW) is most frequently cited in the development of interventions in CKD.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Mapping the identified barriers and facilitators to the BCW indicates that ameliorating symptom burden prior to exercise, individualised exercise counselling and a collaborative, problem-solving approach to exercise education are most likely to encourage and sustain participation.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> Devising ways in which peer and family involvement can be incorporated into the programme may also increase motivation and opportunity to exercise but should be carefully managed given the potential for negative comparison among the frailest patients.</p>
              <p>A lack of preferred environment for intervention delivery may have implications for a definitive RCT. Exercise interventions require motivation, and limited engagement may negatively influence a trials external and internal validity. Ignoring patient preference is also out of step with clinical practice, where rehabilitation involves shared decision-making. Taken together, these factors have implications for determining treatment effects and future intervention implementation.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> There is increasing recognition that novel trial designs may be indicated when evaluating complex interventions and a Partially Randomised Patient Preference Trial, where participants without preference are randomised, while those with a preference receive their choice would provide information on both the efficacy of the intervention and the influence of preference.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref></p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the feasibility of an RCT of IDC for frail HD patients and to explore how trial procedures and exercise programmes should be specifically tailored to the needs of this group, from their own perspectives. Key strengths were the use of a validated frailty risk-stratification measure and multiple qualitative methods which provided a form of triangulation.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> There were, however, challenges to recruiting severely frail participants, and those from a more diverse range of black and minority ethnic groups, to both the trial and the qualitative study. Additionally, the views of clinicians and researchers were not explored. A future RCT should also blind outcome assessors to group allocation to reduce the potential for detection bias. Finally, this study is exploratory and therefore all secondary measures of exercise capacity, function and PROMs should be interpreted with caution, not least due to the high number of participants who did not complete the follow-up tests.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In summary, this study suggests that a future definitive trial of IDC is feasible within a HD population with a CFS of 4–7 and paying particular attention in the design to those factors mentioned above may facilitate improved rates of eligibility and outcome completion. Outcomes focusing on independence and participation should be the primary outcomes of interest in a future trial. While an exploratory analysis suggests some potential benefits to IDC, a tailored intervention comprising a comprehensive multicomponent exercise programme, symptom management, education and behaviour change is better suited to frail HD patients’ needs.</p>
