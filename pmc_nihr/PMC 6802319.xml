                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Some interventions are developed from practice, and implemented before evidence of effect is determined, or the intervention is fully specified. An example is Namaste Care, a multi-component intervention for people with advanced dementia, delivered in care home, community, hospital and hospice settings. This paper describes the development of an intervention description, guide and training package to support implementation of Namaste Care within the context of a feasibility trial. This allows fidelity to be determined within the trial, and for intervention users to understand how similar their implementation is to that which was studied.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A four-stage approach: a) Collating existing intervention materials and drawing from programme theory developed from a realist review to draft an intervention description. b) Exploring readability, comprehensibility and utility with staff who had not experienced Namaste Care. c) Using modified nominal group techniques with those with Namaste Care experience to refine and prioritise the intervention implementation materials. d) Final refinement with a patient and public involvement panel.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Eighteen nursing care home staff, one carer, one volunteer and five members of our public involvement panel were involved across the study steps. A 16-page A4 booklet was designed, with flow charts, graphics and colour coded information to ease navigation through the document. This was supplemented by infographics, and a training package. The guide describes the boundaries of the intervention and how to implement it, whilst retaining the flexible spirit of the Namaste Care intervention.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">There is little attention paid to how best to specify complex interventions that have already been organically implemented in practice. This four-stage process may have utility for context specific adaptation or description of existing, but untested, interventions. A robust, agreed, intervention and implementation description should enable a high-quality future trial. If an effect is determined, flexible practice implementation should be enabled through having a clear, evidence-based guide.</p>

              <p id="Par8">Palliative and end-of-life care interventions in care homes for people living with and dying from dementia will always be multi-faceted and context sensitive. This requires interventions to be carefully developed, tested and implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, experience shows that innovations can be recommended, adapted and implemented without this measured approach, with the flawed implementation of the Liverpool Care Pathway a cautionary tale for those working in palliative care and beyond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An example of an innovative intervention that has had rapid uptake in care homes is Namaste Care, a multi-component approach to care for people with advanced dementia. Interventions in this field are important, as care for people with advanced dementia is usually provided in long term care settings, and these are likely to become the main place of death in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Developed as a response to a lack of active care being offered to people with advanced dementia it has a philosophy based on person centred, holistic care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, early findings on how and why it does (or does not) work are only just beginning to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Practitioner engagement and attitude and ‘fit’ of an intervention are known to have a major effect on adoption of innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Namaste Care appears to have such an intuitive ‘fit’ with practitioners. Implementing evidence-based practice in nursing care homes is complex, with issues such as being on ‘common ground’, connecting with practice, and reconciling new practice with other priorities affecting change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Namaste Care resonates with practitioners because of its context sensitive, innovative, and effective approach to care for an overlooked resident group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Evidence from small scale, qualitative or uncontrolled studies indicates an effect on symptoms such as agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and behavioural symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Qualitative studies identify that staff recognise positive features of the intervention such as providing sanctuary, connections and community, calmness and vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Problems implementing and sustaining the programme do, however, exist. Adjusting to the routines of Namaste Care can be difficult, and workforce turnover and management disruption endemic in long-term care can be barriers to both implementation and sustainability of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is likely that the label ‘Namaste Care’ is applied to a wide variety of activity, and implemented in different ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The requirement for robust evaluation of effectiveness has been recognised, as there are no controlled, comparative trials of this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">The challenge for any study of Namaste Care is that the intervention already exists in practice, albeit without sufficient evidence of effect. This is not a novel problem, health and social care practitioners are adept at identifying areas of care need and devising and implementing potential solutions that have little underpinning empirical evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Healthcare practices, without evidence of effect, have been categorised in three ways: those that are known not to work, those where the evidence of effect is uncertain, and those in development or implemented without evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Whilst the field of de-implementation is developing in order to assist the reduction or cessation of use of interventions known not to work, be unproven, or harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], there is less attention paid to how best to test complex interventions that have already been organically implemented in some areas of practice, but where robust evidence is absent.</p>
              <p id="Par11">A particular challenge in a situation where a broadly defined intervention has already started to be implemented in practice is that of intervention description. A clearly specified intervention is required for a number of purposes including training, understanding fidelity, ascribing outcomes to the intervention, future replication, cost effective and appropriate implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The Medical Research Council guidance on developing and testing a complex intervention focuses on intervention development (identifying the evidence base, identifying or developing theory, and modelling process and outcomes) and acknowledges that a common failing is inadequate description of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The guidance requires a full description of the intervention, and an understanding of its components, so that it can be delivered during the evaluations, allowing for (and understanding) any flexibility and variation, and so that others can implement it outside the study. Understanding the components of an intervention is also important in understanding how the intervention works: what are the ‘active ingredients’ of an intervention and how do they exert their effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]?</p>
              <p id="Par12">Implementation scientists also focus on the importance of intervention description. It is recognised that an intervention can have interacting components: ‘core components’ (the essential and indispensable elements of the intervention) and an ‘adaptable periphery’ (adaptable elements, structures, and systems related to the intervention and organisation into which it is being implemented) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Intervention over specification should be avoided, to enable variation to fit different contexts, recognising the impossibility of describing every component of a complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, compared to knowledge on how to evaluate and implement interventions, there is relatively little guidance on how to develop and describe an intervention in a way that might maximise likely effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. There is a gap in knowledge for those testing effectiveness of practitioner developed and implemented interventions. In these situations the intervention may have been differently understood, frequently adapted, and may differ from the original intent of those initiating the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Its theoretical underpinnings may be absent or not clearly articulated. It is unlikely that it has been carefully specified or adapted for a particular culture or context.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Potential ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ problems also exist. First, trial interventions can be challenging to incorporate in to day-to-day practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the care home situation there are particular issues with conducting research including factors such as time constraints, staff turnover and low education levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In specifying this intervention for research purposes, it was important that it remained relevant to practice, and did not take on features known to affect implementation. Second, interventions developed from practice do not always reflect the intervention encountered in practice. For example, the aim of the Liverpool Care Pathway was to take excellent hospice care principles and embed them in acute hospital practice. However, the intervention as specified (the paperwork developed), did not reflect the knowledge, skills and attitudes required for its safe and appropriate use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The aim of this paper is to present a four-stage model to refine an existing Namaste Care intervention and develop an intervention description, guide and training package to support a feasibility trial of the Namaste Care intervention. The four stages include collation of existing materials, exploring comprehensibility with staff who do not have experience of the intervention, using nominal group techniques to refine and prioritise the intervention and its format, and refining with our patient and public involvement panel.</p>

              <p id="Par15">The overall aim of the study is to establish the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial of Namaste Care in a nursing care home context in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. This is a phased research study involving the development of programme theories of how the Namaste Care intervention achieves particular outcomes and in which circumstances; developing an evidence-based Namaste Care intervention description and training package; and a feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial with embedded process and economic evaluations. Phase one (programme theory development) involved a realist review process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Key contacts within the UK using or publishing about Namaste Care were approached, many identified by online searches of grey literature and/or their self-identification of use on publicly accessible websites, together with snowball methods to identify nursing care homes or other care institutions (e.g. hospices) known to be using or who have used Namaste Care in any form in the past. Written requests were sent to 69 identified organisations (2 UK NHS, 11 Hospice, 56 Nursing/Care Homes).

None had personal experience of Namaste Care in that home or elsewhere. Participants emphasised the utility of brief overview documentation, materials to enable family carers to understand the intervention, and the importance of graphical display to enhance orientation to the materials. They amended some wording to suit a UK nursing care home situation, important as the programme originated in the US. An example is the use of the wording ‘personal care’. In the nursing care home context this equates to intimate care for example, washing or being helped to the toilet. This differentiation between personal and personalised care was important because the delivery of personal care in public spaces is deemed inappropriate by the Care Quality Commission who regulate care provision in nursing care homes. Staff proposed the term ‘pampering’ to describe the Namaste Care related activity. Following the workshop, the written materials were further refined. This included adding more graphical elements to replace text, colour coding the sections of the manual to ease navigation, and tabulating areas of text to break them up.</p>

It was recognised that it was important to capture the relational and philosophical aspects of the intervention in the training and the intervention guide.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par44">The four-stage process for describing and developing an existing practice-based intervention prior to further testing and implementation appears to have utility. We were able to describe succinctly the Namaste Care intervention in a 16-page A4 booklet in a way acceptable to the nursing care home context. This was supplemented by four A4 infographics summarising the main elements of the intervention in an easy to read and user-friendly format. The guide is colour coded (to match the infographics) and uses flow charts and graphics to facilitate the reader’s understanding of and engagement with, the materials. Training materials follow the same style and format. The guide specifies the boundaries of the intervention, and guides implementation, whilst retaining the flexibility both inherent in Namaste Care, and required in a pragmatic feasibility trial.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Intervention development is central to the Medical Research Council guidance on studying complex interventions—researchers are advised to consider whether they are clear about what they are trying to do, that the theoretical basis of the intervention has been used systematically to develop the intervention, and that it can be described fully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The Medical Research Council guidance is frequently used to optimise intervention development, but other frameworks such as intervention mapping, MOST (Multiphase Optimisation Strategy), the six steps in quality intervention development (6SQuID), and intervention modelling are also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Although they use staged approaches which have similar features to the approach reported in our study (e.g. working with key stakeholders, involvement of patients and the public), these typically still are only used in novel intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The four-stage process used in this study to describe the intervention for research use may have utility for other researchers faced with similar challenges. These four stages are conceptually congruent with many frameworks for intervention development or implementation. For example, the Knowledge to Action Framework emphasises that resources should be produced in a collaborative fashion with end users and other interested parties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and this involvement was a key feature of the four step process described here. We propose that this four-stage process could be integrated as an additional component to existing frameworks for intervention development or implementation where there is a requirement for an existing intervention to be described, developed or refined. This generic process is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

              <p id="Par46">This four-stage process could, for example, be implemented in the development element of the Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], or the optimisation stage of MOST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="Par47">The strengths of the study lie in the structured, inclusive and open approach to intervention refinement; opening the black box where many studies fail to describe fully either their intervention or its development. There was a clear relationship between the findings of the realist review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the perceptions of those experienced in Namaste Care.</p>
                <p id="Par48">There were, however, challenges and potential biases that must be acknowledged. There were difficulties in engaging people throughout the process. Only hospice organisations provided information to stage 1, and it may be that the way they use or describe Namaste Care differs to nursing care homes. Few people took part in stage 2, although those who did were very engaged in the process and represented the key staff (nurses, activity coordinators and care support workers) expected to deliver such an intervention. Whilst we anticipated a larger attendance, pressures of day-to-day work in the context of staff sickness had to take priority. This is a reality of much engagement and consultation work with nursing care homes, especially where funds to replace staff were not available. We would recommend that those using this process in the future cost such funding into their processes.</p>
                <p id="Par49">As there is no known sampling frame of those using this intervention, recruitment of people into stage 3 had, by necessity, to involve informal procedures such as social media and word of mouth. This may introduce bias. In this instance a number of attendees had previously been involved in a similar training programme, which may have affected their responses in unknown ways. Few family carers or volunteers participated, although they were acknowledged as potentially important in intervention delivery, and their voices were captured in our PPI group in stage four. It may be that individual interviews at a place close to, or at, home could facilitate their involvement. Whilst we worked hard to ensure geographical diversity, many participants worked in or around London, and again this may introduce unknown biases due to particular difficulties of staffing nursing care homes in city areas where there is large turnover of staff and many may not have English as a first language. Consensus work may be challenging for some, privileging those who feel able to speak in such settings, or who have lower literacy levels. These issues were minimised through offering a variety of processes including silent, written, generation of ideas as well as small supportive table-based discussions that should enable all to have some form of participation.</p>

                <p id="Par50">This process is likely to have utility across a number of studies, and we recommend its use in practice. However consideration should be given to a number of different aspects of the model that would benefit from critical adoption and enabling adaption of the process in the future.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par55">The four-stage process described here may have utility for researchers testing the effect of existing interventions, or where they need to adapt an existing intervention in a culturally or context specific way. Careful development and specification of an intuitively helpful intervention both enables an understanding of fidelity within the subsequent trial, but also facilitates future implementation, or indeed de-implementation. Future research could test these steps with other interventions, and report on its utility and development both in process evaluations of trials, in implementation studies, and in conjunction with other frameworks.</p>
