                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>There is a real unmet need for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) treatments that can improve quality of life impacting symptoms. In this <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis, we evaluated potential effects of the NADP oxidase 1/4 inhibitor, setanaxib, on patient-reported quality of life from a phase 2 trial in PBC.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>The underpinning double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT03226067) recruited 111 patients with PBC and inadequate response/intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid. Patients self-administered oral placebo (n=37), setanaxib 400Â mg once daily (OD; n=38), or setanaxib 400Â mg twice daily (BID; n=36), in addition to ursodeoxycholic acid for 24 weeks. Quality of life outcomes were assessed using the validated PBC-40 questionnaire. Patients were stratified <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> by baseline fatigue severity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>At week 24, patients treated with setanaxib 400Â mg BID reported greater mean (SE) absolute reductions from baseline in PBC-40 fatigue domain score [â3.6 (1.3)] versus those receiving setanaxib 400Â mg OD [â0.8 (1.0)]) or placebo [0.6 (0.9)]. Similar observations were made across all PBC-40 domains except itch. In the setanaxib 400Â mg BID arm, patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue at baseline had a greater reduction in mean fatigue score at week 24 [â5.8 (2.1)] versus those with mild fatigue [â0.6 (0.9)]; results were similar across all domains. Reduced fatigue was correlated with emotional, social, symptom, and cognitive improvements.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>These results support further investigation of setanaxib as a treatment for patients with PBC, particularly for those with clinically significant fatigue.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by immune-associated damage to, and ultimately destruction of, the intralobular bile ducts.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Even before the potential appearance of liver cirrhosis and resulting complications, patients with PBC frequently experience a range of symptoms including fatigue, pruritus, sicca syndrome, abdominal discomfort, and joint or bone pain, all of which can greatly impact patientsâ overall quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The most common of these are fatigue (with more than half of patients experiencing at least moderate levels)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and pruritus (which persists in more than one third of patients).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These symptoms, particularly fatigue, can affect patientsâ ability to perform day-to-day activities, and may significantly impact patientsâ mental health, social life, family life, sexual life, and job performance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> QoL-impacting symptoms are therefore important treatment targets for patients with PBC.</p>
              <p>The only currently approved treatments for PBC are ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; first line) and obeticholic acid (OCA; second line add-on), which both target cholestasis.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, randomized controlled trials for UDCA and OCA have failed to prove efficacy of either drug in managing QoL symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In fact, OCA treatment has been reported to exacerbate pruritus in some patients, and fatigue and pruritus are listed among its common adverse effects.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Consequently, patients may continue to experience debilitating symptoms despite PBC treatment.</p>
              <p>Fibrates, including bezafibrate, are sometimes used off-label to treat PBC but are not approved for PBC at the time of writing. Although bezafibrate may have positive effects on pruritus,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> impact on fatigue has yet to be proven using a validated method of measurement.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A recent study of seladelpar (CymaBay Therapeutics Inc.), an investigational selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonist in development for the second-line treatment of PBC, has reported substantial improvements in pruritus among PBC patients, which was correlated with improvements in patient-reported sleep disturbance and fatigue.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, from this study alone it cannot be distinguished whether seladelpar has a direct impact on fatigue in PBC, or whether alleviation of fatigue was due to improvements in pruritus leading to less disturbed sleep. Thus, there remains an unmet clinical need for medications that can effectively treat PBC as well as addressing and managing accompanying QoL-related symptoms of the disease, particularly fatigue.</p>
              <p>A phase 2 trial for setanaxib (Calliditas Therapeutics Suisse SA), an investigational first-in-class selective inhibitor of NADP oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1 and 4, was recently completed, in which QoL outcomes were assessed as a secondary endpoint. The original study did not account for factors such as baseline levels of fatigue; in this <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis, we set out to evaluate the potential effects of setanaxib on QoL outcomes in further detail and draw comparisons between patients with and without clinically significant fatigue at baseline.</p>

                <p>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel group phase 2 trial (NCT03226067) took place between September 2017 and April 2019 (from the date of first patient enrollment to last patientâs final visit). Eligible patients with PBC and persistently elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo, setanaxib 400Â mg once daily (OD) or setanaxib 400Â mg twice daily (BID) treatment arms. Patients self-administered setanaxib or placebo, in addition to UDCA (unless intolerant), orally for a total of 24 weeks. The study design (including randomization method), primary results, and safety data have been reported previously (Invernizzi P., unpublished manuscript).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

                <p>Patients were assessed for eligibility during a 4-week screening period. Eligible patients were aged 18â80 years (inclusive) and had a diagnosis of PBC. Patients were also required to have received UDCA treatment for â¥6 months (with a stable dose for â¥3Â mo) before their first visit, and to exhibit an intolerance or incomplete response to UDCA [defined by serum ALP and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels â¥1.5Ãupper limit of normal (ULN)]. UDCA treatment was continued, alongside setanaxib or placebo, throughout the duration of the trial. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously (Invernizzi P., unpublished manuscript).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>

Two values of ULN for ALP were used in this study depending on patient age: 125Â U/L (19â59Â y old) and 149Â U/L (â¥60Â y old). Stratifications by liver stiffness and ALP were performed to evaluate whether changes in symptoms and QoL over time were related to greater liver disease severity (indicated by high liver stiffness or serum ALP at baseline).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

                <p>Patient-reported QoL was assessed using the English version of the PBC-40 questionnaire (validated for use in patients with PBC), which includes the following domains: fatigue, emotional, social, symptom, itch, and cognitive (Supplemental Table 2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> PBC-40 questionnaires were self-completed by patients at baseline, week 12, and week 24 of the randomized controlled trial period. The endpoints assessed in these <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analyses of the PBC-40 data, to evaluate the effect of setanaxib treatment on QoL outcomes, were: (1) change from baseline to week 24 in mean patient-reported score for each PBC-40 domain, and (2) the number and percentage of patients who achieved a meaningful response in each domain at week 24 (according to a predefined score reduction threshold). Liver stiffness was assessed through transient elastography (Fibroscan), and serum levels of markers of liver injury and inflammation [ALP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and IL-6] were measured in venous blood samples collected at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 (for ALP); 2, 4, 12, 18, 24, and 28 (for hsCRP); or 12 and 24 (for IL-6).</p>

                <p>Descriptive analyses of baseline disease characteristics and changes in score from baseline to week 12 and week 24 [reported as mean (SEM)] were performed for the 6 PBC-40 domains, stratified separately by treatment arm and fatigue severity subgroup. For each item of the PBC-40, there is a minimum score of 0 (for 6 items in the symptom, itch, and social domains; Supplemental Table 2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>) or 1 (for the remaining 34 items), and a maximum score of 5 (for all 40 items). This results in a different overall âfloor valueâ (minimum total score) for each domain. In order to allow direct comparisons between changes in each domain from baseline to week 12 and week 24, the floor values were accounted for by calculating the âmaximum dynamic rangeâ [the maximum possible range between domain floor and domain ceiling (maximum total score)] for each domain (Supplemental Table 3, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>). Changes in domain score are presented as (1) absolute mean change from baseline and (2) the absolute mean change in score from baseline as a percentage of the maximum dynamic range for the domain.</p>
                <p>The percentage of patients who achieved a meaningful response in each domain at week 24 (defined by a 0.5-point change from baseline per item in the domain) are reported. The value used as a meaningful score reduction threshold was based on previous studies, which were powered to detect an average of a 0.5-point change per item in the PBC-40 fatigue domain (a change which had been demonstrated to be associated with significantly higher levels of social function).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated (using <italic toggle="yes">proc corr</italic> in SAS) between improvement from baseline to week 24 in the fatigue domain and change from baseline in (1) the emotional, social, symptom, itch, and cognitive domains and (2) liver stiffness and serum ALP, log(hsCRP), and IL-6. Serum levels of hsCRP were log-transformed to ensure normal distribution. Correlations were described as weak (Â±0.00â0.39), moderate (Â±0.40â0.69), or strong (Â±0.70â1.0), adapted from previously published cut-offs.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>

Baseline PBC-40 domain scores were similar for all domains across the treatment groups, both in the ITT population (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and in patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue (Supplemental Table 4, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>).

                  <title>Overall ITT population</title>
                  <p>Of the 111 randomized patients, 103 patients had PBC-40 data available for both baseline and week 24, and were therefore included in these analyses. Patients treated with setanaxib 400Â mg BID reported reductions from baseline in mean PBC-40 scores across all domains except itch at week 24 (Figure <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Meanwhile, patients treated with setanaxib 400Â mg OD reported modest reductions in the fatigue, emotional, and itch domains, and patients treated with placebo reported increased scores in all domains except symptom. These changes were already apparent by week 12 (Supplemental Figure 2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>). To aid interpretation, mean changes from baseline are presented as percentages of the maximum dynamic range for the respective domain in Supplemental Figure 3 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>). In all domains except social and cognitive, a greater proportion of patients receiving either setanaxib regimen achieved a meaningful response (0.5-point reduction from baseline per item in the domain)<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> at week 24 than patients receiving placebo (Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although no effect was seen for meaningful response in cognitive function with setanaxib 400Â mg OD treatment, 26.7% of patients receiving setanaxib 400Â mg BID achieved a meaningful improvement in the cognitive domain (vs. 11.1% of those receiving placebo; Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The greatest difference in meaningful responses between the setanaxib treatment groups and placebo was observed in the emotional domain (setanaxib 400Â mg OD: 35.1%; setanaxib 400Â mg BID: 43.3%; placebo: 2.8%; Figure <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue receiving setanaxib 400Â mg OD (n=17) and setanaxib 400Â mg BID (n=17) had a larger reduction in mean fatigue score from baseline at week 24 compared with those in the corresponding treatment arms who had mild fatigue (n=20 and n=13; Figures <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In the moderate-to-severe fatigue group, absolute changes in fatigue [mean (SEM)] were greatest among patients receiving setanaxib 400Â mg BID [â5.8 (2.1) vs. placebo: 1.0 (1.5) and setanaxib 400Â mg OD: â3.1 (1.3); Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>]. As a percentage of the maximum dynamic range for fatigue, 44 (Supplemental Table 3, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>), these changes were â13.2% (4.8) versus 2.3% (3.4) and ââ7.0% (2.9), respectively (Supplemental Figure 4B2, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>). Similar observations were made in the emotional domain (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplemental Figure 4B, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>). For patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue receiving setanaxib 400Â mg BID, a moderate decrease in mean score was also seen across all other domains except itch, whereas an increase (or no change) was seen for all domains in those receiving placebo (Figure <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplemental Figure 4B, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>).

                <p>Changes in fatigue domain scores across treatment arms for patients with lower (&lt;9.6Â kPa) and higher liver stiffness (â¥9.6Â kPa) followed a similar pattern to the ITT population, except patients with liver stiffness â¥9.6Â kPa treated with setanaxib 400Â mg OD who reported an increased mean absolute score from baseline to week 24 (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Regardless of liver stiffness, patients treated with setanaxib 400Â mg BID experienced the greatest reduction in fatigue among the treatment groups; in fact, those receiving placebo reported a mean increase from baseline in fatigue scores at week 24 (Figure <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This was consistent with results observed at week 12 (Supplemental Figure 6, <ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/HC9/A127</ext-link>).

Mean absolute changes from baseline in fatigue domain score at week 24 were also similar in patients with baseline ALP &lt;3 Ã ULN [â1.4 (0.7); n=84] and those with ALP â¥3 Ã ULN [â0.2 (2.0); n=19].

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This phase 2 trial was the first to investigate, in this <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> analysis, the effect of setanaxib, a first-in-class selective NOX1/4 inhibitor, on QoL in patients with PBC. The results suggest that setanaxib 400Â mg BID may reduce fatigue caused by PBC, and may also alleviate impacts on emotional, social, and cognitive function in patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue. The 400Â mg BID dose of setanaxib was most effective at improving fatigue and other PBC-40 domain scores in both the overall ITT population and in the moderate-to-severe fatigue subgroup, supporting the exploration of higher dosages of setanaxib in treating the QoL symptoms of PBC in a future phase 2b/3 trial and supplementing previously reported primary results from this study (Invernizzi P., unpublished manuscript).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>In the ITT population, treatment with setanaxib 400Â mg BID led to reductions in patient-reported PBC-40 scores across the fatigue, emotional, social, symptom, and cognitive domains. Previous evidence indicates that emotional, social, and cognitive symptoms are associated with fatigue, whereas itch is not,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> supporting the possibility that improvements in the fatigue-linked domains in the present study were due to a real effect of setanaxib on fatigue in PBC patients. This notion is reinforced by the moderate positive correlations observed between improvements in fatigue and scores in each of these fatigue-linked domains (emotional, social, and cognitive). There was also no observable placebo effect for any domain; in fact, mean scores worsened from baseline to week 24 for all domains except symptom in patients receiving placebo.</p>
              <p>Reductions in fatigue in the ITT population were not related to baseline values or changes over time in liver stiffness or serum ALP, according to stratification and correlation analyses. Similarly, correlation analyses did not indicate a relationship between improvements in fatigue and change from baseline in IL-6 or hsCRP levels. Previous research suggests that fatigue symptoms in patients with PBC are unrelated to stage of disease and may have an extrahepatic etiology.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Thus, the absence of a relationship between improvement in fatigue and markers of liver disease in the current study suggest that the observed effects of setanaxib on fatigue are PBC-specific, rather than due to the alleviation of general fatigue related to cirrhosis.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have reported that treatment with UDCA does not reduce relative risk of fatigue in patients with PBC; fatigue was even given the highest symptom burden score by patients receiving UDCA (followed by emotional, social, and symptom PBC-40 domains).<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The only trial to date that assessed the effects of OCA treatment on fatigue did not show alleviation of symptoms.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Liver transplantation, a last resort for some patients with end-stage PBC and not a treatment option for fatigue alone, has been reported to result in some alleviation and reduction in risk of fatigue, although not to normal levels.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This suggests that none of the currently approved interventions for PBC are able to target the underlying cause of fatigue. Although the exact pathophysiology of fatigue in PBC is poorly understood, it is considered to have both peripheral and central components.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Whereas UDCA and OCA primarily target cholestasis, setanaxib inhibits NOX isoforms 1 and 4. The NOX family of enzymes produce reactive oxygen species which can trigger muscle wasting and fatigue.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Oxidative stress has also been suggested as a potential mechanism of fatigue in PBC.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The results of the present study may therefore support the theory that setanaxib has a direct impact on peripheral fatigue in PBC; however, this would need to be investigated in a future study that is optimized to evaluate changes in fatigue. As proposed by Phaw et al.,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> ideally such a study would distinguish between populations of patients with central versus peripheral fatigue endotypes.</p>
              <p>In addition, while seladelpar has been shown to improve pruritus, sleep disturbance, and fatigue (according to the pruritus visual analogue scale, the 5-D itch scale, and the PBC-40 itch and fatigue domains) among patients with PBC in an uncontrolled, phase 2 study, these results were not independent of each other, suggesting that the fatigue improvements were not central to seladelpar.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In contrast, the <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> results of the present phase 2 trial for setanaxib in PBC demonstrate improvements in scores in the PBC-40 fatigue domain for patients receiving setanaxib 400Â mg BID, in the absence of improvements in the itch domain. This suggests that any effect setanaxib may have on fatigue in PBC is unrelated to pruritus-related sleep disturbance.</p>
              <p>Symptomatic presentation (including fatigue) at PBC onset has previously been linked to faster-progressing and UDCA-resistant disease with reduced survival rates.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The patients in the moderate-to-severe fatigue subgroup in the present study therefore represent clinically significant symptomatic patients who are most in need of innovative treatments for PBC. Greater improvements in the fatigue, emotional, social, and symptom domains were observed in patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue following setanaxib 400Â mg BID treatment compared to the mildly fatigued group. These improvements were accompanied by alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in the moderate-to-severe fatigue group, again supporting the effectiveness of setanaxib 400Â mg BID in reducing fatigue-related symptoms in patients with clinically relevant fatigue. Meanwhile, setanaxib 400Â mg BID treatment did not seem to alleviate social or cognitive dysfunction in patients who had mild fatigue at baseline, possibly due to low symptom burden at baseline compared with those with moderate-to-severe fatigue (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It has been previously demonstrated that fatigue has the greatest impact on patient-reported QoL when accompanied by symptoms of social dysfunction,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> therefore if setanaxib 400Â mg BID is able to alleviate symptoms of both fatigue and social dysfunction in patients with clinically-severe fatigue, this could result in a substantial improvement in overall QoL. These results highlight the unmet need in patients with clinically severe fatigue; however, these data should be interpreted with caution as the number of patients in each treatment arm stratified by fatigue severity were small [(mild/moderate-to-severe) placebo: n=18/n=18; setanaxib 400Â mg OD: n=20/n=17; setanaxib 400Â mg BID: n=13/n=17].</p>
              <p>As the mechanism of fatigue in PBC is still poorly understood, there are many outstanding questions regarding the potential effect of setanaxib on fatigue-related symptoms. Future studies may explore this further, once the pathogenesis of PBC-related fatigue has been elucidated or suitable biomarkers have been identified. The <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> results reported at this time are therefore purely descriptive but may be used to inform future investigations.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The strengths of the study included the use of the PBC-40 questionnaire, which was developed and verified for patients with PBC, thus the findings are valid for this patient population. Use of the PBC-40 questionnaire also enabled the investigation of the impact of fatigue on patient QoL in the context of other important symptoms of PBC. This study also included 111 patients across 9 countries over a 24-week period, with regular assessments of outcomes of interest; it was therefore one of the largest and longest phase 2 trials conducted for this indication, and provided a large data set that was representative of patients across multiple geographies. The demographics of the ITT population were similar to those observed in clinical settings (Invernizzi P., unpublished manuscript).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It may therefore be possible to extrapolate results from the ITT population to patients in a real-world setting.</p>
                <p>Of the patients included in this study, 50.5% had moderate-to-severe fatigue at baseline, which is reflective of the general patient population.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, due to the small number of patients with moderate-to-severe fatigue in each treatment group, the results in these subgroups should not be assumed for all patients with clinically significant fatigue. Finally, this phase 2 trial was not powered for the interpretation of secondary endpoints, such as QoL data, and as such these <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> data are purely descriptive and should be interpreted accordingly.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>In conclusion, the <italic toggle="yes">post hoc</italic> results of this 24-week phase 2 trial suggest that setanaxib 400Â mg BID treatment may be associated with improved fatigue and emotional function in patients with PBC; plus improved social, emotional, and cognitive function in those with clinically significant fatigue. These results support the further investigation of setanaxib, used in addition to the current standard of care, UDCA, for patients experiencing QoL impairments, particularly those with clinically significant levels of fatigue who therefore have the greatest unmet need. Recruitment is currently underway for a phase 2b/3 trial for setanaxib, which will aim to evaluate efficacy, safety, and QoL outcomes in patients with PBC following treatment with higher dosages of setanaxib in addition to UDCA.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
