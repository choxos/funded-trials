                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose limiting toxicity posing a major clinical challenge for managing patients receiving specific chemotherapy regimens (e.g., Taxanes). There is a growing body of literature suggesting acupuncture can improve CIPN symptoms. The purpose of the ACUFOCIN trial was to collect preliminary data on the safety, feasibility, acceptability and initial effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for CIPN, comparing use of acupuncture plus standard care (Acupuncture) against standard care alone (Control).</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>At a tertiary cancer centre, a pragmatic, randomised, parallel group design study was used to investigate the effectiveness of a 10-week course of acupuncture. Participants experiencing CIPN of ≥ Grade II, recording a ‘Most Troublesome’ CIPN symptom score of ≥3 using the "Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile" (MYMOP 2), were randomised to ‘Acupuncture’ or ‘Control’ arms. Clinicians were blinded to allocated groups, however as it was not possible to blind participants, it cannot be guaranteed they did not disclose study allocation within their clinic assessments. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients reporting a ≥ 2-point improvement (success) in their MYMOP2 score at week 10. 100 participants (120 to allow for attrition) were required for a hypothesised improvement in success proportions from 30% to 55% using a primary analysis model with logistic regression adjusted for stratification factors and baseline MYMOP2 scores. Feasibility and acceptability of study design was addressed through percentage return of primary outcome, retention rate and a nested qualitative study.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Primary MYMOP2 outcome data at week 10 was available for 108/120 randomised participants; this is greater than the 100 participants required to adequately power the study. There were 36/53 (68%) successes in ‘Acupuncture’ compared to 18/55 (33%) in ‘Control’. Beneficial effects were seen in the secondary outcome data, including clinicians' grading of neuropathy, EORTC, QLQ-CIPN20, QLQ-C30 summary scores and patient reported pain scores. There were no serious adverse events reported within the study and only 16 acupuncture associated events, none of which required intervention.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>A 10-week course of acupuncture resulted in measurable improvement in participants symptoms of CIPN. The results warrant further investigation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0025">Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, dose-limiting and debilitating side-effect for patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy drugs including taxanes, (especially paclitaxel), platinum-based drugs (e.g., oxaliplatin) thalidomide and bortezomib (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., 2019a</xref>). Symptoms include pain, paraesthesia and loss of proprioception, all having a detrimental effect on patients’ quality of life by affecting gait, mobility and by limiting the ability to perform activities of daily living such as buttoning a shirt or tying a shoelace. Persistent CIPN is associated with poor physical function, falls, and greater disability in cancer survivors (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kolb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Winters-Stone et al., 2017</xref>). Management of persistent CIPN during chemotherapy is dose reduction or discontinuation of chemotherapy. Commonly used medication for CIPN is not consistently effective (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Desforges et al., 2022</xref>) and except for duloxetine for painful CIPN after chemotherapy, there are no standard treatments (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Loprinzi et al., 2020</xref>). Investigation of interventions that would allow patients to continue chemotherapy at appropriate doses, as well as alleviate CIPN symptoms during and after the course of chemotherapy is therefore of clinical importance (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brami et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0030">Acupuncture, a non-pharmacological intervention, has attracted attention as a treatment for the complex symptoms associated with neuropathy including pain. The exact mechanism of acupuncture analgesia remains unclear. Experimental data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have confirmed that areas of the limbic system, such as the nucleus raphe magnus, locus ceruleus and periaqueductal gray, become deactivated during acupuncture stimulation whilst regions within sensorimotor structures become activated (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). This may be why acupuncture can reduce perception of pain and increase sensation in the case of ‘numbness’ – two key problematic manifestations of peripheral neuropathy. Reviews of the literature have proposed that acupuncture reduces central sensitization or hyper-reactivity, through mechanisms such as segmental inhibition and the release of endogenous opioids (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2020</xref>). Research points to the involvement of a variety of endogenous ligands as biochemical mediators in the acupuncture response to not only opioids (e.g., β-endorphin), but neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA, glutamate), neuropeptides (e.g., oxytocin) and neurotrophins (e.g., nerve growth factor) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting acupuncture may cause the release of biochemical mediators that work directly on the nervous system. In addition, local effects of acupuncture include reduction in levels of inflammatory mediators such as substance P (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). CIPN acupuncture protocols consistently include local needling of feet and hands, particularly between the toes and fingers. It has been suggested that this stimulation elicits a local ‘flare reaction’ with activation of neurotransmitters and opioid production, possibly responsible for improved sensation, increased blood flow, improved oxygenation of tissue, relief of pain and potential local nerve regeneration (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Franconi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Iravani et al., 2020</xref>). The findings from these research studies suggest acupuncture impacts multiple pathways both central and peripheral, which provides a possible theoretical framework to explain how and why acupuncture might work to manage the complex symptom profile seen in CIPN.</p>
              <p id="p0035">A service evaluation at the study site (n = 18), utilising an established acupuncture protocol of weekly sessions for 10-weeks, reported improvements in CIPN symptoms for 14 participants whose symptoms were refractory to standard management practice (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Donald et al., 2011</xref>). Additional benefits included reduction in use of analgesia and improved sleep. The current trial was designed to build on the clinical experience of the in-house CIPN acupuncture protocol. This protocol has been further validated more recently as similar acupuncture protocols for CIPN, with treatments delivered once or twice a week for between 8 weeks and 16 weeks, have been used in other clinical studies (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). The current ACUFOCIN trial was set up to investigate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of a 10-week course of acupuncture, added to standard of care, for the management of patients’ most troublesome symptoms relating to CIPN measured by a self-reported outcome scale. The research question for the work was as follows: "Does the addition of acupuncture to standard treatment reduce the level of CIPN experienced by patients during or following treatment with neurotoxic chemotherapy?"</p>

The study was set over two sites, which form part of a large tertiary cancer centre in Northwest England. Ethical approval was received from the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West. Greater Manchester East on 19th February 2015 (Reference: 14/NW/1492). Written consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
                <p id="p0045">The primary objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of a 10-week course of acupuncture in the management of patients most troublesome symptoms relating to CIPN as measured by subjective improvement in most troublesome symptom of CIPN as measured by the Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM): Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP2). The secondary objectives were to record clinicians’ functional assessments of CIPN, including any improvement of CIPN to grade ≤ I, graded in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. To additionally document concomitant CIPN medication usage, patient reported pain related scores, quality of life assessments using the European Organisation for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and CIPN20 module, acupuncture treatment compliance and uptake of the offer of acupuncture at the end of the study period.</p>
                <p id="p0050">The primary outcome on which the study was powered, was a two point or better improvement in MYMOP 2 score for the self-declared most troublesome CIPN symptom (the definition of “success”). With 1:1 allocation, a 10% one-tail significance level and 90% power if the true ‘success’ proportions were 0.30 and 0.55 respectively 100 participants were required. To allow for attrition the recruitment target was 120. Given the relaxed type I error, rejection of the null hypothesis was to be taken as evidence meriting testing the intervention in a fully powered phase III trial. Feasibility and acceptability of the current study design was addressed through monitoring participant completion and retention. There were post-hoc minimum thresholds agreed for acceptability of ≥80% acupuncture delivery and ≥80% retention (i.e. return of the primary outcome). This was in addition to a nested qualitative study, the results of which will be published in a separate paper.</p>
                <p id="p0055">Recruitment ran between April 2015 and November 2018. Participants remained on the study for 10 weeks, with those allocated to the Acupuncture arm attending the hospital for acupuncture every week, with a follow-up one week after the final acupuncture session to document adverse events. The aim of this study was to verify data from clinical practice, therefore no long-term follow up was included.</p>
                <p id="p0060">Initially, participants with breast cancer and multiple myeloma only were eligible for randomisation, if their neuropathy was of grade II or above (CTCAE v4.03). The protocol was amended to include gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer diagnoses, thereby incorporating participants who would have been exposed to the three classes of drugs with the highest rates of neurotoxicity: platinum-based drugs (e.g. ovarian, colorectal), taxanes (e.g. breast, ovarian) and thalidomide (multiple myeloma) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Banach et al., 2017</xref>). It is recognised that is will introduce a higher degree of heterogeneity onto the chemotherapy regimens, which may affect the pattern of CIPN and treatment outcomes. However, the focus of this initial (pragmatic) study was to explore whether acupuncture could offer a treatment of CIPN regardless of how it presents. Inclusion of participants on and post treatment was permitted, to explore effectiveness of acupuncture of both ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’ CIPN.</p>
                <p id="p0065">Participants randomised to the Acupuncture intervention arm (A) received 10 weekly sessions of acupuncture from a trained acupuncturist in addition to medication to manage symptoms of CIPN in accordance with local clinical policy (gabapentin/pregabalin, and/or amitriptyline). Participants randomised to the Control arm (C) received only medication to manage symptoms of CIPN in accordance with local clinical policy.</p>

                  <p id="p0125">The intervention was documented based on the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) recommendations for reporting acupuncture trials (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">MacPherson et al., 2015</xref>). The acupuncture protocol, including standardised points identified for CIPN, was developed by the seven acupuncturists providing the clinical service, through a collaborative review of practice at the study site, and was based on literature available at the time. This was validated through a service evaluation focused on acupuncture for CIPN (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Donald et al., 2011</xref>) and is described below.</p>
                  <p id="p0130">Participants received a standardised 40-min, weekly acupuncture session. If a participant was experiencing both lower and upper limb CIPN, a maximum of 26 core points would be needled as follows: Eight bilateral core points (LV3, SP6, ST36, EXLE (Ba Feng) and BL60 for lower limb CIPN, as utilised by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Ye (2010)</xref> and <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Schroeder et al., (2012)</xref>.

                  <p id="p0190">The acupuncturist identified any AEs related to acupuncture prior to each weekly treatment and documented them on the primary data form.

                <p id="p0200">All outcome data was collected at baseline, 6 and 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was pre-defined as the 10-week data from the Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM): "Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile" (MYMOP2), see supplementary material 1 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Paterson 1996</xref>). With this validated scale, participants identified and graded their own worst symptom, thus data capture was flexible enough to address the complexity of CIPN. MYMOP2 is scored on an integer 0–6 scale with higher scores denoting greater issues. The clinicians used standardised questions and visual assessments of function, in accordance with CTCAE v4.03. The secondary endpoint was functional improvement set at reduction of CIPN to grade ≤ I (CTCAE v4.03). Clinicians were blind to initial study allocation; however, as assessments were undertaken within a standard clinic setting, it cannot be guaranteed that participants did not disclose their study arm during the appointment.</p>

                <p id="p0225"><underline>EORTC QLQ-CIPN20</underline>: During the data collection period of the study, advice was sought and received from the EORTC that previously proposed subscales for this PROM (sensory, motor and autonomic) had been found unreliable. The current EORTC recommendation is to use an overall score based on the first 18 of the 20 items in the questionnaire. This maps to a 0–100 scale with lower scores being better. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with adjustment for baseline score, diagnosis and treatment status.</p>
                <p id="p0230"><underline>EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score</underline>: The Summary Score was calculated from the mean of 13 of the 15 QLQ-C30 scales (the Global Quality of Life scale and the Financial Impact scale were not included). Prior to calculating the mean, certain symptom scales are reversed to obtain a uniform direction of all scales. The summary score was only calculated if all the required 13 scale scores were available (using scale scores based on the completed items, provided that at least 50% of the items in that scale have been completed). This results in a 0–100 scale in which higher scores represents better overall quality of life. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with adjustment for baseline score, diagnosis and treatment status.</p>
                <p id="p0235"><underline>Participant reported pain scores</underline>: Participants were asked to complete diaries in which they recorded their worst pain daily on an integer 0–10 likert scale with landmarks (0 = “no pain at all”, 10 = “the most intense pain I can imagine”). Within-subject weekly mean scores were calculated, and the week 1 means were taken as baseline as there was no true baseline i.e., no pre-randomisation diary. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with adjustment for baseline score, diagnosis and treatment status.</p>
                <p id="p0240"><underline>Longitudinal models</underline>: Outcome data were also recorded at week 6 and longitudinal models with both week 6 and week 10 outcomes were fitted in further exploratory analyses. These models again adjusted for baseline value, diagnosis, and treatment status. In addition, they included the week effect and the full interaction of week with each of the other model terms. With this approach we were able to assess differences in the trial arm effect between weeks 6 and 10.</p>

                  <p id="p0270">Data was available for 108 of 120 randomised participants, which was above the 100 participants required to adequately power the study. Data showed 36/53 (68%) successes in the Acupuncture (A) arm compared to 18/55 (33%) in the Control (C) arm. The success odds ratio from a logistic regression model was 4.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 9.6; p &lt; 0.001; A vs C) after covariate adjustment. With the worst-best case sensitivity analysis the 8 missing outcomes in the Acupuncture arm were imputed as “failures” and the 4 in the Control arm as “successes”. There were 36/61 (59%) successes in the Acupuncture arm compared to 22/59 (37%) in the Control arm and the adjusted success odds ratio was 2.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 5.0; p = 0.02; A vs C).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0320">Studies to date would suggest acupuncture may be beneficial for treatment of CIPN. However, because of the complexity of symptom load it is a challenge to validate effectiveness for all presentations (e.g., thermal control and paraesthesia). To capture preliminary data encompassing impact of acupuncture on all aspects of CIPN in a way that was meaningful to the participants, the primary outcome measure for this study was the self-reported MYMOP2. Participants identified their own most challenging symptoms, described and scored in a way that was relevant to them. ‘Success’ of acupuncture as an intervention was set as a ≥ 2-point improvement in symptom score, with this being accepted as a clinically significant reduction in symptom burden. The results from this study showed a highly significant level of benefit, with double the number of participants in the Acupuncture arm showing a ‘success’ at week 10 compared to those in the Control arm. Secondary outcome data from clinicians' functional assessments also showed a significant level of benefit for participants receiving acupuncture in addition to standard medication compared to those receiving standard care alone. The results from the clinician rated outcome appear to endorse the suggested 2-point reduction in MYMOP2 scores as indicating a clinically meaningful response to treatment, as CTCAE grade ≤1 is often the threshold to recommence treatment. Additional secondary outcome data from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and associated CIPN-20 was collected to facilitate a more comprehensive data set, as it is recognised that the impact of CIPN is notoriously difficult to capture using only one measure (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., 2019a</xref>). This is as has already been alluded to, in large part because although many cases CIPN involve painless sensory loss, there is a significant minority of patients suffering painful symptoms, both of which negatively impact quality of life (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bonhof et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, this study shows that in this cohort of patients, acupuncture proved to be a safe addition to the treatment package for patients with CIPN, even for those on active chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="p0325">Evidence of effective pharmacological interventions for CIPN, such as tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics and opioids, is limited and inconclusive (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Jordan et al., 2020</xref>) and there is a risk of potential side effects including nausea, constipation and changes to sleep patterns (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Desforges et al., 2022</xref>). The exception is the use of Duloxetine, which has appropriate evidence of efficacy from clinical trials and is approved as a treatment for established painful CIPN by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), albeit with a limited amount of benefit (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Desforges et al., 2022</xref>). Whilst there continue to be challenges to pharmaceutical management of CIPN, in recent years, acupuncture has been identified as a possible alternative, non-pharmaceutical approach (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bao et al., 2018</xref>). There is increasing evidence in the literature supporting the benefits of acupuncture in related fields such as pain related conditions, including neck pain (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Blossfeldt 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Vickers et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">British Acupuncture Council, 2021a</xref>), tension-type headaches (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Linde et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">British Acupuncture Council, 2021b</xref>) and lower back pain (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">British Acupuncture Council, 2021c</xref>). Our findings are in line with these findings and indicate there was a significant level of benefit from adding acupuncture into routine pharmaceutical treatment of patients with CIPN, with improved quality of life and reduced symptom burden in this cohort. These results are in line with studies utilising similar choices of acupuncture points, such as the work by <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., (2019a)</xref> and recent meta-analyses of multiple smaller studies (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0330">Whilst there is a growing body of evidence supporting the benefit of acupuncture in CIPN, the studies tend to be small, there is little consistency in design and no long-term outcome data. In order to provide preliminary data looking at the length of treatment required to afford benefit from acupuncture for symptoms of CIPN, longitudinal models were used to compare effects of the acupuncture at week six and ten. Significant benefit was seen at both time points however, the magnitude was less at week six. It will therefore be appropriate to undertake further exploratory analyses to better understand whether there are certain sub-sets of patients, who will require a longer course of acupuncture, such as those on certain chemotherapy protocols, or with a specific symptom burden. Exploratory sub-group analyses suggests that participants with breast cancer may have a lower odds ratio of achieving a successful outcome as defined by the ≥2 point improvement in MYMOP2 at week 10 than those in the other disease groups (OR = 1.7 vs 12.5, test for interaction; p = 0.02). In addition, these exploratory analyses showed that participants who described ‘numbness’ as their most troublesome symptom also appeared to have a lower odds ratio for successful outcome than those that did not, though this was not statistically significantly (OR = 2.3 vs 7.1, test for interaction; p = 0.18).</p>
              <p id="p0335">Using a Patient Reported Outcome Measure to power the study and provide primary data was key to the study design as it ensured that the data captured was person specific for all participants and flexible enough to facilitate them describing their symptoms in a way which was meaningful to them. Whilst MYMOP2 is a well validated tool, this is to our knowledge, the first time it has been used in a study looking at CIPN. Here we have shown the tool is capable of identifying clinical relevance in symptom burden, and in view of the increasing importance on patient reported outcomes for both regulatory and commissioning bodies (European <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Medicines Agency, 2016</xref>), it would be appropriate to continue its use in future studies, alongside more traditional measures.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="p0340">Reported benefit by participants from the addition of acupuncture, appeared to be part-validated by the clinicians’ grading of motor skills. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the intervention and communication between participant and clinician within the clinic environment, it was impossible to guarantee blinding of clinicians to study arm during the week 6 &amp; 10 assessments. For any future study, it is recommended that data be triangulated with an objective outcome such as nerve conduction studies.</p>
                <p id="p0345">Inclusion of multiple disease groups, at different stages of their treatment and being treated using multiple drug regimens, may be seen as a limitation. However, this facilitated inclusion of the three main classes of drugs known to cause the highest levels of neurotoxicity: platinum-based drugs (e.g., colorectal), taxanes (e.g., breast) and thalidomide (multiple myeloma) (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Banach et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the inclusion of participants who were being treated with chemotherapy as well as those for whom chemotherapy was complete, could be seen as over-complicating the design, however it did facilitate the potential to explore response to acupuncture for both ‘acute’ and ‘chronic’ CIPN.</p>
                <p id="p0350">The decision not to incorporate sham acupuncture as a control was not straight forward and may be a limitation. It was made to avoid control participants having to attend for 10 weekly sessions. This was a concern highlighted in a pre-study survey of patients being treated with acupuncture within the clinical service, asked for their opinion of the study design. Because the study site was a tertiary centre, many participants lived a long distance away, had poor mobility and felt that inclusion of an arm giving sham acupuncture would have put them off taking part. From a clinical perspective, there were concerns regarding unmasking, given the complexity of delivering a sham treatment in a clinical setting, as well as the constraints of limited resource of acupuncturists, whose time was not funded within the trial. Finally, there are criticisms of various sham acupuncture methods in the literature, with debate as to whether they can elicit therapeutic responses, thus compromising interpretation of results (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Franconi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Freed et al., 2021</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., 2019b</xref>). The decision about whether to include sham acupuncture in future studies will be revisited. The decision will in part be informed by the results of a nested qualitative study within this current trial, which sought to gather additional data about feasibility and user acceptability of being in the trial and receiving acupuncture, in addition to exploring the impact of living with CIPN,.</p>

                <title>Clinical implications and future work</title>
                <p id="p0355">The study set out to explore whether acupuncture could, alongside commonly used pharmaceutical options, maintain/improve physical functioning/mobility, reduce symptoms relating to sensation (including pain and dexterity), enhance wellbeing and when appropriate, facilitate ongoing treatment with drugs designed to reduce mortality from cancer. The results from this cohort suggest short-term clinical benefit from acupuncture and add to the growing evidence base for this non-pharmacological treatment as a treatment for CIPN. The data from this study has provided additional evidence, which both patients and healthcare professionals can use to inform decisions regarding the possible use of acupuncture in this context. However, the design of the study was such that only short-term benefit (10 weeks) was evidenced. For assessment of longer-term value, a defined follow-up period would be required.</p>
                <p id="p0360">To address some of the issues highlighted by this study, it is proposed that a larger multicentre study be undertaken. The authors propose that the design of any future trial incorporates protocols to monitor continuation of effect (e.g. teaching self-needling or offering less frequent ‘maintenance’ sessions). In addition, further exploration of factors, which could potentially alter the optimum length of treatment required (e.g. identifying numbness as a key symptom), would be a reasonable consideration. Finally, a full cost-benefit analysis is proposed to strengthen the case for the adoption of acupuncture as a potential patient care pathway for CIPN within the NHS.</p>

              <p id="p0365">In summary, the data from this study have corroborated the results from a previous service evaluation and other smaller studies in the literature (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Molassiotis et al., 2019b</xref>), confirming that this cohort of participants benefited from the acupuncture they received. Specifically, the current data set also suggests acupuncture can impact the complex symptom burden associated with CIPN, not just the pain.
