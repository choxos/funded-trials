                  <p id="Par1">Distribution of take-home naloxone (THN) by emergency services may increase access to THN and reduce deaths and morbidity from opioid overdose. As part of a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of distribution of THN kits and education within ambulance services and Emergency Departments (EDs), we used qualitative methods to explore key stakeholdersâ perceptions of feasibility and acceptability of delivering the trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We undertook semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 26 people who use opioids and with 20 paramedics and ED staff from two intervention sites between 2019 and 2021. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework Analysis.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">People using opioids reported high awareness of overdose management, including personal experience of THN use. Staff perceived emergency service provision of THN as a low-cost, low-risk intervention with potential to reduce mortality, morbidity and health service use. Staff understood the trial aims and considered it compatible with their work. All participants supported widening access to THN but reported limited trial recruitment opportunities partly due to difficulties in consenting patients during overdose. Procedural problems, restrictive recruitment protocols, limited staff buy-in and patients already owning THN limited trial recruitment. Determining trial effectiveness was challenging due to high levels of alternative community provision of THN.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Distribution of THN in emergency settings was considered feasible and acceptable for stakeholders but an RCT to establish the effectiveness of THN delivery is unlikely to generate further useful evidence due to difficulties in recruiting patients and assessing benefits.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Accidental overdose and death from opioids is a significant public health problem, with around 100,000 annual deaths globally, with relatively high rates particularly in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Non-fatal overdose is associated with long-term morbidity, and increased health service use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Rapid administration of the opioid antagonist, naloxone can reduce likelihood of respiratory arrest and death from opioid overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the UK, regulation of naloxone provision was changed in 2015 to enable supply of naloxone without prescription by people working for drug treatment services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Take home naloxone (THN) distribution programmes supply THN to people at risk of overdose for swift administration by people without formal medical training, prior to contacting emergency services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These programmes are usually managed within the community, mainly by specialist drug services or police departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, programmes have been developed to administer THN through emergency services, either through provision of THN kits or prescription of THN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Despite significant evidence about the benefits of naloxone as an effective drug to reverse opioid overdose, evidence about the effectiveness of THN programmes in reducing morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose either in specialist drug settings or emergency service settings is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Small observational studies have shown that distribution of THN in EDs is likely to be feasible, but uptake has been low, particularly when THN has been delivered as prescription rather than kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] Although distribution via ambulance services may be more effective due to many opioid usersâ reluctance to travel to ED, evidence of feasibility within this field is even more limited. Notably there is a lack of evidence around risks of inadequate response or return to state of overdose following lay administration of THN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], although a recent study identified THN provision does not appear to lead to increased substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">This qualitative study was part of a wider study, examining the feasibility of carrying out a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) of THN distribution in emergency settings, using anonymised linked data to capture outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the trial with key stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] Specifically, we spoke to people who use opioids to understand their perspectives on the acceptability of THN delivered from emergency settings, and to emergency services staff involved in delivering the feasibility study to understand whether (a) a randomised controlled trial of THN would be feasible and (b) whether delivery of THN in emergency settings would be feasible.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par8">The trial recruited from two intervention and two matched control Emergency Departments and their associated Ambulance Services in England and Wales. The intervention is described within the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and involved ED and ambulance staff providing education and distributing THN kits to patients consenting to receiving the kit within the TIME trial. Kits contained a multi-dose syringe of naloxone, intramuscular needles, and instructions for drug administration, basic life support and instructions for calling emergency services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

              <title>Study design and setting</title>
              <p id="Par9">We used qualitative methods using semi-structured interviews and focus groups with two groups of key stakeholders: ED and ambulance staff from both study areas and people with experience of opioid use accessing treatment centres or third sector (charity-funded) support groups. The latter group were people with experience of injecting opioids but not directly involved in the trial. This was in response to Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) panel members and funder advice suggested recruitment of trial participants would not be feasible. We therefore used this group to represent potential recipients of THN.</p>

            <sec id="Sec4">
              <title>Selection of participants</title>
              <p id="Par10">People with opioid injection experience were recruited from two substance use treatment centres and one third sector support organisation within the two study areas. Potential participants for opioid user interviews (&gt;â18, experience of injecting drug use or carer/partner of service user) were identified by staff within the drug treatment centres/third sector organisation.</p>
              <p id="Par11">We recruited staff from the 2 EDs and Ambulance Services in the intervention arm of the trial. We sampled purposively for organisation, sex and role. We initially planned to undertake staff baseline focus groups at 0â3 months, then at 6 months to understand how the intervention had been adopted. However, due to recruitment pauses in the trial, limited staff availability for focus groups and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted to conduct individual telephone semi-structured interviews while the trial was running. Participating staff were invited to take part in the interviews by the ED and Ambulance Service research leads. In total, 278 staff were trained to supply THN kits to eligible patients (132 ED, 146 ambulance), 60 THN kits were supplied to eligible patients as part of the trial (ED 52, ambulance 8) and eligible patients were not offered THN kits 164 times (ED 159, ambulance 5).</p>

              <p id="Par13">Topic guides were developed for the study (see supplementary file).</p>
              <p id="Par14">Staff topic guides were guided by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] using the constructs of coherence (what the intervention involves &amp; its purpose), cognitive participation (who has a role in delivering the intervention), collective action (how the intervention was delivered and what enabled or hindered uptake) and reflexive monitoring (assessment of effectiveness). NPT is suitable for use in feasibility studies, can be applied flexibly and can be used to help understand what people do rather than what they say they will do. Topic guides aimed to explore whether, why, and how THN did or did not become part of routine practice in each site during the feasibility trial. A focus group plus three individual interviews took place within a meeting room of one organisation, with remaining interviews undertaken by telephone.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Opioid user semi-structured interview topic guides focused on personal and peer group experiences of opioid use, overdose and their perspectives on the potential barriers and enablers to THN delivery by ambulance and ED staff. Interviews were undertaken face-to-face with participants within the recruiting organisations. All participants were offered a Â£20 Love2Shop voucher.</p>

              <p id="Par16">All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were organised using NVivo 12 â¢. Due to the different focus of the two groups of stakeholders (one had experience in delivering the intervention, the other comprised potential recipients of the intervention), we analysed data sets individually then triangulated findings to identify areas of convergence and conflict. We analysed interviews using Framework Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], based broadly on the constructs of NPT (using the framework described in Huddleston et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]), adding further themes relating to the trial itself rather than the intervention. Initial coding was undertaken by JH &amp; JL (opioid users), JL and FS (staff) and a subset were double coded. The coding structure was further refined, and analysis undertaken after discussion between JH, FS, JL and PB.</p>

Whilst delivering THN in emergency settings offered opportunities to access populations who might not otherwise obtain THN (e.g. those not accessing community drug services etc.) there were concerns that patients coming out of overdose were not necessarily receptive to discussing how to use THN at this stage, often being confused or aggressive.<disp-quote><p id="Par48"><italic>Yeah.

                <p id="Par53">Some service users reported reluctance to travel in an ambulance, attend the ED or even contact emergency services, due to concerns about being in possession of drugs when police were present, or unpleasant withdrawal effects following Naloxone administration. They recognised the potentially beneficial role for THN distribution by ambulance services but did not reflect on how the ED might usefully provide THN, lacking experience of ED attendance post overdose. Staff perceived opportunities for ambulance staff to deliver THN to be potentially greater than for ED staff, partly due to higher contact rates, but also due to having more contact within the community and opportunities to engage with friends and family.<disp-quote><p id="Par54"><italic>The thing is thereâs a fear round drug users that if you start ringing 999, the police are going to come, but a lifeâs a life, isnât it?â (Service User 2, site 2)</italic>.</p><p id="Par55">I <italic>would say that a lot of times we would go to overdoses, that would then refuse to come in because youâd give them the NARCAN and theyâd wake up, and have capacity to refuse.

                <p id="Par59">The trial struggled to recruit staff who could recruit patients, and patients themselves, principally due to procedural problems relating to the timing and processes of the trial. Whilst the intervention was described as well resourced, with easy-to-follow training, engagement of staff differed between the two EDs. One ED recruited few staff and did not engage with the qualitative work. The other ED had a proactive research lead who championed the trial, which resulted in greater staff engagement and willingness counter problems in recruiting patients (e.g. engaging known opioid users attending ED).</p>
                <p id="Par60">High staff turnover in both ambulance services and EDs resulted in difficulties recruiting and training enough staff for the trial to be adequately cascaded and maintained. This was exacerbated by an extended recruitment period due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused the trial to be paused, combined with a reported reduction in number of ambulance calls to overdoses during the national lockdown. Recruitment pauses early in the trial due to protocol changes also meant staff were unaware when the trial was reopened to recruitment so potential patients were missed.<disp-quote><p id="Par61"><italic>The difficulty was the trial had been running for quite a long time and the department has a really high turnover of staff. So I would train people and then they would leave, or there will be people that havenât been trained in it that because theyâre just coming through constantly, I couldnât keep up. Also, even if they did have the training the trialâs been running over a period of two years so they might forget everything Iâve said or some of the things Iâve said.â [ED nurse, ED1 interview]</italic>.</p><p id="Par62"><italic>I think it can be difficult from a medical staff point of view, because in A&amp;E we have a fairly high turnover. So, a lot of SHOs are only in the department for four months. And I think there was a big push with the trial and, you know, putting up the posters and really trying to make people aware. But with COVID and obviously other things that have gone on, I donât know that the message has been as clear or consistent throughout the whole time. [Paramedic, ED1]</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par63">Recruitment protocols specified patients could be recruited if fully conscious. However, ambulance crews reported that management protocols for opioid overdose recommended keeping patients from fully coming out of overdose so that they were safe but not fully alert, which meant they were unable to recruit and consent them. Staff also reported high levels of patient refusal, partly due to difficulties in engaging during overdose, but also due to patients stating they already owned a THN kit that had been issued in the community.<disp-quote><p id="Par64"><italic>So, I know when I went through my paramedic training, there was a big emphasis on if the, you know, respiratory rate is good and the observations are good, just keep them in that groggy state until we can get to somewhere thatâs more â thatâs safer.

Participants indicated that the beliefs and behaviours required to enable widespread acceptance of the intervention may not have been held by all colleagues, with some evidence of wider scepticism about the provision of THN by emergency services. Concerns arose from doubts about the ability to make a significant difference at a population level and about the âsafety netâ effect, suspecting opioid users might take a higher dose, when knowing Naloxone is on hand should they overdose. Some service users acknowledged this risk, but also reported opioid use was dictated by affordability.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par83">Stakeholders recognised the potential benefits of the intervention and supported it in principle, although there were problems with recruitment and delivery of the intervention within the trial. Stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to increase access to THN via emergency settings and the intervention was seen as simple, low risk and feasible, with potentially more support for distribution via the ambulance service. Difficulties associated with the trial delivery itself led to low patient recruitment and recognition that the impact of emergency service delivery of THN may be limited. Assessment of effectiveness was problematic due to significant availability of THN from other sources. There was recognition that wider engagement of emergency service staff to deliver the intervention may be limited, with emergency services staff at times struggling to engage patients, particularly given the current context of rising demand for emergency care services. However, staff who were engaged in the study felt that the potentially high level of benefit for a small population of patients to be worthwhile.</p>
              <p id="Par84">Service users recognised the difficulties associated with engaging themselves and peers during overdose situations, but similarly strongly supported the potentially life-saving intervention. Hawk et al. identified that opioid users wanted EDs to offer harm reduction resources such as THN and overdose prevention education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Other studies have also supported the finding that staff are supportive of Emergency Service distribution of THN in principle. Sokol et al. reported provider attitudes showed increasing understanding towards opioid users, and a desire to feel that they are making a difference to patientsâ lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hawk et al. (2022) reported improving attitudes amongst ED staff towards opioid overdose survivors and a survey of staff in Canada and Australia showed around 9/10 of staff supported provision of THN in the ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>])</p>
              <p id="Par85">However, despite support in principle, studies found that clinicians were missing critical opportunities to prescribe naloxone in pilot THN programmes within the ED, with between 8 and 11% of eligible patients receiving a naloxone prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and only around one in only ten prescriptions being converted when THN was prescribed rather than provided. Holland et al. interviewed pharmacists and ED physicians about theoretical provision of THN in the ED and identified similar willingness to provide THN, awareness of the potential benefits but also concerns of some negative attitudes from a minority of staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Chua et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] highlighted prescription rates were four times higher for epinephrine after ED visits for anaphylaxis than for naloxone or buprenorphine for opioid overdose. This suggests that low prescribing in this population is due to factors relating to the condition being prescribed for and may result from stigma relating to this patient population. This supports our finding that although emergency service clinicians were supportive in principle, this may not translate into practice in part due to negative attitudes towards the population group being targeted.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Lebin et al. sought to identify predictors of receiving a naloxone prescription through their ED programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. They found that users were less likely to be given a prescription if they had a history of opioid use in the past which suggests that many may already have had THN from another source at ED visit. Papp et al. were unable to detect a significant difference in patient outcomes for patients who received THN following ED attendance for overdose but the study was under-powered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. They similarly observed the likelihood that THN would be used by other patients than the people who were offered the THN.</p>
              <p id="Par87">A recent systematic review of opioid overdose interventions delivered in the ED suggested that THN distribution via emergency services is feasible and acceptable to patients but also highlighted the paucity of evidence of effectiveness of delivery in this setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] with systematic evaluation of outcomes unlikely. The authors identified that adequate staffing and role responsibility was required for sustainable implementation of any overdose prevention interventions.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p id="Par88">This study was subject to a number of limitations. Part of the study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic which affected both the trial itself and recruitment into this qualitative study. The move from focus groups to individual interviews may have enabled staff to talk more openly but also meant we were unable to draw on interaction between team members to explore shared and divergent experiences of the implementation of the study. Participants who engaged with the study were likely to be more receptive to the delivery of THN in emergency settings than other staff who may not wish to engage in research, or who did not engage with the intervention, as suggested by the findings. We may have achieved a more representative sample if we had been able to recruit staff directly, rather than through research leads.</p>
              <p id="Par89">Due to anticipated problems in recruiting patients who received THN from Emergency Services we recruited service users who had experience of overdose and opioid use rather than patients who were offered the THN within this study. This means the user perspective could only explore opioid overdose and THN experiences and opinions outside the RCT. The sample were also people who were engaging with treatment programmes, who may be more responsive to carrying THN people who use opioids but were not engaged with treatment programmes.</p>
              <p id="Par90">Interviews with opioid users were conducted within the service treatment centres and participants were sometimes distracted, often providing short responses. Despite good initial PPI involvement, changes in personal circumstances of two PPI members meant they withdrew and it was then difficult to maintain a stable PPI group to inform our study interpretation phase. We were however able to draw on the Sheffield Addiction Recovery Research Panel (ShARRP) who regularly commented on study progress.</p>
              <p id="Par91">The study took place in the UK where THN is funded via local authority commissioning which may limit some of the transferability of findings, particularly given barriers to THN arising from lack of central funding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, cost was not highlighted as a significant barrier to implementation of THN programmes in a review incorporating majority US-based studies, with attidudinal barriers being highlighted as more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. </p>

            <sec id="Sec14">
              <title>Implications</title>
              <p id="Par92">Distribution of THN in emergency settings appears to be feasible and acceptable for all stakeholders and may widen access to THN for those not engaging with wider community drug services. Adoption of THN distribution within emergency settings appears to be a low-risk intervention and may offer benefit if normalised into everyday practice. Given the difficulties in maintaining recruitment of staff and ambulance or ED patients during the feasibility study, it appears unlikely that a full trial would be feasible. This demonstrates the importance of undertaking feasibility or pilot studies prior to undertaking full RCTs.</p>
              <p id="Par93">Further RCTs of THN in emergency settings may be limited by difficulties in recruitment, particularly where THN provision from other settings is widespread. Other observational evaluation methods to understand the effectiveness of THN provision may be required, following widespread distribution of THN kits and monitoring of drug-related deaths by interrupted time series methods. Extending THN provision to peers and family of people at risk of overdose could offer additional opportunities to improve outcomes from opioid overdose. Whilst emergency services staff recognised the benefit of THN as an intervention, there is some evidence that negative attitudes from some staff need to be overcome to maximise the potential for delivering THN in emergency settings. These attitudes need to be addressed, but also mean that provision of THN via other routes such as specialist drug clinics will still be paramount.</p>
