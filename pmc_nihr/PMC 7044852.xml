                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Lateral compression type 1 (LC1) pelvic fractures are the most common type of pelvic fracture. The majority of LC1 fractures are considered stable. Fractures where a complete sacral fracture is present increases the degree of potential instability and have the potential to displace over time. Non-operative management of these unstable fractures may involve restricted weight bearing and significant rehabilitation. Frequent monitoring with X-rays is also necessary for displacement of the fracture. Operative stabilisation of these fractures may be appropriate to prevent displacement of the fracture. This may allow patients to mobilise pain-free, quicker.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study is a feasibility study to inform the design of a full definitive randomised controlled trial to guide the most appropriate management of these injuries. Participants will be recruited from major trauma centres and randomly allocated to either operative or non-operative management of their injuries. A variety of outcome instruments, measuring health-related quality of life, functional outcome and pain, will be completed at several time points up to 12 months post injury. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken with participants to explore their views of the treatments under investigation and trial processes.</p>
                  <p>Eligibility and recruitment to the study will be analysed to inform the feasibility of a definitive trial. Completion rates of the measurement instruments will be assessed, as well as their sensitivity to change and the presence of floor or ceiling effects in this population, to inform the choice of the primary outcome for a definitive trial.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval for the study was given by the South West—Central Bristol NHS Research Ethics Committee on 2nd July 2018 (Ref; 18/SW/0135). The study will be reported in relevant specialist journals and through presentation at specialist conferences.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>The Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database indicate increasing numbers of pelvic ring fractures. In the financial year 2015/16, TARN recorded 6407 pelvic ring fractures in England and Wales of which half were associated with high-energy trauma. Fractures associated with a side or lateral compression force are the most common; a subgroup of these are called lateral compression type 1 (LC1). LC1 fractures make up approximately 60% of pelvic ring fractures,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> which equates to approximately 3800 patients a year within England and Wales. A proportion of pelvic fractures are sustained as a result of simple trips or falls and these are generally in the older person where bone quality is frequently poor. Stabilisation of fractures in elderly patients presents technical problems due to the difficulty in achieving adequate fixation in osteoporotic bone. The mortality during index hospital admission associated with LC1 fractures ranges from 5.1% to 8.6%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
                <p>LC1 fracture patterns are a heterogeneous group of injuries, divided into those involving a complete or an incomplete fracture of the sacrum with or without an injury to the anterior pelvic ring.</p>
                <p>The majority of LC1 fractures are considered stable enough to allow rehabilitation without later displacement. Numerous studies have shown complete sacral fractures to be present in 32%–50% of LC1 fractures.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> The combination of a complete sacral fracture and either unilateral or bilateral pubic rami fractures increases the degree of potential instability. Unstable LC1 fractures of the pelvis have a tendency to displace significantly over time.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Bruce <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reported 32% of patients with a complete sacral fracture and unilateral pubic rami fractures, and 68% of patients with a complete sacral fracture and bilateral rami fractures, went on to have significant displacement.</p>
                <p>This, potentially unstable, subgroup of LC1 fractures may still be managed non-operatively. Patients would usually be allowed to mobilise as able although they may be advised to restrict the amount of weight they put through the injured side and will require walking aids provided by a physiotherapist. They also require frequent X-rays to monitor for any progression in fracture displacement. Patients with LC1 fractures are reported to spend up to 16 days in hospital following their injury<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and require significant rehabilitation following their discharge from acute care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These injuries can have significant implications for patients. Hoffmann <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed that even at 24 months postinjury, patients had not returned to their preinjury functional abilities. Aprato <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> found that 60% of the costs following pelvic injury were attributed to health-related work absence.</p>
                <p>It may therefore be appropriate to surgically stabilise this subgroup of more severe, potentially unstable, LC1 fractures. This involves the insertion of metalwork to prevent displacement of the fractures. While patients will still require walking aids, their ability to mobilise may be improved. Tosounidis <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> carried out a non-randomised study comparing surgical versus non-surgical management of LC1 fractures. They found that patients had significantly decreased pain at 72 hours and were able to mobilise, pain-free, quicker following surgery. They also demonstrated a shorter length of stay in patients undergoing surgical fixation. However, Hagen <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> in a retrospective study looking at patients’ pain, narcotic use and mobility following surgical stabilisation of lateral compression fractures found no significant difference in these parameters between surgically and non-surgically treated groups.</p>
                <p>Other advantages of treating these fractures surgically include a lower risk of fracture displacement and avoiding the risks associated with immobility, including chest or urinary tract infection, thrombosis and pressure sores. The disadvantages of treating LC1 fractures surgically are the risk of general anaesthesia, the physiological impact of surgery, the small risk of surgical site infection and of damage to the nerves that supply the bladder, bowel or leg muscles. As well as improving patients’ pain levels and functional abilities, surgery has been shown to provide economic benefits by reducing length of hospital stay and input required from healthcare professionals, which may outweigh the additional costs of surgery.</p>

                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>A survey on the management of LC1 fractures,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> although not specific to unstable LC1 fractures, indicated significant variation of practice in managing these fractures and agreement between surgeons was only achieved for one third of case studies.</p>
                <p>Both Hagen <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and Tosounidis <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> concluded that a randomised controlled trial of surgical versus nonsurgical management of LC1 fractures was needed. Currently there is no level 1 evidence available to guide clinicians as to the optimum management of these patients.</p>

                <title>Aim and objectives</title>
                <p>The overarching aim is to perform a definitive trial to establish whether surgical or non-surgical management of unstable LC1 fractures is most appropriate. The aim of this feasibility study is to allow us to plan a full definitive trial by measuring recruitment, retention and follow-up rates and explore participant and staff views of the trial processes.

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Patients eligible for inclusion in the study will be identified by their surgeon who will make the patient aware of the study and seek their agreement to consider participating. The study will then be fully discussed with the patient by a member of the research team at each site. Patients will be provided with a written information sheet explaining the purpose of the study and the treatments under investigation. They will be allowed sufficient time to consider the information provided and patients who agree to participate in the study will be asked to provide written consent. Patients who decline to participate in the study will be recorded on the screening log together with reasons for declining where provided.</p>
                <p>To understand patient perceptions of the recruitment process, all patients that are approached regarding their potential participation in the study will be asked to complete a short questionnaire regardless of whether they consent to participate in the feasibility study. Patients will be asked to complete these questionnaires immediately following confirmation of their decision on participating in the study. Where this is not possible a copy of the questionnaire will be sent in the post by the local research team. Responses to these questionnaires will be confidential and patients will be identified only by their screening ID. The results of this questionnaire will be analysed as an ongoing process to help inform and develop the approach of further patients.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>This feasibility study is designed to produce estimates of the parameters required to plan a definitive trial, together with enough data on outcome measures to show whether or not the ceiling effect on the Iowa instrument is likely to be a problem in the definitive trial. If 120 patients are screened as eligible and 40% agree to take part, then this will allow us to estimate the recruitment rate of 40% with a 95% CI of 31%–49% which is within 10% in either direction. Forty complete sets of data should be enough to show when a ceiling effect starts to occur although this will rely on a visual inspection of the data at each time point. If 60 sets of data are collected this will allow greater precision.</p>

                  <p>As this is a feasibility trial no formal statistical testing will be carried out. Instead the analysis will focus on reporting data that will be used for planning and for assessing the feasibility of the definitive trial.</p>
                  <p>Feasibility parameters with 95% CIs will be provided using the exact binomial method. The spread of the data and ceiling effects will be documented for all outcome variables using histograms for single time points and box plots to compare over time. Calculation of the area under the curve over time is the likely primary method of analysis for the definitive trial, and the feasibility analysis will investigate whether this would produce a sufficiently complete data set or whether it would be better to focus on a particular time point. The 95% CI for the effect sizes for all potential outcome measures will be calculated to ensure that a future trial can be planned appropriately.</p>
                  <p>The future economic evaluation is likely to present results in cost/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) terms reporting within trial and lifetime horizons. The economic feasibility work will focus on establishing the appropriate methods for collecting the outcomes, both costs and utilities, which will be of interest in the future economic evaluation, with analysis therefore limited to assessment of completeness and descriptive statistics.</p>
