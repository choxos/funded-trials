                  <title>Background and aims:</title>
                  <p>We investigated kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites levels and their association with suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and elevated peripheral inflammation. The effect of antidepressant augmentation with minocycline on KP metabolites was tested.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>We analysed data from MINocycline in DEPression, a 4-week, randomized, placebo controlled (1:1) trial of minocycline added to antidepressant treatment in 39 TRD patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18 minocycline; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 21 placebo) with C-reactive protein (CRP) ⩾1 mg/L. At baseline and at week 4, we collected data on suicidality (Beck Depression Inventory) and blood samples to measure inflammatory markers and KP metabolites. We tested (1) the association of KP metabolites ratios with inflammatory markers and suicidal ideation at baseline and (2) the role of suicidality and treatment (minocycline vs placebo) in affecting KP changes over time.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>At baseline, kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio positively correlated with high-sensitivity CRP (Spearman’s ρ = 0.35, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02) and IL-10, (ρ = 0.41, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.009); and tumour necrosis factor was positively correlated with quinolinic acid/3-hydroxykynurenine ratio (ρ = 0.55, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, participants with suicidal ideation showed higher levels of KYN/TRP (<italic toggle="yes">U</italic> = 143.000, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.02) than those without suicidal ideation. There was no significant effect of minocycline on KP metabolites changes from baseline to week 4. However, in the minocycline group, the number of participants with suicidal thoughts decreased from 44.4% (8/18) to 22.2% (4/18).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Increased KP neurotoxic metabolites are associated with elevated peripheral inflammation in depressed individuals, particularly in those with suicidal ideation. Targeting KP in this population could be a potential effective personalized approach. Whether this includes minocycline should be investigated in future larger trials.</p>

              <p>Suicidality is a frequent clinical feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) and a major global health problem. Alongside psychosocial factors, various biological mechanisms have been implicated in increasing the risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour (<xref rid="bibr32-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Pandey, 2013</xref>). For example, a dysregulation of the enzymes in the kynurenine pathway (KP) has been found in suicidal patients and suggested as potential mechanism underpinning suicidality (<xref rid="bibr5-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin, 2017a</xref>).</p>
              <p>The KP is an essential pathway in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor, tryptophan, and is strictly regulated by immune activation. Under normal conditions, a proportion of tryptophan is metabolized to kynurenine, which, in turn, is transformed by astrocytic kynurenine aminotransferases into kynurenic acid (KynA). KynA has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects, including anti-inflammatory mechanisms, reduction in glutamate excitotoxicity and enhancement of synaptic plasticity (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Kopra et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, an increased immune activation (i.e. inflammation) leads to the activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1 and 2), a key enzyme in the metabolism of tryptophan. This results in a reduction in serotonin levels and shifts the activation of KP towards the production of kynurenine neurotoxic metabolites (<xref rid="bibr26-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Nettis, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Sforzini et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>KP neurotoxic metabolites include 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). Prior studies have found that 3HK activates neuronal apoptosis and increases the concentration of oxygen reactive species (<xref rid="bibr21-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Kopra et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, QUIN is capable of forming complexes with iron which leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="bibr14-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Goda et al., 1996</xref>). As reviewed by <xref rid="bibr6-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin (2017b)</xref>, QUIN also reduces synaptogenesis and protein synthesis, more specifically of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein. Moreover, it is an agonist of the <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor, causing an increase in glutamate release by neurons and inhibition of its uptake and degradation by astrocytes, resulting in overall neurotoxicity (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin, 2017b</xref>).</p>
              <p>As an indication of IDO activation and KP dysregulation, previous works have used the increased kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio in plasma. Interestingly, an increased KYN/TRP (with increased KYN levels and lower TRP levels) has been found in individuals with MDD and a history of suicidality when compared with those without such history or with healthy controls (<xref rid="bibr3-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Messaoud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Sublette et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, raised QUIN levels and a simultaneous decrease in neuroprotective metabolites have been observed in suicidal patients, in both in vivo and post-mortem studies (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Erhardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 2011</xref>). This results in an imbalance of metabolites that modulate glutamate neurotransmission and neuroinflammation (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin, 2017b</xref>) and might lead to the development of suicidal ideation and behaviour (<xref rid="bibr5-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin, 2017a</xref>).</p>
              <p>Overall, the activation of the KP is believed to be an important mechanism linking peripheral inflammation to the onset of depression, through the production of neurotoxic metabolites, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Nettis et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, treatment interventions targeting peripheral inflammation and KP could be tested in people with immune-related depression, with a particular focus on suicidality.</p>
              <p>Previous preclinical research suggested that anti-inflammatory medications (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), as well as antidepressants with anti-inflammatory effects (e.g. venlafaxine), may exert an antidepressant effect by decreasing the levels of peripheral inflammation and by inhibiting tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (the other enzyme which activates the KP) (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Dawood et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, the expression of IDO can be reduced by anti-inflammatory drugs that reduce interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production (<xref rid="bibr33-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Pfefferkorn et al., 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2007</xref>) and by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (<xref rid="bibr34-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>). Even when mechanisms for reducing inflammation occur primarily in the periphery, research has shown that flux through the KP is decreased in the brain (<xref rid="bibr9-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Dawood et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
              <p>The antibiotic minocycline has been shown to inhibit the KP in preclinical studies. For instance, in rats injected with lipopolysaccharide, the administration of minocycline appeared to block IDO indirectly, by attenuating lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory response and thus preventing the development of depressive-like behaviours (<xref rid="bibr29-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">O’Connor et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, in a rat model of neuropathic pain, the administration of intraperitoneal minocycline diminished the mRNA levels of IDO2 and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, the enzyme leading to 3HK production (<xref rid="bibr35-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Rojewska et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, minocycline showed the ability to pass the blood–brain barrier, which would facilitate neuroprotective properties (<xref rid="bibr41-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Soczynska et al., 2012</xref>). Recent evidence further showed that minocycline modulates pathophysiological processes including oxidative stress, neurogenesis and apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation (<xref rid="bibr18-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2017</xref>). Our own group (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Nettis et al., 2021</xref>) found preliminary evidence of effectiveness of add-on treatment with minocycline in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and increased levels of peripheral inflammation. However, no study so far has investigated minocycline effect on the KP and suicidal ideation in patients with depression.</p>
              <p>With the present work, we aimed to (1) replicate previous evidence on the association between KP and suicidality in a sample of outpatients with TRD selected for increased peripheral inflammation (MINocycline in DEPression (MINDEP) study). We hypothesized that individuals with suicidal ideation would show increased IDO activity, as reflected by increased KYN/TRP ratio and increased levels of neurotoxic metabolites such as QUIN; (2) explore the association between metabolites ratios of the KP, indicating a KP diversion towards neurotoxicity and markers of peripheral inflammation and (3) explore the effect of 4-week treatment with minocycline on suicidality and KP metabolites in the same sample of patients. We hypothesized that minocycline would reduce the number of patients with suicidal ideation from baseline to week 4 of treatment and that this would be mediated by changes in the KP metabolites.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>MINDEP was a single-centre, randomized (1:1 minocycline/placebo) placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group trial of adjunctive oral minocycline (200 mg/day) added to ongoing treatment in patients who had failed to respond adequately to at least one antidepressant in the current depressive episode and had elevated peripheral inflammation as shown by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels ⩾1 mg/L. This is a CRP threshold that, according to a recent meta-analysis, defines ‘elevated levels of CRP’ that are present in around 60% of depressed patients (<xref rid="bibr31-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Osimo et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Of note, the minocycline dose of 200 mg/day was the most consistently used (and proved to be safe) in prior trials in patients with MDD (<xref rid="bibr7-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Rosenblat and McIntyre, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>All visits took place at the Clinical Research Facility of King’s College Hospital, London. Data from the same randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the longitudinal antidepressant effect of minocycline according to baseline levels of inflammation have been previously published (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Nettis et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

                <p>After a screening visit to check their eligibility, participants (all outpatients) were invited to two further visits, the baseline and the week 4 visit (end of treatment). Within 1 month from the screening visit, eligible patients came back for the baseline visit and were randomized to minocycline or placebo (1:1) in addition to their current antidepressant. In the same day, we collected a blood sample for measurement of biological markers, including the inflammatory markers and the KP metabolites, and a clinical assessment including the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) (<xref rid="bibr20-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Kneipp et al., 2010</xref>).

                <p>The final number of randomized patients was 44 (22:22). Five withdrew for different reasons (2 experienced side effects, 1 was lost in follow-up and 1 withdrew for unknown reasons in the minocycline group; 1 patient in the placebo group left for family issues); thus, the final sample consisted of 39 patients, 18 in the minocycline group and 21 in the placebo group.

                <p>The presence (or absence) of suicidal ideation was measured using the item 9 of the BDI-II scale, a self-administered questionnaire. Answers to this item were coded 0 = <italic toggle="yes">I don’t have any thoughts of killing myself</italic>; 1 = <italic toggle="yes">I have thoughts of killing myself, but I would not carry them out</italic>; 2 = <italic toggle="yes">I would like to kill myself</italic>; 3 = <italic toggle="yes">I would kill myself if I had a chance</italic>. This item was used to create a dichotomic variable with 0 = <italic toggle="yes">absence of suicidal ideation</italic> (original score = 0) and 1 = <italic toggle="yes">presence of suicidal ideation</italic> (original score ⩾ 1). Of note, this single suicide item has been considered a valid approach to assess suicidal ideation by previous research (<xref rid="bibr10-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Desseilles, 2012</xref>). The BDI showed higher sensitivity than clinician-rated scales, like the HAM-D, in capturing suicidal ideation in prior work (<xref rid="bibr28-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Newport et al., 2007</xref>). This is particularly the case of outpatient clinical trials (<xref rid="bibr11-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Desseilles et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the BDI proved to have good concurrent and predictive validity in a number of studies, to be beneficial for measuring fluctuations in suicidal ideation throughout the course of treatment (<xref rid="bibr4-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Brown, 2001</xref>) and to have significant diagnostic accuracy for suicidal ideation and risk (<xref rid="bibr15-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Green et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

                  <p>We performed Spearman correlations between peripheral inflammatory markers and kynurenine metabolites ratios indicating the progressive diversion of the KP towards the production of neurotoxic enzymes, in particular the KYN/TRP ratio, the 3HK/KYN ratio, the 3HAA/3HK ratio and the QUIN/3HK ratio. Correlations were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni.

              <p>Our study showed that individuals with suicidal ideation have a higher KYN/TRP ratio than those without suicidal ideation and that higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers are associated with an activation of the neurotoxic branch of KP. Compared with placebo, in the minocycline group, the proportion of patients with suicidal ideation halved from baseline to week 4 (showing trend levels of significance, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.09). However, such an outcome was not significantly associated with KP changes over time.</p>
              <p>Our findings of an association between increased KP activation and suicidal ideation are consistent with previous studies conducted in MDD. <xref rid="bibr3-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bradley et al.

Additionally, <xref rid="bibr43-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Sublette et al.

Similarly, <xref rid="bibr22-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Messaoud et al. (2019)</xref> found that KYN/TRP ratio was more elevated, and levels of tryptophan were much lower in MDD patients with a history of suicide attempt(s) when compared with their non-suicidal counterparts. Results from the same study further revealed an association between increased KYN/TRP ratio and suicidal ideation measured by the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (<xref rid="bibr1-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1979</xref>). The present study, however, is the first to show an association between KP and suicidality in individuals specifically selected for elevated peripheral inflammation (CRP ⩾ 1 mg/L), which, in turn, might be contributing to the resistance to standard antidepressant treatment.</p>
              <p>Several biological mechanisms have been suggested to link the KP to suicidal ideation. One hypothesis is that KP mediates the communication between peripheral and central inflammation, which has been suggested to play a role in the development of MDD suicidal ideation and has been observed in patients with suicidal history (<xref rid="bibr6-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bryleva and Brundin, 2017b</xref>).</p>
              <p>Moreover, the KP dysregulation induced by inflammatory processes leads to a depletion of serotonin and melatonin (<xref rid="bibr46-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Wislowska-Stanek et al., 2021</xref>) involved in mood and sleep–wake regulation, respectively. Finally, some KP metabolites, especially QUIN, might contribute to the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal behaviour. <xref rid="bibr12-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Erhardt et al. (2013)</xref> found that QUIN levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of suicide attempters were statistically higher than QUIN levels in healthy controls (<xref rid="bibr12-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Erhardt et al., 2013</xref>). CSF QUIN positively correlated with suicidal intent and with CSF IL-6, confirming the role of inflammation in activating the neurotoxic branch of the KP. It has been hypothesized that the elevated levels of QUIN and its neurotoxic effects could contribute to the structural and functional changes observed in brain regions of psychiatric patients with suicidal behaviour. Indeed, Steiner and colleagues found an increase in microglial QUIN in the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior midcingulate cortex in post-mortem depressed patients who died of suicide (<xref rid="bibr42-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Steiner et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p>Consistent with some of the above-mentioned studies, we found an association between KP metabolites ratios indicating a neurotoxic diversion of the KP and inflammatory markers in our sample of patients at baseline. This is a further confirmation of the role of KP in linking inflammation to depression and suggests that a subpopulation of patients with immune-related depression who are non-responsive to standard antidepressants might benefit from KP-targeted investigations and treatment. This is also in line with previous clinical evidence of a correlation between increased peripheral inflammation and increased KP activation in depressed individuals. In particular, TNF and CRP have been found to be the inflammatory markers most closely associated with plasma concentrations of KYN and KYN/TRP (<xref rid="bibr16-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Haroon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Milaneschi et al., 2021</xref>). We also found a correlation between KYN/TRP and IL-10, which seems to have pleiotropic roles: it considered primarily an anti-inflammatory cytokine that could increase in response to KP activation to maintain homeostasis. However, recent evidence suggests it could also promote immune response (<xref rid="bibr2-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Bedke et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, previous studies found an association between IL-10 and suicidal ideation. For example, in a cross-sectional study of patients with MDD and controls, levels of IL-10 were higher in MDD patients with suicidal thoughts than non-suicidal MDD patients and controls (<xref rid="bibr30-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">O’Donovan et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, several studies found an increase in cytokines levels, including IL-6 and IL-10 in suicidal victims (<xref rid="bibr39-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014</xref>). This is in line with our findings that suicidal ideation is associated with higher KYN/TRP, which, in turn, is associated with higher IL-10 levels.</p>
              <p>We noted that in patients with baseline suicidal ideation, KYN/TRP tended to decrease over time (although not significantly) in the minocycline group. Furthermore, by week 4, the minocycline group showed a reduction in the proportion of participants with suicidal ideation, compared with the placebo group (although this was also at trend levels). However, we could not find a significant effect of minocycline in affecting the KP metabolites, either in those with or in those without suicidal ideation. This could be due to the short duration of this trial (4 weeks). Indeed, our study did not detect robust changes in inflammatory markers from baseline to week 4 (<xref rid="bibr27-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Nettis et al., 2021</xref>), in contrast to previous longer trials of minocycline in depression (<xref rid="bibr38-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Savitz et al 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that after a longer treatment trial, the two longitudinal results of reduced suicidality and reduced KP dysregulation could fit together more clearly. It is also conceivable that longitudinal effects of minocycline on the KP were affected by the levels of baseline peripheral inflammation, in the same way that its antidepressant effect was limited to patients with CRP ⩾ 3 mg/dL in our previously published work.</p>
              <p>Indeed, CRP levels ⩾ 3 mg/dL have been associated with no-response to standard antidepressants in patients with MDD (<xref rid="bibr24-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Raison, 2016</xref>) and with specific markers of central inflammation (<xref rid="bibr13-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Felger et al., 2020</xref>). However, the small sample size did not allow for a further stratification of patients based on both baseline suicidal ideation and CRP ⩾ 3 mg/dL. Finally, it has to be considered that the effect of minocycline in reducing suicidal ideation could also be mediated by other mechanisms besides the KP. For example, previous work found minocycline to react with a toxic and putatively psychotogenic catecholamine breakdown product, adrenochrome, removing it from solution. Interestingly, two KP intermediates, 3-OH-kynurenine and 3-OH-anthranilic acid, seem to inhibit the minocycline–adrenochrome reaction. Further work needs to clarify the effect of these two KP intermediate products on mental illness in the absence of minocycline and their role in modulating response to the same drug (<xref rid="bibr25-02698811231173588" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study was limited by the small sample size. However, the secondary aims analyses were designed as explorative. Another limitation is that the levels of some KP metabolites (e.g., KynA) were below detectable threshold for most participants, so we could not include them in the analyses, even though we were able to identify important findings with the metabolites that were available. Finally, we excluded from the trial people with active and concerning suicidal ideation. This means that severely suicidal patients were not included, and that our subset of participants with suicidal ideation mainly had suicidal thoughts, without clear plans to act on them. This also means that our findings might reflect an association of increased KT ratio with the severity of depression, directly linked to suicidality, more than with suicidality per se. Unfortunately, we could not further explore this possibility in our sample, but future studies could attempt to clarify this. Indeed, it is possible that including participants with more severe suicidal ideation could lead to the identification of a stronger role of both KP and minocycline in suicidality. Finally, future studies might use more detailed questionnaires such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSR-S) to capture different aspects of suicidality and its association with the KP.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, KP appears to play a role in increase suicidality in patients with depression and is associated with increased inflammation. Targeting KP in these individuals (especially those unresponsive to standard treatment) could be a potential personalized approach. Although minocycline appears to reduce suicidality in this population, further studies are needed to understand whether KP may be or not the mediating mechanism of this effect.</p>
