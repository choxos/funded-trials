                <p id="Par1">The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥5% at week 104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 152) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0) years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9) kg m<sup>–2</sup> and weight of 106.0 (22.0) kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 104 was −15.2% in the semaglutide group (<italic>n</italic> = 152) versus −2.6% with placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of −12.6 %-points (95% confidence interval, −15.3 to −9.8; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥5% from baseline at week 104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104 weeks versus placebo.

              <p id="Par3">Behavioral intervention incorporating modifications in diet and physical activity remains the foundation of treatment for overweight and obesity. However, because behavioral intervention is often not associated with clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss, pharmacotherapy is recommended as an additional tool for long-term weight management in people with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg m<sup>–2</sup>, or at least 27 kg m<sup>–2</sup> in those with weight-related comorbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>

              <p id="Par17">In STEP 5, once-weekly treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg as an adjunct to behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity led to a substantial initial reduction in weight, which plateaued after approximately week 60 and was maintained for the remainder of the study. At week 104, participants in the semaglutide group had achieved a mean weight loss of 15.2% from baseline—a difference of 12.6 percentage points versus placebo plus behavioral intervention. This weight loss is comparable to the mean reduction of 14.9% (placebo-corrected weight loss of 12.4 percentage points) seen at week 68 in the STEP 1 trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, our findings indicate that the substantial weight losses reported during 68 weeks’ treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in prior STEP trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> can be maintained with continued semaglutide treatment up to at least 104 weeks. The mean weight loss of ~15% achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 104 in STEP 5 exceeds weight loss reported at similar time points in trials with other pharmacotherapies for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Weight loss of ≥5%, a threshold widely used to indicate a clinically meaningful response to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, was achieved by &gt;75% of participants in the semaglutide group at week 104. Moreover, 61.8% of participants on semaglutide lost ≥10% of baseline weight, and over a third of participants had achieved at least 20% weight loss at week 104 in the semaglutide group. As was seen in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, while the vast majority of participants receiving semaglutide 2.4 mg had lost weight at the end of the STEP 5 study, a small proportion of participants experienced weight gain. We do not know how weight would have changed in these participants had they not been receiving the drug; notably, the proportion of patients with weight gain during the study was substantially higher in the placebo group. There is marked variability in weight change in patients on weight management treatments; the reason for this is still unclear and likely involves complex biological and societal influences.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease that requires continuous effort to control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. With all nonsurgical interventions and to some extent with bariatric surgery, weight regain after initial weight loss is common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In contrast to findings with behavioral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and other pharmacological interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the similar mean weight loss achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 5 at weeks 52 and 104 (–15.6% and –15.2%, respectively) suggests that, on average, there is minimal weight regain over 104 weeks when once-weekly semaglutide therapy is continued. When interpreted together with the findings of the STEP 4 withdrawal trial and STEP 1 off-treatment extension study, which both showed weight regain after semaglutide discontinuation (after 20 weeks’ treatment in STEP 4 and 68 weeks’ treatment in STEP 1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, these results support the benefit of continued semaglutide treatment for sustained weight loss.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Prior 68-week trials in adults with overweight or obesity have reported cardiometabolic improvements with semaglutide 2.4 mg (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). Consistent with these findings, in STEP 5 semaglutide treatment improved a range of cardiometabolic risk parameters, including waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Collectively, these results indicate a beneficial effect of treatment on overall patient health. In addition, semaglutide treatment reduced C-reactive protein levels, a marker of systemic inflammation that is known to be elevated in patients with obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The reduction in fasting insulin and glucose with semaglutide is indicative of an increase in insulin sensitivity. Similar to the findings of other studies in the STEP trial program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, exploratory outcomes showed that in the semaglutide group 80% of participants with prediabetes at baseline reverted to normoglycemia by the end of the trial (compared with 37% of those receiving placebo), while 99% of participants with normoglycemia at baseline maintained normoglycemia at the end of the trial (compared with 86% with placebo). These findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of semaglutide on glycemic status, but whether semaglutide treatment delays or prevents progression to type 2 diabetes requires confirmation. In the 68-week trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, reductions in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and HbA<sub>1c</sub> appeared to plateau around week 60 with semaglutide. STEP 5 shows that the changes in these parameters were sustained through 104 weeks’ treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 5 was consistent with that in other STEP program trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events with semaglutide, typically transient, of mild-to-moderate severity, occurring during dose escalation, and infrequently leading to treatment discontinuation.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Strengths of STEP 5 include the high rates of adherence to treatment and completion of the trial (which contributed to consistency in findings between the two estimands). Limitations include the low proportion of nonwhite participants and the preponderance of female participants. In addition, while the homogenous nature of the prescribed dietary intake deficit, physical activity goal and counseling frequency provided consistency, it may not fully reflect the need for approaches tailored to the health profiles of individuals or to different populations in clinical practice; however, beyond adherence to the stipulated criteria for counseling on diet and physical activity, behavioral intervention was delivered by each study site with no further direction, allowing a degree of local tailoring and aiding real-world applicability.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In conclusion, treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in conjunction with behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (without diabetes) was associated with clinically ﻿﻿impactful and sustained weight loss of 15.2% at week 104, along with improvements in weight-related cardiometabolic risk factors.</p>

                <p id="Par64">Randomization (1:1) to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo was done centrally by the clinical research organization (Parexel) in a double-blind manner using an interactive web-based response system (IWRS) with a fixed-size blocking schema, without stratification. The IWRS generated the randomization list and assigned patients to the next available treatment according to the randomization schedule. The IWRS allocated dispensing unit numbers for each patient, with the trial product dispensed by the site investigator or study coordinator at the trial site visits. The active product and corresponding placebo product were visually identical to maintain masking of participants and site staff. The people analyzing the data were blinded to treatment/group assignment until breaking the blinding at database lock.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="Par65">Participants received subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo once-weekly for 104 weeks, in addition to standard behavioral intervention, followed by 7 weeks without treatment. Semaglutide was initiated at 0.25 mg per week for the first 4 weeks via a pre-filled pen injector, escalating in a fixed-dose regimen every 4 weeks to reach the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg by week 16 (lower maintenance doses were permitted if participants were unable to tolerate 2.4 mg) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Behavioral intervention consisted of counseling by a dietitian or similarly qualified healthcare professional every 4 weeks via in-person visits or telephone on adherence to a reduced-calorie diet (500 kcal deficit a day relative to the energy expenditure estimated at randomization) and increased physical activity (150 minutes a week encouraged, for example, walking), both recorded daily (via a diary, app or other tools, which were reviewed during counseling sessions); beyond these criteria for behavioral intervention, no further standardization of behavioral intervention was applied across study sites. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in the trial and were encouraged to attend scheduled visits, particularly those at weeks 104 and 111.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Body weight, waist circumference and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were measured at baseline; these measurements were repeated every 4 weeks until week 20, and every 8 weeks thereafter, until week 100 and week 104 (within 3 days either side of scheduled visit day). These parameters were also measured at the end-of-trial visit at week 111 (within 5 days either side of scheduled visit day). Height was measured at screening. HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose, lipids and C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and weeks 20, 52, 84, and 104; electrocardiograms were also performed at these time points. Fasting serum insulin was measured at baseline and week 104. Physical examinations were performed at screening and weeks 52 and 104. Hematology and biochemistry laboratory parameters were measured at screening and weeks 20, 52, 84 and 104. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. Control of eating was assessed in a subset of participants from the United States and Canada; these results will be presented in a separate manuscript.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Given the emergence of COVID-19 in the second year of the study, trial visits were permitted to be conducted via telephone, during which counseling was provided and safety-related information was collected; endpoint assessments were not performed during telephone visits. Assessment data were collected at the next possible in-person visit.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par68">Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 104 and achievement of weight loss of at least 5% of baseline weight at week 104. These were tested first in the statistical testing hierarchy, followed by the confirmatory secondary endpoints, which were tested in the following order: achievement of weight loss of at least 10% or 15% at week 104; and change from baseline to week 104 in waist circumference and systolic blood pressure.</p>
                <p id="Par69">Supportive secondary endpoints were not included in the statistical testing hierarchy and were: achievement of weight loss of ≥20% at week 104; change from baseline to week 104 in body weight (in kg), BMI, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, diastolic blood pressure, lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids and triglycerides) and C-reactive protein; change from baseline to week 52 in body weight (percentage change and kg change), BMI and waist circumference; and achievement of weight loss of ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15% and ≥20% at week 52.</p>
                <p id="Par70">Exploratory endpoints reported herein include change from baseline to week 104 in glycemic category, antihypertensive medication use and lipid-lowering medication use. Glycemic category (normoglycemia, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) was determined by investigators on the basis of available information (for example, medical records, concomitant medication, and blood glucose variables) and in accordance with American Diabetes Association criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, which for prediabetes includes fasting plasma glucose levels of 100 mg dl<sup>–1</sup> (5.6 mmol l<sup>–1</sup>) to 125 mg dl<sup>–1</sup> (6.9 mmol l<sup>–1</sup>) or HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol l<sup>–1</sup>), and for type 2 diabetes includes fasting plasma glucose levels of ≥126 mg dl<sup>–1</sup> (7.0 mmol l<sup>–1</sup>) or HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels ≥6.5% (48 mmol l<sup>–1</sup>). The allowance for investigators to use all available information (for example, concomitant medication) to assess glycemic category was primarily included to account for scenarios in which glucose-lowering medications were initiated during the trial that would confound glycemic category assessment if based purely on fasting plasma glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (for example, if a patient developed diabetes during the study and received a glucose-lowering drug that resulted in their glucose level being below the American Diabetes Association threshold for type 2 diabetes diagnosis). Additional exploratory endpoints for which data are not reported were: permanent discontinuation of trial product between baseline and week 104; time to permanent discontinuation of trial product; and Control of Eating Questionnaire scores from the four domains and 19 individual items (applicable for United States and Canada only).</p>
                <p id="Par71">Safety endpoints included the number of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, assessed between baseline and week 111; and change from baseline to week 104 in pulse, amylase, lipase and calcitonin. An independent external event adjudication committee reviewed cardiovascular events, acute pancreatitis and deaths.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par72">A sample size of 300 participants provided an effective power of at least 96% for the two co-primary endpoints, and at least 43% for all confirmatory secondary endpoints, which were tested in a predefined hierarchical order (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The two co-primary endpoints were analyzed independently of each other, and for the trial to be considered to be positive (indicating a significant benefit of semaglutide versus placebo), statistical superiority for both co-primary endpoints was required to be demonstrated.</p>
                <p id="Par73">Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using the full analysis set (all randomized participants according to the intention-to-treat principle). Safety endpoints were analyzed using the safety analysis set of all randomized participants exposed to at least one dose of randomized treatment. Observation periods included the in-trial period (that is, while in the trial, regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention) and the on-treatment period (with trial product). All results from statistical analyses of confirmatory endpoints were accompanied by two-sided 95% CIs and corresponding <italic>P</italic> values (significance defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Supportive secondary endpoint analyses were not controlled for multiple comparisons and should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Two estimands were employed to assess treatment efficacy from different perspectives and accounted for intercurrent events and missing data differently, as described in a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The treatment policy estimand quantified the treatment effect among all randomly assigned participants, regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention (participants in trial; intention to treat). This estimand was used to assess the superiority of semaglutide versus placebo for the co-primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints in a predefined hierarchical order.</p>
                <p id="Par75">For the treatment policy estimand, continuous endpoint analyses were conducted with the use of the analysis-of-covariance method, with randomized treatment as a factor and baseline endpoint value as a covariate. Analyses of categorical endpoints were conducted with the use of logistic regression, with the same factor and covariate. A multiple imputation approach was used to handle missing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, with imputation based on available data from participants in the same treatment arm with the same treatment status (on-treatment or discontinued). Imputation was performed using a linear regression model, with sex, baseline BMI and timing of last observation as factors, and baseline value and last observation value as covariates. One thousand complete datasets were generated for analysis, with results combined using Rubin’s formula.</p>
                <p id="Par76">The trial product estimand addressed the average treatment effect in all randomly assigned participants, assuming that the drug or placebo was taken as intended (participants on treatment). For the trial product estimand, continuous endpoint analyses were conducted using a mixed model for repeated measures with randomized treatment as a factor and baseline endpoint value as a covariate. Analyses of categorical endpoints were conducted with the use of logistic regression, with categorization for missing data based on values predicted from the mixed model for repeated measures. Analyses of endpoints for the trial product estimand were not adjusted for multiplicity.</p>
                <p id="Par77">Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). Additional details on analytic methods per endpoint are in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Exploratory endpoints were assessed with descriptive statistics based on observed data.</p>
