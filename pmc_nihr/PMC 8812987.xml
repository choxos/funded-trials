                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is a mainstay of treatment in acute severe asthma but how it is administered varies widely. The objectives were to examine whether a trial comparing humidified O<sub>2</sub> to standard O<sub>2</sub> in children is feasible, and specifically to obtain data on recruitment, tolerability and outcome measure stability.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Heated humidified, cold humidified and standard O<sub>2</sub> treatments were compared for children (2–16 years) with acute severe asthma in a multi-centre, open, parallel, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Multiple outcomes were assessed.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 258 children screened, 66 were randomised (heated humidified O<sub>2</sub> n = 25; cold humidified O<sub>2</sub> n = 21; standard O<sub>2</sub> n = 20). Median (IQR) length of stay (hours) in hospital was 37.9 (29.1), 52 (35.4) and 49.1 (29.7) for standard, heated humidified and cold humidified respectively and time (hours) on O<sub>2</sub> was 15.9 (9.4), 13.6 (14.9) and 13.1 (14.9) for the three groups respectively. The mean (standard deviation) time (hours) taken to step down nebulised to inhaled treatment was 5.6 (14.3), 35.1 (28.2) and 32.7 (20.1). Asthma Severity Score decreased in all three groups similarly, although missing data prevented complete analysis. Humidified O<sub>2</sub> was least well tolerated with eight participants discontinuing their randomised treatment early. An important barrier to recruitment was research nurse availability.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Although, the results of this pilot study should not be extrapolated beyond the study sample and inferential conclusions should not be drawn from the results, this is the first RCT to compare humidified and standard O<sub>2</sub> therapy in acute severe asthmatics of any age. These findings and accompanying screening data show that a large RCT of O<sub>2</sub> therapy is feasible. However, challenges associated with randomisation and data collection should be addressed in any future trial design.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. In the UK, there is a person with asthma in one in five households and 1.1 million children are currently receiving treatment for this condition [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is a mainstay of treatment for acute severe or life-threatening asthma. There are physiological reasons why O<sub>2</sub> administered during an acute attack should be warmed and humidified [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. BTS guidelines state that it is reasonable to use humidified O<sub>2</sub> for adult patients who need O<sub>2</sub> for longer than 24 hours or who report upper airway discomfort due to dryness (Evidence Grade D) [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], there is no such guidance for children. Currently, most children (and adults) with acute asthma receive cold (15°C), dry (un-humidified) O<sub>2</sub> from bedside wall outlets as soon as they arrive in the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) department. If hospitalised, they may or may not receive humidified O<sub>2</sub> depending on their local hospital asthma guidelines. There are few studies to support the use of humidified O<sub>2</sub> use in the acute setting for asthma or any respiratory condition and no randomised controlled trials. Over recent years, high flow nasal cannula O<sub>2</sub> has crept into the management of children with severe respiratory distress (not just asthma) in hospitals throughout the UK with a limited evidence base to support its use.</p>
              <p>The HUMOX trial was performed to understand whether a future trial comparing different methods of administrating O<sub>2</sub> to children with severe asthma is feasible with regards to recruitment and retention, participant acceptability and adherence to the protocol.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>A ‘Pilot study’ design was used for this trial to determine whether a larger scale study could feasibly be carried out in the future. We did not intend to conduct hypothesis testing and make inferential conclusions regarding our results but rather evaluate the various processes involved in the trial, such as randomisation, recruitment and retention [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
                <p>This multi-centre, open-label, parallel, pilot RCT recruited participants aged between 2–16 years with severe asthma according to the BTS and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) asthma guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] attending A&amp;E Departments at four sites in the UK. To provide pilot data on ease of recruitment in both secondary and tertiary care, one large paediatric teaching hospital (Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Liverpool) and three district general hospitals (Royal Lancaster Infirmary, Warrington and Halton, and Countess of Chester) were selected. Exclusion criteria included requiring admission to intensive care, other respiratory disease or any other significant underlying medical problem.</p>
                <p>The trial compared three ways of administering O<sub>2</sub> (heated humidified O<sub>2</sub>, cold humidified O<sub>2</sub> or standard O<sub>2</sub>). It was not possible to blind participants or any members of the trial team.</p>

                  <title>Heated humidified O<sub>2</sub></title>
                  <p>Heated humidified O<sub>2</sub> was delivered by a Fisher Paykel MR850 humidifier and a RT408 O<sub>2</sub> Therapy System through a System face-mask (No 1120 or 1100 depending on participant size). The humidifier was set to a temperature of 31°C and the percentage inspired O<sub>2</sub> was titrated to maintain the participant’s O<sub>2</sub> saturations above 92%. The humidifier was filled with sterile water with the levels monitored and topped up as necessary.</p>

                  <title>Cold humidified O<sub>2</sub></title>
                  <p>Cold humidified O<sub>2</sub> was given through an inter-surgical humidifier nebuliser, inserted into a bottle of sterile water and attached to wall-mounted low flow O<sub>2</sub>. Elephant tubing was used to connect the nebuliser device to the participant’s face-mask. Up to 60% O<sub>2</sub> was titrated to maintain the participant’s O<sub>2</sub> saturations above 92%. If the participant required more than 60% O<sub>2</sub>, a Rusch multi-fit nebuliser with BOC adapter was used in the same way.</p>

                  <p>Standard cold (15°C), dry (un-humidified) O<sub>2</sub> was given directly from the wall at the participant bedside via a non-rebreather mask. Once the participant required less than 10L O<sub>2</sub> (approximately 50% FiO<sub>2</sub>), they were changed to nasal cannula.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Stratified block randomisation (age (2–5 years and 6–16 years) and centre, random block sizes of 3 and 6) using a ratio of 1:1:1, was used within a computer generated list prepared by an independent statistician. Allocation concealment was ensured using sequentially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes. Regular checks were conducted on the envelopes to ensure that they were being used in the correct order and had not been tampered with.</p>
                <p>Randomisation took place after completion of the screening phase and the initial nebulised treatment. The participant was re-assessed by the treating clinician and if they still required O<sub>2</sub> and fulfilled the entry criteria then the clinician/research nurse would take consent and randomise them by opening the next consecutive numbered envelope.</p>

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>The parent or legal representative of the child had an interview with the investigator, or a designated member of the investigating team, during which they were given the opportunity to understand the objectives, risks and inconveniences of the trial and the conditions under which it was to be conducted. They were provided with written information and contact details of the local study personnel should they require further information. Due to the nature of the study and the requirement to provide prompt treatment in an emergency setting, there was a short window of 90 minutes available for obtaining informed written consent in the A&amp;E department/Paediatric Assessment Unit. Simplified written information was available for children 6–11 years, those aged 12–16 years and written assent was obtained when possible.</p>

Contemporaneously, parents/guardians were provided with study information documents and a screening assessment was undertaken. If they still required O<sub>2</sub> to maintain saturations ≥92%, then they could be randomised and if not they were treated as per standard guidelines.</p>
                <p>Trial treatment began as soon as possible after the initial nebuliser treatment had concluded and initial assessments had been performed.</p>
                <p>Following randomisation, trial participants were assessed at pre-specified time intervals (2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours and then every 6 hours following the start of the allocated intervention) for as long as they required O<sub>2</sub> (and until discharge). Data were collected on time taken for nebulised treatment to be definitively stepped down from randomisation to 1 hourly, 2 hourly and 4 hourly treatments, and to salbutamol treatment delivered by metered dose inhaler and large volume spacer.</p>
                <p>Adverse events were only reported where the causal relationship to the trial treatment had been assessed by the investigator to be related.</p>
                <p>Prior to discharge the participant’s parent or guardian (and participant if appropriate) was asked to consider what they thought were meaningful outcome measures for studies in acute asthma for the future and three months following discharge they were asked about their child’s respiratory symptoms since discharge.</p>

                  <p>Outcomes were not classified as primary or secondary. They were identified as relevant and important in a previous exercise involving consumers and paediatricians. However, during that exercise, the relative importance of these outcomes was not assessed. In this trial, the following outcomes were examined; length of time in O<sub>2</sub>, time until treatment ‘stepped down’ to hourly, two-hourly and four-hourly nebulised therapy, difference in O<sub>2</sub> saturation in air after entry into the study, changes in Asthma Severity Score (ASS) [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Paediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], number of Salbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide nebules required by each participant following randomisation, requirement for escalation of treatment, adverse events, tolerability and length of stay in hospital.</p>
                  <p>Data using the Liverpool Respiratory Symptom Questionnaire (LRSQ) [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] were collected three months post discharge.</p>

There were nine adverse reactions reported (all mild in severity), eight of which were related to participants being unable to tolerate their O<sub>2</sub> (heated humidified O<sub>2</sub> n = 6 and cold humidified O<sub>2</sub> n = 1 and standard O<sub>2</sub> group n = 1), and the remaining adverse reaction was related to the patient being unable to maintain O<sub>2</sub> saturations above 92% (heated humidified O<sub>2</sub>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first RCT to compare humidified and standard O<sub>2</sub> therapy in acute severe asthma. Data on recruitment, consent and randomisation, treatment and outcome measure suitability have been generated to inform future large definitive clinical trials on interventions for acute severe asthma in children and young people.</p>
              <p>This trial highlights several practical issues pertinent to future trial design in this patient group. Firstly, although more than half the recruited cohort had had at least one previous respiratory admission, most (65%) didn’t have a formal diagnosis of asthma. As such, it would have been very difficult to prospectively recruit to this study by targeting otherwise well children attending outpatient clinics with asthma/viral induced wheeze. Secondly, predictions for recruitment to future similar studies cannot be based solely on numbers of children attending A&amp;E requiring O<sub>2</sub>. For those children attending A&amp;E who were hypoxic, only 60% still needed O<sub>2</sub> after initial triple nebuliser treatment. Thirdly, recruitment was most successful in centres where there was a dedicated research nurse assigned to the study. Flexible recruitment both at weekends and during the night was also desirable given that nearly half those attending hospital with severe asthma arrived between 5pm and midnight. Lastly, even though information sheets were given at a stressful time, consent rates were high (72%).</p>
              <p>Despite offering incentives (£50 gift vouchers in prize draws), it was challenging to get nursing and medical staff to undertake an online training course to calculate the PRAM score. Ultimately, PRAM was removed from the clinical report following poor data completion. This was disappointing as PRAM has been extensively validated as an outcome measure in children and young people between 2–17 years with acute severe asthma in North America [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but there have been relatively few studies using it in Europe and none in the UK. As for ASS, completion rates were better but still only half the data was complete between 00:00 and 07:59, likely reflecting the busy workloads of clinical staff out-of-hours.</p>
              <p>In the time it has taken to complete the trial, several issues relevant to future trial design have arisen. Firstly, the EU clinical trials regulation published in 2014 and approved in the UK in 2016, would now classify O<sub>2</sub> as a drug. Secondly, clinical practice regarding the acute management of children with severe respiratory distress of whatever cause has changed, particularly in the UK. High flow heated humidified O<sub>2</sub> given via nasal cannula therapy (HFNCO<sub>2</sub>) has ‘crept’ into the clinical management of children, often with very little evidence to support its use. Largely because of this we would see the next steps being a comparative trial of HFNCO<sub>2</sub> and standard O<sub>2</sub> therapy, a feasibility study for which is already in development [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>The number of participants required for a future trial were calculated for length of time on O<sub>2</sub> and length of time in hospital. Data for both these outcomes were not normally distributed and therefore the methods described by O’Keeffe [<xref rid="pone.0263044.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were used. A sample size calculation to detect a minimum clinically important difference of 20% for the length of time on O<sub>2</sub> was undertaken and would require a sample size of 214 in each group and to detect the same difference for the length of time in hospital would require 114 in each group.</p>
              <p>Further work should be undertaken on what outcomes are important to patients, parents and healthcare providers for acute severe asthma and on minimally clinical important differences. How important is a 20% reduction in time requiring O<sub>2</sub> or time in hospital equating to ~3 and 8 hours respectively to stakeholders and particularly funders, when lengths of stay are generally so short? Treatment escalation (in the form of need for HDU/PICU, IV aminophylline/salbutamol) may have better potential as a primary outcome given that it was not uncommon (particularly in those receiving heated humidified O<sub>2</sub>) and may be more important to key stakeholders.</p>
              <p>Given that HFNCO<sub>2</sub> has crept into the management of children with severe respiratory distress in hospitals throughout the UK, any such future trial would likely incorporate this intervention rather than heated or cold humidified O<sub>2</sub> by face-mask.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Jones,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>It is somewhat astonishing that you would use the worst possible randomization method even in this day and age, when so much has been published about the shortcomings of permuted block randomization, even with varying block sizes.  What possible justification can there be for this?  Before you respond, please carefully review the following:</p>

              <p>Especially in an unmasked trial, this is inexcusable.  It is stated that:</p>
              <p>"Allocation concealment was ensured using sequentially numbered opaque, sealed envelopes".</p>
              <p>How would sealed envelopes in any way, shape, or form ensure allocation concealment?  Short answer:  They don't.  The reality is that allocation concealment is rendered impossible by the combination of the lack of masking and the fatally flawed randomization method used.  See:</p>

              <p>Academic Editor</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>
              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>Dr. Jones - I have read the revision of your manuscript as well as feedback from two pulmonologists who reviewed it. I have also read the reviews from your initial submission. In my opinion, the presentation of the research is in line with what can be expected of a pilot project: the focus is on feasibility and acceptability, not inference. The goal is to try out the procedures and logistics and see what works and what doesn’t so that problems in a large confirmatory trial are avoided. The outcome data themselves are secondary, and whatever conclusion of benefit or not, apply to the sample only; no statement should be made about generalizability of results and no formal testing should be conducted, although uncertainty can be expressed in the form of confidence intervals or credible intervals.</p>
              <p>Regardless, looking at the reviews from the original submission and the revision, a common theme is that reviewers had a difficult time seeing this study as a pilot and tried to interpret it, at least partially, as if it was a confirmatory study, which is clearly not, and therefore the concerns about baseline imbalances, inferential testing, and statistical power. In addition to that, the prior academic editor, who has studied in-depth the nuances of randomization procedures, expressed concern about the randomization procedure and how it was implemented.</p>
              <p>Therefore, to avoid confusion and over-interpretation of results, the following is needed:</p>
              <p>1) A statement in the abstract along the lines of:</p>
              <p>“Because of the small sample size of this pilot, conclusions cannot be extrapolated beyond the study sample.” So that from the beginning readers are not looking for inferential conclusions.</p>
              <p>2) A paragraph in the methods section explaining to readers the purpose of a pilot study such as yours. In addition to your reference 9 (Lancaster et al, 2004), consider using the following:</p>

              </p>
              <p>3) A paragraph in the discussion about what you will do to improve the randomization in a future confirmatory trial. For instance, increase the number of random block sizes to 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15, or use a different randomization method altogether, and implement a computerized system (as opposed to the envelopes).</p>
              <p>Minor fix: typo in abstract results: “[…]time (hours) taken to step down nebulised to inhaled treatment was 5.6 (14.3),” should be 35.6 (14.3).</p>
              <p>Finally, please respond to the reviewer comments.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript, "Humidified and standard oxygen therapy in acute severe asthma in children (HUMOX): a pilot randomized controlled trial" by Jones and colleagues examines the feasibility of comparing types supplemental oxygen in asthmatic children experiencing acute exacerbations. The authors identify several potential barriers to a full-scale investigation, including difficulties in recruiting volunteers to complete some of the desired outcome measures, and difficulties in achieving adequate overnight data collection. As such, this manuscript provides insights that will be useful to clinical investigators studying other clinically relevant questions. Therefore, this manuscript will be of interest to a fairly general audience. The manuscript has been significantly improved by the revisions. However, there are still some areas that are not clear in the current manuscript. These minor issues include the following:</p>
              <p>1. The Procedures section specifies the duration of assessment to be "as long as they required O2 (and until discharge)". Do the authors mean that all the patients were followed until their discharge? Alternatively, this sentence could mean the patients were followed until they were either off O2 or had been discharged. This sentence should be rewritten to be more clear.</p>
              <p>2. The Procedures mention that the parents or guardians provided recommendations regarding potential meaningful patient outcomes and post-A&amp;E Department therapy. The details regarding these findings are provided in the Supplemental Material. However, no reference to this is made within the Procedures section. The authors should state that these findings are provided in the Supplemental Material appendix to make it easier for the interested reader to locate them.</p>
              <p>3. The authors state that the outcomes were not designated as primary or secondary, but do not provide a rationale for doing that. The authors should provide a rationale as to why they chose to not designate outcomes as primary or secondary.</p>
              <p>4. The authors should provide more details regarding how they arrived at 30 per group as their sample size. Did they conduct a power analysis? Was this based on the average number of children seen in the A&amp;E Department for acute asthma exacerbations?</p>
              <p>5. The Discussion outlines some of the barriers experienced by the authors in obtaining their data. While they report some of the approaches that were not successful, it would be helpful if they would include potential ways that they might be successful in collecting a more complete data set in a subsequent study. This is particularly important since the difficulties with missing data precluded the use of a clinically relevant assessment, the PRAM score.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: In the table !, when you compare the three groups with parametric method do you use to write they are similar?</p>
              <p>Can you explain why did not carried out hypothesis testing?</p>
              <p>**********</p>
