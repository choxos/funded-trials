                  <p>Graves orbitopathy is both disabling and disfiguring. Medical therapies to reduce inflammation are widely used, but there is limited trial data beyond 18 months of follow-up.</p>

                  <p>Three-year follow-up of a subset of the CIRTED trial (N = 68), which randomized patients to receive high-dose oral steroid with azathioprine/placebo and radiotherapy/sham radiotherapy.</p>

                  <p>Data were available at 3 years from 68 of 126 randomized subjects (54%). No additional benefit was seen at 3 years for patients randomized to azathioprine or radiotherapy with regard to a binary clinical composite outcome measure (BCCOM), modified European Group on Graves’ Orbitopathy score, or Ophthalmopathy Index.</p>
                  <p>Clinical Activity Score (CAS), Ophthalmopathy Index, and Total Eye Score improved over 3 years (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001). However, quality of life at 3 years remained poor. Of 64 individuals with available surgical outcome data, 24 of 64 (37.5%) required surgical intervention. Disease duration of greater than 6 months before treatment was associated with increased need for surgery [odds ratio (OR) 16.8; 95% CI 2.95, 95.0; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .001]. Higher baseline levels of CAS, Ophthalmopathy Index, and Total Eye Score but not early improvement in CAS were associated with increased requirement for surgery.</p>

                  <p>In this long-term follow-up from a clinical trial, 3-year outcomes remained suboptimal with ongoing poor quality of life and high numbers requiring surgery. Importantly, reduction in CAS in the first year, a commonly used surrogate outcome measure, was not associated with improved long-term outcomes.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Graves’ disease is common throughout the world (<xref rid="dgad084-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Active moderate to severe Graves orbitopathy (GO; also known as thyroid eye disease or thyroid-associated orbitopathy) occurs in approximately 5% to 10% of cases of Graves’ disease (<xref rid="dgad084-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It can be both visually disabling and cosmetically disfiguring and substantially impairs quality of life (<xref rid="dgad084-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B4" ref-type="bibr">4-6</xref>). Middle-aged women are predominantly affected, and the negative impact of GO can be prolonged.</p>
            <p>Current medical therapeutic strategies have been directed toward suppression of orbital inflammation in the hope of reducing tissue remodeling in the extraocular muscles, orbital fat, and other periocular soft tissues (<xref rid="dgad084-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Immunosuppressive therapies, particularly corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment (<xref rid="dgad084-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). More recently, randomized clinical trials have indicated substantial potential benefit from novel/additional agents such as azathioprine (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), teprotumumab (<xref rid="dgad084-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), mycophenolate, (<xref rid="dgad084-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and tociluzimab (<xref rid="dgad084-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, these clinical trials have largely been of modest duration, and follow-up has been at most 18 months and often less. One exception is the study of Leo et al that followed patients up for 4 to 10 years. This showed continued improvement and a requirement for surgery in 27% of patients, but limited quality of life data was reported (<xref rid="dgad084-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Alongside these advances, surgery continues to be required to reduce the degree of diplopia or proptosis (<xref rid="dgad084-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and in some cases to preserve vision, as well as to improve quality of life (<xref rid="dgad084-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Frequently, surgical intervention is performed a year or more after disease onset and so is rarely included in trial outcomes. At present there is limited data on what proportion of individuals with moderate to severe GO require surgery despite extensive medical intervention. Taken together, there is a pressing need for longer term data to establish which of the characteristics of GO correlate with poor clinical outcomes once the inflammatory phase of the disease has resolved. These may be key in assessing who will potentially benefit the most from new and costly interventions and provide insight into disease trajectory while awaiting for trials with longer duration of follow-up.</p>
            <p>There are several well-established tools for assessing GO. Typically disease activity is measured using Clinical Activity Score (CAS) or by the inflammatory component of the vision, inflammation, strabismus, and appearance scale (<xref rid="dgad084-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Other scores objectively assess the severity of GO including European Group on Graves’ Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) (<xref rid="dgad084-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), Ophthalmopathy Index (OI) (<xref rid="dgad084-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), Thyroid Eye Score, NOSPECS (<xref rid="dgad084-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), Graves Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life (GOQOL) (<xref rid="dgad084-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and the vision, inflammation, and appearance component of the vision, inflammation, strabismus, and appearance scale (<xref rid="dgad084-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition to these measures, a greater understanding of disease trajectory is essential for identifying which patients should be followed more closely in clinic. Potential variables that might predict the disease trajectory and likely need for additional interventions such as surgery include patient characteristics such as baseline GO severity scores as well as age, sex, and duration of disease as well as potent risk factors such as smoking status.</p>
            <p>The CIRTED trial was a multicenter, factorial design, double-masked, randomized controlled trial based in the UK. Results from the primary outcome at 1 year have been reported (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but participants were also invited to attend an optional follow-up assessment at 3 years. All patients in the study received high-dose oral corticosteroids and were randomized to receive either azathioprine or placebo and orbital radiotherapy or sham radiotherapy. These planned medical interventions were completed within 6 months of study entry. The 3-year data in CIRTED enables us to identify important predictors of disease outcome and treatment response, especially with regard to quality of life and the need for surgery.</p>

                <p>The CIRTED trial was a randomized multifactorial trial and has been described in detail previously (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Baseline characteristics were obtained on age at enrollment, disease duration, ethnicity, sex thyroid status, study center, CAS, and Thyroid Eye Score. In brief, all patients received high-dose oral prednisolone in a tapering regime for 24 weeks (80 mg per day, reduced to 20 mg per day by 6 weeks, 10 mg per day by 15 weeks, and 5 mg per day by 21 weeks). Those randomized to radiotherapy received 20 Gy of radiation administered to the retrobulbar compartment in 10 to 12 fractions over 2 to 3 weeks. Those randomized to receive azathioprine received this treatment for 48 weeks with doses adjusted according to weight and safety blood monitoring. The majority of patients were recruited from 2 centers in the UK (Bristol and Moorfields; n = 105) (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The CIRTED trial identified potential benefit at 48 weeks for azathioprine, but no clear benefit was observed for radiotherapy (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Following week 48 (completion of the original CIRTED study) follow-up was optional and patients were managed by their local teams.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>In the original study, the coprimary outcomes were a BCCOM (Box 1) and OI. Secondary outcome measures included Total Eye Score (TES) as an additional assessment of disease severity and the patient-reported GOQOL score (<xref rid="dgad084-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), which has 2 components: Visual Function (GOQOL-VF) and Appearance (GOQOL-AP). CAS was also measured throughout. In this 3-year report we additionally calculated the EUGOGO score from the individual components of the trial dataset (<xref rid="dgad084-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). As this did not include a measurement of lid retraction, we inferred the presence of lid retraction if there was a &gt;2 mm difference in palpebral aperture between an individual patient's eyes. On this basis, moderate to severe GO was classified as having 2 or more of ≥ 2 mm difference in palpebral aperture, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos ≥ 3 mm above normal for race and gender, and inconstant or constant diplopia. Hence, the indices we used to assess longitudinal features and stability of disease over 3 years or follow-up were the OI, TES, CAS, EUGOGO, and GOQOL scores. In addition, whether ophthalmic surgery was required, which was entirely at the discretion of the patients and their local ophthalmologists, was also recorded.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The impact of being randomized to azathioprine and radiotherapy against the original primary outcome measures of disease severity BCCOM and OI were studied first. CAS was a coprimary outcome, although we anticipated all participants would have a significant improvement in CAS well before 3 years in accordance with the natural history of the disease (<xref rid="dgad084-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and the EUGOGO score was utilized as an additional outcome. Analysis was undertaken adjusting for the same confounders as in the initial CIRTED analysis; these included smoking status at the time of GO diagnosis, thyroid status on enrollment, previous corticosteroid use, sex, disease severity, disease duration, age greater than 60 years, and disease activity (baseline CAS). Additional analyses were then undertaken to explore the effect of being randomized to azathioprine or radiotherapy on TES, quality of life scores, and need for ophthalmological surgery.</p>
                <p>Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used, adjusting for minimization variables, the factorial design, and the value of the outcome variable at baseline. Where appropriate, to allow easy comparison variables were standardized; these analyses are therefore presented as per standard deviation. Comparison between nonnormally distributed outcomes between groups was undertaken using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The original trial was a factorial design, and, as patients who followed up at 3 years were broadly representative of the whole trial population, with no striking benefit observed for either azathioprine or radiotherapy and no evidence of interaction between them, we combined treatment groups when exploring baseline ophthalmic and clinical assessments and their relationship to subsequent clinical outcomes to increase power. In these analyses we explored the relationship between the baseline clinical assessments of CAS, OI, TES, GOQOL-VF, and GOQOL-AP and their respective scores at 3 years. We also explored the association between baseline CAS (as a continuous measure), OI (in quartiles) TES, and EUGOGO scores as well as baseline characteristics on the need for ophthalmological surgery over the 3 years of follow-up.</p>
                <p>Statistical significance was defined in advance as a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of &lt;.05. All statistical analyses were undertaken using STATA version 16 (STATACORP, College Station, TX, USA).</p>

              <p>Data were available after 3 years of follow-up from 68 of 126 (54%) individuals initially randomized into the CIRTED study.

The EUGOGO score could be calculated from the individual measurements recorded in our dataset (as set out previously) for 47 trial subjects. The 68 individuals with 3-year data were fairly evenly distributed across the intervention groups: 17 were in the placebo/sham radiotherapy group, 16 were in the placebo/radiotherapy group, 16 were in the azathioprine/sham radiotherapy group, and 19 were in the azathioprine/radiotherapy group.

                  <p>Twenty-four of the 64 individuals (37.5%) who provided surgical outcome data required surgery over 3 years of follow-up. The decision to perform surgery was left to the local clinical team and was not protocolized. The majority of interventions involved lid surgery (n = 16) or orbital decompression (n = 12), with strabismus correction (squint surgery) being less common (n = 2). Five individuals required both lid surgery and decompression surgery. Eight of 49 respondents (16.33%) had undergone thyroidectomy over the 3-year period.</p>

                  <p>Of the 64 individuals who provided data, 16 needed lid surgery during the 3 years. The needs for lid and decompression surgery were also separately assessed. CAS at baseline as a continuous measure was associated with the need for lid surgery (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02), as was duration of disease prior to enrollment (OR = 7.18; 95% CI 1.24, 41.4; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .03) (Supplementary Table 2) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). OI, TES, and EUGOGO score at baseline were not predictive of the need for lid surgery (<xref rid="dgad084-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). No other baseline factors were predictive of the need for lid surgery including diplopia at baseline (OR = 0.94; 95% CI .51, 1.73; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .84).</p>
                  <p>Twelve of 64 individuals underwent decompression surgery within 3 years. Similar to lid surgery, disease duration prior to enrollment of greater than 6 months was predictive of the need for orbital decompression (OR = 52.5; 95% CI 4.10, 672; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .002), but there was no significant association with baseline CAS score (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .39) (<xref rid="dgad084-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Baseline diplopia was also associated with need for orbital decompression (OR = 6.00; 95% CI 1.78, 20.3; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .004), as was palpebral aperture (OR = 3.18; 95% CI 1.54, 6.57; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .002) and OI (OR = 2.70; 95% CI 1.33, 5.47; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .006), with a possible association with TES, with 5% requiring surgery in the lowest quartile but 37% requiring surgery in the highest quartile (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .05), (<xref rid="dgad084-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), but not degree of proptosis (OR = 0.06; 95% CI .03, .15; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .16) (Supplementary Table 4) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). No individuals with mild GO on baseline EUGOGO score required orbital decompression over 3 years. No other baseline variables predicted the need for decompression surgery including age, gender, ethnicity, thyroid state, recent use of steroids, smoking status, or baseline TES (Supplementary Table 4) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Baseline GOQOL-VF was lower in those who required orbital decompression over the 3-year follow-up [median 58.3 (IQR 28.6-78.6) vs those who did not, median 75 (IQR 63.4-100); <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02]. However no clear association was seen between GOQOL-VF and the need for any surgery or lid surgery. Baseline GOQOL-AP was not predictive of individuals undergoing any form of surgery (Supplementary Table 5) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>

Some individuals showed minimal improvement or even deterioration in GOQOL-AP (<xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), especially among those who did not undergo surgery (<xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Overall, 35% of individuals failed to improve their GOQOL-VF and 42.4% failed to improve GOQOL-AP at 3 years (<xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These percentages were even higher in those who did not have surgery, with 42.1% failing to improve GOQOL-VF and 50% failing to improve GOQOL-AP (<xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>).</p>

                <p>After 3 years, 15 of the 60 people (25%) who provided GOQOL-VF scores and 32 of the 60 people (54.2%) who provided GOQOL-AP at 3 years had a score of 75 or less, indicating ongoing substantial impairment of quality of life. No baseline characteristics, potential confounders, or disease levels at baseline (CAS/TES) were associated with having increased odds of having a GOQOL score less than 75 at 3 years (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is limited outcome data for GO following medical interventions beyond 2 years. This 3-year report on prospectively acquired subjective and objective assessments in just over half of the participants in the CIRTED trial, who were broadly representative of the overall study population, therefore adds substantially to the current evidence base for long-term treatment outcomes in this important cause of visual disability, disfigurement, and impaired quality of life. In summary, we observed no clear benefit beyond the effect of high-dose oral steroids in individuals randomized to receive azathioprine or radiotherapy on BCCOM, OI, CAS, and EUGOGO score at 3 years. Furthermore, for azathioprine we also observed no additional benefit with regard to need for subsequent surgical intervention or quality of life measures. This is in contrast to our original findings at 1 year, which showed a modest potential benefit from azathioprine (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The results for radiotherapy are less clear. In our original study we found no evidence of benefit with radiotherapy (<xref rid="dgad084-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but in this longer-term follow-up we did observe that those randomized to receive radiotherapy had a higher GOQOL-AP score [median 81.3 (IQR 62.5-93.8) vs median 68.9 (IQR 31.2-87.5); <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .03] than those who did not. We also observed a potential reduction in the need for lid surgery (OR = 0.17; 95% CI .03, 1.03; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .05), although it should be highlighted that the 95% CI does cross equality. Analysis of key individual components of outcome measures did suggest radiotherapy reduced diplopia (Supplementary Table 2) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Taken together this does raise the possibility of late benefits from radiotherapy; however, caution is needed over interpretation of these marginal benefits given our incomplete patient follow-up and the number of statistical tests being performed, which raises the possibility of a type 1 error.</p>
              <p>The most striking finding from this 3-year follow-up study was that quality of life outcomes in GO remain poor, as 35% of individuals failed to improve their GOQOL-VF and 42.4% failed to improve their GOQOL-AP at 3 years (<xref rid="dgad084-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This figure was even higher in those patients who did not undergo surgery. Overall, after 3 years, 25% of patients had a GOQOL-VF of 75 or lower and 54.2% had a GOQOL-AP of 75 or lower, indicating ongoing prolonged substantial impairment in the quality of life of these patients despite aggressive medical management. This appears to contrast with the substantial improvement in physician-conducted GO assessments, in particular measures of inflammation (CAS) and overall orbital effects/deformity (eg, OI and TES) (<xref rid="dgad084-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Taken together, this indicates there is a substantial unmet need for improving outcomes in this visually disabling and cosmetically disfiguring condition. In keeping with this, we confirm that although CAS is a valuable baseline measure (<xref rid="dgad084-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), change in CAS did not correlate with key surgical and quality of life outcomes.</p>
              <p>In addition, we have been able to quantify the need for surgery beyond the inflammatory phase of GO. Despite extensive medical therapy, including high-dose oral (but not intravenous) steroids in all individuals, 37.5% of patients still required surgical intervention, predominantly lid surgery or decompression. This is comparable but somewhat higher than the surgery rates in the study of Leo et al, although it is noted that some patients in their study declined surgery (<xref rid="dgad084-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The high requirement for surgery also indirectly highlights the poor efficacy of oral steroids and/or azathioprine and radiotherapy in treating thyroid eye disease. It is possible that more of our patients would also benefit from surgical intervention, especially since a recent meta-analysis has highlighted the patient-reported benefits of surgery (<xref rid="dgad084-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Whereas baseline CAS was predictive of the need for surgery overall (particularly lid surgery but not orbital decompression), it was not associated with quality of life at 3 years. Of note, baseline CAS was not associated with CAS later on in the study, and early suppression of inflammation as shown by a reduction in CAS to 0 or 1 in the first 12 weeks was not associated with improved outcomes with regard to needing surgery or improving quality of life, raising the possibility that early control of inflammation—a key part of current treatment approaches for GO—may not have the impact on long-term orbital remodeling that have been predicted (<xref rid="dgad084-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This contrasts with the improvements in proptosis as well as quality of life seen with disease-modifying therapies such as teprotumumab, although this also improves CAS substantially (<xref rid="dgad084-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="dgad084-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and emphazies the need for longer-term follow-up and assessments of quality of life and responses other than CAS, to ensure benefits translate into improved outcomes for patients.</p>
              <p>An additional finding from our study was the consistent observation that the need for surgery over 3 years was higher in those who had thyroid eye disease for more than 6 months before enrolment in CIRTED (OR = 16.8; 95% CI 2.95, 95.0; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .001), in particular orbital decompression (OR = 52.5; 95% CI 4.10, 672; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .002). This emphazies the importance of surveillance and early case finding in GO, as in the UK TEAMeD 5 approach (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.btf-thyroid.org/TEAMeD-5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.btf-thyroid.org/TEAMeD-5</ext-link>) (<xref rid="dgad084-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), which supports patients and endocrinologists to detect GO early. More than 80% of cases of GO arise at the same time or after the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, a period in which patients are normally under endocrine follow-up (<xref rid="dgad084-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study also highlights that OI and TES are associated with need for decompression surgery over 3 years (<xref rid="dgad084-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and OI at baseline is still associated with OI 3 years later. This perhaps reflects the robustness of these assessments but also provides evidence of incomplete treatment efficacy in our study. Whereas baseline CAS, OI, and TES are associated with surgical outcomes, they do not appear to be able to clearly identify those patients who do not need surgery; they are better at identifying those at highest risk of surgery and identifying individuals who need the closest attention (<xref rid="dgad084-T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Although baseline OI and TES are predictive of identifying those who need surgery, they are not associated with quality of life at 3 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, quality of life at baseline is predictive of quality of life at 3 years: baseline GOQOL-VF was lower in those who required orbital decompression over the 3 years [follow-up median score 58.3 (IQR 28.6-78.6)] vs those who did not [median score 75 (IQR 63.4-100) <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02]. A positive change in GOQOL-VF was observed in those who received orbital decompression [median 28.1 (IQR 18.3-36.5) vs 7.13 (IQR 0—25); <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .05] (Supplementary Table 6) (<xref rid="dgad084-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This suggests that orbital decompression in particular improves GOQOL-VF in people with thyroid eye disease. Taken together, to improve GOQOL outcomes in GO we need to take more account of the baseline GOQOL-VF and GOQOL-AP scores and use these in conjunction to perhaps better define who might benefit from surgery or consider novel agents such as teprotumumab.</p>
              <p>Although our study is one of the largest in thyroid eye disease with longer follow-up than other studies, there are several limitations. The sample size is still modest, which means we are potentially underpowered to detect important effects such as identifying clear benefits from surgery in terms of quality of life scores. The number of statistical tests performed also raises the possibility of a type 1 error. As the 3-year assessment was optional, almost half the study participants were also not evaluated at this time point, although a majority did provide data and are representative of the original cohort.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have identified no clear evidence of benefit for the addition of azathioprine to high-dose oral steroid in individuals with moderate to severe GO at 3 years. The results for orbital radiotherapy were less clear, but there may have been possible benefit in the visual appearance domain for quality of life and a potential reduction in the need for lid surgery. Furthermore, we have identified that 3-year outcomes in GO despite the medical interventions we used are heterogenous and poor, particularly for GOQOL-AP. A large proportion of patients still need surgery, and in those who receive surgery there are potential benefits, particularly for GOQOL-VF. Despite considerable effectiveness of therapy in improving GO indices such as CAS, this is not reflected in quality of life scores, and future trials of treatment and treatment strategies should reflect this. Our results also strongly suggest that intervening in GO early will likely reduce the need for future surgical intervention, although rapid reduction in CAS was not associated with extra benefit. Longer-term studies, particularly for promising new therapies, are also needed, with an emphasis on quality of life measures and not just objective clinical assessments of GO.</p>
