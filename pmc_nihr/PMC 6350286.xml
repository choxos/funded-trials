                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy disorder, characterised by hypertension and multisystem complications in the mother. The adverse outcomes of pre-eclampsia include severe hypertension, stroke, renal and hepatic injury, haemorrhage, fetal growth restriction and even death. The optimal time to instigate delivery to prevent morbidity when pre-eclampsia occurs between 34 and 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation, without increasing problems related to infant immaturity or complications, remains unclear.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The PHOENIX trial is a non-masked, randomised controlled trial, comparing planned early delivery (with initiation of delivery within 48â€‰h of randomisation) with usual care (expectant management) in women with pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+â€‰0</sup> and 36<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeksâ€™ gestation. The primary objectives of the trial are to determine if planned delivery reduces adverse maternal outcomes, without increasing the short-term harm to infants (composite of perinatal deaths or neonatal unit admissions up to infant hospital discharge) or impacting long-term infant neurodevelopmental status at 2 years corrected age (Parent Report of Cognitive Abilities-Revised).</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for management of pre-eclampsia varies by gestation. Previous trials have shown that in women with pre-eclampsia after 37â€‰weeks of gestion, delivery is initiated, as maternal complications are reduced without increasing fetal risks. Prior to 34â€‰weeks of gestation, usual management aims to prolong pregnancy for fetal benefit, unless severe complications occur, necessitating preterm delivery. This trial aims to address the uncertainty for women where the balance of benefits and risks of delivery compared to expectant management are uncertain. Previous trials in this area have been undertaken, but have not provided a definitive answer, and the research question remains active. The results of this trial are expected to influence clinical practice internationally, through direct adoption and by incorporation into guidelines in countries with similar settings.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">In the UK, 10â€“15% of pregnant women develop hypertension in pregnancy, and 2â€“5% pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder, characterised by placental and maternal vascular dysfunction, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality for the mother and infant. Adverse outcomes of pre-eclampsia include severe hypertension, stroke, renal and hepatic injury, haemorrhage, fetal growth restriction and even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Timely delivery may be indicated to prevent maternal and infant morbidity. Standard management of pre-eclampsia involves close monitoring whilst taking into consideration gestational age, fetal well-being and progression of maternal disease. When a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is made at or beyond 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation, it is currently recommended that delivery be induced, since maternal and fetal risks can be significantly reduced without any apparent added risk associated with the intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Around half (40%) of all pre-eclampsia occurs preterm (before 37â€‰weeks), and these cases have the most serious outcomes. Using data from previous pre-eclampsia trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we have estimated that 33% of women with pre-eclampsia will present between 34<sup>+â€‰0</sup> and 36<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeks of gestation and not require immediate delivery. Delivery before 34â€‰weeks (meta-analysis of two randomised controlled trials, <italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰133) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] increases neonatal risk (Hyaline Membrane Disease risk ratio 2.3 [95% confidence interval, CI 1.39 to 3.81] and necrotising enterocolitis risk ratio 5.54 [95% CI 1.04 to 29.56]) without sufficient benefit in maternal outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The optimal time to instigate delivery to prevent morbidity when pre-eclampsia occurs between 34 and 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation, without increasing problems related to infant immaturity or complications, remains unclear. Current management involves close surveillance and delivery only when evidence of impending serious morbidity becomes apparent (e.g. deteriorating maternal or fetal condition). As this may be rapid or unexpected, planned delivery (the proposed intervention) beyond 34â€‰weeks may be valuable. Neonatal and infant mortality and morbidity (e.g. through respiratory distress syndrome) may, nonetheless, occur following delivery between 34 and 37â€‰weeks of gestation. However, neurodevelopmental morbidity and risk of growth restriction and death may be reduced by early delivery, and adverse events related to expectant management (including placental abruption, stillbirth and worsening growth restriction) may be decreased.</p>
              <p id="Par20">It is highly likely that routine delivery will reduce the maternal risk, as delivery cures pre-eclampsia. There is, therefore, a need to compare a policy of planned delivery between 34<sup>+â€‰0</sup> and 36<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeks of gestation with that of expectant management, to evaluate the benefits and risks for the mother and baby, including assessment of longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par21">This aim of this study is to compare planned delivery with expectant management (usual care) in women with pre-eclampsia between 34 and 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation. This study arose from a commissioned call by the funder (National Institute for Health Research), following development of the proposal and choice of important outcomes by clinicians with patient and public involvement. The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (dated 2008) and all applicable regulatory requirements. This protocol will be submitted to an NHS research ethics committee (REC) and the NHS Trust Research and Development Offices for approval.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par32">This will be a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of planned delivery versus expectant management in 900 women with pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+â€‰0</sup> and 36<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeks of gestation inclusive. The trial will be conducted in approximately 35 to 45 consultant-led maternity units across England and Wales. An internal pilot phase will initially be run, involving six centres over a period of 6 months to establish whether the procedures and assessments are conducive to achieving the recruitment and other objectives of the study. Recruitment is anticipated to take 36â€‰months based on an assumption that each centre will on average recruit 1.5 women per month, with some allowance for unforeseen events and centres recruiting slower than expected. The study, including set-up, pilot phase, completion of mother and infant follow-up and reporting, is anticipated to take 72â€‰months to complete. If the processes are shown to work in the internal pilot phase, recruitment to the main trial will proceed with no break and data from the internal pilot phase will be analysed together with the main trial data collected. The internal pilot will aim to recruit a total of 41 women by the end of month 6. Progression criteria (internal pilot into main trial) will be recruitment in the pilot study of at least 75% of target (31 women or more) with loss to follow-up of no more than seven women.</p>

Withdrawal from the study will not affect their (or their babyâ€™s) ongoing care and there will be no requirement for any study-related follow-up safety assessments. The intervention may be discontinued if their clinician feels it is in the babyâ€™s best interests. For a woman allocated to the expectant management group, the attending clinician will make a decision for delivery based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, with delivery planned at 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation. If clinical needs dictate delivery prior to 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation, this will not constitute withdrawal from the trial allocation. For a woman allocated to the planned delivery group, if the woman should decide that she does not wish to proceed with the planned delivery and instead chooses to continue to be monitored by her attending clinician, this will not constitute withdrawal from the study. There is no requirement to replace women who do not complete the study or need to be delivered prior to their planned delivery date.</p>

Women who do not speak English will be approached only if an adult interpreter is available. Relatives may not interpret. Introductory verbal and written information should be offered to all potentially eligible women with pre-eclampsia at the studyâ€™s recruiting centres. Written informed consent will be given using an informed consent form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>)Â completed, signed and dated by the woman (with a countersignature by an interpreter where required) and signed by the person who obtained informed consent, who will be the principal investigator or another study doctor with delegated authority. After written informed consent has been obtained, a member of the research team will enter the baseline data onto the online database and perform randomisation, communicating the results directly to the woman. At all stages, it will be made clear to the woman that she is free to withdraw from the trial at any time without the need to provide any reason or explanation.

Therefore, assuming an expected adverse maternal outcome incidence of 43% in the control group (expectant management), a sample size of 850 women will be needed to demonstrate a relative risk reduction of 25% to 32.25% (deemed clinically significant) with a two-sided 5% significance level and 90% power in the planned delivery group. Taking into account a 5% loss of women in the follow-up, the overall target sample size for the study is 900 women (450 per group).</p>

                  <title>Non-inferiority hypothesis for the neonatal outcomes</title>
                  <p id="Par114">A sample size of 850 women will result in approximately 860 live births (assuming 1 in 80 pregnancies are twin pregnancies). The PELICAN study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported that a composite of perinatal death or any neonatal admission occurred in 27 of 115 infants (23.5%, 95% CI 16.1% to 32.3%). Assuming a composite adverse neonatal outcome incidence of 24% in the control group (expectant management), a sample size of 860 (430 per group) will achieve 93% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of a difference in incidence of no less than 10% (judged to be clinically relevant) and 78% power to detect a margin of no less than 8%.</p>
                  <p id="Par115">To examine the component of perinatal death specifically, using Office for National Statistics data for all babies born in England and Wales in 2013, it is estimated that 1.6% (585/36,939) of all preterm births were perinatal deaths (stillbirth and early neonatal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A similar incidence is expected in women with pre-eclampsia as those deaths prevented by increased surveillance would be offset by pre-eclampsia associated co-morbidities of fetal growth restriction and placenta abruption. Thus, for the component of perinatal death, assuming a control group incidence of 1.5%, a sample size of 430 in each group would achieve 90% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of a difference in incidence of no less than 2.7%. For the component of neonatal unit admission, assuming a control group incidence of 21%, a sample size of 430 in each group will achieve 90% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of a difference in incidence of no less than 9%.</p>
                  <p id="Par116">Assuming a loss to follow-up at 2 years of 20%, we should obtain long-term outcomes for approximately 690 infants (345 per group assuming no difference in the loss to follow-up between the groups). The PARCA-R questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] provides a composite score for neurodevelopment with a standardised mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. With a one-sided significance level of 2.5%, under a non-inferiority hypothesis, a sample size of 345 in each group achieves 94% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of a difference in the mean PARCA-R score of no less than 4 points (1/4 of a standard deviation). A margin of no less than 3 points can be detected with 75% power. Considering the results from the INFANT trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] of over 46,000 higher risk women with babies of over 35â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation, the original power calculation was revised. Using a revised standard deviation of 34, a sample size of 345 in each group will detect a non-inferiority margin of a difference in the mean PARCA-R score of no less than 9 points (1/4 of a standard deviation) with 94% power. A margin of no less than 7 points can be detected with 77% power.</p>
                  <p id="Par117">In summary, a sample size of 900 women will have at least 90% power to detect: (1) a relative risk reduction of 25% (from 43% to 32%) in the primary maternal composite outcome, (2) a non-inferiority margin of a difference in the incidence of the primary short-term perinatal outcome of no less than 10% (from 24%) and (3) a non-inferiority margin of a difference in the mean 2-year PARCA-R score of â‰¥9 points.</p>

                  <p id="Par169">Only unexpected SAEs will be reported. These will be followed up until the post-natal discharge of mother and baby from acute hospital care. Unexpected SAEs for both the mother and infant will be recorded and reported to the Clinical Trials Unit of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) within 24â€‰h of research staff at the site becoming aware of the event. An SAE occurring to a participant will be reported to the REC, which gave a favourable opinion of the study, if, in the opinion of the chief investigator, the event was related (resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures) and unexpected in relation to those procedures. Reports of related and unexpected SAEs will be submitted within 15 working days of the chief investigator becoming aware of the event, using the Health Research Authorityâ€™s form for reporting an SAE. All reported SAEs will be regularly reviewed by the DMC throughout the study. The chief investigator will inform all investigators concerned of relevant information that could adversely affect the safety of participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par171">The primary analysis for all maternal outcomes will be by intention to treat with participants analysed in the groups to which they are assigned regardless of protocol non-compliance. The primary analyses for all perinatal and infant outcomes will be by intention to treat and per protocol, since the hypothesis under examination for these outcomes is a non-inferiority hypothesis. The intention-to-treat analysis will include data from all women who discontinue the intervention for any reason and data from all women who withdraw, up to the point of their withdrawal (after which no further data will be collected). The per-protocol analysis will exclude babies of women who do not receive the allocated intervention as per protocol. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the results from both populations are consistent with each other. If women in the expectant management arm are delivered prior to 37â€‰weeksâ€™ gestation due to clinical need (i.e. with new indications for delivery by NICE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), this will not be considered a protocol deviation. A sensitivity analysis will also be carried out excluding babies of women randomised to the planned delivery arm where initiation of delivery is more than 96â€‰h post-randomisation. This is to allow for clinical (e.g. steroid administration) and logistical (e.g. availability of labour ward bed or neonatal unit cot) delays.</p>
                <p id="Par172">All outcomes will be analysed adjusting for minimisation factors (as listed above) at randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] where possible. Binary outcomes will be analysed using log binomial regression models. If the model does not converge, log Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Results will be presented as adjusted risk ratios with associated CIs. The site will be treated as a random effect in the model, and all other factors as fixed effects. For continuous outcomes, differences in means and associated CIs will be estimated using linear regression models assuming the residuals are normally distributed. Should this assumption be considered unmet, quantile regression methods will be used. For all primary outcomes, 95% CIs will be presented. For the analysis of perinatal outcomes, the adjusted analysis will also account for the correlation of outcomes in twins included in the trial by treating these as random effects in the model.</p>
                <p id="Par173">The frequency and content of any interim analyses, including any stopping guidelines, will be determined by an independent DMC and documented in the DMCâ€™s charter.</p>
                <p id="Par174">Further details of the short-term outcomes can be found in the statistical analysis plan (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). A statistical analysis plan for the 2-year follow-up analysis is currently in development.</p>
                <p id="Par175">The loss to long-term follow-up is expected to be around 20% to 30% and to be associated with poor outcomes and lower socioeconomic status. Babies for whom no 2-year follow-up data are received will be compared to babies with 2-year data on demographic and clinical characteristics as well as short-term outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par176">An economic evaluation from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services will be conducted alongside the main trial. Data on health and social care resource utilisation will be collected using patient administration systems, maternity and neonatal databases, and logs of tests and procedures, together with data from questionnaires administered at 6 months and 2 years, which capture health and social care resource use for mother and child in the previous 6 months. Health and social care services will be costed using national published sources (NHS reference costs and Unit Costs of Health and Social Care, Personal Social Services Research Unit, British National Formulary). QALYs for the mother will be calculated from EQ-5D-5â€‰L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] utility scores collected at baseline, 6â€‰months and 2â€‰years and the SF-12v2Â® [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] questionnaire also at 6â€‰months and 2â€‰years. Differences in infant mortality between the two groups will be captured by assuming full health up to 2â€‰years for surviving infants. The final results of the economic evaluation analyses will be expressed as the mean incremental cost per mean QALY gained from baseline until the 2-year follow-up. Costs and QALYs in the second year will be discounted in line with NICE guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As the analysis will be undertaken after the 2-year follow-up, a full health economic analysis plan, linking with the 2-year statistical analysis plan, is currently in development.</p>

                <p id="Par178">Based on interim data on the trialâ€™s outcomes, adverse event data, accumulating evidence from other trials and any other evidence from relevant studies, the DMC will inform the TSC if, in its view, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate that the trial should be terminated. This will apply if any part of the protocol under investigation is either clearly indicated or contra-indicated, either for all infants or for a particular subgroup of trial participants. A decision to inform the TSC of such a finding will, in part, be based on statistical considerations. Appropriate proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least 3 standard errors in the interim analysis of a major outcome may be needed to justify halting or modifying the study prematurely, for the superiority hypothesis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par191">Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for management of pre-eclampsia varies by gestation. Previous trials have shown that if delivery is initiated after 37â€‰weeks of gestation for women with pre-eclampsia, maternal complications are reduced without increasing fetal risks. Prior to 34â€‰weeks of gestation, usual management is to aim to prolong pregnancy for fetal benefit, unless severe complications occur that necessitate a preterm delivery. This trial aims to address the uncertainty in the balance of benefits and risks of an earlier delivery compared to expectant management. Previous trials in this area have been undertaken, but have not provided a definitive answer, and the research question remains active. The results of this trial are highly likely to influence clinical practice internationally, through a direct impact and through impacting guidelines in countries with similar settings.</p>

                <p id="Par246">Primary responsibility for preparing publications will lie with the chief investigator, Professor Lucy Chappell, who will liaise with the NPEU Clinical Trials Unit to deliver effective dissemination. All publications using data from this trial for original analyses will be submitted to the TSC for review before release. The research will be published in high-impact peer-reviewed scientific journals. There are no commercial or intellectual rights issues that would delay publication of results. The writing will be the responsibility of a writing committee drawn from the co-investigators (trial grant holders), trial co-ordinators and others substantially involved in execution, analysis and interpretation. The committee will be named authors on the principal publications arising from the trial, provided they meet the authorship criteria used by most high-impact peer-reviewed journals (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org">http://www.icmje.org</ext-link>). No external professional writers will be used. Local principal investigators will be named formally as collaborators on the publication. Other trial personnel with significant input to the running of the trial will be named in the acknowledgements section of published research. The chief investigator will nominate and agree appropriate authorship on all publications prior to commencement of writing. Participants will be sent a summary of trial publications if they wish, with a reference to the final paper. A copy of the journal article will be made available to them on request from the chief investigator. Information will be made available on the trial website, including the final report and any publications when available.</p>
                <p id="Par247">To target the clinical community, the results of this research will be disseminated at conventional academic platforms, including presentations at prominent national and international conferences. The results will be available for inclusion in the relevant Cochrane review and in national and international guidelines. Requests for the final dataset can be made through the chief investigator in accordance with the data-sharing policies of Kingâ€™s College London and the NPEU Clinical Trials Unit, with input from the co-investigator group where applicable.</p>
