                <p>Convalescent plasma (CP) treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shown significant therapeutic effect when administered early (eg, Argentinian trial showing reduced hospitalization) but has in general been ineffective (eg, REMAP-CAP trial without improvement during hospitalization). To investigate whether the differences in CP used could explain the different outcomes, we compared neutralizing antibodies, anti-spike IgG, and avidity of CP used in the REMAP-CAP and Argentinian trials and in convalescent vaccinees. We found no difference between the trial plasmas, emphasizing initial patient serostatus as treatment efficacy predictor. By contrast, vaccinee CP showed significantly higher titers and avidity, being preferable for future CP treatment.</p>

                <p>Outcomes of 2 clinical SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma treatment trials, one effective the other ineffective, were not explained by serological markers of the convalescent plasma used. Start of treatment in relation to disease progression was likely the key factor that determined success.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Despite successful development of targeted antiviral therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a need for more effective treatment options for severely affected individuals and better protection for vulnerable groups, such as the immunocompromised. While immune protection relies on both cellular and humoral immunity, the administration of SARS-CoV-2–specific neutralizing antibodies (nAb) can enhance host immunity. Convalescent plasma (CP) treatment using plasma collected from previously infected donors has been shown to have a significant therapeutic effect in terms of disease progression when administered early or before hospitalization [<xref rid="jiad070-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="jiad070-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Multiple subsequent trials have observed no clinical benefit in terms of disease outcome or mortality when treating those more severely ill, unless they have impaired immunity [<xref rid="jiad070-B3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>]. Monoclonal anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy has shown to be effective, yet exclusively when given before antibody response [<xref rid="jiad070-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
            <p>As the clinical trials differ in patient demographics, treatment protocols, and timing in relation to the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the reasons underlying the differences in efficacy of CP remain to be determined. Firstly, potential variability in the criteria used to select donors may influence CP potency. It is also possible that CP administration is only able to change the course of disease during very early stages, mimicking the role of vaccination, whereas this protective effect might be lost if administered after onset of the host's own response. In addition, assays used in CP characterization, which determine selection of high-titer antisera for transfusion, may vary between trials. High titers of nAb against SARS-CoV-2 are generally considered essential for protection, while some other antibody properties, such as afucosylation or association with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, have been considered potentially harmful [<xref rid="jiad070-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Finally, no clinical trials to date have investigated the importance of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity, the average binding strength of a polyclonal antibody population towards an antigen, in therapeutic CP, although it is proposed to act as a favorable clinical outcome predictor in COVID-19 [<xref rid="jiad070-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The wider picture is further complicated by emergence of new variants partly evading neutralization by antibodies raised against earlier variants or vaccines, potentially also affecting antibody avidity.</p>
            <p>In this study, we have investigated whether the differences in nAb titers, spike protein binding, and avidity of plasma used in the Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) and Argentinian trials were associated with their markedly different clinical outcomes [<xref rid="jiad070-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="jiad070-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We further compared these metrics in plasma collected from convalescent donors following vaccination to guide the future selection of potential donors of CP therapy.</p>

                <p>Anti-Spike IgG titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using spike antigen based on the first strains reported from Wuhan in January 2020 [<xref rid="jiad070-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The samples were tested in 4-fold dilution series, and a titration curve was fitted to the series as previously described [<xref rid="jiad070-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The titers were normalized against a calibrator plasma [<xref rid="jiad070-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The ELISA was adapted for anti-spike IgG avidity: each sample was assayed in 2 dilution series; after antigen-binding, one series was incubated 3 times for 5 minutes with 4 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline Tween (PBST) and the other with PBST alone. Both series were washed once with PBST before applying anti-human IgG conjugate (Dako P0214); IgG avidity was calculated by the ratio of titers with and without urea, respectively, as described [<xref rid="jiad070-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. High avidity is indicative of stronger binding, reflecting higher antibody affinity. Anti-spike IgM was measured, as described for IgG, using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgM (Dako P0215; 1:1000 diluted). Neutralizing antibodies were detected using a live-virus microneutralization assay [<xref rid="jiad070-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study, we have firstly compared the serological metrics of CP used in REMAP-CAP and Argentinian trials, considering their markedly different outcomes. Whereas the REMAP-CAP trial could not demonstrate effectiveness of CP when administered to severely ill COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="jiad070-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the Argentinian trial showed reduction in the COVID-19 progression among older adult patients that received CP within 3 days from the onset of mild COVID-19 symptoms [<xref rid="jiad070-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We have further compared these metrics to those obtained in plasma collected from convalescent donors following vaccination.</p>
              <p>As no differences in serological reactivity, nAb titers, or avidities in the plasma used in these 2 trials were observed in the present study (<xref rid="jiad070-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), it appears likely that their therapeutic potencies were equivalent, whereby additional explanations such as timing or populations treated will more likely account for the different clinical outcomes. Aspects of patient selection may also have contributed to the trial outcomes; in the REMAP-CAP trial, 68% of patients were male, also shown to be at elevated risk of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas in the Argentinian trial men accounted for merely 38% of those treated.</p>
              <p>In terms of antibody maturation (low avidity, IgM positivity) the plasma used in REMAP-CAP and Argentinian trials was typical for endogenous antibodies produced during primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages has been suggested to trigger inflammatory cell death leading to systemic inflammation that further modulates COVID-19 pathogenesis, but such antibody-mediated enhancement is not seen with vaccinee plasma [<xref rid="jiad070-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For these reasons, as well as their higher nAb titers and avidity, it might be beneficial to collect CP from vaccinated individuals to avoid pathology, especially if plasma was given to patients during late-stage SARS-CoV-2 infection, as demonstrated by the high pretreatment (70%) IgG seropositivity in the REMAP-CAP trial.</p>
              <p>The therapeutic value of vaccine-derived CP is likely further enhanced by its previously described broadly neutralizing antibody response to new SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, which is important as such continue to emerge [<xref rid="jiad070-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This issue was also considered at the time of REMAP-CAP trial analyses when the emergence of Alpha variant became obvious [<xref rid="jiad070-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and which led to a substantial loss of efficacy of most available monoclonal antibody therapies [<xref rid="jiad070-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We should also aim to determine the neutralizing antibody threshold for effective CP treatment, similar to what has been previously determined for vaccine efficacy [<xref rid="jiad070-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, enrolment of convalescent blood donors is now more laborious than in the beginning of the pandemic as SARS-CoV-2 infections are not currently that well recorded. It is also currently unknown to what extent the initial exposure, whether infection or vaccine, defines the antibody response that is later enhanced by booster vaccinations or infections (the original antigenic sin). While the present vaccine immunity is mostly against the original Wuhan strain, use of plasma of recently infected donors could better account for SARS-CoV-2 evolution whereas monoclonal antibodies or vaccines may need constant updating.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found no difference between CPs from REMAP-CAP or Argentina trials. As exemplified by the difference in the REMAP-CAP and Argentinian cohorts, simple antibody supplementation is clearly of greater value for patients prior to anti–SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. Furthermore, plasma collected from convalescent donors following vaccination should be preferable for future CP treatment.</p>
