                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A novel loaded self-managed exercise programme that includes pain education and self-management strategies may result in better outcomes for people with patellofemoral pain (PFP). However, establishing program feasibility is an essential first step before testing efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a definitive RCT which will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a loaded self-managed exercise programme for people with PFP compared with usual physiotherapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In a mixed methods, pragmatic, randomised controlled feasibility study, 60 participants with PFP (57% female; mean age 29âyears) were recruited from a physiotherapy clinic within a large UK teaching hospital. They were randomly allocated to receive either a loaded self-managed exercise programme (<italic>n</italic>Â =â30) or usual physiotherapy (nâ=â30). Feasibility indicators of process, resources, and management were collected through follow-up of standardised questionnaires six months after recruitment and semi-structured interviews with 20 participants and physiotherapists.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Recruitment rate was 5 participants per month; consent rate was 99%; adherence to intervention appointments was 87%; completeness of questionnaire data was 100%; and adherence to intervention delivery was 95%.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Three exercise diaries were returned at six months (5%). At six months, 25 questionnaire booklets were returned (9 in the loaded self-managed group, 16 in the usual physiotherapy group), with a total retention rate of 42%.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">At six months, 56% (5/9) of respondents in the loaded self-managed group and 56% (9/16) in the usual physiotherapy group were classified as ârecoveredâ.</p>
                  <p id="Par6">Both groups demonstrated improvements in average pain (VAS), kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, general self-efficacy and EQ-5D-5âL from baseline to six months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par7">The results of this feasibility study confirm that it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a loaded self-managed exercise programme to adults with PFP in an NHS physiotherapy outpatient setting. However, between group differences in lost to follow up and poor exercise diary completion mean we are uncertain on some feasibility aspects. These methodological issues need addressing prior to conducting a definitive RCT.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par30">Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most common forms of knee pain in adults under the age of 40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has an estimated prevalence of 23% in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The long-term prognosis for PFP is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Only one-third of patients are pain-free one year after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and 91% still report pain and dysfunction four years post-diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">There remains scientific debate around the underlying aetiology of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is thought most likely to be multifactorial in origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There is currently little high-quality level 1 evidence to base conservative management on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Even in relation to exercise therapy, which has the strongest evidence-base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there remains insufficient evidence to determine the best form and dose of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Many patients with PFP develop associated pain- related fear, such as fear-avoidance, catastrophizing thoughts and low self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These psychological factors not only affect function and quality of life of patients with pain but can modulate the individual pain experience. This may influence the development or maintenance of chronic pain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A systematic review of self-management interventions for chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain (16 studies; <italic>n</italic>Â =â4047), found self-efficacy and depression were the strongest prognostic factors for pain and disability (irrespective of the intervention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Pain catastrophizing and increasing physical activity were the strongest mediating factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This provides a foundation that interventions should be aimed at improving pain-related fear and increasing physical activity in relation to self-management strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Exercise therapies designed to load and temporarily aggravate patientsâ symptoms have demonstrated improvements for a range of MSK disorders including tendon pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], shoulder pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and plantar heel pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The potential rationale and mechanisms behind loaded painful exercises include positive changes to central and peripheral pain mechanisms, the immune system and affective aspects of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Specifically, these exercises are prescribed to address pain-related fear within a framework of âhurt not equalling harmâ, with the pain experience rationalised as a consequence of âde-conditionedâ tissue. Hypothetically, over time, the exercises reduce pain related-fear and the overall sensitivity of the central nervous system, with a modified pain experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Exercise interventions for PFP have shown a âdose-responseâ, where the greater the volume and intensity of exercise the patient performs the greater their improvement in long-term pain and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A recent systematic review of painful exercises versus pain-free exercises for chronic MSK pain found regimes using painful exercises offered a small, but significant benefit over pain-free exercises in the short-term. It also reported that regimes using painful exercises typically have higher loads and dose of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nonetheless, the optimal dose of exercise for the greatest improvements in PFP remains uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Based on these uncertainties, high-quality research on exercise prescription in relation to pain mechanisms and response to load/resistance warrants further investigation. However, to ensure the success of a large multi-centred randomised controlled trial (RCT), several feasibility questions needed to be answered.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The primary aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a definitive RCT which will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an intervention based on pain science (where exercises are designed to load and temporarily aggravate patientsâ symptoms), self-management strategies and improvements in physical activity levels for people with PFP compared to usual physiotherapy. The intervention has been referred to as a loaded self-managed exercise programme.</p>

                <title>Loaded self-managed exercise programme</title>
                <p id="Par49">The âexperimentalâ intervention was a loaded self- managed exercise programme. It is a novel intervention based on pain science (where a single exercise is designed to load and temporarily aggravate patientsâ symptoms), self-management strategies and improvements in physical activity levels, delivered by trained and supported NHS physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The intervention was set within a framework of reducing fear-avoidance, with an emphasis on participant self-management of the condition and exercise programme, and improvements in physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A full description of the intervention has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A brief description is detailed below.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Education of the patients regarding pain mechanisms, such as addressing any beliefs or fear within the participant that pain was a sign of tissue damage, was planned to take up a large portion of the clinical time. Patient discourse regarding tissue-based pathology models of pain, e.g. patellar mal-tracking, or limb mal-alignment was actively discouraged by the physiotherapist.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The physiotherapists prescribed the exercise and typically involved body weight resistance in the form of a modification of the âStep Downâ function test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], a single leg squatting exercise sideways on a step. The exercise required balance, knee extension strength, eccentric control and isometric hip strength. The participants were advised to exercise to the point of fatigue, such that it reproduced their pain and discomfort, whilst ensuring pain was manageable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par52">Exercise progression was guided by the symptomatic response. Participants were advised that on cessation of the exercise, the pain should remain no worse than pre-exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Participants with more severe pain were able to start on a lighter regime, guided by the baseline functional assessment by the treating physiotherapist. Regression of the exercise programme was reduced repetitions or lightening the exercise, for example moving from single-leg squats to double-leg squats or isometric static squats. Progression was in the form of increased repetitions or increasing the load by moving to plyometric exercises, such as jumping and hopping, for younger participants with higher sporting requirements.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Participants were taught one exercise, to aid adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], whilst being time-efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Participants were advised to perform the exercise twice daily. They were encouraged to self-direct progressing/regressing the repetitions, as guided by their pain response. This was done to promote internalising the locus of control and towards self-management and overall improvements in physical activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par54">Self-management strategies employed included: goal-setting, discussions about managing âflare upsâ and potential or perceived barriers to successful outcomes of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">Keeping the treatment pragmatic, the timing of follow-ups, number of treatment sessions, frequency and discharge, and physiotherapy-led passive treatments was at the discretion of the qualified physiotherapist. However, as the aim of the programme was focused on self-management strategies, self-directed exercises were promoted and concomitant treatments discouraged. All participants had the opportunity to telephone for support if required, as per usual department practice.</p>
                <p id="Par56">To avoid cross-contamination between the two groups, the intervention group was delivered by physiotherapists who were excluded from treating participants from the control group (and vice versa).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par99">The results of this study confirm that it is feasible and acceptable to deliver a loaded self-managed exercise programme to adults with PFP in an NHS physiotherapy outpatient setting. However, differences in lost to follow up and poor exercise diary completion mean we are uncertain on some feasibility aspects, with potential for systematic bias. Further feasibility work may be needed to address these issues, before supporting a larger clinical trial which will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a loaded self-managed exercise programme for people with PFP compared with usual physiotherapy.</p>
              <sec id="Sec36">
                <title>Process</title>
                <p id="Par100">The observed recruitment rate was 5.0 participants per month at the single site over 13âmonths. We had expected to be able to recruit 4.6 patients per month but deemed a recruitment rate of 3.7 feasible. Our initial recruitment strategy was an estimate based on the referral rate (after full screening by a physiotherapist) of 23 per month (based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria), which was observed in the department between January 2013 and October 2013. However, the observed number of referrals during the study was less than the rate observed in 2013, with 16.8 potentially eligible patients referred each month (before full screening). Therefore, any future definitive trial should consider a lower referral rate than we had initially anticipated.</p>
                <p id="Par101">Of the participants interviewed, both patients and physiotherapists, no barriers to recruitment were identified. However, as the embedded interviews were conducted on recruited participants, it may represent a biased sample. Furthermore, it may be that the participants interviewed felt inhibited to provide negative feedback because they were interviewed by the main researcher. From a management perspective, 50 (27.8%) potential recruits were uncontactable via the telephone numbers supplied by the referring healthcare professional. Therefore, any future trial may need to include strategies in the protocol to cross-check potential eligible participants contact details on referrals with primary care databases.</p>
                <p id="Par102">The qualitative interviews identified no barriers or issues with the delivery of the training package to the physiotherapists. However, positive reference was made to the physiotherapy departmentâs frequency in participating in clinical trials, suggesting the staff were more willing and able to adapt to the suggested evidence-based training package than, perhaps, a department less experienced in clinical trials.</p>

              <sec id="Sec37">
                <title>Resources</title>
                <p id="Par103">One of the biggest challenges with exercise interventions is treatment adherence and monitoring of adherence. With unsupervised exercises, it is unclear to what degree participants have engaged with the prescribed exercise to obtain any therapeutic benefit. This feasibility study used exercise diaries as a measure of self-reported exercise adherence. The three diaries returned indicated exercise adherence of 42% of the time (40% in the loaded self-managed exercise group compared with 43% in the usual physiotherapy group). However, with such a low return rate, the reliability and validity of the data are limited. Recent systematic reviews have highlighted the lack of validated and reliable self-report measures for unsupervised, exercise-based rehabilitation adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Therefore, any future definitive trial may need to consider it unfeasible to monitor adherence through self-reported paper-based measures.</p>
                <p id="Par104">Through qualitative interviews with both patients and physiotherapists, we were able to understand the acceptability of the study design and any potential challenges that may occur with implementation into a large RCT. Patients and physiotherapists perceived some value and benefit from the intervention, which can be seen in the effect sizes of the patient reported outcome measures (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), though the degree and nature of this benefit were variable, with the aforementioned un-even lost to follow up.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec38">
                <title>Management</title>
                <p id="Par105">The fidelity assessment highlighted some interesting findings on current practice (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In contrast to current UK wide physiotherapy treatment, and international best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], very few physiotherapists provided movement retraining exercises, vastus medialis (VM) exercises, hip-specific exercise or stretches; and no physiotherapists in the usual physiotherapy group offered patella taping, joint mobilisations or orthotics. Further qualitative work trying to understand the nature of and impact of the content of the control group was conducted and published separately. Nonetheless, 95% of patients received the intervention as described in the protocol, indicating intervention fidelity was not an issue in this study.</p>
                <p id="Par106">The overall level of missing data for the returned patient-reported outcome measures was negligible (0.3%). However, the return rate was below the feasibility threshold, with a retention rate of 42%. The telephone and postal reminder for non-returned questionnaires did not improve the response. The researcher also asked treating physiotherapists to prompt participants, should they still be receiving physiotherapy management; this accounted for four receipts of outcome questionnaires, each one being completed in the physiotherapy department during a follow-up appointment. It remains unclear why such a large lost to follow-up occurred. Patient representatives of the trial steering committee approved the completion time of the questionnaires, and this was confirmed by the qualitative interviews of the participants. Of the five patients interviewed who failed to return an outcome questionnaire, four stated they had, suggesting some problem with the pre-paid envelopes. However, internal and external testing of the pre-paid envelopes in the UK and hospital mail system operated correctly. One patient did acknowledge to having failed to return one of their outcome questionnaires saying they simply forgot. This compares to 97 and 96% (at 12âmonths) in the largest PFP RCT trials to date in the Netherlands and Australia respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. These trials optimised collection of the main outcome measure by telephone follow-ups and e-mail, rather than relying solely on postal mail.</p>
                <p id="Par107">The retention rate was uneven, with 21 lost to follow-up (70%) in the loaded self-managed group compared with 14 (47%) in the usual physiotherapy group at six months. Of note, is the four participants who failed to return outcome forms at six months, who were still under the care of the physiotherapists and then went on to complete their six month outcome data during their follow-up appointments, were all in the usual physiotherapy group. One possible explanation for the uneven lost to follow-up rate could be the fewer appointments received and the shorter period under physiotherapy management that the loaded self-managed group received compared with the usual physiotherapy group. Ten per cent (3/29) of participants in the loaded self-managed group were still under physiotherapy care at the six month follow-up, compared with 50% (14/28) in the usual physiotherapy group. Lost to follow-up is lower when participants outcome schedule occurs with appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Indeed, the mean number of appointments were 2.4 and 3.2 in the loaded self-managed group and usual physiotherapy, respectively; this is considerably lower than the 7.7 appointments seen elsewhere in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A future definitive trial should make modifications to address participant engagement with the study, particularly after they have been discharged from physiotherapy. Strategies could include weekly telephone calls, frequent newsletters, and the use of e-mail or text messaging for measuring adherence or patient report outcome measures.</p>
                <p id="Par108">High participant attrition has been observed in different patient populations, in the same physiotherapy outpatients department, in a large scale RCT (56% at six months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A high attrition rate does not necessarily mean that large-scale RCTs are unfeasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], merely that the sample size calculation and recruitment rate should be adjusted to account for this. Further feasibility work may be warranted to test strategies to improve attrition, including, reducing the burden of the number of outcome measures; use of technology, e.g. text-messaging for reminders or using short outcome measures like pain score or GROC; asking the treating physiotherapists to remind the participants at three months; relaxing the criteria for success; using patient incentives to return forms, e.g. entry into a prize draw; using telephone consultations to complete the questionnaires; or telephoning participants at evenings and weekends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Interestingly, feasibility studies looking at web-based patient questionnaires have found equally low return rates (33% at 24âweeks follow-up), demonstrating the complexity of finding solutions to this problem.</p>

                <title>Strength and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par109">The principle strengths of this research are the comprehensive use of a mixed-methods approach, which was based on the recommendations of the Medical Research Council for the evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]; the use of concealed random allocation; and its pragmatic evaluation of physiotherapy assessment and interventions.</p>
                <p id="Par110">Study limitations included, firstly, the research being conducted at a single centre, thus reducing its generalisability. Whilst baseline demographics, symptom duration and average pain scores were comparable to previous trials in PFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]; a definitive RCT would be required to be multicentred to improve generalisability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Secondly, baseline patient-reported outcome measures were completed in front of an unblinded assessor. Future trials should introduce blinded assessors to reduce the risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">As briefly mentioned above, and despite efforts to the contrary, the embedded qualitative component was likely to have produced a biased sample of participants who had largely positive feelings towards the design of the study. Furthermore, they knew they were being interviewed by the main researcher and therefore may have felt obliged to answer questions favourably. Strategies to reduce this risk such as conducting interviews with an independent researcher or collecting anonymised questionnaires may be considered.</p>
                <p id="Par112">Lastly, as the exercise intervention was considered low risk, being commonly used in musculoskeletal pain populations, no adverse event data were collected.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par113">A loaded self-managed exercise programme designed around: pain education; a loaded exercise programme; and self-management strategies, is feasible and acceptable to deliver in an NHS physiotherapy outpatient setting. However, the present study demonstrates that, even with the appropriate physiotherapist training package, further feasibility work may be needed to address differences in lost to follow up and poor diary completion. These methodological issues need addressing, before supporting a larger clinical trial which will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a loaded self-managed exercise programme for people with PFP compared with usual physiotherapy.</p>
