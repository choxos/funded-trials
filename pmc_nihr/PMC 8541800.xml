                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome is time to disengagement: days from the date of allocation to care coordinator to date of the last contact following either refusal to engage with an EIP team or lack of response to EIP contact for 3 consecutive months which will be analysed using a shared frailty model. Secondary outcomes are Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS), Process of Recovery Questionnaire (QPR), DIALOG (a service user-reported measure of quality of life and treatment satisfaction) and service use outcomes which will be analysed using mixed effects regression models.</p>

              <p id="Par17">Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services improve health outcomes for young people with severe mental illness in the medium-long term, but 25% of young people disengage in the first 12 months at significant cost to their mental health, their families, society and the National Health Service (NHS). Our own feasibility-pilot work clarified the issues that affect engagement. This study will refine and test the team-based motivational Early Youth Engagement (EYE-2) intervention to improve engagement and outcomes for young people as detailed in the published trial protocol paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was written following guidelines for SAPs by Gamble et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par18">To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention with respect to the primary outcome: time to disengagement (in days from date of allocation to care coordinator to date of the last contact following either refusal to engage with EIP or lack of response to EIP contact for 3 consecutive months) and secondary, routinely collected and researcher collected, outcomes (service use, deaths, Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], Process of Recovery Questionnaire (QPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], DIALOG—a service-user-reported measure of quality of life and treatment satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]) derived from routine service data at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par19">EYE-2 is a cluster randomised controlled trial to compare the EYE-2 motivational engagement intervention plus standardised EIP service to standardised EIP service alone. Participating services are Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) clinical teams (henceforth referred to as teams) in 5 geographical locations in England including East Anglia (4 teams), Hampshire (4 teams), Manchester (5 teams), South London (3 teams) and Thames Valley (4 teams). These teams aim to promote recovery and reduce treatment delay for people experiencing first episode psychosis (FEP) by providing early access to multi-disciplinary support and treatment. Participating teams were expected to have at least 35–60 new FEP cases per year meeting participant inclusion criteria described below. A cluster randomised design was chosen to reduce the risk of contamination of the standardised EIP service teams with the EYE-2 intervention which is a team-based intervention. The intervention focuses on engagement, and although largely delivered by care coordinators (e.g. nurses, occupational therapists or social workers), it is supported by all members of the team including support workers, pharmacists, psychiatrists, psychologists and employment specialists.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Inclusion criteria for service users were defined as follows: (1) consecutive referrals to EIP services during the study recruitment period, (2) aged 14–35 years and (3) meeting criteria for a FEP as determined by each local service according to their own established criteria. Exclusion criteria were (1) sub-threshold ‘at risk mental state’, not meeting FEP criteria, (2) referrals over the age of 35, (3) diagnostic uncertainty about psychosis at 12 months and (4) service exclusion criteria such as organic or intoxication induced psychosis and specific exclusions.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The EYE-2 intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is a novel team-based motivational engagement model delivered by EIP teams of clinicians to young people with FEP. Key elements of the approach are (1) transparent, open communication; (2) social involvement and support from service users’ social network; (3) collaborative approach supporting client treatment choices; (4) hopeful supportive approach towards meaningful goals; and (5) addressing personal barriers to engagement. Clinicians delivering the approach are provided with training and an implementation toolkit consisting of an implementation manual, individual implementation checklists, online video resources and training, myth-busting booklets on (i) mental health and help-seeking, (ii) EIP services, (iii) advice for friends and family and (iv) treatment choices, and an engagement-focussed mental health companion website.</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p id="Par22">Teams administering interventions and individual participants are not blind to allocation. The research assistants rating the primary outcome are blind to the allocation status of teams at their respective sites. The statisticians, health economists and process evaluation research team members are also blind to allocation. The analysis will be conducted using dummy labels for the trial arms, using a code to which the statisticians are blinded. Final unblinding will only occur once the statistical analysis has been completed. SB had access to disaggregated data by coded treatment allocation for the purposes of separate exploratory work relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par23">A statistician at the Brighton and Sussex Clinical Trials Unit generated a randomisation list comprising permuted blocks of size 2, stratified by site using a tool provided by Sealed Envelope™ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], an independent online randomisation service. To achieve statistician blinding and to ensure concealment, this was sent to an independent statistician to combine with the teams list, itself randomly ordered within site by sorting a random number list and then uploaded to Sealed Envelope. The study research fellow requested the password-protected concealed allocations online once all the participating teams at a site had reached the threshold for care coordinator and staff recruitment (≥ 80%) and were deemed ready to start.</p>

                <p id="Par24">Participants are a consecutive sample in each service. Time to disengagement will be analysed using frailty analysis to adjust for clustering by team. Simulation confirms that 10 clusters (teams) per arm (<italic>N</italic> = 950 participants in total across the 20 teams) will achieve 90% power to detect a difference corresponding to 12-month disengagement rates of 25% (standard 12-month disengagement rate from EIP service) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] versus 15%, assuming time to disengagement follows an exponential distribution; intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 (to be conservative in the absence of information on this parameter); loss to follow-up rate 10% per year; conservative significance level 3% to correct for inflation of type I error due to the small number of teams; variable cluster size modelled as a uniform random variable between 35 and 60; recruitment at referral; 12 months’ recruitment plus 12 months’ follow-up. The target reduction in disengagement and expected loss to follow-up were based on data from the original EYE pilot project. We did not anticipate any loss of teams during the trial. Simulations were conducted using the SimSam package in Stata 14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/richard-hooper/simsam/tree/EYE2">https://github.com/richard-hooper/simsam/tree/EYE2</ext-link>.</p>
                <p id="Par25">In October 2019, the Trial Steering Committee asked us to re-evaluate the statistical power in light of the lower-than-expected rate of service user identification and to consider an extended timetable for the trial. We used recruitment figures to date to project the recruitment to each team if we recruited for a total of 15.5 months, and calculated power assuming an additional follow-up period of either 8.5 or 12 months. This re-calculation of power was done blind to the actual treatment allocations: simulations of power were conducted over all possible randomisations of teams stratified by site, with all other assumptions as in the original, pre-trial power calculation above. We estimated the power to be 85% with 15.5 months’ recruitment plus 8.5 months’ follow-up or 90% with 15.5 months’ recruitment plus 12 months’ follow-up.</p>

Primary outcome status (engaged, disengaged, lost to follow-up) will be double-rated by an independent clinician based on all available data, and any discrepancies will be discussed to reach consensus. For those who have disengaged or have been lost to follow-up, the timing of this event will be retrospectively determined. For participants who remain engaged until the end of the study follow-up period, time to disengagement is treated as censored (unknown) beyond this point. This definition is widely used in engagement research. People who engage intermittently every few weeks or via text message or phone would still be engaged. Engagement will be evaluated according to the trial protocol and the EYE-2 Primary Outcome Rating Guidance Document (see Additional file 1) by double-rating, by raters blind to the allocation status of teams. Whilst final data entry and cleaning is conducted, we will continue to follow up engaged participants for a further 3 months to identify any final disengagement outcomes.</p>

Where more than one baseline value is available, we will select that which is closest to the date when the patient was allocated to their care coordinator. Due to the pressures of delivering clinical services, much of the secondary outcome data is collected outside the allowable windows. In order to accommodate this, such observations will be snapped to the nearest interim (pseudo) time point, i.e. 3, 9, 15 and 21 months.</p>

                    <p id="Par60">Time to disengagement will be summarised by intervention arm and compared between trial arms using Cox regression with a gamma-distributed shared frailty to allow for the clustering by team. Missing values for the primary outcome, time to disengagement (due to loss to follow-up or remaining engaged at the end of data collection), are considered censored. The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. Should this assumption not be met, the model will be fitted after splitting the follow-up at the median (using Stata’s 'stsplit' command) and fitting the interaction between this and the randomisation variable. Alternatively, if the assumption is not met due to one or more covariates, we will stratify the modelling on these. If this analysis fails to converge, we will employ fully parametric time-to-event exponential regression analysis with a shared frailty. With a relatively small number of teams per arm, there is a risk that the type I error rate will be inflated—we will use a permutation test in order to obtain a true significance level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Time to disengagement or the time beyond which observations are censored (due to loss to follow-up or end of data collection) will be known for all participants. Fixed effects will include treatment allocation, site, age at allocation to care coordinator and substance misuse score (HoNOS question 3) at baseline. We will report the 2-sided <italic>p</italic> value (and its 95% confidence interval) from the permutation test of the treatment effect.

HoNOS, QPR and DIALOG will be analysed using mixed effects regression analysis of all non-missing data (valid if outcomes are missing-at-random) appropriate to distribution, with random effects for time point and for team and a Kenward-Roger small-sample correction to account for the small number of teams.

Observations for these outcomes falling outside expected collection windows will be quantified and visualised. Intermediate (pseudo) time points at m3 and m9 will be created between the main time points (m0, m6 and m12), and observations will be assigned to the closest empty time point. For HoNOS, baseline observations will not be reassigned to later time points as data collection for HoNOS occurred close to baseline, and baseline score will be included as a covariate in the model. For QPR and DIALOG, baseline data collection could occur after true baseline, so these observations may be reassigned to their closest empty time point; otherwise, the baseline score will instead be included in the outcome variable. An interaction between treatment allocation and time will be included in these models, but the treatment allocation (intervention) main effect will not be included (QPR and DIALOG models), as this represents a comparison of the outcome at baseline.

This will be performed using Δ = Δoutcome + Y<sub>1</sub>P<sub>1</sub> – Y<sub>0</sub>P<sub>0</sub>, where Δ is the treatment effect under MNAR, Δoutcome is the treatment effect, estimated with the ‘margins’ command in Stata, from each secondary analysis model, Y1<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>0</sub> are the assumed mean participant responses of those missing data in the ‘EYE-2 intervention plus standardised EIP service’ and ‘standardised EIP service alone’ arms respectively, and P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>0</sub> are the proportions of participants excluded from analysis in their respective arms. Y<sub>0</sub> will be varied for each outcome variable, and for each value of Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>1</sub> will be set equal to: {Y<sub>0</sub> - x, Y<sub>0</sub>, Y<sub>0</sub> + x}.
