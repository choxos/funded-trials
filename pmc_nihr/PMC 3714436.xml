                  <p>In models of dopaminergic neuronal loss, the dopamine agonist pramipexole has exhibited neuroprotective properties.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Between May 24, 2006, and April 22, 2009, at 98 centres, we recruited patients with PD diagnosed within 2 years and aged 30â79 years. We randomly assigned eligible patients (ratio 1:1), by a centralised, computerised randomisation schedule, to receive double-blind either placebo or pramipexole (1Â·5 mg a day) and followed them up for 15 months. At 9 months, or as early as 6 months if considered necessary, placebo recipients were assigned to pramipexole. In a neuroimaging substudy, striatal dopamine-transporter binding was assessed by SPECT. All patients, investigators, and independent raters were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was the 15-month change from baseline in total score on the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, number <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT00321854" id="interrefs20">NCT00321854</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Of 535 patients, 261 were randomly assigned to receive pramipexole and 274 to receive placebo. At 15 months (n=411), adjusted mean change in UPDRS total score showed no significant difference between early and delayed pramipexole (â0Â·4 points, 95% CI â2Â·2 to 1Â·4, p=0Â·65). 62 patients in the early pramipexole group and 61 patients in the delayed pramipexole group were included in the neuroimaging substudy, for which the adjusted mean 15-month change in striatal <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT binding was â15Â·1% (SE 2Â·1) for early and â14Â·6% (2Â·0) for delayed pramipexole (difference â0Â·5 percentage points, 95% CI â5Â·4 to 4Â·4, p=0Â·84). Overall, 180 (81%) of patients given early pramipexole and 179 (84%) patients given delayed pramipexole reported adverse events (most frequently nausea), and 22 (10%) patients in the early pramipexole group and 17 (8%) in the delayed pramipexole group had serious events, two of which (hallucinations and orthostatic hypotension) were deemed related to study drug.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>By clinical and neuroimaging measures, pramipexole showed little evidence differentiating 15-month usage from usage delayed for 6â9 months. The results do not support the hypothesis that pramipexole has disease-modifying effects.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para50">Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta underlies the major early motor features by which the disease is diagnosed clinically. Although several therapeutic strategies are available to treat the dopamine deficiency of PD and have been shown to improve motor symptoms, no drug has yet been shown unequivocally to slow the progression of the loss of dopamine cells.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Development of a therapy to slow progression of neurodegeneration in PD is a major unmet need.</p>
              <p id="para60">Pramipexole is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the treatment of PD motor symptoms in early and advanced PD.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In cell culture studies<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and studies in rodents<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and primates,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> pramipexole showed neuroprotective properties that seemed to arise partly by a mitochondria-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanism. These results were the basis for considering that, in addition to its symptomatic action, pramipexole might have a disease-modifying effect.</p>
              <p id="para70">The Pramipexole On Underlying Disease (PROUD) study was designed to identify whether early, as opposed to delayed, initiation of pramipexole resulted in improved outcome, as defined by unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) total score.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> We undertook a neuroimaging substudy to assess the effect of the drug on the rate of loss of dopamine transporter binding.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> PROUD is the second prospectively designed delayed-start trial in PD, and to our knowledge the first to combine clinical and neuroimaging endpoints.</p>

                <p id="para80">PROUD is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start trial of pramipexole in patients with early PD. The clinical trial design of PROUD has been published previously and the reader is referred to the report for detailed discussion of the design.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para90">We recruited patients at 98 centres in ten countries (Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA). Patients were 30â79 years (extended from 75 years by protocol amendment in October 2006, to facilitate enrolment), had idiopathic PD characterised by bradykinesia plus at least two further PD signs (resting tremor, rigidity, or asymmetry), were at modified Hoehn and Yahr<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> stage 1 or 2, were diagnosed within the preceding 2 years, and were judged unlikely to need symptomatic treatment for at least the next 6 months, preferably 9 months. We excluded potential patients if they were currently using PD drugs, had used antipsychotic drugs within the preceding 6 months, or had any clinically significant abnormalities unrelated to PD in physical findings or laboratory values; we also excluded patients with medical or psychiatric disorders capable of interfering with study participation or the interpretation of study data, and those with any history of psychosis, dementia, or major or seasonal depression.</p>
                <p id="para100">The study was conducted in accordance with its protocol, with good clinical practice, and with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. Before patients were enrolled, the protocol, the informed-consent form, and all protocol amendments were approved by local Institutional Review Boards or Independent Ethics Committees. The nature and purpose of the study were explained to all patients, who provided written informed consent before any study procedures.</p>

                <p id="para110">Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) by centralised, computerised, sponsor-maintained randomisation schedule to receive double-blind pramipexole or placebo.</p>
                <p id="para120">Study drug (ie, pramipexole tablets or matching placebo) was up-titrated over 4 weeks from 0Â·125 mg three times a day to 0Â·25 mg three times a day, and finally 0Â·5 mg three times a day, a fixed maintenance level shown to provide adequate symptomatic benefit and intended to minimise withdrawal due to adverse events in those assigned to active drug.</p>
                <p id="para130">At 9 months, or as early as 6 months if an investigator elected it for a patient expressing inability to tolerate PD symptoms, participants were all assigned to the pramipexole regimen, including its double-blind up-titration. For all patients, the month 9 visit (which could be conducted as much as 3 months earlier) marked the transition from study period 1 (double-blind pramipexole <italic>vs</italic> placebo) to period 2 (double-blind early <italic>vs</italic> delayed pramipexole). Any patient needing additional PD treatment discontinued the study. Non-PD treatment (including anti-emetics) was permitted for the welfare of the patient, on the basis of investigator judgment.</p>
                <p id="para140">All patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. Pramipexole tablets and matching placebo were given in identical blister packaging. Masking was maintained during period 2 for all but two patients unmasked for non-emergencies. An independent masked rater distinct from the study investigators assessed patients at baseline and 15 months, and was separate from the masked investigator who assessed patients at every visit.</p>

A study investigator assessed the UPDRS at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 15 months. The independent rates also assessed the clinical global impression-global improvement (CGI-I) and clinical global impression-severity of illness (CGI-S) scales<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> applied at 15 months. Additionally, at 6â9 months (ie, end of period 1) and at 15 months (end of period 2), patients assessed their quality of life on the Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39), the EuroQoL five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQVAS). Patients also completed the Beck depression inventory version 1A (BDI).</p>
                <p id="para160">The imaging substudy group was a subset of patients in the PROUD study who provided additional consent for this substudy and who had a baseline and a post-baseline (15 months) assessment of striatal dopamine transporter density, as measured by SPECT at sites with tracer availability.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Striatal binding of <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT, a marker of dopamine-transporter density, was assessed by standardised SPECT and interpreted centrally by one of the lead investigators (KM).</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="para180">The primary outcome variable was the 15-month change from baseline in total score on the UPDRS, as assessed by an independent rater. Secondary assessments included the UPDRS assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 15 months by a study investigator and the CGI-I and CGI-S applied at 15 months by the independent raters.</p>
                <p id="para190">The period 2 full-analysis set included all patients randomly assigned to treatment who took at least one dose of study drug and had UPDRS scores assessed by an independent rater at baseline and at least once during period 2. In this set, we compared mean 15-month change in total UPDRS score between patients assigned to early pramipexole versus delayed pramipexole using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with country and baseline score as covariates. We expected the final UPDRS total score at month 15 to be correlated with the baseline score. Therefore, we selected an ANCOVA model for the primary analysis change in UPDRS total score from baseline at the end of the second maintenance phase (ie, period 2; month 15) with factors treatment and centre and the covariate UPDRS total score at baseline. For patients who discontinued prematurely during period 2, we used scores at their time of withdrawal for analysis.</p>

We also analysed other UPDRS score changes by ANCOVA including the slope of total-score change from month 3 to month 9 in all patients with at least two UPDRS assessments during period 1. We calculated the slope as the difference between the last and first UPDRS observations during this period divided by the number of weeks between these observations. We analysed changes in quality of life ratings using Wilcoxon rank sum tests with treatment effects summarised by Hodges-Lehmann estimates. We analysed BDI changes as the sum of 21 item scores. We collapsed CGI-I ratings into three categoriesâmuch or very much improved, essentially unchanged, and much or very much worseâand analysed these groups for odds of category improvement using multinomial logistic regression (with terms for treatment, country, and CGI-S). On CGI-S, we defined changes of one rating point or fewer as essentially unchanged.</p>
                <p id="para210">In the neuroimaging substudy, we analysed mean binding change by ANCOVA (with adjustment for centre and baseline value).

              <p id="para240">We recruited patients between May 24, 2006, and April 22, 2009. Of 593 patients screened, 535 were randomly assigned to either early pramipexole (261 patients) or delayed pramipexole (274 patients; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). 221 (85%) of 261 patients assigned to early pramipexole and 214 (78%) of 274 patients assigned to delayed pramipexole (ie, placebo) completed period 1 of the study. Of patients who entered period 2, 45 (20%) of 221 patients who received early pramipexole did so before 9 months, compared with 65 (30%) of 214 patients who received delayed pramipexole. Of the 435 patients entering period 2, 198 (90%) of the patients in the early pramipexole group (or 76% of the initial group) and 192 (90%) of the patients in the delayed pramipexole group (or 70% of the initial group) completed period 2. In both treatment groups during both periods, adverse events were the main reason for premature discontinuation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The most common adverse events leading to premature discontinuation in the delayed group during period 1 were related to need for symptomatic PD treatment. Overall, mean compliance with treatment (expressed as percentage of prescribed doses taken) was 95Â·9% (SD 10Â·3) in the early pramipexole group and 95Â·3% (12Â·5) in the delayed pramipexole group.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>PD=Parkinson's disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

              <p id="para340">At a maintenance dose of 1Â·5 mg per day in patients with early PD, at 15 months, UPDRS scores, clinical global impression ratings, quality of life ratings, and BDI score did not differ significantly between those given early pramipexole and those given delayed pramipexole. Additionally, 15-month <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT neuroimaging findings showed a decrease in striatal dopamine-transporter binding that was equivalent in the early and delayed starters. In the first 6â9 months, the clinical efficacy of pramipexole relative to placebo in improving motor function and quality of life was confirmed at a dose limited to 1Â·5 mg daily, although an increase in drug-related adverse events was noted. The difference in UPDRS in period 1 was a consequence of deterioration from baseline in the placebo group; the group receiving 1Â·5 mg of pramipexole had returned to baseline.</p>
              <p id="para350">The simplest explanation of the PROUD results would be that pramipexole does not have any disease-modifying action in PD, a conclusion supported by both the clinical and the neuroimaging endpoints. However, certain factors could potentially confound this interpretation. For instance, the symptomatic effect of pramipexole might have obscured a difference between the treatment groups at 15 months. This possibility is not supported by the neuroimaging data, assuming that striatal loss of dopamine-transporter binding is an accurate marker of PD-related nigrostriatal neurodegeneration and has the capacity to detect a meaningful group difference in change over 15 months. A concern is that patients with slow PD progression might have been over-represented among the PROUD participants, a consequence of the selection of patients deemed likely to tolerate a placebo phase of 6â9 months. In this case, the PROUD study design might be inherently unable to detect a disease-modifying effect that evolves over a time span exceeding 6â9 months.</p>

Generally, the baseline characteristics of the patients recruited in these two studies were similar, although the mean UPDRS total score was 20Â·4 (SD 8Â·5) in ADAGIO, compared with 24Â·6 (10Â·9) for independent ratings or 23Â·9 (10Â·3) for study investigators' ratings in PROUD. Moreover, both trials had a target 36-week initial phase (for active treatment <italic>vs</italic> placebo), although ADAGIO had a second phase lasting 36 weeks whereas PROUD had a 24-week second phase. In patients who had delayed treatment, the annualised rate of progression of UPDRS total score on placebo was 6Â·2 points in ADAGIO, similar to the rate of 5Â·5 points in PROUD.</p>
              <p id="para370">ADAGIO had three hierarchical endpoints and showed that for a dose of 1 mg a day of rasagiline, patients who received active drug early maintained a 1Â·7-point difference in UPDRS total-score change at week 72 compared with those in the delayed-start group. Analyses also suggested that the mean responses were not converging to one another in these two groups near the end of follow-up. Mean response at week 72 did not differ between early and delayed starters at the higher dose of 2 mg per day. A post-hoc analysis yielded results for both doses consistent with a disease-modifying effect if the analyses were restricted to patients with baseline UPDRS total scores in the highest quartile (&gt;25Â·5 points), although findings for patients in the lower three quartiles then failed to attain statistical significance. This might imply that a floor effect for UPDRS rating of early PD might have masked a potential disease-modifying effect of rasagiline at the dose of 2 mg per day. In PROUD, however, the results concerning the primary outcome variable, 15-month change in UPDRS total score, were consistent in subgroups stratified by baseline UPDRS scores greater or less than 25.</p>
              <p id="para380">Both PROUD and ADAGIO showed slope of progression for the early treated group in the first phase of the study that was slower than, and significantly different from, the slope for the untreated group. The interpretation of this result is complex. For instance, it could simply portray a gradually increasing symptomatic effect of intervention as PD progresses.</p>
              <p id="para390">The results of PROUD have implications not only for our understanding of the use of pramipexole in early PD but also for the design of disease-modification studies in patients with PD (including the selection of patient populations and study endpoints) and for the reliance on preclinical studies and model systems to identify candidate neuroprotective drugs. PROUD confirms the clinical efficacy of pramipexole in the treatment of early PD. The timing of introduction of symptomatic therapy following diagnosis of PD remains a matter to be determined according to individual patient need. The proposal that earlier dopaminergic therapy might be associated with long-term benefits remains an interesting hypothesis,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and is supported by the results of ADAGIO,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> the Deprenyl and Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism study (DATATOP),<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and the Earlier versus Later Levodopa Therapy in PD study (ELLDOPA),<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> but not those of PROUD (<xref rid="box1" ref-type="boxed-text">panel</xref>).<boxed-text id="box1"><label>Panel</label><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para10"><bold>Systematic review</bold></p><p id="para20">Extensive preclinical evidence suggests that dopamine agonists might have neuroprotective properties of relevance to Parkinson's disease (PD). On April 22, 2013, we searched in PubMed for reports of clinical trials, without restriction on language or on publication date, using the search terms âdelayed-startâ plus âParkinson diseaseâ or âParkinson's diseaseâ.

Dopamine agonists have also been assessed for ability to slow the rate of progression of imaging parameters of dopamine metabolism or dopamine transporter density, compared with levodopa (Comparison of the Agonist Pramipexole versus Levodopa on Motor Complications of PD [CALM-PD]<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Ropinirole as Early Therapy versus L-dopa Positron Emission Tomography [REAL-PET]<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> studies).

There was also no difference in dopamine transporter status by SPECT between the two groups at 15 months. These results indicate that pramipexole does not demonstrate an ability to slow progression of PD, as judged by UPDRS, over the 15-month period of the trial, and by contrast with the results of previous studies, does not indicate that earlier dopaminergic therapy is neuroprotective. Future clinical trials for neuroprotective drugs with symptomatic benefit will need to be designed with consideration for potential confounding factors (eg, biased PD sample, suboptimum PD stage for delaying neurodegeneration, inadequate study duration, masking by symptomatic effect, or suboptimum neuroimaging markers).</p></boxed-text></p>
              <p id="para400">In reference to future trial design, there are several noteworthy observations. First, the proportion of patients without evidence of dopamine deficiency was smaller in PROUD than in similar studies such as ELLDOPA<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and the Parkinson Research Examination of CEP-1347 Trial (PRECEPT),<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> perhaps as a consequence of the more stringent diagnostic criteria used in PROUD. Second, although patients were recruited only if thought capable of remaining untreated preferably for 9 months, about 25% failed to achieve this. The ability of the delayed-start design to address the issue of disease modification rests, partly, on the ability to minimise patient withdrawal and the resulting missing data. Excessive dropout of fast progressing patients from the placebo group might be expected to lead to a lower (ie, better) mean UPDRS score in those remaining and entering period 2. However, in PROUD, the two groups entering period 2 remained well matched, making this an unlikely explanation for the results noted. Nevertheless, future delayed-start studies need to ensure high levels of participation in both early and delayed stages and minimise dropout. Third, the standard UPDRS might not be the best assessment to identify changes in early PD, and might be limited by a floor effect.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
