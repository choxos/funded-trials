                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>International guidelines recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should be offered to adults living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but PR availability is limited in Sri Lanka. Culturally appropriate PR needs to be designed and implemented in Sri Lanka. The study aims to adapt PR to the Sri Lankan context and determine the feasibility of conducting a future trial of the adapted PR in Sri Lanka.</p>

                  <p>Eligible participants will be identified and will be invited to take part in the randomised controlled feasibility trial, which will be conducted in Central Chest Clinic, Colombo, Sri Lanka. A total of 50 participants will be recruited (anticipated from April 2021) to the trial and randomised (1:1) into one of two groups; control group receiving usual care or the intervention group receiving adapted PR. The trial intervention is a Sri Lankan-specific PR programme, which will consist of 12 sessions of exercise and health education, delivered over 6 weeks. Focus groups with adults living with COPD, caregivers and nurses and in-depth interviews with doctors and physiotherapist will be conducted to inform the Sri Lankan specific PR adaptations. After completion of PR, routine measures in both groups will be assessed by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome measure is feasibility, including assessing eligibility, uptake and completion. Qualitative evaluation of the trial using focus groups with participants and in-depth interviews with PR deliverers will be conducted to further determine feasibility and acceptability of PR, as well as the ability to run a larger future trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease characterised by airflow obstruction and breathlessness. COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, corresponding to 6% of all deaths worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Further, more than 90% of COPD deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The most recent estimate of COPD prevalence in South Asia was 6.3%<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with a prevalence in Sri Lanka of 10.5%,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> similar to the estimated global COPD prevalence of 11.7%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> COPD is a significant burden to both patients and healthcare services.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Chronic cough with sputum, breathlessness, physical inactivity and exercise intolerance resulting from dyspnoea or fatigue are common consequences of COPD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Symptoms of COPD progressively worsen and people can become breathless, even at rest. Daily activities often become difficult as the condition worsens, impacting their quality of life.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The impact of COPD to the individual and to society makes the need for interventions to reverse the associated disability of paramount importance.</p>
              <p>International guidelines recommend that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should be routinely offered to patients with chronic respiratory disease who have persistent symptoms, limited activity and/or are unable to adjust to illness.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> It is a low-cost, high-impact intervention that improves the quality of life, reduces suffering, reduces mortality and reduces economic loss, relieves dyspnoea and fatigue, improves exercise capacity, improves psychological and emotional function, and enhances an individual’s self-management of their condition.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Having realised the benefits of PR in COPD, Western countries have incorporated this as an important structural component of healthcare delivery services.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Implementation of PR based as practiced in Western countries, in Sri Lanka requires adaptation to the local health service, population and culture. Despite its effectiveness, there is a significant need to understand the feasibility of conducting PR in low-resource Sri Lankan healthcare setting and the acceptability of PR among Sri Lankan adults living with COPD and healthcare staff involved in its delivery. Uptake and completion of PR even in Western countries is an ongoing challenge.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The need to maximise appeal of PR to patients and referrers is a global issue and one that is likely to be specific to a given location and population. There remains an unmet need for PR in Sri Lanka. To be successful, PR must be not only evidence based, but also designed and implemented in a manner sensitive to the context in which it is being delivered, such as culture and geography. Therefore, the aim of this study is to devise an appropriate PR programme and then determine the feasibility and acceptability of this programme for adults living with COPD in Sri Lanka and assess the potential for a future trial of its effectiveness.</p>

Suitable participants will be purposively selected and informed verbally about the study by the researchers. After receiving a study information sheet, potential participants will be contacted to arrange an appointment, if they wish to take part. An opportunity to ask questions will be provided. If willing to take part in the study, they will be asked to provide written informed consent. Multireligious and multiethnic Sri Lankan cultural diversity and gender will be considered when recruiting to the study. Adults living with COPD aged ≥18 years and Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score grade 2 or higher, family member aged ≥18 years and looks after a patient with COPD and healthcare professionals who have more than 1-year experience of managing patients with COPD and working in the government healthcare system of the country will be eligible to participate in the phase 1 of the study. Participants who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the study.</p>
                <p>After the adaptation of PR in phase 1, suitable participants for the phase 2 randomised controlled feasibility trial will be identified by the medical officers in the Chest Clinic and will be invited to take part in an eligibility assessment. This assessment will determine eligibility for entry into the study. People eligible for inclusion in the trial will be: aged ≥18 years, will have a clinically confirmed diagnosis of COPD by a physician, confirmed COPD with spirometry based on GOLD criteria with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/forced vital capacity (FVC)&lt;0.7, and FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;80% predicted, ≥1 exacerbation required a hospitalisation in the year preceding study, mMRC grade ≥2 and willing to provide informed consent. Adults with comorbidities such as severe or unstable cardiovascular, other internal diseases and locomotor difficulties that preclude the exercise or malignant disease or other serious illness which will interfere with participation in the PR, will be excluded from the study. Individuals not eligible for the study will be recorded on a study screening log.</p>

                    <p>Adults living with COPD often tell us how having COPD impacts their lives and that they often find it challenging to know what they can do to better manage their condition. When they talk about their self-management strategies, it is clear that education and exercise support would be of value. Also, they revealed the necessity of a programme to support their condition and willingness to attend such a programme. Patients are generally positive about being able to access support but there is little available to them. The study was planned to fulfil the need of adults living with COPD. The delivery and adaptations of the trial intervention (Sri Lankan-specific PR) will also be informed by the adults living with COPD, their caregivers/family members and healthcare professionals. Priorities, experience and preferences of the stakeholders will be used to design the PR. Healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of COPD at Central Chest Clinic will be involved in the recruitment as key informants and conduct of the study. The feasibility and acceptability of the PR intervention among adults living with COPD and healthcare staff involved in its delivery will be assessed in qualitative interviews at the end of the trial. The results of the trial will be disseminated through patient and public involvement events, local and international conference proceedings. As well as all the research participants, stakeholders and individuals with COPD will be openly invited to take part in an event organised at the central chest clinic to reveal the study findings.</p>

Close attention will be paid to the complexity and interactions inherent in the focus group data.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>

                <title>Adverse events</title>
                <p>All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded on an adverse event log, within study trial management paperwork, case report forms and REDCap. There will be no formal interim analysis of data due to the feasibility nature of the trial. The IDMC will review high-level safety data. Adverse events will be monitored at least every month, and as needed on an ad hoc basis, to ensure the continuing safety of the participants. The scientific committee will determine the need to terminate the trial. Participants who experience any such event will be directed to the appropriate hospital and all the necessary care will be ensured and followed up until the participant has resolved or stabilised.</p>

              <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
              <p>Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics review committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura (FMS/USJP ERC 64/19) and the University of Leicester, UK (26770). Further permission for the proposed study will be obtained from the relevant authority at the Central Chest Clinic, Colombo. Sri Lanka. Privacy and the confidentiality of all information and identities of participants will be strictly maintained and will not be disclosed when publishing the results of the study. A copy of the test results obtained will be provided to each participant at the end of the trial for subsequent follow-up and treatment at the clinic. Compensation for travelling will be provided to all the participants. All study documents will be translated to Sinhala and Tamil to ensure clear communication. Participation will be without compulsion and each participant has the right to withdraw at any time, without providing a reason. Consent form and data sheets will be securely stored in a separate locked cupboard. Study computers will be password protected. The participants (adults living with COPD) of the phase 1 study also will be provided the opportunity to participate the PR. All the data will be stored safely up to 6 years and after 6 years consent form and data sheets will be disposed of appropriately. Study team and IDMC only will have access to final trial dataset. Data from the Global Health Research Group on Respiratory Rehabilitation (Global RECHARGE) Core Dataset <sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> will be made available following the completion of this project and we are considering the best tools to use to make this database available to the wider community. Any modifications of the protocol will be updated on trial registry (ISRCTN) and will be informed to the ethics review committee and the participants. Participants will be provided the provisions for reconsenting after any change of the approved protocol. It will be made clear in the publication of trial findings.</p>
