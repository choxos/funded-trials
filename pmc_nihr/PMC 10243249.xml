                  <p id="Par2">A ToC represents how our designed quality improvement intervention targeting changes at service, practitioner, and patient levels was expected to improve engagement in, and the quality of, telephone-delivered psychological therapies. The intervention was evaluated following implementation in a feasibility study within three NHS Talking Therapies services through a qualitative research design incorporating semi-structured interviews and a focus group with key stakeholders (patients, practitioners, and service leads) (<italic>N</italic>â=â15). Data were analysed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the ToC was examined and modified accordingly following the findings.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">CFIR analysis highlighted a set of challenges encountered during the implementation of our service quality improvement telephone intervention that appeared to have weakened the contribution to the change mechanisms set out by the initial ToC. Findings informed changes to the intervention and refinement of the ToC and are expected to increase the likelihood of successful future implementation in a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">Four key recommendations that could help to optimise implementation of a complex intervention involving different key stakeholder groups in any setting were identified. These include: 1-developing a good understanding of the intervention and its value among those receiving the intervention; 2-maximising engagement from key stakeholders; 3-ensuring clear planning and communication of implementation goals; and 4-encouraging the use of strategies to monitor implementation progress.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Evidence shows psychological interventions delivered by telephone can be as effective as those delivered face-to-face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with the added benefits of access, flexibility, and reduced stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite the increased utilization of remote means of communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, some scepticism remains among practitioners and patients about the use of telephone in mental health settings. Concerns centre around the potential difficulties involved in developing a therapeutic alliance at a distance, perceptions of reduced effectiveness, worries about patient safety, and lack of patient engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The COVID-19 pandemic forced a sudden shift towards remote therapy delivery, with no preparation time in which to train practitioners in telephone-specific skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The pandemic also drove an increase in mental health problems in the general population in the UK and across the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There were, and still are, pressing needs for mental health services to improve access to psychological therapies without compromising quality of care and to find cost-effective ways of providing evidence-based interventions to an increasingly high volume of patients. In the UK, mild to moderate depression and anxiety are treated in primary care within the NHS Talking Therapies Services (formerly known as Improving Access to Psychological Therapies -IAPT services). Evidence-based interventions are provided following National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. NICE Clinical guidance for mild to moderate depression and anxiety recommends telephone delivery for low intensity psychological interventions such as guided self-help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The use of the telephone as a modality to deliver psychological interventions started in the twentieth century and increased during the recent global Covid-19 pandemic; early indications are that telephone delivery will continue at a comparable, if not greater, pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This means that the development of a sustainable intervention to improve the quality and engagement of psychological treatment delivered by telephone remains relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Before the implementation of any new and complex health care intervention, the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] emphasises an iterative process including four phases: 1-intervention development, 2-feasibility and piloting, 3-evaluation, and 4-implementation. To increase the likelihood of complex interventions being effective, sustainable, and scalable, a theory-driven process of intervention design and evaluation is strongly recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">The Theory of Change (ToC) approach is a pragmatic framework, which describes how and why an initiative/intervention works and can be useful in both intervention planning and in empirical testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, the ToC can be subjected to modifications to incorporate ongoing processes of reflection exploring changes and how these happen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. According to the MRC framework, a ToC can be tested in the feasibility/piloting phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and its use may help to increase implementation success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This, combined with the involvement of stakeholders, leads to a refinement of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this paper, we report on the use of both the ToC and engagement with stakeholders, which strengthen the key stages of the MRC framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Specifically, a ToC can be modified to capture changes resulting from the feasibility/piloting phase, and a revised ToC can be taken forward for formal evaluation as part of the evaluation phase of the MRC framework. We illustrate the use of the ToC working through an intervention we developed as part of our research programme called EQUITy (Enhancing the quality of psychological interventions delivered by telephone) funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The aim of this article is to explore the use of a Theory of Change (ToC) and an implementation framework of analysis to increase the likelihood of complex interventions being effective, sustainable, and scalable. A ToC was developed to represent how changes of a complex intervention, aimed at enhancing the quality of telephone-delivered psychological therapies, were expected to occur to trigger the intended outcomes. We provide a case example of how the development of a ToC has been informed and amended following evidence from the feasibility study reported here. We also describe potential solutions to overcome implementation challenges and improve likelihood of future implementation success.</p>

                <title>Description of the EQUITy intervention</title>
                <p id="Par18">The EQUITy intervention was a service quality improvement intervention designed to enhance engagement and the quality of psychological interventions delivered by telephone in primary care in the UK. In brief, the EQUITy intervention targets change at service, practitioner, and patient levels and includes three interlinked components that are equally important: 1-Telephone Recommendations for Services, 2-Telephone Skills Training for Practitioners and, 3-Telephone Information Resources for Patients.</p>
                <p id="Par19">The Telephone Recommendations for Services comprised a booklet including guidelines for telephone delivery covering five areas (i.e., Promoting Telephone Work, Key Elements of Telephone Work, Telephone Working Environment and Resources, Boosting Telephone Skills, and Promoting Reflection on Telephone Treatment). Services were asked to decide on a set of goals that could be achieved immediately, and another set that may take longer or need more effort to accomplish. This booklet was circulated to the Service Lead/Team Manager. This component of the EQUITy intervention was designed to ensure availability of the most suitable working environment and resources for the delivery of psychological interventions by telephone, enhance the provision of clinical support for remote delivery and facilitate opportunities for professional development.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The Telephone Skills Training for Practitioners included two 3-h online training sessions, combining teaching and interactive activities (e.g., role-play, live demonstration of good practice, group exercises). This component of the EQUITy intervention was designed to develop and/or enhance practitioner telephone skills, address negative preconceptions, and increase engagement and confidence in the delivery of psychological interventions by telephone.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The Telephone Information Resources for Patients comprised a leaflet containing key information about telephone interventions delivered by psychological well-being-practitioners, an appointment card which also included tips on how to prepare for telephone sessions, and a poster to be displayed at services. This element of the EQUITy intervention was designed to increase awareness of cognitive behavioural therapy and guided-self-help, and its effectiveness when delivered via telephone; it also aimed to address beliefs and pre-conceptions about remote delivery being inferior in quality to face-to-face delivery.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The EQUITy intervention was delivered by a team comprising the two principal investigators (PBo, PBe), the programme manager (JG), a clinical academic with robust experience of delivering training and providing therapy as a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist (KL), a clinical psychologist, two psychological wellbeing practitioners, one clinical academic involved in delivering training for PWPs, one researcher with clinical experience in different evidenced-based therapies including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CF) and one patient with experience in supporting training of psychological wellbeing practitioners.</p>

To this end, key stakeholders, objectives, intervention components, intended changes/goals (short, medium, and long-term), and an overall vision of success were identified beforehand (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for a schematic depiction of the EQUITy initial ToC). As depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the short/intermediate goals of the EQUITy intervention were to enhance patient, practitioner, and service engagement with telephone treatment, leading to increased treatment efficacy and effectiveness, and to ultimately improve patient outcomes (i.e., symptoms of depression and anxiety over time).

                <p id="Par31">The initial ToC was developed by reflecting upon the qualitative evidence obtained from research studies conducted within this research project, which provided an in-depth understanding of the clinical and organisational contexts in which telephone-delivered psychological interventions are used. Qualitative studies included interviews with practitioners, patients, and key informants, as well as the conversational analysis of telephone sessions delivered in IAPT services. Evidence from the qualitative studies provided an insight into the barriers and facilitators influencing delivery and engagement of patients, practitioners and services with psychological interventions delivered by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Following understanding of the problem, an evidence-based behaviour change intervention was co-developed with stakeholders to increase engagement and quality of telephone-delivered psychological interventions in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In addition, a smartphone app was developed to facilitate completion of questionnaires and to improve therapeutic information exchange in telephone-delivered psychological interventions.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par32"><bold>(d) Who was involved in reviewing/refining the ToC</bold></p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par33">The initial ToC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was reviewed by the research team to reflect the possible impact of COVID on the model, producing a modified ToC (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) which was trialled in this feasibility study. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> indicates that the smartphone app was removed from the EQUITy intervention due to it being deemed redundant following a shift by services towards the use of online portals for outcome measure completion and communication with patients. In addition, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> captured elements of the EQUITy service quality improvement intervention that could be potentially diluted/influenced by the fact that services were forced to deliver psychological treatment by telephone (or video) during the pandemic, which may have also affected patient views/expectations about telephone treatment.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>EQUITy Programme: Theory of Change updated reflecting the COVID context (trialled in this feasibility study)</p><p>Note: White boxes indicate elements removed from the intervention prior to the commencement of the feasibility study.

                <p id="Par34">Following findings from this feasibility study, a meeting with all members of the research team was held to interrogate and review the ToC for appropriateness, comprehensiveness and accuracy. This included the identification of components and theoretical changes that were achieved or not met, and the examination of whether or not and how the ToC aligned with the findings. Identified changes to the components of the intervention and ToC were then further discussed with the Implementation Reference Group (IRG) and the Programme Steering Committee (PSC). The IRG comprises10 professionals with clinical, policy or educational expertise in IAPT services to provide strategic advice and guidance to the design and the implementation of the EQUITy programme. The PSC is an independent group of five individuals with research and clinical expertise in low intensity psychological interventions, service organisation, delivery, development, and leadership. One member has specific expertise in the use of statistics in randomised controlled trials, while a patient and public representative provides additional expertise from a lived experience perspective. Following agreement, the required amendments to the ToC and the intervention took place. The updated version of the ToC will be evaluated as part of a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                <p id="Par36">This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and a focus group with stakeholders (patients, practitioners, and service leads). Interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and focus groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used to account for service preferences and convenience, and to allow exchange of viewpoints whenever this was considered appropriate.

                <p id="Par37">This feasibility study was conducted in three UK NHS IAPT services (currently known as Talking Therapies services)Â delivering guided-self-help for anxiety and/or depression by telephone.

                <p id="Par38">Patients receiving guided-self-help for anxiety and/or depression by telephone at the services participating in the study were invited to take part in a research interview. Information packs containing an invitation letter, participant information sheet, and a consent to contact form were distributed by the service administration team. Following expressions of interest (return of consent to contact form or direct contact with the research team by email or phone), participants were contacted to confirm willingness to participate, complete the consent form and to schedule a telephone interview. Examples of interview questions for patients included: What did you know about IAPT when you were first referred? What was the information you received at the point of referral and what can you tell me about that information? What did you think about the EQUITy patient resources? How did the EQUITy resources influence (or not) your views about the effectiveness of the treatment you were referred to? How did the EQUITy resources change (or not) your beliefs about how you will be able to successfully engage in your treatment? Thinking about your experience of treatment, how did you find communicating with you practitioner without being able to see her/him? What can you tell me about the therapeutic relationship with your practitioner?</p>
                <p id="Par39">Professionals, including practitioners and service leads from each of the three services, were invited to take part in a research interview/focus group. Practitioners delivering guided-self-help by telephone who had attended the EQUITy telephone skills training were invited to take part in the study. All eligible professionals received an invitation letter, a participant information sheet, and a consent to contact form by email, distributed by the service lead/manager or research team. Participants expressing interest to take part were contacted by the research team to confirm willingness to participate and an interview/focus group date was arranged. Examples of interview questions for professionals included: What were your initial thoughts about the EQUITy intervention and taking part in the feasibility study when you heard about it? What aspects of the EQUITy intervention were most helpful for patients, practitioners and for services? What aspects of the EQUITy intervention would you change? How did you feel about delivering telephone treatment following receipt of the EQUITy intervention? What were the challenges you face to implementing the EQUITy intervention?

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p id="Par40">The study took place in England, UK. The EQUITy intervention was delivered to each of the three NHS IAPT services independently between November 2020 and January 2021. Data collection took place post-intervention between February and April 2021.</p>
                <p id="Par41">All participants provided informed consent prior to taking part in the study. All interviews/focus group were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by an independent company approved by the University of Manchester. Any identifiable information was removed from the transcripts to protect participantsâ anonymity and data were securely stored.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Fifteen stakeholder informants across the three NHS services took part in the study (i.e., six patients, five practitioners, and four service leads). All six patient participants had received two or more sessions of guided-self-help by telephone from a practitioner who had received the EQUITy telephone skills training. All patient participants were females, aged between 20 to 57 years old (M=35.33, SD=15.67), five self-described as White and one as Asian, four were employed full-time, one was not employed due to health issues, and one was retired. Three patient participants were receiving treatment for anxiety and depression and the rest for depression only. Three had completed telephone treatment at the time of the interview and the other three were still in treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par43">The professional participants included five practitioners with varying degrees of experience from trainees to senior practitioners with supervisory responsibilities, and four service leads. Eight out of the nine professionals were female, all were White British, aged between 24 and 59 years old (M=36.44, SD=11.46). The professionalsâ experience within mental health ranged from more than one year up to 20 years.</p>
                <p id="Par44">All participants were interviewed and two service leads from one NHS IAPT service participated in a focus group. A focus groupÂ was particularly pertinent as they were undergoing a service restructure at the time, enabling a more meaningful and fuller discussion about service implementation . The interviews and the focus group were conducted by telephone and lasted between 40 and 69 minutes.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par45">Data were analysed incorporating inductive and deductive approaches with deductive approaches informed by the CFIR framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The CFIR is a widely used pragmatic multi-level framework that provides an organized list of potential barriers and facilitators to assess the implementation of complex interventions. It is composed of a taxonomy of 39 operationally-defined constructs across five major domains: (1) intervention characteristics, (2) outer setting, (3) inner setting, (4) characteristics of the individuals involved, and (5) the process of implementation. Each major domain includes several sub-domains. We used the CFIR to identify the areas that are most important to optimise our intervention and subsequently to explore how these data could be used to inform the development of a ToC.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Firstly, researchers familiarised themselves with the transcripts and the CFIR framework. Secondly, data were coded into the corresponding domains/sub-domains of the CFIR framework and data outside of the framework were coded inductively. CF coded service leadsâ data and JC coded data from patients and practitioners. Thirdly, findings were regularly presented and discussed with the wider research team to facilitate further reflection and inform the changes (if needed) to the ToC. The EQUITy intervention was a service quality improvement intervention and targeted change at three different levels (patients, practitioners and service leads); however, the immediate recipients of the intervention were practitioners and services. Consequently, the ToC was used to explore implementation barriers and facilitators, and the patient data aided understanding of the reach of the intervention. Data analysis was supported by QSR Internationalâs NVivo-12 qualitative software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, IAPT services had increased the delivery of psychological interventions by telephone at the time the EQUITy intervention was introduced. The lack of clarity about the potential benefits of its use and its addition to current practices at each service may have weakened professionalsâ motivation towards its implementation. Indeed, service leads and practitioners shared these views, as illustrated in the findings below:</p>

                <p id="Par56">We found that if a service quality intervention includes multiple components and requires engagement from different stakeholders, providing stakeholders with a clear presentation reflecting the integration of and rationale for the different elements is extremely important in improving the likelihood of implementation success. For instance, the EQUITy intervention involved three elements (i.e., Telephone Recommendations for Services, Skills Telephone Training for Practitioners and Telephone Information Resources for Patients), but service leads and practitioners perceived it as a telephone training intervention instead of a service quality improvement intervention. Findings highlighted there was a lack of awareness from practitioners of two of the three elements of the intervention (i.e., Telephone Recommendations for Services and Telephone Information Resources for Patients) and service leads placed more value and importance on the Telephone Training for Practitioners. Below is a quote from a dialogue with a practitioner and one with a service lead illustrating these findings:</p>

                <p id="Par72">All mental health services were tasked with increasing remote modalities of working, particularly telephone, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenge faced was how to deliver telephone treatments as effectively as those delivered face-to-face. Within the outer setting domain, we found that sub-domains of patient needs and resources and external policy and incentives were the most relevant for our quality service improvement intervention. We outlined two key points that may weaken successful implementation.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par73"><bold><italic>Patient information: effective communication routes and friendly easy-to-read information</italic></bold></p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par74">We found it was important to explore effective routes to deliver patient information to prevent resources from getting lost among other materials routinely received by patients from mental health services. Since COVID, most services use email to communicate with patients, but most patients taking part in this study could not recall receiving our Telephone Information Resources for Patients. One remembered receiving the EQUITy patient leaflet and said:</p>

                <p id="Par77">Patients accessing mental health services appreciated the difficulty of finding the balance between providing a lot of information without this being overwhelming. Some found the information provided by services in general was easy to read and to understand and was sufficient for their needs. Others, however, pointed out that grasping it was much more difficult when feeling unwell and valued information that was presented clearly and simply in a user-friendly manner. This finding became evident from the patientsâ data but was also shared by practitioners and service leads. In addition, one service lead highlighted the importance of going through the information with the patient during their first appointment:</p>

Therefore, improving the quality of telephone treatment for patients, professionals, and services was identified as an area of high priority and interest. Data from professionals highlighted the importance of tailoring service quality improvement interventions for each service, and for its workforce, to guarantee success. For instance, the telephone skills training element of our intervention was reported to be more useful for recently qualified professionals than for those with a few years of experience using the telephone. Nevertheless, the most experienced practitioners highlighted that their confidence in current practice increased, and they had developed new skills and broadened their knowledge. They had also benefitted from reflections and discussions about how to overcome challenging scenarios when using the telephone and it had been a good opportunity to identify âbad habitsâ:</p>

We hypothesised that self-efficacy and individual stage of change sub-domains might not appear to be relevant due to the lack of clarity around how to implement each element of the intervention into daily practice and as a result or regular telephone use during COVID. Below we described two key aspects within this CFIR domain.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par153"><bold><italic>Beliefs, attitudes and value placed on the intervention</italic></bold></p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par154">Professionalsâ beliefs and the value they placed on the intervention are key drivers towards the success of its implementation:<disp-quote><p id="Par155"><italic>âI think my initial thoughts were actually, this is a really good project to be involved in and something that I personally would love to learn more about.

                <p id="Par156">Individual beliefs about personal capabilities to apply the intervention into routine practice and individualsâ motivation to change their current way of working over the telephone are important in reducing its potential failure. For instance, practitioners who were aware of the patient telephone information leaflet reported this was useful but there were concerns and a reluctance to use it due to fear of overburdening patients. Thus, identifying and challenging these beliefs early on during the implementation phase may remove these barriers to implementation.</p>
                <p id="Par157">The majority of practitioners reported the importance of allocating more time during the telephone training to practise skills and indicated it would be beneficial to incorporate into the training specific psychological interventions such as behavioural activation, or exposure and its associated challenges when using this modality.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par158"><bold><italic>Factors influencing a positive telephone treatment experience</italic></bold></p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par159">Findings from patient interview data provided information about key factors that contribute to a positive telephone treatment experience, including the development of a good therapeutic relationship, receiving personalised care, and feeling listened to by their practitioner.</p>
                <p id="Par160">The skills aiding a good therapeutic relationship reported by the patients were: going at a pace that suited them; guiding things along without pushing; keeping focused; listening and responding; being patient and understanding; being genuinely caring and empathetic; providing reassurance; being informal, warm, and friendly.</p>
                <p id="Par161">Patient interview findings showed practitioners cared about them via listening carefully, using their verbal skills such as by having a soothing voice, remembering and recapping what they had said in previous sessions, checking they were ok, and using appropriate utterances and changing tone of voice. Consequently, this meant that the patient felt comfortable, relaxed, less anxious, more positive, less isolated, and more trusted, facilitating patient openness and engagement in their treatment.<disp-quote><p id="Par162"><italic>âAnd she definitely does change her tone of voice, so if I say something that Iâm struggling with, you can hear the â I donât know if itâs sympathy or what, but you can hear that kind of change in her tone of voice that shows that sheâs actually properly listened to what Iâm sayingâ.

                <p id="Par163">Findings highlighted that reviewing progress across the sessions (via the use of outcome measures or assessing/evaluating goals) indicated some improvement and provided a sense of reassurance and/or achievement, which maintained their motivation and engagement.</p>

                <p id="Par172">There was a shared perception amongst those practitioners interviewed that the lack of engagement of stakeholders such as service leads and team managers in the implementation process had a negative impact. In addition, the lack of clarity about the role of service leads, team managers, practitioners, and other staff from IAPT services (e.g., administrative staff) in the implementation of the intervention and its three different components, appeared to have weakened the contribution to the change mechanisms set out in the ToC. For instance, engagement with the Telephone Recommendations for Services ranged from reading the booklet (no recommendations implemented) to immediately implementing the recommendations identified as most relevant. Examples of implemented recommendations included: addressing safe space and confidentiality within the therapy agreement, allocating time in supervision to reflect on telephone experiences and its challenges, incorporating time into staff induction sessions to discuss uncertainties, and anxieties related to telephone working.</p>

Previous research within the EQUITy research programme has highlighted the factors that are considered to prevent optimisation of psychological guided-self-help interventions delivered by telephone in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Drawing on this research, a service quality improvement intervention to increase patient, practitioner, and service engagement with telephone delivery was co-developed with stakeholder informants (patients, practitioners, service leads, team managers, clinical academics, and policy makers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The MRC framework developed for evaluating the process of complex public health interventions was published in 2015. The MRC framework strongly recommended the use of a theory-driven process and emphasised the importance of intervention implementation evaluations to increase the likelihood of success of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This feasibility study research makes important contributions to the literature by detailing challenges and barriers encountered during the implementation phase of a complex intervention that may help to improve engagement in and quality of telephone treatment in mental health services. We applied the CFRI and the ToC towards this end and findings informed requisite changes to our intervention theory and implementation strategies. In addition, we provided four key recommendations that could help to optimise future intervention implementation in stretched and busy mental health services.</p>

                <title>1-Developing a good understanding of the intervention and its value</title>
                <p id="Par180">Many factors can impede uptake of service quality improvement interventions for telephone working including competing demands on frontline providers, lack of knowledge, skills and resources, and misalignment with service priorities. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on developing a good understanding of the intervention, identifying its value, exploring resources available, and pinpointing the best way to integrate the intervention within existing procedures to prevent further burden on services. In addition, it is important to overcome any negative beliefs or resistance from staff to prevent implementation failure.</p>

                <p id="Par181">Findings from our study indicate that a service quality improvement telephone intervention comprised of different components targeting changes at different levels (service, professionals, and patients) requires engagement, commitment, and accountability of different key stakeholders, including service leads, team managers, practitioners, administrative personal, and other staff. Engagement from appropriate individuals could be improved by providing support from leads and using organisational incentives such as goal sharing awards or extrinsic incentives could prove beneficial to increase receptivity and increase engagement of individuals to use the intervention. It is anticipated that high levels of commitment and involvement of leads and managers with the implementation of each of the elements of a complex intervention could enhance the likelihood of a successful implementation. Due to the high turnover of staff in mental health services, it is important to develop strategies to immerse new staff in the awareness and implementation of the intervention, which could ensure sustainability of the intervention over time.</p>

                <p id="Par184">The ToC originally developed was in line with a pre-COVID context where the use of telephone to deliver assessment and treatment sessions in NHS Talking Therapies services varied, but many low intensity practitioners (Step 2 care) were delivering approximately 60% of their appointments by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] without dedicated training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health services have had to shift from face-to-face or blended care to entirely remote delivery in a very short time. Although our ToC was reviewed prior to the commencement of the feasibility study to reflect the use of online portals for outcome measure completion and communication with patients (i.e. app removed), there was inevitable variability and some knowledge gaps about how each of the services managed this sudden shift. Findings from this feasibility study highlighted that, in contrast to usual practice pre-COVID, practitioners were mandated to work over the telephone in their day-to-day practice and developed their own skills through experience. Due to increased exposure to remote working because of the COVID pandemic, services, practitioners, and patients became more attuned to this mode of delivery. Evidence from studies published prior to the pandemic did not show interactional differences between psychological therapy delivered face-to-face and by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, beliefs about telephone being less formal than face-to-face, or being a lower or second best option focused more on reducing costs, were strongly held by patients and professionals. During the pandemic, most services, professionals, and patients were grateful for being able to deliver/receive psychological support during extremely difficult and unprecedented times, influencing their views towards a more positive approach to telephone therapy. Furthermore, findings from this feasibility study identified changes occurring at a service level to meet the needs of practitioners in light of this shift to telephone/online delivery, including the provision of further training, support, and supervision.</p>
                <p id="Par185">Findings from the feasibility study presented in this paper have provided information on individual and group influences on behaviour and the ability that social context, as much as clinical context, has influenced the ToC success of our service quality improvement intervention. Findings from this feasibility study additionally resulted in changes to the content of our EQUITy intervention and its implementation. It is anticipated that changes will increase the likelihood of implementation success for its further evaluation in a randomised controlled trial.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par186">Concerted attention to evidence-based implementation strategies is needed to reduce the likelihood of implementation failures and optimise success. Implementation strategies should emphasise the value and benefits related to implement an intervention and facilitate awareness and good understanding of what is needed and from whom to implement the intervention. In addition, ensuring engagement and monitoring of progress from key stakeholders is also paramount to improve the likelihood of success and sustainability over time. Understanding implementation challenges for service quality improvement interventions could prove beneficial to increase chances of implementation success.</p>
