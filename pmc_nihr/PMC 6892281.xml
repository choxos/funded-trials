                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In women with late preterm pre-eclampsia, the optimal time to initiate delivery is unclear because limitation of maternal disease progression needs to be balanced against infant complications. The aim of this trial was to determine whether planned earlier initiation of delivery reduces maternal adverse outcomes without substantial worsening of neonatal or infant outcomes, compared with expectant management (usual care) in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this parallel-group, non-masked, multicentre, randomised controlled trial done in 46 maternity units across England and Wales, we compared planned delivery versus expectant management (usual care) with individual randomisation in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia from 34 to less than 37 weeks' gestation and a singleton or dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy. The co-primary maternal outcome was a composite of maternal morbidity or recorded systolic blood pressure of at least 160 mm Hg with a superiority hypothesis. The co-primary perinatal outcome was a composite of perinatal deaths or neonatal unit admission up to infant hospital discharge with a non-inferiority hypothesis (non-inferiority margin of 10% difference in incidence). Analyses were by intention to treat, together with a per-protocol analysis for the perinatal outcome. The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN01879376. The trial is closed to recruitment but follow-up is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 29, 2014, and Dec 10, 2018, 901 women were recruited. 450 women (448 women and 471 infants analysed) were allocated to planned delivery and 451 women (451 women and 475 infants analysed) to expectant management. The incidence of the co-primary maternal outcome was significantly lower in the planned delivery group (289 [65%] women) compared with the expectant management group (338 [75%] women; adjusted relative risk 0·86, 95% CI 0·79–0·94; p=0·0005). The incidence of the co-primary perinatal outcome by intention to treat was significantly higher in the planned delivery group (196 [42%] infants) compared with the expectant management group (159 [34%] infants; 1·26, 1·08–1·47; p=0·0034). The results from the per-protocol analysis were similar. There were nine serious adverse events in the planned delivery group and 12 in the expectant management group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>There is strong evidence to suggest that planned delivery reduces maternal morbidity and severe hypertension compared with expectant management, with more neonatal unit admissions related to prematurity but no indicators of greater neonatal morbidity. This trade-off should be discussed with women with late preterm pre-eclampsia to allow shared decision making on timing of delivery.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of pregnancy, characterised by placental and maternal vascular dysfunction and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality for the mother and infant. Adverse outcomes of pre-eclampsia include maternal stroke, renal and hepatic injury, fetal growth restriction, and maternal and perinatal death.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Around 10% of pregnant women develop hypertension and 2–3% develop pre-eclampsia, characterised by hypertension and manifestations of multiorgan disease.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Standard management of pre-eclampsia involves maternal and fetal assessment and subsequent consideration of timely delivery to minimise maternal and perinatal morbidity, taking into consideration gestational age, progression of maternal disease, and fetal wellbeing. After 37 weeks' gestation, most national guidelines recommend prompt delivery for a woman with pre-eclampsia<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> because maternal risks can be significantly reduced without additional perinatal risks from such an intervention.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In women with late preterm pre-eclampsia (between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation), the optimal time for delivery is less clear, because limitation of maternal disease progression needs to be balanced against complications for the infant either related to ongoing expectant management (including needing emergency delivery, worsening growth restriction, and stillbirth) or those related to planned earlier delivery (infant immaturity and associated complications). Current usual practice in the UK for women with late preterm pre-eclampsia is for expectant management until 37 weeks' gestation, with delivery sooner if the clinical scenario changes and there is concern over impending severe pre-eclampsia and associated complications. In the absence of definitive new evidence, this advice has been maintained in the most recent management recommendations from the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy, published in 2018,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> which are used to inform current practice in many countries worldwide.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">At conception of this trial in June, 2012, we searched PubMed for studies in humans published in any language using the following MEDLINE subject heading keywords: “gestational age”; “hypertension, pregnancy-induced”; “labor, induced”; “obstetric delivery”; “pre-eclampsia”; “pregnancy”; and “pregnancy outcome”. We found no published randomised controlled trials evaluating planned delivery against expectant management for women with late preterm pre-eclampsia between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation, although some women with mild pre-eclampsia might have been included in the HYPITAT-1 trial, in women with pregnancy hypertension from 36 weeks' gestation. A Cochrane systematic review that assessed timing of delivery interventions for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy from 34 weeks' gestation to term, updated on Jan 15, 2017, included five studies, all published after 2012 with the exception of one large trial (published in 2009) that included women with pregnancy hypertension from 36 weeks' gestation onwards (and therefore only indirectly relevant to the research uncertainty assessed here). Taking all the studies into account, the Cochrane systematic review concluded that planned early delivery was associated with fewer maternal complications but no clear differences in infant outcomes. However, they cautioned that few data were available, particularly on infant outcomes, from trials where women with all hypertensive disorders (gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, and pre-eclampsia) were considered as one group. They advised that further studies were needed to look at optimal timing of delivery, particularly in different types of pregnancy hypertensive disorders.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">This large, multicentre trial represents contemporaneous management of women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. Our sample size (901 women) is considerably larger than the number of women with late preterm pre-eclampsia in previous trials included in the Cochrane systematic review (352 and 183 women) that considered the same gestational age window. Those trials did not affect clinical practice as there was continued uncertainty over the trade-off between maternal benefit and perinatal harms. The neonatal endpoint chosen in our trial reflects potential harms from both the intervention (planned early delivery) and ongoing pre-eclampsia (in the expectant management group).</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">The results of this trial, taken together with smaller trials published since the trial started, support a lower threshold for considering planned delivery in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. This benefit seems to be greater in women with pre-eclampsia (compared with women in other studies with gestational or chronic hypertension alone). Although planned delivery might result in more infants being admitted to a neonatal unit under current guidelines, the observed lack of associated morbidity and provision of alternative care strategies that avoid separation of the infant from their mother (such as transitional care) should enable management of these women to be optimised.</p>

                <p id="para110">In this parallel-group, non-masked, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, we compared planned delivery against expectant management (usual care). The trial was done in 46 consultant-led maternity units in England and Wales.</p>
                <p id="para120">A pregnant woman was eligible if she was between 34 weeks and less than 37 weeks of gestation, had a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or superimposed pre-eclampsia (as defined by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy),<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> with a singleton or dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy and at least one viable fetus, was aged 18 years or older, and was able to give written informed consent. Women with any other comorbidity (including pre-existing hypertension or diabetes) or with a previous caesarean section or any fetal position were eligible. The only exclusion criterion to study participation was if a decision had already been made to deliver within the next 48 h. Current practice by national guidelines in use during the trial was for immediate delivery of a woman with persistent severe features of pre-eclampsia (including haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome); these women would thus not be eligible for the trial.</p>

                <p id="para140">Participants were randomly assigned to planned delivery or expectant care in a 1:1 ratio using a probabilistic minimisation algorithm to ensure approximate balance within the following groups: study centre, singleton or twin pregnancy, severity of hypertension in 48 h before enrolment (highest systolic blood pressure with or without medication: &lt;150 mm Hg, 150–159 mm Hg, or ≥160 mm Hg), parity (previous delivery of an infant past 24 weeks' gestation), previous caesarean section, and gestational age at randomisation (34, 35, or 36 weeks). Randomisation was managed via a secure web-based randomisation program provided by MedSciNet. The minimisation algorithm was implemented by a MedSciNet database programmer, with balance and predictability monitored by the independent National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit statistician during the trial. The intervention was not masked from women, clinicians, or data collectors due to the nature of the intervention. Trial statisticans were also not blinded to allocation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">We allocated women to planned initiation of delivery within 48 h of randomisation (to allow for corticosteroid administration to accelerate fetal lung maturation and neonatal cot availability if necessary) or to expectant management (usual care). Planned delivery was usually by induction of labour, unless there was an additional specific indication for pre-labour caesarean section. Expectant management involved delivery at 37 weeks' gestation or sooner as clinical needs dictated in accordance with the UK national guidelines,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> as assessed by the clinician responsible for the woman's care, for maternal indications (eg, uncontrolled hypertension or abnormal blood results), fetal compromise, eclampsia, or other clinical crises. Individual decisions around mode of induction and delivery and use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity were left to the discretion of the individual clinician, with the trial protocol advising that all options should be discussed with the pregnant woman and her needs and preferences taken into account.</p>
                <p id="para160">Site research teams approached women to confirm eligibility and provided verbal and written information. A trained clinician (obstetrician or obstetric physician) obtained written informed consent. A research team member entered baseline data on a web-based database and then performed randomisation, communicating the results directly to the woman. All other aspects of pregnancy management were expected to be in accordance with the UK national guidelines<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> at the discretion of the responsible clinician.</p>
                <p id="para170">Outcomes were recorded on the web-based trial database through case-note review by trained researchers after maternal and infant primary hospital discharge. Participants were asked to complete the EuroQol five dimensions, five levels questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) at baseline to assess health-related quality of life. Planned long-term follow-up assessments include the EQ-5D-5L, 12-item Short Form Health Survey, and maternal and infant health-care and social care use after hospital discharge at 6 months post-delivery and when infants are 2 years of age, corrected for prematurity. In addition, the Parent Report of Children's Abilities—Revised (PARCA-R) questionnaire will be collected at 2 years.</p>

The primary indication for neonatal unit admission was allocated as part of usual clinical care practice by a clinical neonatologist (not involved in the trial), from a prespecified list of exclusive admission reasons, on an electronic clinical database used nationwide in England and Wales.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para400">In this randomised controlled trial in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia, planned delivery reduced maternal morbidity, including severe systolic hypertension. However, planned delivery led to more neonatal unit admissions for the infant, principally for a listed indication of prematurity and without an excess of respiratory or other morbidity, intensity of care, or length of stay. Women in the expectant management group had a median additional prolongation of pregnancy from enrolment to delivery of 5 days (3 days after adjustment) and more than half of these women had indicated delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, with three quarters subsequently meeting the criteria for progression to severe pre-eclampsia. Women in the planned delivery group had significantly more spontaneous vaginal deliveries. In this health-care setting, there were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths. We found that planned delivery had lower costs than expectant management in this setting.</p>
              <p id="para410">Strengths of the trial include a sufficiently large sample of women specifically with late preterm pre-eclampsia, in whom the benefits and risks of planned delivery might be different from those with gestational or chronic hypertension in pregnancy, related to the likelihood of progression to severe features of the disease and need for medically indicated emergency delivery. The trial was conducted to rigorous standards, with a prespecified protocol without changes. Findings are likely to be generalisable to similar health-care settings, because it was undertaken in a large number of maternity units across England and Wales, with diverse representation of women in terms of both demography and disease spectrum. Recommendations for expectant management and indications for delivery in our trial followed UK national guidelines<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and current international guidelines,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> so our findings are relevant to countries that have similar recommendations. More than half of eligible women approached agreed to participate in the trial, indicating agreement of equipoise in this scenario.</p>
              <p id="para420">Limitations of the trial include the challenge of finding a perinatal outcome that adequately represented the potential risks of both groups—related to intervention in the planned delivery group and to ongoing pre-eclampsia in the expectant management group—as there are potential harms from continuing pregnancy as well as initiating earlier delivery. Because adjudication of multiorgan neonatal morbidity is complex and subjective, and no widely accepted validated measure of neonatal morbidity is currently available, we chose neonatal unit admission (involving separation of the infant from their mother), supported by our lay representatives, and intending that this would capture underlying neonatal morbidity. Although UK clinical practice guidelines do not recommend routine admission of an infant based solely on gestational age after 34 weeks of pregnancy, admission principally for prematurity in this trial suggests different real-world clinician behaviour, despite no differences in objective measures of direct neonatal morbidity being shown. Choice of a maternal outcome that reflects the multiorgan manifestations of pre-eclampsia is also challenging, particularly as no intermediate complication exists between severe systolic hypertension (relatively common) and stroke (very rare in high-income health-care settings), and treatment paradox could mean that women are appropriately delivered on the basis of moderate deterioration in biochemical parameters before severe complications occur. The incidences of maternal and perinatal primary outcomes were higher than anticipated on the basis of previous studies, but this did not limit the interpretation of the analysis. Although we acknowledge that for women enrolled after 36 weeks' gestation, expectant management would only be for a maximum of 7 days, immediate planned delivery would still represent a change in clinical care from usual practice and the research uncertainty remained when we conceived the trial. The proportion of women enrolled at 36 weeks' gestation was similar, and even slightly lower, than that enrolled in a similar trial,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and maternal benefit was shown even at this gestation.</p>
              <p id="para430">We considered sources of possible bias for our trial. Selection bias was unlikely due to the randomisation process, which included robust allocation sequence concealment such that determining next allocation was not possible. Performance and detection bias were possible because it was not possible to mask participating clinicians or women, nor data collectors because timing of delivery was contained within maternity records where morbidity was recorded. Every primary maternal outcome was additionally signed off by each site principal investigator, and we used a primary neonatal outcome (independently recorded by the attending clinical team) to minimise bias where possible. There was minimal attrition in both groups. We have reported all prespecified secondary outcomes, interpreting them cautiously.</p>
              <p id="para440">We did not adjust for multiplicity for the co-primary outcomes, which fundamentally adheres to the concept that a clinical trial is a focused scientific research question. The key outcomes for mothers and their infants need to be considered together. Furthermore, statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons invokes debate among methodologists, and there is no consensus.</p>
              <p id="para450">Our finding of a reduction in maternal adverse outcomes is similar to that of a previous study,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> but that trial included only 352 women with late preterm pre-eclampsia and the reduction was not statistically significant. However, our trial found no difference in respiratory morbidity (as a secondary outcome) and much higher antenatal corticosteroid use (60%) compared with the previous trial,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> which reported increased respiratory distress syndrome in those with planned delivery, with lower corticosteroid use (8%) and a longer interval to delivery in the expectant management group that was probably related to inclusion of women with chronic or gestational hypertension. Systematic reviews of planned early delivery in women with pregnancy hypertension to date have been constrained by insufficient numbers to draw definitive conclusions for specific groups of women in whom the benefit and risk balance might differ (ie, those with late preterm pre-eclampsia),<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but an individual patient data meta-analysis<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> has suggested that some women in these groups could benefit from earlier delivery. Developing accurate validated prognostic tools to best identify those at highest risk remains challenging, and infant follow-up is useful to further evaluate the longer term outcomes<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> with such strategies.</p>
              <p id="para460">In women with late preterm pre-eclampsia, planned delivery is associated with improved maternal outcomes but more neonatal unit admissions for prematurity (although not respiratory or other morbidity, higher intensity of neonatal care, or duration of stay) compared with expectant management. Although UK guidance does not recommend routine admission for prematurity alone, individual clinicians might vary in their thresholds for neonatal unit admission. Additional prolongation of pregnancy by 5 days, as seen in the expectant management group, might move an infant out of a notional group where admission is dictated by a guideline (eg, based on a gestational age threshold) rather than by clinical need. Increased use of transitional care arrangements, where an infant stays with their mother but with enhanced surveillance and care in a postnatal setting, might be particularly beneficial in these infants and avoid unnecessary separation of the infant from their mother. For women with pre-eclampsia at this gestational age, prolongation of pregnancy might only be for a few days; more than half of these women require indicated delivery, potentially necessitating emergency management. Rates of vaginal delivery are similar to those reported from a large US study<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> of women with early preterm pre-eclampsia, suggesting that these results can be extrapolated across similar high-income settings. The increase in spontaneous vaginal births with planned delivery could be judged an important advantage by women and clinicians, particularly for future pregnancies. Notably, there were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths in this setting, and one maternal death was probably related to comorbidities in association with pre-eclampsia rather than treatment allocation. The benefits and risks of planned delivery in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia might vary in low-resource health-care settings and require further evaluation, although the potential disadvantages of increased prematurity would need to be balanced against a much higher incidence of stillbirth in women with pre-eclampsia managed expectantly, such as that reported in a South African setting.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Our findings relate to women with late preterm pre-eclampsia and should not be extrapolated to women with chronic or gestational hypertension, in whom the likelihood of developing maternal morbidity is lower.</p>
              <p id="para470">In conclusion, our trial supports offering initiation of delivery in women with late preterm pre-eclampsia. The trade-off of lower maternal morbidity and severe hypertension against higher neonatal unit admissions, albeit without additional respiratory or other morbidity, should be discussed with women with late preterm pre-eclampsia to allow shared decision making on timing of delivery.</p>
