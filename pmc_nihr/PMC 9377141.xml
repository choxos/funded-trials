                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Clinic non-attendance rates are high across the African continent. Emerging evidence suggests that phone-based reminder messages could make a small but important contribution to reducing non-attendance. We will use behavioural economics principles to develop an SMS and voice reminder message to improve attendance rates in a school-based eye screening programme in Botswana.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will test a new theory-informed SMS and voice reminder message in a national school-based eye screening programme in Botswana. The control will be the standard SMS message used to remind parents/guardians to bring their child for ophthalmic assessment. All messages will be sent twice. The primary outcome is attendance for ophthalmic assessment. We will use an automated adaptive approach, starting with a 1:1 allocation ratio.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">As far as we are aware, only one other study has used behavioural economics to inform the development of reminder messages to be deployed in an African healthcare setting. Our study will use an adaptive trial design, embedded in a national screening programme. Our approach can be used to trial other forms of reminder message in the future.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par10">Many health programmes experience large mismatches between those identified with a clinical need and those who attend services. A recent international systematic review of âno-showâ appointments across all medical specialities in primary and secondary care estimated that 23% of clinic appointments are not attended, with the highest rate observed in the African continent (43%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Complex supply and demand factors govern access to health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and systematically marginalised populations are often the least likely to receive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par11">As mobile phone penetration has risen, there has been increasing interest in the use of phone-based reminder messages to reduce these missed appointments. Systematic reviews from 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have found that SMS and voice message reminders can improve clinic attendance by 50â100% depending on service, population and setting. In Linde and colleagueâs systematic review of African RCTs, their pooled analysis found that SMS reminders doubled appointment attendance compared with no SMS (odds ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.95; <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 85%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Robotham and colleaguesâ 2016 review found that two or more notifications increased attendance by as much as 19% over and above sending one notification, and voice notifications may offer slight improvements over text notifications for increasing attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">SMS and voice messages function as behavioural âbrief interventionsâ, and a number of studies have used behavioural economics principles to guide the wording of these messages in order to optimise their impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Senderey and colleagues used a set of established cognitive biases to develop the content of eight different clinic reminder messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]Â and Huf and colleagues used a similar approach in developing four different messages to boost clinic attendance in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whilst both studies showed improvements in clinic attendance rates, neither provided theÂ rationale for why these specific biases were selected. In Linde and colleaguesâ 2019 systematic review of 31 African RCTs using phone-based messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], only one study reported using behavioural theories to develop the content of theirÂ reminder message: Erwin and colleagues successfully boosted cervical cancer screening rates among women in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], basing their SMS reminder content on the Health Belief Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They also reported using a motivational toneâfound to be more effective than an informational tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]âand pre-tested the SMS content validity and cultural sensitivity of the message with programme staff and laypeople.</p>
                <p id="Par13">One area that currently experiences very high rates of missed appointmentsâwith substantial societal and economic costsâis community-based vision screening. Approximately 1.1 billion people (over 10% of the global population) currently live with a form of easily correctable visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Two very cheap and simple interventionsâspectacles and cataract operationsâcould eliminate over 90% of all visual impairment worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Provision of these services has risen exponentially in recent decades; however, effective coverage rates are disappointingly low and exhibit marked socioeconomic gradients at the international and intra-national levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women and marginalised groups bear a disproportionate burden of visual impairment, and often face structural social barriers that prevent them from accessing careâas noted in the recent UN Resolution on Vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par14">Recognising the human, social, and economic drag exerted by cataracts and uncorrected refractive error, many low- and middle-income country (LMIC) governments are ramping up their vision screening programmes. Donor funding is rising in tandem, partly driven by the advent of phone-based screening platforms like Peek Acuity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] that have made it possible to rapidly screen entire regions with very modest resource requirements.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Screening programmes based on the Peek digital platform are currently operating in seven LMICs. The Botswanan Ministry of Health (MoH) has committed to use Peek softwareÂ to screen all school children in government schools over 3 years beginning in Summer 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The Peek platform records basic sociodemographic data, visual acuity, referral status, and attendance status for each child. Every time a child is referred a series of three SMS messages are sent to the mobile phone number registered by their parent/guardian (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The current SMS message was not developed with reference to behavioural economics principles. According to internal data from Peek screening programmes in other countriesÂ and pilot data in Botswana, attendance rates are currently around 50%, i.e. only half of those identified as needing ophthalmic assessment present to services.</p>
                <p id="Par16">We aim to develop two behavioural economics-informed reminder messages; an SMS and a pre-recorded voice message to be used in the new Botswana MoH schools-based vision screening programme, and tested using an embedded, pragmatic, adaptive RCT design.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par17">Our objectives are to test a behavioural economics-informed SMS reminder message and a pre-recorded voice message that will be sent to the parents/guardians of school children who have been identified as having a visual impairment and referred to clinic. We hypothesise that these messages will be associated with a higher attendance rate than the current standard SMS reminder that is sent to all referred patientsâ parents/guardians.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par18">This is an automated, adaptive, parallel, four-arm, embedded, pragmatic RCT. We will start by testing the two SMS reminder messages head-to-head with an initial 1:1 allocation ratio, and then introduce the voice messages after a period of six weeks. We will use a Bayesian adaptive trial algorithm to perform adaptive allocation as the trial progresses.</p>

                <p id="Par20">Reminder messages will be sent to the registered mobile phone numbers of parents/guardians of children who test positive at screening and are referred on to clinic in the Pono Yame MoH/Peek Vision school screening programme in 2022. Provision of a mobile number is a pre-condition of entry into the screening programme, although parents/guardians are able to supply the number of a friend or relativeÂ so in practice this stipulation does not exclude any children.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Reminders will be sent in English and Setswana; spoken by &gt;96% of the local population. The screening programme routinely collects data on preferred language, and reminders will be sent in the preferred tongue.Â Those who list any language other than English of Setswana will receive the reminder in both Setswana and English.Â The reminder will alsoÂ be sent in both languages to those where data onÂ language isÂ not available for any reason. We will perform a secondary analysis that excludes these participants, but they will be included in the primary analysis.</p>

Obtaining consent would introduce burdens to the participant that are greater than the intervention itself. As such, we will not seek informed consent. This approach has been approved by the LSHTM and University of Botswana ethics committees, and follows the precedent set by three previous RCTs testing SMS reminder messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

They are also asked to provide written opt-outÂ consent for the use of their childrenâs sociodemographic data for research and sharing purposes.

                  <p id="Par25">We aimed to use an established framework to identify a theory-informed set of behaviour change principles to guide the development of our reminder messages. We elected to use Dolan and colleaguesâ <italic>MINDSPACE</italic> framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], developed in conjunction with the Institute for Government. This framework brings together insights from behavioural economics research that can be used to develop brief healthcare interventions (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The framework has been endorsed by the Behavioural Science and Public Health Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the London School of Economics Behavioral Economics Playbook for behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the Health Foundation in their guidance on behavioural insights in health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The âMINDSPACEâ framework and application for phone-based reminder messages</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Principles</th><th>Application</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Messenger</td><td>People are heavily influenced by the authority and credibility of the person sending the message, so the reminder messages should be signed-off by a trusted official/professional.</td></tr><tr><td>Incentives</td><td>People are more sensitive to losses than gains, so the reminders should frame non-attendance as a loss.</td></tr><tr><td>Norms</td><td>People want to fit in and are strongly influenced by the actions of others, so the reminders should signal that attendance is the norm.</td></tr><tr><td>Defaults</td><td>People tend to âgo with the flowâ and use pre-set options, so attendance should be the default option in the reminders.</td></tr><tr><td>Salience</td><td>People are drawn to things that are novel and appear relevant to them, so the reminders should be personalised and stress the novelty of the opportunity.</td></tr><tr><td>Priming</td><td>Peoplesâ decisions are commonly influenced by subconscious cues in their environment. We cannot influence this via phone-message.</td></tr><tr><td>Affect</td><td>Peoplesâ decisions are often based on emotional associations rather than facts, so the reminders should seek to make emotive arguments for attendance.</td></tr><tr><td>Commitments</td><td>People seek to be consistent with public promises and reciprocate acts, so the reminders should aim to elicit a commitment to attend and stress the social expectation of attendance.</td></tr><tr><td>Ego</td><td>People act in ways that support the impression of a positive self-image, so the reminders should reinforce the message that attendance is consistent with recipientsâ positive self-perceptions.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par26">Whilst SMS and voice messages can include messenger, incentives, norms, defaults, salience, emotional appeals, commitments, and ego, they are less able to âprimeâ recipients using subconscious cues. In addition to these principles, we also looked to the specific guidance on sending effective phone messages to reduce clinic non-attendance produced by Public Health England in 2020, based on their review of the international literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

                  <p id="Par34">One researcher (LA) drafted an initial SMS that included all of the eight relevant MINDSPACE behavioural economics elements and adhered to PHE guidance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We convened a workshop to refine the SMS and develop a pre-recorded voice message with an African economist and representatives from the University of Botswana, and Peek Visionâs Botswana office. Further iterations were made following a robust refinement process (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 1) that included input from laypeople, and professional translation and back-translation.

Enrolment is planned to commence in quarter 3 2022. We intend to start with two SMS arms and add in voice messaging once the trial is underway. This is because we want to observe how the automated allocation system handles the introduction of new arms.</p>

                <p id="Par51">Approximately 1000 children will be screened every day. Based on previous programmes, we expect approximately 160 of these children to be identified as requiring referral for further assessment and treatment. All of these childrenâs parents/guardians would receive the standard SMS reminders in a standard programme.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The adaptive allocation method that we are using does not use a pre-specified a sample size. Instead, the study will run until one of two criteria is met:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par53">There is a &gt;95% probability that one arm is best.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">There is a &gt;95% probability that the difference between the arms remaining in the study is &lt;1%.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par55">Depending on the effect of the interventions, one of the stopping criteria might be met after a few days; however, it could also take years before reaching a definitive conclusion. We will set a 3-month limit for this current study due to resource constraints.</p>

                  <p id="Par57">Participants will initially be randomly allocated into two arms using computer-generated blocks of 12. As allocation and intervention delivery (sending SMS messages) is fully automated, there is no need for any of the human investigators to know participant allocation status. Once the first participants attend refractive services, the algorithm will begin adjusting the allocation ratio to favour the best-performing arms. There is no need for the investigators to see allocation status at this stage either. The data safety monitoring committee will be fully unmasked to allocation status and all outcome data and will have the power to stop the trial or suspend any arm.</p>

They will double-check the algorithmâs working every 24 h during the trial and will repeat the final analysis comparing each arm.

                  <p id="Par69">This study will use Thompson sampling a Bayesian approach to identify the best arm. This is a Bayesian algorithm widely used to learn about arms and optimise decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] Every 24 h, the probability of each arm being the best arm overall will be estimated, using Monte-Carlo simulations to get the posterior probability estimates. As there is no evidence available on how the messages would perform relative to another, a regularising prior of Beta(100,000) (i.e. centred at <italic>p</italic>=0.5 with a 90% credible interval of 0.44â0.56) will be used to avoid overfitting extreme data in the early phase of the trial. It is expected that about 1,000 children will enrol every day, and the observed data will begin to dominate the prior within the first couple of days. Each arm will have a probability of being best between 0 and 100%, and the sum of all two probabilities will equal 100%. These probabilities will be compared to the stopping rules as to whether the trial should stop or continue into the next day. If the trial is to continue, the proportion allocated to each arm for the next day will be updated to be proportional to the estimated probabilities. We will conduct all analyses using the runif and rbeta functions in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Â FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates participant flow and operation of the algorithm.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Interaction between patient flow and the adaptive trial algorithm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6519_Fig2_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                  <p id="Par74">Internal data from a pilot site suggests that around 10% of children who attend the âtriage and treatmentâ clinic will subsequently be identified as having an eye need that requires further specialist ophthalmological assessment in a hospital clinic. These children will be referred from the âtriage and treatmentâ clinic to the local hospital. This subgroup will also receive either the intervention or control reminder messages.

                  <p id="Par75">Once the trial is complete, we will perform retrospective subgroup analyses to explore whether attendance within each group was associated with sociodemographic variables.

                  <p id="Par77">The primary analysis only requires trial arm and the outcome (attendance) to be recorded. The trial arm should be recorded automatically as part of the Peek coding, and if it was missing it would be due to a bug in the coding. If this occurred, there is no statistical method that could be used to recover that data so any records with trial arm missing would not be included in the updating of the probability that an arm is best. We will check the code every 24 h to ensure that it is running as expected and correct any errors that we find immediately. The outcome cannot be missing, as a participant is set as ânot attendedâ until the point where they are updated as having âattendedâ.</p>

As such, any delays to the launch of the programme will delay the start of the trial. As far as we are aware, only one other study has used behavioural economics to inform the development of reminder messages to be deployed in an African healthcare setting. Our study will use an adaptive trial design, embedded in a national screening programme. Our approach can be used to trial other forms of reminder message in the future, including tweaks to the messages that are sent and varying message content according to the demographic characteristics of the recipient.</p>

              <p>Any participantsâ identifiable personal data collected following informed consent by the Trial Coordinating Centre will be stored in a secure Peek Vision server (See Data Management Plan for more details on the purpose and type of data collected, and the security of the Peek Vision server). Confidentiality protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Act. Patient-level data will be pseudo-anonymised removing names and any other key identifiers before it is shared. Only the least amount of data will be shared, and where possible it will be fully anonymised and aggregated.</p>
              <p>All published findings will be at anonymous aggregate subpopulation level. In line with the UK concordat on open research data (2016), anonymised data from this trial will be made available to bona fide research groups (evidenced via CVs and the involvement of a qualified statistician), and in line with the trialâs publicly available Data Management Plan (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix 2), following review and approval from the trialâs data monitoring committee. No reasonable request will be turned down, and the appropriate data will be made available within 1-month of receiving the request.</p>
              <p>Peek Vision has a signed data sharing agreement with the Ministry of Botswana that governs the use of patient data collected and used in Peek Vision screening programmes. There may be multiple levels of permission required in-country before data can be shared, including national ministry of health approval and local implementation partner approval.</p>
