                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The incidence of Gram-negative bacteraemia is rising globally and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia initially receive intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. However, it remains unclear whether patients can step down to oral antibiotics after appropriate clinical response has been observed without compromising outcomes. Compared with IV therapy, oral therapy eliminates the risk of catheter-associated adverse events, enhances patient quality of life and reduces healthcare costs. As current management of Gram-negative bacteraemia entails a duration of IV therapy with limited evidence to guide oral conversion, we aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy and economic impact of early stepdown to oral antibiotics.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is an international, multicentre, randomised controlled, open-label, phase III, non-inferiority trial. To be eligible, adult participants must be clinically stable / non-critically ill inpatients with uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia. Randomisation to the intervention or standard arms will be performed with 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants randomised to the intervention arm (within 72 h from index blood culture collection) will be immediately switched to an oral fluoroquinolone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Participants randomised to the standard arm will continue to receive IV therapy for at least 24 h post-randomisation before clinical re-assessment and decision-making by the treating doctor. The recommended treatment duration is 7 days of active antibiotics (including empiric therapy), although treatment regimen may be longer than 7 days if clinically indicated. Primary outcome is 30-day all-cause mortality, and the key secondary outcome is health economic evaluation, including estimation of total healthcare cost as well as assessment of patient quality of life and number of quality-adjusted life years saved. Assuming a 30-day mortality of 8% in the standard and intervention arms, with 6% non-inferiority margin, the target sample size is 720 participants which provides 80% power with a one-sided 0.025 α-level after adjustment for 5% drop-out.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A finding of non-inferiority in efficacy of oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus IV standard of care antibiotics may hypothetically translate to wider adoption of a more cost-effective treatment strategy with better quality of life outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par45">The incidence of Gram-negative bacteraemia is rising globally and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. <italic>Enterobacterales</italic>, particularly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, are the predominant pathogens isolated from blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although practice guidelines provide general recommendations for antibiotic treatment duration for Gram-negative bacteraemia, the optimal route of administration is yet to be definitively defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The majority of patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia initially receive intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. However, it remains unclear whether patients can step down to oral therapy after appropriate clinical response has been observed without compromising outcomes. Doctors must exercise judgement based on multiple factors such as severity of disease, host immune status, anticipated adherence and predicted adequacy of drug absorption and infection-site penetration. Limited data suggesting conversion to oral therapy is effective and safe are generally restricted to Gram-negative bacteraemia secondary to urinary tract infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although the efficacy of early oral stepdown therapy versus continuing IV therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia (not limited to urinary tract sources) is unknown, the advantages of oral therapy are apparent. Compared with IV therapy, oral therapy eliminates the risk of catheter-associated adverse events such as venous thrombosis, phlebitis, line breakage and catheter-associated bloodstream infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Oral therapy enhances patient quality of life by eliminating discomfort associated with IV catheters, enabling mobility and reducing length of stay (LOS) in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The healthcare cost of oral therapy is lower compared with IV therapy as there are no charges associated with placement/maintenance of central lines or drug preparation and administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">Tamma et al. recently compared patient outcomes from early oral stepdown therapy (within the first 5 days of treatment) versus continued IV therapy for monomicrobial <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> bacteraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The retrospective multicentre study involved a 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort of 4967 unique cases. Key eligibility criteria included effective antibiotics administered from day 1 until treatment discontinuation, appropriate source control and clinical response by day 5. The authors found that 30-day all-cause mortality was not significantly different between 739 patients who received oral stepdown therapy versus 739 on continued IV therapy (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82–1.30). Patients who stepped down to oral therapy were discharged from hospital an average of 2 days earlier than those who continued IV therapy (5 [IQR 3–8] days vs. 7 [IQR 4–14] days; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
                <p id="Par47">In an earlier retrospective single-centre study of <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> bacteraemia from the urinary tract, Rieger et al. compared outcomes between 135 patients who switched early to oral therapy (median 4 days of IV therapy) versus 106 patients who continued to receive IV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The key eligibility criterion was positive urine and blood cultures collected within 24 h with the same <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> pathogen. Treatment failure was not significantly different between patients who received IV antibiotics only versus those who received IV-oral antibiotics (3.8% [95% CI 1.0–9.4%] vs. 8.2% [95% CI 4.1–14.1%]; <italic>p</italic> = 0.19). Similar to Tamma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the authors reported that patients who switched early to oral therapy were discharged from hospital approximately 2 days earlier than patients who continued to receive IV therapy (4.6 [IQR 3.1–7.8] days vs. 7.1 [IQR 4.0–17.5] days; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
                <p id="Par48">To date, no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been conducted to assess the efficacy of early oral stepdown therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia that are not limited to urinary tract sources. Current management of uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia entails a duration of IV antibiotic therapy with limited evidence from prospective studies to guide oral conversion.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par49">In this RCT, we aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy and economic impact of early stepdown to oral antibiotics versus continuing IV therapy for clinically stable / non-critically ill inpatients with uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia.</p>
                <p id="Par50">We hypothesise that (a) early stepdown to oral antibiotics will be non-inferior to continuing IV antibiotic therapy in the primary outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality, and (b) early oral stepdown therapy will result in significantly lower health resource and service utilisation costs compared with continuing IV therapy.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par51">This study is designed as an international, multicentre, randomised controlled, open-label, phase III, non-inferiority trial with a non-inferiority margin of 6%. Eligible participants must be clinically stable / non-critically ill inpatients over the age of 18 years (≥21 years in Singapore) with uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia. Randomisation to the intervention or standard arms will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants randomised to the intervention arm (within 72 h from the time of index blood culture collection) will be immediately switched to oral therapy. Participants randomised to the standard arm will continue to receive IV therapy for at least 24 h post-randomisation before clinical re-assessment and decision-making by the treating doctor. At the doctor’s discretion, patients in the standard arm may be switched to oral antibiotic therapy after continuing the IV therapy for at least 24 h post-randomisation. This data on oral antibiotic switch for patients in the standard arm will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). All study drugs (and dosage) would be those routinely used in clinical practice and will be ordered/dispensed from the hospital pharmacy as per site institutional practice. The recommended treatment duration is 7 days of active antibiotics (including empiric therapy), although treatment regimen may be longer than 7 days due to regimen extension or requirement for prolonged regimen as clinically indicated. Participants may be discharged home or to outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) at any time post-randomisation according to the discretion of the treating doctor. At day 30 post-randomisation, participants will be assessed for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. The key secondary outcome is health economic evaluation, including estimation of total healthcare cost (from healthcare system and patient perspective) to determine the economic impact of early oral stepdown therapy. Health services and resource utilisation cost data over the entire duration of the study will be collected from medical records or administrative sources whenever possible. A health outcome analysis will be conducted to assess patient quality of life and the number of quality-adjusted life years saved.</p>

                <p id="Par52">As Gram-negative bacteraemia can be seen in a large range of clinical situations spanning all hospital departments and patient populations, the study logically requires recruitment of patients from all areas of the hospital system. Gram-negative bacteraemias are usually treated in admitted patients and therefore inclusion of outpatients is not applicable. Recruitment in Singapore will be carried out in Tan Tock Seng Hospital, National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. Recruitment will also be carried out in several overseas sites in Australia (Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Royal Melbourne Hospital), Malaysia (University Malaya Medical Centre), South Korea (Samsung Medical Centre) and UK (Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Hospital).</p>

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par94">High-bioavailability oral antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole have been utilised for Gram-negative bacteraemia based on clinical and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the use of fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increases the risk of potential adverse events (AEs) including <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic>-associated diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As a result, interest has been spurred in the role of oral β-lactams that have low-to-moderate bioavailability. The question of whether oral β-lactams can be used as an efficacious alternative to oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Gram-negative bacteraemia is controversial.</p>
                <p id="Par95">Many doctors assume that patients who switch to oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are less likely to experience treatment failure compared with patients who switch to oral β-lactams. This is due to the higher bioavailability and more favourable PK/PD profile of fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared with β-lactams. This assumption is supported by the retrospective study of Kutob et al., which investigated whether varying bioavailabilities of different oral antibiotics affected outcomes for Gram-negative bacteraemia predominantly from the urinary tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The authors found the risk of treatment failure was higher in patients who received antibiotics with low-to-moderate bioavailability compared to those who received antibiotics with high bioavailability.</p>
                <p id="Par96">However, in another retrospective study by Mercuro et al., clinical success was similar between patients who received oral fluoroquinolones and those who received oral β-lactams as stepdown therapy for <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> bacteraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Likewise, in the earlier described study by Tamma et al., the authors found no difference in 30-day mortality between patients who switched to high-bioavailability agents versus those who switched to low-bioavailability agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is noteworthy the studies by Kutob et al., Mercuro et al. and Tamma et al. were underpowered to determine whether bioavailability of oral antibiotics is crucial for successful treatment of Gram-negative bacteraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par97">In view of the uncertainty associated with high-bioavailability versus low-bioavailability agents for Gram-negative bacteraemia, the study team decided the oral stepdown arm of this RCT will consist only of fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This conservative decision (in not testing oral β-lactams) is supported by a recent review article highlighting many oral β-lactams have short half-life requiring frequent dosing that may negatively impact patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the dose of oral β-lactams (unlike IV β-lactams) required to attain specific PD targets is still unclear and the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of oral β-lactams is not routinely performed in many hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This conundrum is further complicated in clinical scenarios when dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis revealed infection recurrence occurred more frequently in Gram-negative bacteraemic patients transitioned to oral β-lactams compared with oral fluoroquinolones, although all-cause mortality was not significantly different between the β-lactams group versus fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

Study team will not be exposing participants to excess risk by study inclusion beyond the risks involved in standard therapeutic decisions and clinical management. The main risk for patients randomised to the intervention arm is that oral antibiotics may not be as efficacious compared with IV antibiotics for treatment of Gram-negative bacteraemia. In the event of microbiological or clinical failure of the oral antibiotic treatment, escalation to IV antibiotics may be initiated at the discretion of the treating doctor at any time point post-randomisation. Antibiotic escalation will not be considered a protocol deviation. Study team will be monitoring for any change in treatment strategy (e.g. switch to IV antibiotics from allocated oral antibiotics or vice versa) between the time of randomisation and day 30 due to (a) an AE deemed by the treating doctor to be of sufficient severity to change treatment strategy, or (b) presumed lack of efficacy of treatment strategy according to the judgement of treating doctor.</p>

                <p id="Par139">In an RCT comparing 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia, 30-day all-cause mortality occurred in 4.9% of patients in the 7-day duration arm and 4.4% of patients in the 14-day duration arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a retrospective multicentre study of propensity score-matched cohort with monomicrobial <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> bacteraemia, 30-day all-cause mortality was 13.1% for patients who received early oral stepdown therapy and 13.4% for those who continued to receive IV therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accurate estimation of mortality (for this study) is complicated by significant variability in reported mortality of past studies—likely influenced by geography and isolate resistance phenotype. We assumed 30-day mortality of 8% in the standard and intervention arms of this study—determined as the approximate mid-range from the two aforementioned studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. With a 6% non-inferiority margin, a total of 720 patients are needed to achieve 80% power with a one-sided 0.025 <italic>α</italic>-level after adjustment for 5% drop-out. Based on an expected mortality of 80% under a hypothetical situation where bacteraemic patients received no antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the standard arm treatment would have reduced mortality by 72% (from 80 to 8%). The pre-specified, 6% non-inferiority margin requires a 30-day mortality of ≤14% in the intervention arm, which preserves more than 90% of the 72% treatment effect of standard arm treatment to conclude non-inferiority. This is in accordance with requirements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on non-inferiority margin to maintain at least 50% of treatment effect of the standard treatment.</p>

The eCRFs will collect clinical and laboratory-related information and will contain validation ranges for each variable to minimise data entry errors. The database will include information on demographics, underlying illnesses, antibiotic history, baseline and follow-up laboratory data including microbiologic data, and assessments of vital signs and AEs for the purpose of clinical outcome assessment. Data on hospital admission and discharge summaries will also be recorded. Source of bacteraemia, if known, will be noted. Trial data will be stored in a re-identifiable manner in the database using a unique screening number for each participant. For each potential participant screened (even those who are not eligible), the screening eCRF will be completed by the site PI or their delegate. For each participant enrolled, eCRFs will be completed. This also applies to records for those participants who fail to complete the study. The site PI will ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data entered into the eCRFs and in all required reports. A comprehensive validation check programme will verify the data and automatically generate discrepancies for resolution by the investigator. Manual discrepancies can also be raised if necessary. The study team will manage the data and will conduct quality control of the data following their own standard operating procedures (SOP). Missing data or suspected errors will be raised as data queries (for example, by the lead study coordinator and monitor) and will be resolved prior to database lock and analysis. An audit trail will be maintained for tracking purposes. The clinical study report(s) and all analyses performed as well as the final data set will be archived together according to SOP.</p>

                <p id="Par182">The primary analysis for this study will be performed on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, which consists of all randomised patients but excludes those who withdraw consent prior to any post-randomisation assessment. Risk difference of 30-day all-cause mortality and its 95% confidence interval between standard and intervention arms will be estimated from a generalised linear model with binomial distribution and identity link function adjusted for country and other prognostic factors for the mITT population. If the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval falls below the 6% non-inferiority margin, non-inferiority will be concluded for early oral stepdown therapy relative to continuing IV therapy. As a special case of non-inferiority, if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval falls below zero, superiority will be declared for early oral stepdown therapy. Supportive analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed with the per-protocol population, which consists of all randomised patients but excludes those who withdraw consent prior to any post-randomisation assessment and those who have a major protocol violation that may significantly affect the primary endpoint. Superiority of early oral stepdown therapy over continuing IV therapy will be evaluated with respect to outcomes such as LOS in hospital, as well as infection and health economic outcomes. Secondary outcome measures expressed as proportions will be compared between standard and intervention arms using chi-squared test, and risk difference as well as relative risk of the outcome measures will be calculated together with its 95% confidence interval. Mean difference and its 95% confidence interval will be provided for secondary outcome measures that are on interval scale, and comparison between study arms will be done using a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
                <p id="Par183">In addition to exploring the efficacy and safety of early oral stepdown therapy, this study will also analyse the economic viability of the proposed approach through a health economic evaluation according to ITT principle from healthcare system as well as patient perspectives. For base case analysis, private rate of each resource utilisation will be applied to calculate the average cost and savings. The health economic analysis will have two components:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par184">If the RCT results confirm the non-inferiority of early oral stepdown therapy relative to continuing IV therapy, a cost saving analysis will be conducted to estimate the economic impact of the new treatment regimen;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par185">If the RCT results fail to confirm the non-inferiority, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) by comparing the difference in cost and clinical outcomes as well as quality of life between the two treatment arms (ICER=∆C/∆E).</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par186">To address possible variations in patient medical conditions and outcomes, a series of one-way sensitivity analyses will be conducted to address the potential impact of each parameter uncertainty and assess the robustness of study estimations for generalisability. Based on the sensitivity analysis, tornado plot will be generated to assess how much influence each of the variables has on the overall model. Additionally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation will be performed. Simulated results will be plotted in the cost-effectiveness plane to present the distribution of cost-effectiveness ratios. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be generated to assess the probability variations of accepting each strategy by changing the threshold of willingness-to-pay.</p>

A participant may also be withdrawn from participation in the study for the following reasons: (a) termination of study or (b) any new information becomes available that makes continuing participation unsafe. An early termination occurs when an enrolled participant withdraws consent to participate in the study, regardless of circumstances, prior to the primary outcome assessment at day 30. All participants terminating early from the study, regardless of cause, will be classified as non-evaluable and will be analysed as a ‘failure’ in the efficacy analyses. The reason(s) for early termination should be reflected in the source documentation and on the applicable eCRFs. In all cases, the reasons why a participant is withdrawn must be recorded in detail and entered into the eCRF. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. Patients whose randomised treatment is changed due to an AE or treatment failure or an unintentionally fulfilled exclusion criterion will remain in the study to assess outcomes. If the unintentionally fulfilled exclusion criterion/criteria is judged to be critical (i.e. it will significantly affect clinical outcomes), the case may be excluded from efficacy analysis although it will still be included in safety analysis regardless of study arm allocation.</p>

                <p id="Par197">An elective procedure not reflecting a worsening of a known underlying medical condition is not considered an AE, and therefore will not be considered an SAE despite requiring hospitalisation. However, complications of a procedure will be considered an AE and may be considered an SAE if hospitalisation is prolonged (or any other SAE criteria is met). A hospitalisation or prolongation of a hospitalisation for reasons other than an AE would not be considered an SAE.</p>
                <p id="Par198">AEs include any occurrences that are new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Concurrent medical conditions present at baseline that worsen will be considered as AEs. Lack of efficacy, aggravation, or relapse of current infection are not an AE in the study and therefore also not an SAE (except death).</p>

In general, abnormal laboratory results without clinical significance (based on clinical judgement) should not be recorded as AEs. However, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered adverse. The investigators should liaise closely with the treating teams and remain aware of any such AEs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par227">This study aims to determine whether patients with uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia can step down to oral antibiotic treatment as early as within 72 h from the time of index blood culture collection. Recent data from a multicentre, propensity score-matched, retrospective study suggested 7 days of antibiotics may be sufficient for treatment of uncomplicated <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> bacteraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Consistent with this, recently completed RCTs demonstrated non-inferiority of 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, switching to oral therapy on day 7 or later will not be meaningful as it is likely that sufficient IV antibiotics would have already been administered. In this study, we propose 72 h from the time of index blood culture collection as the cut-off time frame for switching to oral therapy for patients randomised to the intervention arm. The proposed 72-h randomisation window is supported by the observational analyses of Rieger et al., Kutob et al. and Mercuro et al., where patients typically received 3–5 days of IV therapy prior to oral stepdown therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par228">The options for oral therapy in this study are fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole—selected due to their extensive use in clinical practice with well-established safety and efficacy across a plethora of infections. For example, in one of the aforementioned RCTs studying treatment duration for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia, &gt;70% (across both study arms) received oral fluoroquinolones among the patients who switched to stepdown therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par229">Our study will help inform local and international practice guidelines on optimal antibiotic management for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteraemia. A finding of non-inferiority in clinical efficacy of oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus IV antibiotics may translate to wider adoption of a more cost-effective treatment strategy. Early oral stepdown therapy will reduce hospital LOS as well as result in better patient-centred quality of life outcomes and satisfaction.</p>
