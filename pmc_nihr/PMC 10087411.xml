                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>5%–10% children and young people (CYP) experience specific phobias that impact daily functioning. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is recommended but has limitations. One Session Treatment (OST), a briefer alternative incorporating CBT principles, has demonstrated efficacy. The Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial (ASPECT) investigated the non‐inferiority of OST compared to multi‐session CBT for treating specific phobias in CYP.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>ASPECT was a pragmatic, multi‐center, non‐inferiority randomized controlled trial in 26 CAMHS sites, three voluntary agency services, and one university‐based CYP well‐being service. CYP aged 7–16 years with specific phobia were randomized to receive OST or CBT. Clinical non‐inferiority and a nested cost‐effectiveness evaluation was assessed 6‐months post‐randomization using the Behavioural Avoidance Task (BAT). Secondary outcome measures included the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule, Child Anxiety Impact Scale, Revised Children's Anxiety Depression Scale, goal‐based outcome measure, and EQ‐5DY and CHU‐9D, collected blind at baseline and six‐months.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>268 CYPs were randomized to OST (<italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 134) or CBT (<italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 134). Mean BAT scores at 6 months were similar across groups in both intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per‐protocol (PP) populations (CBT: 7.1 (ITT, <italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 76), 7.4 (PP, <italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 57), OST: 7.4 (ITT, <italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 73), 7.6 (PP, <italic toggle="no">n</italic> = 56), on the standardized scale‐adjusted mean difference for CBT compared to OST ‐0.123, 95% CI −0.449 to 0.202 (ITT), mean difference −0.204, 95% CI −0.579 to 0.171 (PP)). These findings were wholly below the standardized non‐inferiority limit of 0.4, suggesting that OST is non‐inferior to CBT. No between‐group differences were found on secondary outcomes. OST marginally decreased mean service use costs and maintained similar mean Quality Adjusted Life Years compared to CBT.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A specific phobia is an intense, enduring fear of a situation/object associated with anxiety symptoms, distress, and avoidance (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), estimated to affect 5% to 10% of children and young people (CYP). Specific phobias are associated with distress and interference with day‐to‐day activities (Ollendick &amp; March, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), poorer quality of life (Comer et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), academic difficulties (Ialongo, Edelsohn, Werthamer‐Larsson, Crockett, &amp; Kellam, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), and predict future mental health problems (Bittner et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lieb et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) including long‐term phobia (Meyer, Rumpf, Hapke, &amp; John, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Multi‐session Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the commonly used therapeutic approach to managing specific phobias in CYP and has a robust evidence base demonstrating efficacy (Hudson et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kendall &amp; Hedtke, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). However, access to CBT is limited (Care Quality Commission, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), likely due to several factors. For example, multi‐session CBT is time‐consuming (Aschim, Lundevall, Martinsen, &amp; Frich, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Wiebe &amp; Greiver, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), offered at great cost (Cavanagh, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Shapiro, Cavanagh, &amp; Lomas, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), and often requires highly trained therapists (Stallard, Myles, &amp; Branson, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; van der Gaag, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, multi‐session CBT takes several weeks and months to complete, which is burdensome for families accessing support (Ollendick, Ryan, Capriola‐Hall, Austin, &amp; Fraire, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and might be one reason for the relatively high drop‐out rate seen in CYP mental health services (De Haan, Boon, de Jong, Hoeve, &amp; Vermeiren, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). These barriers to the provision of, and access to, multi‐session CBT suggest a need for briefer, cost‐effective treatments that retain the clinical benefits of CBT, while also improving access to therapy.</p>
              <sec id="jcpp13665-sec-0006">
                <title>One session treatment: a brief and effective treatment for specific phobia</title>
                <p>One‐session treatment (OST) is a variant of CBT that uses many of the same techniques but does not require an extensive treatment period over several weeks and months. Instead, OST takes place over two sessions: (i) an initial assessment and planning session lasting around 1 hr, and (ii) a single exposure session lasting up to 3 hr. Furthermore, OST has a strong evidence base built largely over the last two decades, supporting its efficacy at improving specific phobias in CYP (Davis III, Ollendick, &amp; Öst, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Ryan, Strege, Oar, &amp; Ollendick, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), therefore offering a clinically effective, briefer, and potentially more accessible treatment option to multi‐session CBT.</p>
                <p>However, despite the clinical efficacy of OST, there remains substantial gaps in the evidence that prevent OST being delivered in routine clinical services. First, to our knowledge, no study has compared OST to multi‐session CBT. Consequently, it is unclear whether the clinical effects of OST stand up to the benefits of CBT. Second, extant research has tended to test OST in tightly controlled efficacy trials that do not reflect the participants, therapists, or environments seen in mental health services. Therefore, it is unclear how well OST would perform in a more pragmatic setting such as Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Finally, although the consolidated, brief format of OST lends itself to being a more cost‐effective tool than multisession CBT, to our knowledge, no study has performed an economic analysis to quantify any (potential) savings or evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of OST relative to CBT.</p>
                <p>The present research The ‘Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial’ (ASPECT) aims to address the gaps described above by investigating the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of OST vs. multi‐session CBT for specific phobias in CYP aged 7 to 16 years within ‘real‐world’ mental health services in the UK. The present research aimed to investigate the clinical non‐inferiority of OST compared to multi‐session CBT at a 6‐month follow‐up point in (i) reducing the severity of specific phobia as measured by the Behavioural Avoidance Task and (ii) improving wider quality of life outcomes for CYP. Additionally, we report the cost‐effectiveness of OST relative to multi‐session CBT (for a more detailed cost‐effectiveness analysis as part of ASPECT, see Wang et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p>

                <p>ASPECT was a pragmatic, multi‐center, parallel group non‐inferiority RCT, comparing the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of OST with multi‐session CBT. A nested qualitative study exploring the acceptability of OST to CYP, their parent/guardians, and therapists and a full economic evaluation are reported elsewhere (Hayward et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited across thirteen sites in England, including twelve NHS Trusts (comprising a total of 26 CAMHS) and one University‐based CYP wellbeing service. Potential participants were identified by participating clinical services and referred to the ASPECT study team for screening. To be eligible for the study, participants were required to be aged 7 to 16 years (inclusive) who were experiencing a specific phobia as defined by DSM‐IV criteria (American Psychiatric Association, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Specifically, participants were required to experience phobias characterized by (i) marked and out of proportion fear to a specific object or situation; (ii) exposure provokes immediate anxiety; (iii) the phobic situation(s) is avoided where possible; (iv) the avoidance or distress interferes with the person's routine or functioning; and (v) has been present for ≥ six‐months. CYPs were excluded from participation if (i) exposure therapy was not deemed to be an appropriate first‐line treatment (e.g., where a more severe difficulty took priority) and (ii) their phobic stimuli could not be safely presented or simulated during therapy (e.g., stinging insects). CYPs experiencing comorbid physical and/or mental health difficulties were not excluded, provided they met the eligibility criteria.</p>

                <p>Potential participants that were referred to ASPECT by participating recruitment sites were initially screened for eligibility by a Research Assistant over the telephone. Guardians of CYP with suspected phobias answered five ‘yes/no’ screening questions based on the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule (ADIS). Those eligible (answering ‘yes’ to all questions) were invited to a face‐to‐face baseline appointment with a Research Assistant where full informed consent and assent was taken from the Guardian and the CYP. After consent, baseline measurements were taken from both the Guardian and the CYP (see ‘Measurements’ section for all measurements). Participants were then remotely randomized by a Clinical Trials Unit to receive either CBT or OST (1:1) using an online system through the Trials Unit (see ‘Randomization’ section for full details). Participants were then referred to clinical services for their allocated therapy. All outcome measures (except the demographics survey) were repeated 6 months after randomization by a Research Assistant blind to group allocation.</p>

CYPs were exposed to their phobic stimulus over ten pre‐defined steps which gradually increased in difficulty. The number of steps taken was the main unit of measurement recorded for analysis, with more steps (i.e., a higher score) indicating less severe phobia. Alongside this, a measure of Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) was also taken at the start of the BAT and at the last step completed, which ranged from 0 (no fear at all) to 8 (very, very much fear). All BATs were standardized, which included using the same/similar rooms and phobic stimuli, alongside the same Research Assistant. For some phobic stimuli, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> exposure was not ethically appropriate (e.g., needle injection, exposure to vomit). In these instances, phobic stimuli were simulated (e.g., using venipuncture practice arms to simulate injection, and simulated vomit).</p>

The ADIS is a semi‐structured interview that records information from the CYP and their Guardians about the type of specific phobia(s) experienced (e.g., animal, injection, heights), the degree of associated fear (ranging from 0 = not at all, to 8 = very, very much), whether the phobia impacts daily functioning (rated as ‘yes’ or ‘no’), and the degree to which the specific phobia impacts daily functioning (ranging from 0 = not at all, to 8 = very, very much). The ADIS interview was used to assign a Clinical Severity Rating (CSR) to both the CYP and Guardian perceptions of the specific phobia. In line with guidelines (Silverman &amp; Albano, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), the higher value of the CSR's given by the CYP or the Guardian was taken for the final CSR, unless strong reason was provided to depart from this (e.g. clear evidence of unreliability of one score).

                  <p>CBT is the current gold‐standard approach to treating specific phobias and includes several elements that target cognitive and behavioral processes associated with specific phobia experience. CBT typically aims to help CYP recognize anxious feelings and bodily reactions to anxiety; understand interactions between thoughts, feelings, sensations, and the environment; confront the feared situation through exposure until anxiety reduces; and practice a range of anxiety management and coping strategies to enable progress. CBT is typically administered in hour‐long sessions delivered weekly, and although there is currently no recommended number of CBT sessions for specific phobias, CYP typically receive 6–12 sessions as part of usual care. ASPECT was a pragmatic trial aiming to reflect ‘real‐world’ delivery; therefore, therapists providing CBT as part of ASPECT were asked to deliver their service's usual multi‐session CBT approach.</p>

                  <p>OST comprises two treatment sessions – an initial 1‐hour functional assessment followed by a 3‐hour exposure session. OST is a variant of CBT and uses the same treatment techniques (e.g., graduated exposure, participant modeling, challenging unhelpful beliefs, and reinforcement). During the initial functional assessment session, the therapist works with the CYP to build rapport and develop a fear hierarchy (i.e., an ascending list of situations/experiences in order of perceived severity). In the subsequent exposure session, CYP work with the therapist to gradually move through their fear hierarchy, remaining at each step until subjective anxiety levels have decreased by ≥50%. Therapists delivering OST as part of the ASPECT trial were trained by experienced OST therapists based on the definitive textbook for OST (Davis, Ollendick, &amp; Öst, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p>

Therefore, using the point estimate method, the non‐inferiority margin was set to be half of this at 0.4. The initial target sample size was 286 (143 per arm). An extension was requested when we faced COVID‐19 and other related recruitment challenges. Our observations at this point i.e., a correlation of 0.7 between baseline and six‐month primary outcome measures, an observed dropout rate of 27.3%, the finding that each therapist was treating five (instead of 15) CYP, and with a design effect of 1.04 (instead of the planned 1.14), the original sample size of 286 (143 per group), would have given us a power of 97.7%. Based on these observations, a total of 246 participants (123 per group) were required to preserve a power of ~90% for a one‐sided 2.5% test with a standardized non‐inferiority margin of 0.4. This was approved by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC), Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the funder.</p>

Analysis controlled for baseline scores and stratifying variables (age, phobia severity). Secondary binary outcomes were analyzed using a mixed‐effects logistic regression model adjusted for age, site, phobia severity, and therapist as the random effect. For the primary outcome, the standardized mean difference was calculated using Hedges correction factor and the confidence interval using the true standard error (Goulet‐Pelletier &amp; Cousineau, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), and the null hypothesis of inferiority would have been rejected if the lower limit of the two‐sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the standardized mean difference was wholly below 0.4 (the range of clinical non‐inferiority).</p>
                <p>To conclude non‐inferiority of OST, we required both the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and the PP analyses to reject the null hypothesis of non‐inferiority. To be considered PP CYP randomized to OST had to have attended one assessment session, one main exposure session (with an optional extra session), and treatment needed to include an assessment, fear hierarchy development, and exposure. Any CYP attending more than the three outlined sessions prior to 6‐months follow‐up was not considered PP. CYP randomized to CBT were defined as PP if they had attended ≥ four sessions.</p>

Regression models controlled for baseline differences in cost and utility were used to compare mean costs and QALYs, and a non‐parametric bootstrapping with 5,000 iterations was conducted to take uncertainty into consideration. The bootstrapped results were presented in the conventional form of a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC), which resented the probability of the intervention being cost‐effective over a range of willingness‐to‐pay thresholds per QALY.</p>

                  <p>Analysis of the primary outcome (i.e., the BAT) suggested that OST was clinically non‐inferior to multi‐session CBT.

A marginally larger improvement was seen for the PP group in both treatment arms. Progression in the number of BAT steps taken was comparable across groups at 6 months (CBT 7.1 (ITT) and 7.4 (PP); OST 7.4 (ITT) and 7.6 (PP); adjusted mean difference for CBT compared to OST −0.46, 95% CI −1.43 to 0.51 for ITT, mean difference − 0.73, 95% CI ‐1.83 to 0.37 for PP; Table <xref rid="jcpp13665-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) compared to baseline (3). As the standardized mean difference 95% CIs were below the non‐inferiority limit (0.4; Figure <xref rid="jcpp13665-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), the results provide evidence for OST as non‐inferior to CBT.

The final sensitivity analysis in relation to OST and CBT compliance was conducted via Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis (Angrist, Imbens, &amp; Rubin, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Receipt of treatment was regressed on the random treatment allocation and baseline covariates, generating a prediction of the receipt of treatment. The primary analysis model was fitted after replacing treatment with the prediction. CACE analysis was conducted for both CBT and OST. All sensitivity analyses found that the 95% CIs remained wholly below the non‐inferiority limit, confirming the robustness of the primary result.</p>

The Cost Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) shows that the probability of OST being cost‐effective was over 97% across all WTP thresholds, suggesting OST is likely to be cost‐saving compared to CBT (Figure <xref rid="jcpp13665-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using prospectively set non‐inferiority parameters, OST is shown to be non‐inferior in clinical effectiveness to multi‐session CBT when treating specific phobias in CYP. The number of steps completed on the BAT (our primary outcome) and the percentage of diagnosis‐free participants at follow‐up were similar for both OST and CBT. The non‐inferiority conclusion was corroborated by our secondary outcomes (SUDS, CAIS, goal‐based outcomes and RCADS).</p>
              <p>The value of ASPECT is that it is the only fully powered RCT that has compared OST with another active therapy across a range of phobias. The findings of an earlier small RCT (Flatt &amp; King, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) with 43 participants across three arms (OST, cognitive therapy, and waiting list) are uninterpretable due to the small sample. Two earlier RCTs by Ollendick and colleagues compared (a) OST against psychological placebo and waiting list (Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) that found OST to be superior to education support and waiting list and (b) different versions of OST (with or without parental involvement, Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There are, therefore, no similar previous studies for comparison with ours.</p>
              <p>We cannot tell whether the number of steps completed on the BAT and the percentage of diagnosis‐free participants at follow‐up would be higher if COVID‐19 had not affected treatment completion. Absolute rates at follow‐up should be considered in the context of our sample having higher severity at baseline and including more complex presentations, such as blood–injury–injection phobia and young people with low motivation, who were excluded by other studies (e.g. Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). We also determined diagnosis conservatively by choosing the higher score between parent and child (as done by Evans, Thirlwall, Cooper, &amp; Creswell, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), rather than averaging the scores (as in Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), which could have deflated the absolute numbers of “diagnosis‐free” participants at follow‐up.</p>
              <p>Findings from the qualitative and health economics analyses are presented elsewhere and demonstrated good acceptability and satisfaction with OST from the perspectives of CYP, parents/guardians and clinicians, and also marginally decreased service use costs with similar QALYs, which will be of interest to commissioners.</p>

                  <p>ASPECT is the first RCT comparing the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of OST to multi‐session CBT for CYP with specific phobias. Unlike other previous studies conducted in tightly controlled research settings (Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Öst, Svensson, Hellström, &amp; Lindwall, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), ASPECT's pragmatic design allowed the effectiveness of OST and CBT to be compared in real‐world clinical settings. Furthermore, by imposing few exclusions, many phobia types were represented in ASPECT allowing broad comparisons of OST and CBT to be made, unlike previous studies (Ollendick et al., <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) where BII phobias were excluded. BII phobias are particularly important because they lead to vaccination refusals and get in the way of medical screening and dental check‐ups.</p>
                  <p>ASPECT employed several methodological mechanisms to reduce bias including remote randomization, blinding of researchers collecting outcome measures, and adherence to a prospectively planned protocol, alongside statistical and health economics analysis plans, conducting treatment fidelity assessments and receiving project oversight from an independent Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Ethics Committee. Including the BAT alongside self‐reported questionnaires allowed for a comprehensive and objective measure of CYP phobia.</p>

                <title>Implications and recommendations</title>
                <p>Access to training for community or school‐based child mental health treatments has become more readily available to UK clinicians (Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Education, <xref rid="jcpp13665-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). As this includes training to deliver OST, ASPECT was timely in providing evidence for OST being as effective as CBT for CYP with specific phobias. Our study shows OST has a place in the armory of possible available treatments for specific phobias. For young people who do not engage or benefit from OST and CBT, further research can help us understand “why” and subsequently enable us to develop and evaluate new strategies for maximizing therapy gains for a greater number of young people.</p>

              <p>To date, ASPECT is the only fully powered RCT to compare the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of OST relative to multi‐session CBT. Our findings show that OST is as clinically effective as multi‐session CBT for specific phobia in CYP and is likely to be more cost‐effective. Future work should focus on developing service specifications, training, and care pathways to ensure that OST can be readily available as part of routine care for severe and debilitating phobias in children and young people.</p>
