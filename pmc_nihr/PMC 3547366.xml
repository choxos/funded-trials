                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>Diagnosis of heart failure in older people in long-term care is challenging because of co-morbidities, cognitive deficit, polypharmacy, immobility, and poor access to services. This study aimed to ascertain heart failure prevalence and clinical management in this population.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and results</title>
                  <p>A total of 405 residents, aged 65–100 years, in 33 UK care facilities were prospectively enrolled between April 2009 and June 2010. The presence of heart failure was determined using European Society of Cardiology guidelines, modified where necessary for immobility. Evaluation of symptoms and signs, functional capacity, and quality of life, portable on-site echocardiography, and medical record review were completed in 399 cases. The point prevalence of heart failure was 22.8% [<italic>n</italic> = 91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18.8–27.2%]; of these, 62.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 57, 95% CI 59.6–66.5%) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and 37.3% had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (<italic>n</italic> = 34, 95% CI 34.8–40.5%). A total of 76% (<italic>n</italic> = 61) of previous diagnoses of heart failure were not confirmed, and up to 90% (<italic>n</italic> = 82) of study cases were new. No symptoms or signs were reliable predictors of heart failure.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Heart failure was diagnosed in almost a quarter of residents: the prevalence was substantially higher than in other populations. The majority of heart failure cases were undiagnosed, while three-quarters of previously recorded cases were misdiagnosed. Common symptoms and signs appear to have little clinical utility in this population. Early, accurate differential diagnosis is key to the effective management of heart failure; this may be failing in long-term care facilities.</p>

              <p>Heart failure (HF) has a progressive, negative impact upon quality of life, morbidity, and mortality, which may be improved substantially by accurate diagnosis and management. Although the prevalence of HF is highest in older people, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C1">1</xref></sup> diagnosis and management are likely to be least comprehensive in long-term care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C5">5</xref></sup> In this setting, where access to health services may be limited, acute care often takes precedence over chronic care and preventative needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C6">6</xref></sup> In practice, HF symptoms are often non-specific, physical signs may be difficult to elicit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C12">12</xref></sup> and, for unknown reasons, the prevalence of cardiovascular co-morbidities may be lower in older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C13">13</xref></sup> As long-term care residents are often unable to attend outside clinics or diagnostic facilities, the lack of availability of echocardiography in this setting further complicates diagnosis and management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C17">17</xref></sup> Internationally, the most relevant studies suggest a prevalence of 10–42% in long-term care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C19">19</xref></sup> 6.7% in the general population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C20">20</xref></sup> and 46% in older people presenting to hospital with HF symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C11">11</xref></sup> While data on undiagnosed HF are inherently difficult to obtain, current evidence suggests that an accurate diagnosis may be missed in up to half of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C18">18</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C24">24</xref></sup> Despite the higher prevalence of HF in older people, there is a paucity of research that examines either assessment and diagnostic practices or care provision for this debilitating disease. The relative prevalence of HF with reduced ejection fraction [left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or HFrEF] and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unknown, though HFpEF may account for &gt;50% of HF hospitalizations in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C28">28</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to establish the overall prevalence of HF (and by type) in long-term care facilities using on-site echocardiography and a review of treatment for existing diagnoses of HF.</p>

                <p>The NYHA classification was not a reliable indicator of systolic dysfunction; participants with an assessment of NYHA class IV were classified as having mild or moderate LVSD, while those with NYHA class I had mild, moderate, or severe LVSD. Study assessment of NYHA classification was not possible in 101 participants (25%) due to immobility; the remainder were ambulant. A total of 129 (32%) residents had an elevated respiratory rate (&gt;20 breaths/min), and 183 (49%) had peripheral oedema (mild or moderate); 59 (15%) residents had both, and, of these, four residents also had a raised BNP (&gt;400 pg/mL). Of the 59 symptomatic residents with an elevated respiratory rate and peripheral oedema, 20 (34%) had HF, of which 5 had an existing record of HF and15 were newly diagnosed. Of the four residents with these signs plus a raised BNP, three had HF, of which one was newly diagnosed.</p>
                <p>The acceptability of the diagnostic assessment by residents was high: four (1%) residents reported they would decline a request to repeat parts of the assessments, two found the echocardiogram procedure uncomfortable, and two reported they would decline further blood tests. There were only four unsuccessful venepuncture attempts in the 405 participants.</p>

The number of co-morbidities was not significantly different between those with and without HF (<italic>P</italic> =0.641).

              <p>In our large, institution-based study of older people, we report that HF was diagnosed in almost a quarter of residents, two-thirds of whom had HFpEF. The prevalence of HF was substantially higher than in community populations. Most cases of HF were previously undiagnosed, and three-quarters of previously recorded cases were not confirmed. Symptoms and signs typically associated with HF such as leg oedema and breathlesness appear to have little clinical utility in this population. In summary, these findings indicate a HF and HFpEF burden that is substantially higher than previously thought.</p>

                <p>Four studies have previously estimated the prevalence of HF in long-term care, varying from 23% to 42%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C35">35</xref></sup> These studies were small (100–150 residents), with the exception of one large US study (nearly 3000 residents).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C28">28</xref></sup> Participants' mean age and gender distributions were similar to those of the cohort in this study, but definitions of HF and methods of diagnosis varied. Most studies relied on medical records to identify HF, with no details about operational definitions; only one prevalence study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C16">16</xref></sup> used echocardiography to assess and define the presence of LVSD. For comparison, the prevalence of undifferentiated HF based on medical records (a HF register) in our study was 32%.</p>
                <p>Recent evidence suggests potential prognostic benefits of ACE inhibitors for patients with HFpEF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C36">36</xref></sup> However, findings from this study indicate a tendency towards the use of diuretics for this group. The high incidence of HFpEF detected suggests the need for further research in this population, in order to establish clear guidelines for treatment;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C37">37</xref></sup> this is borne out in the latest ESC guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C38">38</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Implications of study findings</title>
                <p>The findings of this study have implications for practice internationally and challenge the current focus on diagnosis and treatment of undifferentiated HF in this population: high levels of misdiagnosis, missed diagnosis, and the lack of evidence-based treatment found in this study might be explained in part by this lack of differentiation. In this study, HF was diagnosed in almost a quarter (22.8%) of participants. The prevalence of LVSD was lower than anticipated, while rates of asymptomatic LVSD reflect international data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C20">20</xref></sup> However, the study found high rates of HFpEF: this is the first known prevalence study to report HFpEF and LVSD as clearly defined subgroupings of HF in this population. Half of the HF cases diagnosed within the study were previously undiagnosed, while three-quarters of previously recorded cases appeared misdiagnosed (not confirmed by the study). Baseline demographic characteristics of participants and non-participants were almost identical and reflect other long-term care populations in different socio-economic groups and different countries with alternative service provision models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C35">35</xref></sup> Findings are therefore likely to be generalizable nationally and internationally. The cohort did not include patients from ethnic minorities; these patients are much less commonly represented in care home populations for cultural reasons. Half of study-determined cases of LVSD (17 of 34) and 6 of 57 cases of HFpEF were previously recorded as undifferentiated HF in general practice records. Previous studies have limited their examination of care provision to records held by healthcare professionals outside of long-term care facilities. Our study supports international evidence that an accurate diagnosis may be missed in up to half of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C18">18</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C23">23</xref></sup> Difficulties diagnosing HF, organizing care across a wide range of care facilities, and allocating scarce health service resources can mean that important health needs of the older population in care are unmet. Based on these data, a review of current diagnostic processes within long-term care seems timely.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Long-term care facilities proved a challenging environment, which led to some limitations for this research. As a condition of research access into care facilities, staff determined in part which residents were invited to participate. Thus participation within the study was filtered at three levels, by staff, by relatives, and by the residents themselves. Limited cognitive capacity was common, and a consultee declaration was required in 66% of participants. While 35% of eligible (non-excluded) residents participated, individual reasons for non-participation could not be determined within the selection process. A comparison of participants and non-participants reveals similarity in age, gender, and ethnicity. Study assessment tools, including the AMTS and EQ-5D, were carefully selected to avoid lengthy assessment times. A very high proportion (399/405, 98.5%) of recruited participants completed assessments, pointing to the acceptability of the assessments, including portable echocardiography, and the generalizability of findings.</p>
                <p>There were difficulties assessing NYHA class and other symptoms and signs in this sedentary population; the lack of correlation between NYHA classification and LVSD severity, and between LVSD and HFpEF raises questions about its utility in the study population. Symptoms suggestive of HF such as oedema and dyspnoea were poor predictors of HF in this study. These were as common in participants without HF as in those with HF, and appear to have little diagnostic utility in this population. The routine introduction of portable echocardiography in care facilities might be essential to accurate diagnosis; this reflects the views of others about how best to achieve accurate diagnosis in older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFS165C12">12</xref></sup></p>
                <p>This study examined long-term care facility records which are used on a day to day basis (including prescriptions and co-morbidities) for this group and found them to be incomplete. Access to general practice and care facility records provided information about diagnoses and treatment but not the rationale behind decisions or relevant contraindications to medications; thus, the reasons for treatment decisions remain unknown.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In our large study of older people in long-term care, HF was diagnosed in almost a quarter of residents, two-thirds of whom had HFpEF. The prevalence of HF was substantially higher than in community populations. Symptoms and signs typically associated with HF such as leg oedema and breathlessness appear to have little clinical utility in this population. Findings suggest that this population is not routinely receiving evidence-based diagnosis; screening for HF was feasible and acceptable in this study. This challenges the current organization of diagnostic services for older people in care, which needs to be addressed at national and international levels.</p>
