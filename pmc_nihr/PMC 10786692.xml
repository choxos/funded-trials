                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p><underline>P</underline>hase 1 study of <underline>ATR</underline><underline>i</underline>nhibition al<underline>o</underline>ne or with radiation <underline>t</underline>herapy (PATRIOT) was a first-in-human phase I study of the oral ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) inhibitor ceralasertib (AZD6738) in advanced solid tumors.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>The primary objective was safety. Secondary objectives included assessment of antitumor responses and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies. Sixty-seven patients received 20–240 mg ceralasertib BD continuously or intermittently (14 of a 28-day cycle).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Intermittent dosing was better tolerated than continuous, which was associated with dose-limiting hematological toxicity. The recommended phase 2 dose of ceralasertib was 160 mg twice daily for 2 weeks in a 4-weekly cycle. Modulation of target and increased DNA damage were identified in tumor and surrogate PD. There were 5 (8%) confirmed partial responses (PRs) (40–240 mg BD), 34 (52%) stable disease (SD), including 1 unconfirmed PR, and 27 (41%) progressive disease. Durable responses were seen in tumors with loss of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) and DNA damage–response defects. Treatment-modulated tumor and systemic immune markers and responding tumors were more immune inflamed than nonresponding.</p>

              <p>ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is a critical kinase in the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Preclinical data have identified multiple cancer-related phenotypes sensitizing tumor cells to monotherapy ATR inhibition (ATRi) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Additionally, ATRi potentiates DNA-damaging therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and targeted therapies such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), making it a promising combination partner. Emerging evidence suggests ATRi may also modulate antitumor immune responses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>ATR is activated by diverse DNA lesions causing exposure of expanses of single-stranded DNA (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This replication stress is a frequent consequence of oncogene activation and impaired G1 checkpoint control and can be secondary to exogenous and endogenous sources of DNA damage and repair. Activated ATR phosphorylates targets, including checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), leading to stabilization of replication forks, activation of DNA repair, and activation of cell-cycle checkpoints (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Hence, monotherapy ATRi is predicted to affect tumors with high levels of replication stress, reduced DNA repair, or nonfunctional cell-cycle checkpoints, leading to accumulation of DNA damage and cell death.</p>
              <p>In preclinical models, ATRi kills tumor cells with loss of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and specific components of the DDR pathway (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) or those driven by oncogenes such as cyclin E and Myc (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Emerging data suggest that increasing the DNA damage load in cells could promote an antitumor immune response, for example, through interferogenic nucleic acid–sensing pathways (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Ceralasertib (AZD6738, AstraZeneca) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive ATR inhibitor, with antitumor activity demonstrated in multiple preclinical models (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We report the results of the <underline>p</underline>hase 1 study of <underline>ATR</underline>
<underline>i</underline>nhibition al<underline>o</underline>ne or with radiation <underline>t</underline>herapy (PATRIOT) study (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), a first-in-human dose-finding study that determined safety, tolerability, recommended dose and schedule, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and antitumor activity of ceralasertib monotherapy and explored potential predictive biomarkers of response to ATRi.</p>

                <title>Patient characteristics</title>
                <p>A total of 26 patients were enrolled and started ceralasertib in the dose-escalation phase across 3 centers between July 2014 and July 2016. In the dose-expansion phase, 43 patients were enrolled, of whom 41 received at least 1 dose of study drug (2 progressed prior to treatment start) between December 2016 and October 2020 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Patient and tumor characteristics are given in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Dose escalation and toxicity</title>
                <p>A total of 67 patients received a dose of ceralasertib and were evaluable for safety (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Twenty-six patients were treated with continuous dosing schedule during the dose-escalation phase, at doses from 20 to 240 mg BD (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). At the maximum administered dose of 240 mg BD, 3 of 6 patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). There were no DLTs at 160 mg BD and 1 at 80 mg BD (grade 3 [G3] thrombocytopenia with epistaxis, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI175369DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI175369DS1</ext-link>). The maximum tolerated dose was 160 mg BD. DLTs were thrombocytopenia (G4, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2 at 240 mg, G3 with epistaxis, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1 at 80 mg) and elevated amylase (G3, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1 at 240 mg, <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). Dose-expansion participants received 160 mg BD, either continuously or on a 2-week-on, 2-week-off schedule (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This was investigated after the development of toxicity beyond the DLT window in continuously dosed patients, leading to dose modifications. The intermittent schedule was chosen based on modeling of bone marrow recovery and was better tolerated, with incidence of G3 or greater anemia, 33% on continuous versus 9% on intermittent schedule, and 8% versus 0 % G3 leukopenia. Platelets and other hematological parameters were also more favorable with an intermittent schedule, recovering in the treatment break (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Six of 12 (50%) patients on the continuous schedule (including those in part A) versus 10 of 35 (29%) on the intermittent required dose reduction or interruption for toxicity. Four patients in the dose-escalation and 1 in the dose-expansion phase withdrew due to toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths. Four deaths occurred on study medication: 2 from disease progression, 1 from pneumonia, and 1 from adult respiratory syndrome assumed to be COVID-19 related (no leukopenia observed for the latter 2 participants). The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the intermittent schedule was 160 mg BD, although other doses were not evaluated on an intermittent schedule. Serious adverse events related to study treatment are shown in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>Ceralasertib was rapidly orally absorbed across all doses following single and multiple dose administration (median time to peak drug concentration [t<sub>max</sub>] 0.5 to 4 hours), with mean terminal elimination half-life of 5.3 to 7.7 hours at the 40 and 80 mg dose levels and 11.2 to 12.8 hours at the 160 and 240 mg dose levels. Following single dosing, ceralasertib exposure increased approximately proportionally with increasing doses between 80 to 240 mg (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). There was some evidence for accumulation after repeated dosing with higher predose and maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) levels at days 15 and 29 compared with day 0. Accumulation ratios based on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were between 1.6- and 2.2-fold higher (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Paired PBMCs were available for the majority of study participants. PBMCs were analyzed for p-Chk1, the downstream phosphorylation target of ATR. There was variation in p-Chk1 levels with treatment, but this was not consistent (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). p-Chk1 has been described as decreasing with ATRi in the presence of exogenous DNA damage (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and as increasing with ATRi reflective of replication stress and DNA damage (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Increased γH2AX positivity was observed in PBMCs after treatment at the RP2D for most subjects (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), likely reflecting DNA damage in proliferating bone marrow cells due to ATRi. Four paired tumor biopsies were available for IHC. These tumor biopsies showed upregulation of p-Rad50, a marker of ATM pathway activation, after treatment with ceralasertib (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D and E</xref>), as well as an increase in the number of γH2AX-positive cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, F and G</xref>).</p>

                <title>ATRi modulates the tumor-immune microenvironment</title>
                <p>We have previously shown preclinically that ATRi can affect the immune tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly when combined with radiotherapy (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In support of this, paired biopsies from a responding patient (40 mg BD, HNSCC, RECIST PR) showed an increase in immune-cell infiltration and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining on immune cells at 2 weeks (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
                <p>Therefore, we profiled, in detail, the immune response to ATRi in the peripheral blood of 8 participants (best responses of 5 SD, 2 progressive disease, and 1 nonevaluable [NE], all treated with 160 mg BD intermittent schedule) and in paired tumor biopsies (on treatment versus baseline) from 8 participants (5 SD, 2 progressive disease, and 1 NE). In the peripheral blood, we observed a reduction in Tregs and a trend toward increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to an increased CD8/Treg ratio after ATRi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). All were on an intermittent schedule, allowing assessment of changes after 2 weeks of ceralasertib (day 14) and a 2-week break (day 29). Proportions of T cell subsets changed after ATRi, with increased naive and central memory CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after ATRi (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, there were increased frequencies of memory CD4-TEMRA (effector memory reexpressing CD45RA) cells at day 29 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Detailed profiling revealed a reduction in PD-1–positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cell activation, with a trend toward increased NKG2A- and CD69-positive NK cells with ceralasertib, which normalized after the 2-week break (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The circulating myeloid compartment was also altered by ATRi, with a reduction in classical and intermediate monocytes and a change in circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), with increased granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSC) and reduced monocytic MDSCs (mMDSCs) after ceralasertib, again trending to baseline after treatment break (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Circulating cytokine levels were modulated on ceralasertib therapy, with an increase in CCL2 and decrease in CCL4 and CCL5 levels observed after 2 weeks of treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>

                <title>Responders to ATRi have inflamed tumors</title>
                <p>RNA-Seq of paired tumor biopsies was performed to assess differential gene expression after 2 weeks of ceralasertib treatment. Eight paired tumor biopsies were analyzed from 3 patients with PR, 4 with SD, and 1 NE, treated at various dose levels. Additional baseline samples were also available for 1 PR and 1 SD. When all samples were considered together, there were few differences in differential gene expression between baseline and on-treatment biopsies (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). However, when responders (PR) were compared with nonresponders (SD), there were marked differences in both baseline and on-treatment gene expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, B–E</xref>) with clustering of a number of differentially expressed genes according to response (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>). The most common genes that were differentially expressed were immune related, with adaptive, innate, and cytokine-related genes highly represented (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Pathway analysis of the most differentially expressed genes found that these were predominantly immune related (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enrichment of inflammatory response genes between baseline and on-treatment samples. When responders were compared with nonresponders, responding patients had more inflamed tumors both at baseline and on treatment, with significantly higher transcript levels for multiple immune-related genes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Expression of cell-type–specific genes was different between responders and nonresponders. Responders had a significantly higher expression of <italic toggle="yes">PTPRC</italic> (CD45) at baseline and on treatment than nonresponders; they also had an increase in <italic toggle="yes">ITGAX</italic> (CD11c) with treatment. Several other genes showed similar elevation in responders compared with nonresponders, but this did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). When gene expression data were used for cell-type deconvolution, some differences were observed with treatment, particularly in neutrophil and macrophage populations (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>).</p>
                <p>Baseline expression of macrophage, antigen-processing, and cytokine-related genes was generally higher in responding tumors (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A–C</xref>), with clustering by response. T and NK cell signatures were increased in responders (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>, A and B). When on-treatment biopsies were analyzed, there was clustering of responders in cytotoxicity (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) as well as cytokine and T cell signatures (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>, C and D). When plotted together, baseline and on-treatment samples tended to cluster by patient rather than by treatment, indicating a strong effect of baseline tumor inflammation on response. However, interferon-stimulated genes did appear to be upregulated in both baseline and on-treatment biopsies in responders (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>).</p>
                <p>We counted stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in H&amp;E-stained sections at baseline and for 4 paired samples (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Those patients who derived clinical benefit from ceralasertib, defined as PR or greater than 16 weeks on study, had a trend to higher numbers of TILs than those who did not (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Stromal TILs appeared to increase in a responding patient, but not in 3 nonresponders (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, E and G</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study is the largest to date, to our knowledge, of ATRi monotherapy. We have shown that ceralasertib monotherapy is tolerable, with predominantly hematological toxicities reduced by an intermittent schedule. Ceralasertib has predictable PK and plasma levels at the RP2D that compare favorably with observed preclinical monotherapy IC<sub>50</sub> values (ATR IC<sub>90</sub> of 0.666 μM and GI<sub>50</sub> of approximately 1 μM, comparable to between 270–420 ng/mL; refs. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We have shown target modulation in tumor tissue and increased DNA damage in surrogate tissues. We found durable clinical benefit in diverse tumor types, with evidence suggesting multiple potential biomarkers of response to ATRi, including loss of ARID1A, genomic instability, ATM/G1 pathway abnormalities, and high tumor inflammation. Conversely, we did not find clear signals that oncogene drivers sensitize to ATRi.</p>
              <p>Other published studies of ATRi have demonstrated similar, predominantly hematological, toxicities (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). ATRi has been combined with carboplatin (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and with paclitaxel (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) in early phase studies. The only previously published ATRi monotherapy study of BAY1895344, to our knowledge, also found durable responses in DDR-defective tumors — 4 of 11 patients with ATM protein loss or deleterious mutation and 1 with BRCA1 mutation had prolonged SD (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We identified several patients with ATM loss, all without objective responses. Responses were associated with other factors involved in G1 cell-cycle checkpoint control, including <italic toggle="yes">MRE11</italic>: loss will result in defective ATM activation, and a previous Chk1 inhibitor study observed a durable response associated with loss of another component of this complex (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Alternative ATR inhibitors are administered intravenously, and the duration of enzyme inhibition may differ between these 2 modes of administration. This may result in differential effects on efficacy and immunomodulation. As well as convenience, oral administration with an intermittent schedule allows bone marrow recovery between dosing periods and may allow more effective tailoring of dose exposure. The introduction of a modified schedule after emergence of toxicity outside the DLT window highlights a limitation of the 3+3 study design, and alternative designs may have been able to integrate such toxicities into dose-escalation decisions. Differences in efficacy between continuous, lower-dose and intermittent, higher-dose regimens should be examined in future studies.</p>
              <p>ARID1A is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which modulates the accessibility of DNA to transcription and repair machinery and is frequently mutated in cancers (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). ARID1A is important for ATR activation after double-stranded DNA breaks (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>); it helps topoisomerase-II prevent DNA tangling during mitosis (decatenation) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Without this activity, cells activate a G2/M decatenation checkpoint (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This is abolished by ATRi, leading to massive DNA damage (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). There are 2 main protein complexes in the SWI/SNF family: ARID1A, a critical component of the cBAF complex, and PBRM1 and ARID2, which are components of the PBAF complex (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Only ARID1A loss has been described preclinically as an ATRi sensitizer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but distinct functions of different SWI/SNF complexes are unclear (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). ARID1A loss is particularly common in ovarian clear cell and uterine carcinomas (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Of 2 patients with protein loss, 1 responded and 1 had SD, suggesting other factors may also be involved. Durable responses have been reported in patients with ARID1A loss in ongoing clinical studies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Other components, such as ARID2, may also be associated with clinical benefit, as suggested by the durable SD in a participant with <italic toggle="yes">ARID2</italic> loss.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, ceralasertib responders in this study had more inflamed tumors at baseline. We saw ATRi-induced changes in the immune TME. Prior studies have found that ATRi can cause marked modulation of the TME, thought to be secondary to increased DNA damage and activation of cytoplasmic DNA-sensing machinery (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Here, we have confirmed that treatment with ceralasertib modulates the immune response, with a more favorable CD8/Treg ratio, activation of NK cells, increased frequencies of effector memory RA CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and modulation of cytokines and circulating MDSCs as well as increases in TILs and inflammatory gene expression in responding patients. A recently published combination study of ceralasertib and immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) with durvalumab in advanced gastric cancer found a benefit in those patients with ATM loss or HR deficiency and found that responders had changes in their immune TME (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, the specific contribution of ATRi cannot be determined from those data. Our study of ATRi monotherapy allows an opportunity to observe the immunomodulatory effects of these agents without immunotherapies and provides the first data, to our knowledge, showing that ATRi (and other DDR inhibitors) may modulate the immune TME in their own right.</p>
              <p>The possibility that inflamed tumors may respond better to ATRi suggests that (a) these tumors have preexisting DDR defects that make them more inflamed and more likely to respond to ATRi (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), with the inflammation being a phenomenon independent of the response to ATRi; and/or (b) there is modulation of antitumor immunity by the administration of ATRi. Although we noted that there may be increased TILs in the tumors of patients who benefitted from ATRi, the difference was modest and more substantial changes were seen between responders and nonresponders on the gene expression level. Notably, ATRi seem to increase responses to ICB in patients who have previously failed ICB alone (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), adding further weight to our hypothesis that ATRis have independent immunomodulatory effects. We suggest immune analyses in ongoing ATRi studies focusing on both baseline immune status and changes with therapy to uncover rational immunotherapy partners for ATRi. In particular, the effect we have observed on NK and myeloid cells should be further investigated, particularly in light of preclinical data suggesting NK cells may have a role in ATRi responses (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>The results from this study provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that ceralasertib monotherapy is tolerable, with antitumor activity in a number of genetic backgrounds. We have recommended a 160 mg BD 2-week-on, 2-week-off dosing schedule for further evaluation. Phase I–III studies are proceeding as monotherapy or in combination with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02264678), <italic toggle="yes">ATM</italic>- or <italic toggle="yes">ARID1A</italic>-mutant tumors (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) (NCT03682289), DDR-deficient tumors (NCT03462342), and in combination with ICB (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) (NCT02664935, NCT05061134, NCT05450692). Tumor inflammation, ARID1A loss, and genome instability are among the most promising areas for future study.</p>

The secondary objectives were to identify a dose and schedule for further studies of ceralasertib and to assess antitumor responses and PK. Exploratory objectives included PD studies in tumor and normal tissue and the potential value of putative markers of sensitivity to single-agent ATRi, including measures of immune activation.</p>

                <p>Ceralasertib was administered orally, twice daily.</p>
                <p>For part A (dose escalation; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, A and B</xref>), the starting dose of 20 mg was selected based on animal toxicity studies. Dosing was continuous, and escalation used a modified Fibonacci method. Initial dose escalation was planned in single patient cohorts, changing to 3+3 design after the first grade-2 toxicity was seen. This occurred in the first patient. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients were assessed for toxicity during a DLT window of 28 days (1 cycle), with a nontolerable dose defined as 2 or more of 6 patients experiencing a DLT. DLT definitions are in the <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Methods</xref>.</p>
                <p>For part B, all patients received the RP2D as defined for part A. Part B allowed for different schedules (continuous/intermittent) to be assessed. Initially, a continuous dosing schedule was used for the first 6 patients. Subsequently, the safety review committee authorized the assessment of an intermittent schedule, 14 days on and 14 days off. Pretreatment biopsy was mandatory in part B. DNA-Seq of archival tumor material or review of external tumor sequencing was used to enrich for patients with putative genomic markers of sensitivity to ATRi, based on preclinical data, including oncogene amplification or driver mutation, ATM/G1 pathway defects (alteration in ATM, CHK2, or other components of the pathway causing G1 cell-cycle arrest after DNA damage), SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable, a chromatin-remodeling complex) pathway defect, genomic instability/homologous recombination deficit (HRD), or defect in a gene synthetically lethal with ATRi in published data (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 3</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study assessments.</title>
                <p>Patients were assessed weekly during cycle 1 and twice weekly thereafter, with safety assessments including blood hematology and biochemistry, physical examination, and toxicity scoring. Safety and tolerability were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Participants had ECG and urinalysis at the start of each cycle of treatment and assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction every 8 weeks. Response assessment imaging was conducted according to RECIST 1.1 within 28 days of starting ceralasertib and every 8 weeks.</p>

                <title>PKs.</title>
                <p>Intensive PK sampling in part A occurred after a single dose from predose up to 24 to 72 hours and again at day 15 and day 29 of continuous dosing. Participants fasted for 1 hour before and 2 hours after dosing for PK assessment. In part B, sampling coincided with day 15 PD assessments.

                <p>PD sampling took place at baseline (within 7 days prior to dosing) and between days 15 and 22 of dosing (day 14 for intermittent dosing cohorts). PD samples included PBMCs and tumor biopsies. PBMCs were analyzed by immunofluorescence for γ<sup>(S139)</sup>H2AX, p-<sup>(S345)</sup>Chk1, and total Chk1, as described in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Methods</xref>. Paired tumor biopsies were formalin fixed and analyzed for nuclear p-<sup>(S635)</sup>Rad50 and γH2AX by IHC.</p>

                <p>DNA-Seq of tumor and matched buffy coats was either by whole-exome sequencing or a custom-designed panel targeting all exons of genes of interest for 173 genes, including potential markers of sensitivity to ATRi. ACK-lysed whole blood or PBMCs were stained for flow cytometry using 8 multicolor panels. Plasma cytokines were assessed using the Bio-Plex Pro 27-Plex Panel (Bio-Rad).

                <title>Statistics.</title>
                <p>Simple descriptive statistical data analysis methods were used to summarize the data. Categorical data used numbers and percentages of patients in the categories/groups; where appropriate, 95% CIs were reported. Continuous nonnormally distributed data as assessed by visual inspection were described using median, IQR, and minimum and maximum values. Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA, version 17.0. Additional genomic and laboratory data were plotted and analyzed using Prism 8 (GraphPad), and ggplot2 in R version 4. For comparison of biomarkers at baseline and on treatment, paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests (2 tailed) or their nonparametric equivalents were used. When comparing fold-change data normalized to baseline, Wilcoxon’s signed rank test with a hypothetical median of 1 (no change from baseline) was used unless otherwise stated.</p>
