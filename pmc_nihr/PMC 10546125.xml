                  <p>People who are immunocompromised have a poor biological response to vaccinations. This study aims to determine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) if a 3-week pause in Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (BTKi) starting 1 week before delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster, improves vaccine immune response when compared with continuation of BTKi.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>An open-label, randomised controlled superiority trial will be conducted in haematology clinics in approximately 10 UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. The sample size is 120, randomised 1:1 to intervention and usual care arms. The primary outcome is anti-spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody level at 3 weeks post-SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination. Secondary outcomes are RBD antibody levels at 12 weeks postbooster vaccination, participant global assessments of disease activity, blood films, full blood count and lactate dehydrogenase levels, impact on quality of life, self-reported adherence with request to temporarily pause or continue BTKi, T cell response against spike protein and relative neutralising antibody titre against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants. Additionally, there will be an investigation of any effects in those given influenza vaccination contemporaneously versus COVID-19 alone.</p>
                  <p>The primary analysis will be performed on the as randomised groups (‘intention to treat’). The difference between the study arms in anti-spike-RBD antibody level will be estimated using a mixed effects regression model, allowing for repeated measures clustered within participants. The model will be adjusted for randomisation factor (first line or subsequent line of therapy), and prior infection status obtained from prerandomisation antinucleocapsid antibodies as fixed effects.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukaemia in many countries with 3800 new diagnoses each year in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> It is a chronic and currently incurable disease that demonstrates wide clinical heterogeneity.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> CLL occurs predominantly in older people and is rare below the age of 40 years. An estimated 31 900 people are living with CLL in the UK.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref></p>
              <p>People who are immunocompromised have a poor biological response to vaccinations.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> CLL is associated with underlying immune suppression. This can lead to considerable risk of infection with associated morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Infection remains the cause of death for around 25% of patients with CLL.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Most recently, people with CLL were shown to be susceptible to severe COVID-19 and have been prioritised for receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–17</xref> Unfortunately, vaccine responses in patients with CLL are impaired, particularly in those on current ‘targeted’ drugs (Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi)) that act to inhibit B cell receptor function. This class of drug is highly effective in suppressing the CLL tumour and is taken continuously in the long term.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref> New approaches to improve immune protection in patients with CLL are needed.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In this study, we seek to investigate if a pragmatic modification of CLL therapy could act to have an impact on vaccine induced immunity in this clinically vulnerable group.</p>
              <p>We hypothesise that people taking BTKi specifically Ibrutinib or Acalabrutinib for their CLL at the time of vaccination against COVID-19 (±an influenza vaccination) will have an impaired immune response to the vaccine dose, and therefore, lower production of anti-spike-receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibodies. We propose that a 3-week pause in BTKi treatment will improve the vaccine-specific immune response, without significant worsening of the control of the underlying CLL, when compared with continuation of treatment as usual. The design and delivery of this study was based around another trial that assessed pausing the immune suppressant drug methotrexate around the time of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with inflammatory disorders.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Pausing of CLL therapy is not uncommon and is recommended perioperatively due to the off-target effect of BTKi therapy on platelet function, which results in an increased bleeding risk.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Individuals can then experience a disease flare (which can include enlargement of lymph nodes and/or “B symptoms”, such as fever, sweats and weight loss); most are mild with symptoms such as a fever, rash or mild pain, but some can experience raised lymphocyte counts, enlarged spleens, and pain and changes seen in their blood biochemical profiles.</p>
              <p>Currently, no randomised trials have examined the impact of pausing BTKi therapy in patients with CLL for vaccine responsiveness. However, several observational studies have shown poorer responses in those taking BTKi and in addition, improvement in responses off therapy. In the CLL-VR study, following the second dose of vaccine, response rates were almost half in patients who took a BTKi compared with healthy controls.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Greenberger <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> studied responses to a third dose of COVID-19 vaccination in 25 patients with CLL, 13 of whom were treated with BTKi. Of these, 6/13 had an elevated anti-Spike response but 4 had stopped therapy and one was maintained on a low dose. In comparison, among those who continued therapy, five had a very weak response (&lt;5.2 U/mL) and two had an intermediate response (&lt;250 U/mL).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> These data suggest that both the proportion of responders and the strength of response increases in patients not taking BTKi therapy.</p>
              <p>Thus, the main aim of this study is to assess whether a 3-week pause in BTKi treatment, 1 week before and 2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster, improves the vaccine response in people with CLL, compared with continuing BTKi treatment as usual. Key secondary outcomes include any impact on quality of life (QoL) and disease activity.</p>

Searching of clinic records/hospital/pharmacy databases by the usual care team and identification during routine clinic visits will be the main methods of identification of potentially eligible patients. Social media and promotion of the study by national patient charities, will enable people taking BTKi for their CLL to directly approach their local study teams (or the study centre) to find out more about the study. People identified in the database reviews will be sent a study introductory letter, a participant information leaflet, and a reply slip to return if they are interested in taking part. For those identified directly in clinics, they will be offered the participant information leaflet and the study introductory letter if appropriate.</p>

                <p>This will be performed using a centralised validated computer randomisation programme through a secure (encrypted) web-based service, provided by the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU). Eligible participants will be randomised when they receive a date for their SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination. The randomisation system will stratify on whether the participant is on their first line or subsequent line of therapy for CLL to ensure balanced allocation across treatment groups. It will use a 1:1 ratio to allocate to either continuing taking BTKi as usual or to have a 3-week pause (1 week before and 2 weeks after their booster vaccination against COVID-19).</p>
                <p>Randomisation will be stratified on the line of CLL therapy being used as it has already been shown that the magnitude of immune response differs depending on the number of lines of therapy.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We have chosen not to stratify on past COVID-19 infection even though it is a strong modifier of serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as it is difficult to ascertain this reliably from participant self-report. We are also not stratifying on the first vaccine platform received (eg, adenovirus vector or mRNA) as we have previously shown that there is no difference in the magnitude of antibody response by vaccine platform in patients with CLL,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> nor on which BTKi therapy the participant is currently taking. However, we will obtain past infection status using anti-nucleocapsid antibodies and use this in the statistical analysis. Due to the nature of the intervention, the participants and the clinical team will not be blind to the allocated arm of the study. However, those analysing the study samples will be blinded to the participants’ allocation. Trial statisticians will not be blinded.</p>

                <title>Sample size and justification</title>
                <p>A total of 120 participants will be randomised. The sample size estimates were based on the anti-spike-RBD response after vaccination dose from a small observational study of patients with CLL who were either taking or not taking BTKi.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This suggested a large suppressive effect of BTKi (effect size of 0.9SD). However, anti-spike RBD response related to booster vaccination in CLL patients suggests a smaller though still large effect is more plausible (circa 0.7 SD). Conservatively, we have based the sample size calculation on an effect size of 0.65SD (detecting at least a 0.97 unit (log10 scale) higher antibody response in the BTKi suspension group with 90% statistical power at two-sided 5% significance level which requires data from 102 participants. This leads to 120 participants after allowing for 15% missing data. This calculation was performed using the Stata V.15.1 ‘power twomeans’ command.</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis: Full details will be presented in a separate statistical analysis plan which will be drafted and finalised and aimed to be published prior to the final analysis data lock and will receive review and input from the trial steering committee (TSC) and data monitoring committee. The principal analysis will be performed on the as randomised (‘intention-to-treat’) population, analysing participants with available outcome data in their randomised groups, regardless of adherence. The study will be reported in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>
                <p>The primary objective of the statistical analysis will be to identify if a temporary 3-week pausing of BTKi around the time of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 increases the anti-spike-RBD antibody at 3 weeks postvaccine compared with continuing BTKi treatment without interruption. The anti-spike-RBD antibody levels will be summarised descriptively at baseline and 3 and 12 weeks post-COVID-19 booster vaccination follow-up. The differences between the study arms will be estimated using a mixed effects regression model, allowing for repeated measures clustered within participants. The model will be adjusted for a randomisation factor (first line or subsequent line of therapy), and prior infection status obtained from prevaccination antinucleocapsid antibodies, as fixed effects. A treatment by time interaction will be included. The model is anticipated to use an unstructured covariance matrix, and maximum likelihood estimation. Data will be log-transformed prior to analysis, as appropriate. The adjusted mean difference between the groups will be presented, together with 95% CI and p values. The regression model will be simplified (eg, linear regression) if the planned model does not converge.</p>
                <p>Supplemental analyses will explore the time effect between the last COVID-19 vaccination dose and the dose given in IMPROVE. The effect of non-compliance to the randomised intervention will be explored using per-protocol analyses.</p>
                <p>The same model as for the primary outcome will be used to analyse the 12-week PVB anti-spike-RBD antibody outcome. Similar supportive analyses as planned for the primary outcome will be performed for 12 weeks PVB data. Overall, 50% and 90% neutralisation by Wuhan and VOC along with, T cell spike response by subtype (spike for Wuhan and VOC, and nucleocapsid and membrane), will be analysed in a similar manner to anti-spike RBD antibody outcome. Other secondary outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear models for binary and continuous data, as appropriate, with model adjustment as described above.</p>
                <p>The number of SAEs will be presented by treatment arm. The proportion of participants with at least one SAE will be compared. Details of the events will be presented, together with information on the timing of the events from randomisation.</p>

Discussion with a small group (six people) of people with CLL confirmed the trial question is of considerable relevance to the CLL community and advised on study design. A Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representative (LD) is a coapplicant on the grant, a member of the trial management group, and a non-independent member of the TSC. A patient advisory group has been convened and will meet regularly throughout the study. The role of this group is to work with the IMPROVE study team to ensure that the perspective of people living with CLL is considered during the design, conduct and reporting of the research. This will be achieved through the group helping to raise awareness of the study, reviewing documents, inputting on any issues requested by the trial team, and advising on dissemination of the study results to the CLL community.</p>

              <p>The IMPROVE study is designed to investigate in those with CLL on BTKi therapy for more than 1 year if a 3-week pause in therapy, compared with continuing as usual with BTKi therapy, improves immune responses to COVID-19 booster vaccination. It will assess the quantitative and qualitative humoral response, to ancestral B.1 virus and the latest variant of concern. In addition, cellular immunity will be assessed through T cell responses to ancestral B.1 and omicron variant peptide pools to give a comprehensive assessment of the adapted immune response. It is generally accepted that both binding and neutralising antibodies are correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic disease, and the contribution of cellular immunity can be important in protection from severe disease among those that are immunocompromised. The study will generate data that will be generalisable for patients taking one of the currently licensed BTKi in the UK and may be applicable to patients taking this therapy for other conditions, where treatment can be safely interrupted. Treatment interruption can be associated with disease flare, and as such, data outcomes of this will be collected over the course of the study in order for the risk/benefit to be assessed to inform future clinical decision-making.</p>
              <p>As this study focuses on patients with CLL, we have chosen to use the internationally validated EORTC QLQ-CLL17.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This will identify symptom burden, physical condition/fatigue and worries/fears on health and functioning and allow direct comparison with other published data. Non-blinding of the participants is a potential limitation to the findings, although concordance with study arm will be assessed through the 3-week CRF. Importantly, laboratory personnel will be blinded to the allocation for objective primary and secondary endpoints and, as such, the results should provide clarity for patients and clinicians around any beneficial impact on immunity of pausing BTKi therapy around the time of vaccination. The published results will help to inform national and international treatment guidance.</p>
