                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes in first line cutaneous melanoma. However, there is a high unmet need for patients who progress on these therapies and combination therapies are being explored to improve outcomes. Tebentafusp is a first-in-class gp100×CD3 ImmTAC bispecific that demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit (HR 0.51) in metastatic uveal melanoma despite a modest overall response rate of 9%. This phase 1b trial evaluated the safety and initial efficacy of tebentafusp in combination with durvalumab (anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1)) and/or tremelimumab (anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) in patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (mCM), the majority of whom progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

                  <p>In this open-label, multicenter, phase 1b, dose-escalation trial, HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with mCM received weekly intravenous tebentafusp with increasing monthly doses of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab starting day 15 of each cycle. The primary objective was to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose for each combination. Efficacy analyses were performed in all tebentafusp with durvalumab±tremelimumab treated patients with a sensitivity analysis in those who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>85 patients were assigned to receive tebentafusp in combination with durvalumab (n=43), tremelimumab (n=13), or durvalumab and tremelimumab (n=29). Patients were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy, including 76 (89%) who received prior anti-PD(L)1. Maximum target doses of tebentafusp (68 mcg) alone or in combination with durvalumab (20 mg/kg) and tremelimumab (1 mg/kg) were tolerated; MTD was not formally identified for any arm. Adverse event profile was consistent with each individual therapy and there were no new safety signals nor treatment-related deaths. In the efficacy subset (n=72), the response rate was 14%, tumor shrinkage rate was 41% and 1-year OS rate was 76% (95% CI: 70% to 81%). The 1-year OS for triplet combination (79%; 95% CI: 71% to 86%) was similar to tebentafusp plus durvalumab (74%; 95% CI: 67% to 80%).</p>

                  <p>At maximum target doses, the safety of tebentafusp with checkpoint inhibitors was consistent with safety of each individual therapy. Tebentafusp with durvalumab demonstrated promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients with mCM, including those who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most aggressive skin cancer and the cause of the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With an estimated 106,110 new cases in 2021,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the incidence of CM is increasing dramatically, especially in men.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref> Following primary tumor excision, up to one-third of patients go on to develop metastatic disease.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Currently available therapies for the first-line treatment of metastatic cutaneous melanoma (mCM) include anti-programmed death 1 (PD1) monotherapies (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or anti-PD1 in combination with a cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) or lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) inhibitor.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition is used for tumors harboring a <italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic>
<sup>V600</sup> mutation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In pivotal studies, 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were ~43% for anti-PD1 monotherapy, 52% for combination anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4, and ~33% for combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref> For patients who progress on these therapies, there are few options beyond the (re)use of anti-PD1 or, in the event of specific gene aberrations (<italic toggle="yes">BRAF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KIT</italic> mutations), targeted therapies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In these patients, prognosis is poor, with recent studies in patients with anti-PD(L)1-resistant/refractory mCM reporting 1-year OS rates of ~55% and median OS of 14 months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>
</p>
              <p>The success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in CM relies on an active immune inhibitory pathway including the PD1/PDL1 axis (ie, expression of PD1 by tumor infiltrating T cells together with high PDL1 expression by tumor cells), and thus requires the presence of an intratumoral T cell infiltrate which has been associated with the high mutational burden and immunogenicity of this particular tumor type.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> However, two-thirds of patients reveal either a primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD(L)1 therapy with many failing to recruit tumor-reactive T cells that mediate tumor cell killing. Consequently, new therapeutic approaches and combinations that recruit effector T cells into the tumor may overcome resistance to checkpoint blockade.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 23</xref>
</p>
              <p>Glycoprotein of 100 kDa (gp100), a melanocyte-associated antigen, is an intracellular protein overexpressed in melanoma<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> but with limited expression in normal cells.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) Against Cancer) molecules are a unique class of bispecific proteins that use a TCR for the effective targeting of any protein, including cancer specific intracellular targets, that is, processed and presented as peptide on the cell surface in the context of HLA. Tebentafusp, a gp100×CD3 bispecific ImmTAC, is a fusion protein comprizing a soluble affinity-enhanced HLA-A*02:01-restricted TCR specific for the gp100 peptide, YLEPGPVTA, fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment. Once bound to its target peptide-HLA, these ImmTAC bispecifics can redirect and activate polyclonal CD3+T cells to mediate target cell lysis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 27</xref>
</p>
              <p>In a randomized, phase 3 trial in adult HLA-A*02:01 patients with previously untreated metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM; NCT03070392), tebentafusp significantly prolonged OS in comparison to investigator’s choice of therapy (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.71; p&lt;0.0001).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> One remarkable observation was the disconnect between low Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) response, 9%, and the 49% improvement in OS. The OS benefit appears to be driven by prolonged stable disease including among the 39% of patients with any tumor shrinkage, and even from patients with apparent progressive disease (PD) by radiographic assessment.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p>
              <p>Tebentafusp was well tolerated with most patients experiencing manageable cytokine-mediated (eg, cytokine release syndrome) or skin-related adverse events (AEs) (eg, rash, pruritus) consistent with the mechanism of action (gp100 is expressed in skin melanocytes). The first-in-human trial (NCT01211262) of tebentafusp monotherapy in advanced metastatic melanoma (mostly cutaneous),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> showed a 1-year OS of ~74% in anti-PD(L)1 therapy-naïve patients.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In that study, serial tumor biopsies showed an increase in CD3+T cells in both the tumor and the skin, which correlated with increased expression of PDL1 and LAG3 in the tumor. Tebentafusp treatment was also associated with an increase in serum cytokines and chemokines and T-cell trafficking from the blood.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 30</xref>
</p>
              <p>Based on their distinct and complementary mechanisms of action and toxicity profile, a combination of tebentafusp with checkpoint inhibitors could overcome resistance and loss of response to PD(L)1 therapy. Here we present proof of concept for the combination of tebentafusp with immune checkpoint inhibitor and complete safety and efficacy results of the phase 1b portion of study IMCgp100-201 in patients who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1.</p>

                <p>The primary objectives of the phase 1b study were to identify the MTD and RP2D of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab when administered with tebentafusp. Secondary objectives of the study were characterization of the safety and tolerability of tebentafusp when administered in combination with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab, and to assess the preliminary antitumor efficacy of tebentafusp in combination with durvalumab and/or tremelimumab.</p>
                <p>Investigator-reported AEs, collected from C1D1 up to the safety follow-up visit (ie, 30 days after the last dose of study drug), were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, V.23.1 and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03. DLTs were defined as any AE of CTCAE Grade ≥3 occurring during the DLT observation period with selected exceptions (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S2</xref>), for which relationship to study treatment cannot be ruled out. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level with an observed incidence of DLTs in &lt;33% of patients in the cohort, and the RP2D was defined as the dose level selected for testing in phase 2 based on all available safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data.</p>
                <p>Efficacy was evaluated using RECIST V.1.1 for clinical response and time-to-event estimates of OS. CT/MRI scans were performed at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 (±1 week), then every 12 weeks (±1 week) until PD or withdrawal. Tumor shrinkage was based on observing a decrease in the sum of the longest diameters for all target lesions while on treatment relative to baseline measurements regardless of the appearance of new lesions. Patients were followed for survival every 3 months until death or the end of the study.</p>

Among patients enrolled, 81 (95%) had CM and 4 (5%) had mucosal melanoma. The median age was 58 (range 28–79), 76% were ECOG 0, and 38% had baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Thirty-three (39%) patients had mutated BRAF, of whom 30 had <italic toggle="yes">BRAFV600</italic> mutations and 25 had received prior BRAF/MEK inhibitors (7 single agents and 18 combinations). The median number of prior metastatic lines of therapy was 3 (range 1–4) with nearly all patients (76/85 (89%)) receiving prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy; of whom 80% also received prior ipilimumab. Of the 72 patients who were assigned to receive tebentafusp and durvalumab±tremelimumab (Arms 1 and 3), 63 received prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy, of which 58 were reported as having discontinued prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy due to disease progression. Thirty-four of these 58 patients (59%) were documented as relapsed (best overall response (BOR)=stable disease (SD)/partial response (PR)/complete response (CR)) and 19/58 (33%) as primary refractory (BOR=PD) to prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy.</p>

Nine patients overall were not included due to non-measurable disease at baseline or no evaluable post-baseline target lesion scans. Evaluable post-baseline scans must be on or prior to disease progression or starting subsequent alternative cancer therapy to be considered. (B) Waterfall plot showing the best change in tumor size (n=63). Forty-one per cent of patients had tumor reduction at any time. Tumor size was measured as the sum of longest diameters or short axis of the target lesions according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors V.1.1 by investigator assessment. Best percent change in target lesion size was the maximum percent reduction from baseline or the minimum percent increase from baseline (in the absence of a reduction), up until disease progression or starting subsequent alternative cancer therapy. Tumor shrinkage is shown regardless of whether new lesions identified. Reference lines at 20% and −30% mark target lesion response criteria for disease progression (PD), partial response (PR), respectively. CR, complete response; SD, stable disease.</p>

                <p>In order to compare these results to recent clinical trials, a sensitivity analysis was limited to patients with documented progression on prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy (n=58). In this subset of patients, the overall response rate was 10%. Five patients had a confirmed PR (three in Arm 1 and two in Arm 3), with a median duration of response of 11.8 months (range 5.6–34.5 months with the response of one patient ongoing at 34.5 months at time of data cut-off). Thirty-seven per cent of those evaluable (19/52) had tumor shrinkage as their best overall change in tumor size (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S2</xref>). Some patients had tumor shrinkage that was durable despite the appearance of new lesions. Sustained durable tumor shrinkage was seen both in patients who were primary refractory, defined as best response of PD to prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy, or relapsed, defined as best response of SD, PR, or CR followed by disease progression while on prior anti-PD(L)1 (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S3</xref>).</p>
                <p>The OS in the sensitivity analysis, restricted to patients who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1, was similar to that of the efficacy evaluable patients. The overall 1-year and 2-year OS rates were 75% (95% CI: 70% to 87%) and 32% (95% CI: 23% to 40%), respectively, and were similar between treatment arms (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>). OS with tebentafusp and durvalumab±tremelimumab was not influenced by the timing of prior anti-PD(L)1 relative to the start of tebentafusp as patients receiving anti-PD(L)1 therapy immediately prior to enrollment (median 2 months earlier) had the same 1-year OS rate of 75% as those patients who had their most recent anti-PD(L)1 more remotely (median 9 months earlier) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S4</xref>). Intriguingly, even patients with tumor increase as best change in tumor size from baseline had promising 1-year OS of 58% (31/52).</p>

                    <p>Overall survival in patients who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1. (A) Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS) for patients who progressed on prior anti-PD(L)1 therapy treated with tebentafusp in combination with durvalumab (Arm 1; n=34; blue) or durvalumab and tremelimumab (Arm 3; n=24; green). Events are deaths due to any cause. Patients not known to have died at the time of analysis are censored. For patients receiving combination tebentafusp and durvalumab (Arm 1), the median OS was 18.4 (95% CI: 13.1 to 22.3) months with a 1-year OS rate of 73% (95% CI: 65% to 80%). For patients receiving triplet therapy (Arm 3), the median OS was 17.8 (95% CI: 14.6 to 21.7) months with a 1-year OS rate of 78% (95% CI: 70% to 87%). (B) Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS for patients who had a best response of progressive disease while on prior anti-PD(L)1 (refractory; n=19; blue) or had a best response of either stable disease (n=17) or partial response/complete response (n=17) and then had disease progression on prior anti-PD(L)1 (relapsed n=34; red). For patients refractory to prior anti-PD(L)1, the median OS was 18.4 (95% CI: 7.2 to 28.6) months with a 1-year OS rate of 60% (95% CI: 49% to 72%). For patients relapsed on anti-PD(L)1, the median OS was 17.7 (95% CI: 15.4 to 21.7) months with a 1-year OS rate of 82% (95% CI: 75% to 89%).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This phase 1 study indicates that tebentafusp can be safely combined with anti-PD(L)1 and/or anti-CTLA4 therapy and provides the first evidence of efficacy for this combination therapy. AEs were generally mild-to-moderate and consistent with the individual components of each arm. No new safety concerns were identiﬁed with either combination regimen.</p>
              <p>OS has been demonstrated as the best endpoint to capture benefit from tebentafusp in prior uveal melanoma studies.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 31</xref> The combination of tebentafusp and durvalumab (± tremelimumab) led to promising overall 1-year and 2-year OS rates of 76% and 34% in this heavily pretreated cohort of patients. Clinical benefit was seen in patients with melanoma that was primary refractory to prior anti-PD(L)1 as well as those who relapsed on prior PD(L)1 therapy.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, the efficacy endpoints observed in this tebentafusp mCM study matched those observed in the phase 3 study of tebentafusp in mUM.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The 1-year OS rates were both approximately 75%. The RECIST response rates were roughly the same, both with promising durability, and approximately 40% of patients in both studies had any tumor shrinkage. In the mUM study, benefit was observed even in patients with an increase in the size of the index lesions.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In this study, a similar percentage of patients had an increase in their tumor burden and the 1-year OS in these patients was similar to that from the phase 3 mUM study, approximately 60%.</p>
              <p>While anti-PD1 with or without anti-CTLA4 has shown clear survival benefit in first line, there is a high unmet need for patients who progress on these therapies. Retrospective studies of ICI reuse following progression have reported 1 years OS rates of 38–58%, with differences in baseline characteristics across these studies (eg, baseline LDH&gt;ULN range 26–66%) not correlated with OS benefit.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 32 33</xref> A few other treatments have been tested in phase 1/2 trials in patients who progressed on prior anti-PD1 regimens with varying response rates although the 1-year OS rates are around 55% which is lower than the 76% reported in this study. For example, the combination of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab led to a response rate of 21% with a response duration of 8 months,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> but the 1-year OS was 55%. Adoptive T cell transfer where tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are extracted from the tumor and expanded ex vivo has shown response rates of up to 36% and durable remission in some patients with advanced melanoma.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> However, the 1-year OS rate is also approximately 55%.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Furthermore, patients must undergo non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to infusion and receive high dose interleukin-2, which together has significant associated toxicity,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> thus limiting patient eligibility. Consequently, TIL therapy will only be possible to use in a small subset of fit patients and is presently only available in a limited number of centers worldwide.</p>
              <p>T cell engaging bispecifics have a number of advantages over cell therapies as they are ‘off-the-shelf’ molecules with potential for repeat dosing and tunable serum kinetics, they have the ability to activate a polyclonal T cell response with potential for triggering natural secondary responses<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and, as shown in this study, they can be combined with other therapies. Antibody-based bispecifics like blinatumomab (CD19×CD3) that use antibody fragments as both targeting and effector domains are limited to targeting cell surface antigens which are also highly expressed on normal cells and, to date, have only shown benefit in liquid tumors.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> By contrast, ImmTAC bispecifics like tebentafusp use a TCR as targeting domain providing access to intracellular cancer specific/enriched proteins (eg, gp100, cancer testis antigens) that are processed and presented as peptides on the cell surface by HLA. Since most cancer specific antigens are intracellular and thus not accessible by antibodies, four new TCR bispecifics are currently in clinical development for treatment of various solid tumors.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Tebentafusp can be safely combined with anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 in heavily pretreated patients with mCM. Tebentafusp with anti-PDL1 demonstrated promising OS compared with other investigational therapies in a similar mCM population. These data provide rationale for a randomized study of tebentafusp with or without anti-PD1 versus standard of care in mCM.</p>
