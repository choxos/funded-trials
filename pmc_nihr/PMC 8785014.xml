                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) effectively prevent pneumococcal disease but the global impact of pneumococcal vaccination is hampered by the cost of PCV. The relevance and feasibility of trials of reduced dose schedules is greatest in middle- and low-income countries, such as The Gambia, where PCV has been introduced with good disease control but where transmission of vaccine-type pneumococci persists. We are conducting a large cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, field trial of an alternative reduced dose schedule of PCV compared to the standard schedule, the PVS trial.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PVS is a prospective, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, real-world field trial of an alternative schedule of one dose of PCV scheduled at age 6 weeks with a booster dose at age 9 months (i.e. the alternative ‘1 + 1’ schedule) compared to the standard schedule of three primary doses scheduled at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age (i.e. the standard ‘3 + 0’ schedule). The intervention will be delivered for 4 years. The primary endpoint is the population-level prevalence of nasopharyngeal vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage in children aged 2 weeks to 59 months with clinical pneumonia in year 4 of the trial. Participants and field staff are not masked to group allocation while measurement of the laboratory endpoint will be masked. Sixty-eight geographic population clusters have been randomly allocated, in a 1:1 ratio, to each schedule and all resident infants are eligible for enrolment. All resident children less than 5 years of age are under continuous surveillance for clinical safety endpoints measured at 11 health facilities; invasive pneumococcal disease, radiological pneumonia, clinical pneumonia, and hospitalisations. Secondary endpoints include the population-level prevalence of nasopharyngeal vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage in years 2 and 4 and vaccine-type carriage prevalence in unimmunised infants aged 6–12 weeks in year 4. The trial includes components of mathematical modelling, health economics, and health systems research.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Analysis will account for potential non-independence of measurements by cluster, comparing the population-level impact of the two schedules with interpretation at the individual level. The non-inferiority margin is informed by the ‘acceptable loss of effect’ of the alternative compared to the standard schedule. The secondary endpoints will provide substantial evidence to support the interpretation of the primary endpoint. PVS will evaluate the effect of transition from a standard 3+ 0 schedule to an alternative 1 + 1 schedule in a setting of high pneumococcal transmission. The results of PVS will inform global decision-making concerning the use of reduced-dose PCV schedules.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par44">Despite the pneumococcus causing more childhood deaths than any single pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], global control of pneumococcal disease is hampered by the cost of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). In addition to the relatively high cost of several new vaccines that have recently been introduced in many low-income countries, expanded programmes on immunisation (EPI) face the additional challenge of schedules with increasing numbers of doses. Reducing the cost and complexity of EPI schedules would improve the flexibility, acceptability and sustainability of immunisation programmes.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Low-income countries receive subsidised PCV through the GAVI Alliance, providing a co-payment of 0.15–0.30 USD per dose (increasing 15% per year in ‘intermediate’ countries) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, when countries’ Gross National Income per capita exceeds the World Bank ‘low-income’ threshold of ~ 1500 USD, they begin to transition from GAVI support. During transition, co-payments increase each year for 5 years to a final price set under the GAVI Advance Market Commitment (2.00–2.90 USD per dose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. GAVI expenditure on PCV represents approximately half of its vaccine budget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The importance of the cost of PCV was evident in The Gambia where its introduction, at 0.2 USD per dose, increased the national cost of the EPI programme by one third, with vaccine representing 91% of the total cost of introducing PCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, a major determinant of the sustainability of pneumococcal vaccination in low- and middle-income countries is vaccine cost. Middle-income countries, ineligible for GAVI support, experience many child deaths due to pneumococcus but cost has precluded many from introducing PCV.</p>
                <p id="Par46">EPI programmes in low- and middle-income countries are becoming more complicated and costly with the introduction of new vaccines. The addition of vaccines such as PCV, rotavirus vaccine, injectable polio vaccine, meningococcal group A conjugate, human papillomavirus vaccine, and typhoid conjugate challenges the implementation, acceptance, cold-chain capacity, and sustainability of EPIs. The difficulty of introducing such new vaccines has its biggest impact in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of disease is greatest but resources are scarce.</p>
                <p id="Par47">The Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (MRCG at LSHTM) has a long history investigating the burden of pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal vaccination. In 2000–2004, a trial of a 9-valent PCV (PCV9) was conducted in Central and Upper River Regions (CRR and URR) of The Gambia. Vaccine efficacy in children aged 3–29 months was 37% against radiological pneumonia, 77% against vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and 16% against all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2009, The Gambia introduced PCV7 into the routine EPI using a three-dose schedule without a booster dose (i.e. a ‘3 + 0’ schedule). In 2011, PCV7 was replaced by PCV13. The Pneumococcal Surveillance Project (PSP) has documented the impact of PCV13 in the Basse Health &amp; Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS) in rural Gambia. Four to five years after the introduction of PCV7/13 the incidence of VT IPD had declined by 82%, with a 24% reduction in radiological pneumonia, and 61% reduction in severe hypoxic pneumonia in children aged 2–59 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Eight years after the introduction of PCV7/13 the incidence of VT IPD in the 2–59 month age group has declined by 92% and radiological pneumonia has declined by 33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Before the introduction of PCV, PSP detected an average of 35 annual cases of VT IPD among children aged 2–59 months. In 2016, we detected six cases of VT IPD, and in 2017, we detected three. In 2016/2017, we detected zero cases of VT IPD among children in the first year of life. These data indicate that the introduction of PCV7/13 has now controlled VT IPD.</p>
                <p id="Par48">It is now evident that following the introduction of PCV13, herd protection has developed in The Gambia. The annual count of VT IPD in older children in PSP was six to ten before the introduction of PCV13 in 2011. Following the introduction of PCV13 the annual case counts in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were four, one, and zero, respectively. In the 5–14 year age group, IPD incidence declined by 69% (95%CI, − 28–91%) and radiological pneumonia by 27% (95%CI, − 5–49%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar findings of the direct and herd effect of PCV are evident in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">The prevalence of nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of PCV13 VT in the BHDSS area before the introduction of vaccine was 47% in the under-5-year age group. In 2015 and 2017, the prevalence of vaccine types was 15% and 17%, respectively (author’s own data). The downward trajectory of VT prevalence from 2009 to 2015 and 2017 suggests that the introduction of PCV13 has substantially reduced the prevalence of VT carriage. However, it is evident that transmission of VT pneumococci continues in the population. Ongoing circulation of VT pneumococci following the introduction of PCV is also observed in Kenya with a persisting 9% prevalence in young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and particularly so in Malawi with 17% prevalence in 3–5-year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Kenya and Malawi, like The Gambia, have high rates of pneumococcal transmission and all three countries use the standard 3 + 0 schedule.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Mathematical models can help to understand pneumococcal transmission under different vaccination scenarios. Such models may benefit from inputs on population contact patterns. Evidence suggests that interpersonal physical contact frequency is associated with pneumococcal carriage and that older unvaccinated children and larger household sizes, typical in low-income countries, may drive pneumococcal transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Children aged 1–5 years are large contributors to pneumococcal transmission from increased physical contacts and high rates of carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Interpersonal contact patterns and their relationship to pneumococcal carriage will be important inputs into modelling the impact of reduced dose schedules of PCV in high transmission settings.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The Gambian EPI schedule currently includes birth doses of BCG, hepatitis B and oral polio vaccine (OPV); visits at 2 and 3 months of age when OPV, pentavalent, rotavirus and PCV13 vaccines are scheduled; a visit at 4 months of age when OPV, injectable polio (IPV), pentavalent, rotavirus and PCV13 vaccines are scheduled; a visit at 9 months of age when measles-rubella and yellow fever vaccines are scheduled; conjugate meningococcal group A vaccine scheduled at 12 months of age was introduced in 2018; at 18 months of age OPV and measles-rubella vaccines are scheduled. Human papilloma virus vaccine delivered to school-age girls was introduced in 2020. In the event that polio is eradicated then OPV will be phased out and be replaced by IPV. The EPI is also considering the introduction of a conjugate typhoid vaccine. Thus, in recent years, and in the anticipated future, the EPI schedule has introduced and may introduce additional injectable antigens.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Several studies indicate that immunological priming for an optimal PCV booster dose response may be more effective with fewer primary doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, the immunological response to a booster dose following a single priming dose may reduce VT acquisition to a greater degree than following the standard 3 + 0 schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As a result, a schedule with one primary dose and a later booster dose, that is a 1 + 1 schedule, may induce greater herd protection than the 3+ 0 schedule. An accompanying paper describes the protocol for a trial in which we are investigating the immunogenicity of the comparator schedules, testing whether the concentration of VT serotype-specific IgG is greater in the 1 + 1 compared to the 3 + 0 group at 18 months of age.</p>
                <p id="Par53">This trial joins a global initiative to generate evidence concerning reduced dose schedules for PCV. WHO is engaged with this initiative having held a consultative meeting in February 2016. Studies investigating reduced dose schedules for PCV are underway in South Africa, Vietnam, India, and the UK. The UK introduced the 1 + 1 schedule nationwide in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our trial in The Gambia is critical to provide evidence from a typical African setting.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par54">Given the control of VT IPD by routine immunisation, we aim to compare the community-level impact of an alternative PCV schedule (doses scheduled at ages 6 weeks and 9 months) with the standard schedule (doses scheduled at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks). The authors’ meta-analysis of observational studies found that one infant dose of PCV was around 65% effective against VT IPD, less than that of two or three doses (85% to 90%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The median age at vaccination in the analysed observational studies was greater than 2 months and so this analysis is likely to overestimate the efficacy of one dose given at 6 weeks of age. In the USA, the effectiveness against VT IPD of one dose given before the age of 7 months was 84% in the 6 months after vaccination but effectiveness then waned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In Fiji and The Gambia, one dose of PCV at 2 or 3 months of age significantly reduced carriage of VT pneumococci at 9 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A Dutch study showed that following two doses of PCV7 at the ages of 2 and 4 months, a booster dose at 11 months prevented VT carriage in the 2nd year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">Data from the UK trial show that the immunogenicity of the PCV booster dose using a 1+ 1 schedule was equivalent to, or superior to, a 2+ 1 schedule for nine of the 13 serotypes in PCV13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Of importance to the Gambian setting, where serotypes 1 and 14 have been the most common serotypes causing IPD, IgG responses to those serotypes following the booster dose were superior in the 1+ 1 group. Almost all infants in both the 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 groups had IgG responses above the protective titre of 0.35 μl/ml, for all serotypes except serotype 3, for which fewer reached protective thresholds in both schedules. Geometric mean IgG concentrations following the primary series were higher in the 2+ 1 schedule, although differential time from vaccination to sampling in the two groups biased results towards lower levels in the 1+ 1 group. There is also suggestive clinical evidence that herd protection following the use of a 2+ 1 schedule is greater than with a 3 + 0 schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">The duration of protection of PCV is poorly defined but the potential for greater antibody persistence following a booster dose compared to doses in early infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] suggests that protection may be more long-lived when a booster dose is given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Even though PCV has proven efficacious against serotype 1 in young African children, serotype 1 continues to cause epidemic meningitis in the African meningitis belt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. There is a strong rationale to test, in our epidemiological setting, whether a 1 + 1 schedule will provide an overall non-inferior programmatic effect compared to the 3 + 0 schedule. It is important to note that as the time course after the introduction of a vaccine extends, the direct effect of vaccination becomes less important and herd protection assumes an increasingly important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par57">Testing the non-inferiority of the 1+ 1 compared to 3+ 0 schedule will provide necessary evidence to assist decision-makers in considerations of reduced dose schedules. Reducing the number of PCV doses in EPI schedules will impact on multiple elements of the challenges posed by this vaccine; reducing the costs to countries and GAVI, reducing the number of injections in schedules and providing greater flexibility for the inclusion of other vaccines, reducing staff time and cold-chain requirements, and ultimately making EPI programmes more acceptable and sustainable. If countries can safely transition to 1 + 1 schedules the global uptake of PCV should accelerate with greater and more sustainable reductions in the pneumococcal disease.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par58">The objective of the PVS trial is to generate evidence to inform global and national policy concerning the use of an alternative PCV schedule with one priming and one booster dose compared to the standard schedule of three primary doses to control pneumococcal carriage and disease. Exploratory measures will inform the time course of development of the differential effects of the two schedules.</p>
                <p id="Par59">We hypothesise that following the control of VT IPD by routine immunisation with three doses of PCV13, the community-level impact of the alternative schedule (doses scheduled at ages 6 weeks and 9 months) will be non-inferior to the standard schedule (doses scheduled at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks). We hypothesise that the alternative schedule will provide adequate direct protection between 2 and 9 months of age, during which time the risk of VT disease in our setting is very low, and potentially superior herd protection, and similar overall effectiveness compared to the standard schedule. An accompanying paper describes the protocol for a related trial in which we are investigating whether the rate of acquisition of VT pneumococci is reduced in the 5 months after the administration of the booster dose, in the 1 + 1 compared to the 3 + 0 group.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par60">PVS is a parallel-group, phase IV, unmasked, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority field trial of the population-level impact of an alternative compared to the standard schedule of PCV13. We will test the non-inferiority of the impact of the alternative compared to the standard schedule to reduce the prevalence of nasopharyngeal (NP) VT pneumococcal carriage in young children with clinical pneumonia. Approximately equal numbers of infants will be enrolled in each cluster, with clusters allocated to the two groups in a 1:1 ratio.</p>

                <p id="Par76">Eligible infants making their first presentation to the immunisation clinic after birth are identified. Trial staff determine the parent or guardian’s first language and literacy. More than three quarters of the adults in the trial area are not literate in English. Trained staff provide the trial information sheet to literate parents or guardians. If the parent or guardian is not literate, trial staff play a standardised audio recording explaining the trial in the appropriate one of four different local languages. Translation of the trial information sheet and its audio recording was validated and certified by Tostan Basse (email. gambia@tostan.org). Trained staff then enquire whether there are any questions and seek informed consent. Mothers and guardians are encouraged to discuss participation with the infant’s father before consent. Trial staff address the questions and concerns of parents or guardians. Trial staff who speak the language of the parent or guardian conduct the informed consent process. If the parent or guardian is illiterate, an impartial witness is present during the informed consent process. Each impartial witness receives the information sheet and consent form and listens to the audio consent information. Given that the impartial witnesses will see and hear standard information about the trial in their own language and that their role is to judge the voluntary nature of the participant’s decision to be enrolled, they may not be literate in English.</p>
                <p id="Par77">The consent of parents or guardians is recorded on a paper form. If literate in English the participant’s parent or guardian signs and dates the consent form. If illiterate, the impartial witness attests to the participant’s apparent understanding, that informed consent is freely given, and the responses to the specific questions on the form. Trial staff mark the participant’s responses to each of the specific questions on the form. If the parent or guardian has understood the information, they thumbprint the consent form. The impartial witness signs, or thumbprints, the consent form and dates the participant’s thumbprint. If the impartial witness is illiterate trial staff date the thumbprint of the parent or guardian and impartial witness. If a guardian provides consent, this is documented on the consent form and a statement of guardianship is obtained, with the signature of a witness if the guardian is not literate in English. The staff member obtaining consent records their name and signature on the consent form and provides an identical copy to the parent or guardian. The person obtaining consent also provides a copy of the information sheet (including the free-call contact details of two trial staff).</p>

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par79">The current standard 3 + 0 schedule for PCV is well-established and has effectively controlled VT IPD and generated a degree of herd protection. Given the need to generate data that are generalizable to other African countries, PVS will implement the much more commonly used scheduling of doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, rather than the national schedule of 2, 3, and 4 months. The alternative 1 + 1 schedule (doses scheduled at ages 6 weeks and 9 months) will schedule its first dose at the same age as the 3 + 0 schedule. The booster dose at 9 months of age is a standard EPI visit in low-income countries, and in Africa measles and yellow fever vaccination are scheduled at this visit. The age of 9 months is the earliest at which the booster dose could be incorporated into already established EPI schedules in low-income countries and takes advantage of a key EPI visit to optimise coverage of administration in the population. We hypothesise that the 1 + 1 schedule will provide adequate direct protection between 2 and 9 months of age, during which time the risk of VT disease in our setting is very low, and potentially superior herd protection and similar overall effectiveness compared to the 3 + 0 schedule. The interventions will be delivered for 4 years (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We will measure the primary and secondary endpoints in Year 4 of intervention delivery, at which time we assume the differential effects of the two schedules will have stabilised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par80">The intervention was initiated at the same time in all clusters across the trial area. The experimental intervention in this trial is the scheduling of PCV13 for infants resident in geographic clusters of villages with the first dose due at 6 weeks of age and a booster dose scheduled at 9 months of age. The standard intervention is the scheduling of PCV13 for infants with doses due at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. There are few data to indicate the period of time required for the dissipation of the population-level effects of a PCV schedule while transitioning to a new schedule. Data from PSP in rural Gambia suggest that, in the 2-year period following the introduction of PCV13, herd effects were developing as the incidence of PCV13 only serotype IPD in the 2–4 years age group had fallen from 50 per 10<sup>5</sup> person-years in 2010/2011 to 20 in 2013, despite coverage of PCV13 in mid-2013 being only 10% in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At the time the intervention was initiated, the 1 + 1 schedule was implemented with catch-up of the booster dose for infants up to 9 months of age who had already received two or three doses of PCV, the rationale being that this would be the approach if countries were to transition from a 3 + 0 schedule to a 1 + 1 schedule, and not waste doses of PCV. Catch-up of the booster dose was implemented for 4 months and then ceased.</p>
                <p id="Par81">PCV13 vaccine is licenced in many countries and has been approved for use in The Gambia since 2011. The EPI procures the vaccine through global systems coordinated by UNICEF. This trial delivers PCV13 in collaboration with, and through the structures of the Gambian EPI, and under the operational conditions of the public health system. The EPI receives PCV13 into a central cold-storage facility. Vaccine is transported to the regional centres either by a specially designed EPI ‘cold van’ or by cold storage units carried by Regional Health Directorate (RHD) vehicles. The RHDs in URR and CRR are based in Basse and Bansang respectively. The URR RHD stores vaccine in solar refrigerators in Basse and the CRR RHD stores vaccine in a purpose-built ‘cold room’ in Bansang. From Basse and Bansang, small volumes of vaccine are distributed on a monthly basis to eight ‘base clinics’ in Basse, Gambisara, Demba Kunda, Fatoto, Koina, Sabi, Bansang, and Brikamaba. These base clinics carry small volumes of vaccine to each of the EPI clinics in the 68 different geographic locations involved in PVS. Solar vaccine refrigerators are used for storage at the base clinics. The trial uses the existing EPI procedures to monitor and record the vaccine accountability and cold chain documentation with daily logs.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Immunisation is undertaken at the 11 fixed health centres in the study area on one to two days each week. Mobile clinics in the 57 other sites are held once or twice per month. Given the frequency of EPI clinics, there is generally some delay in the time that vaccines are actually received. Administration of PCV13, and other antigens, by EPI staff will follow the schedule allocated for the particular geographic cluster (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), apart from when a list of exceptions dictate that an infant receives the schedule of the other group and not the locally allocated schedule (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In 2016 coverage in the BHDSS of three doses of PCV at 12 months of age was 92% and coverage of one dose of measles vaccine was 82% with measles coverage of 92% by 18 months of age.

                  <p id="Par102">Measuring the prevalence of VT pneumococcal carriage in children with pneumonia and in the community are effective methods to determine the population-level effect of PCV schedules on pneumococcal transmission. The primary endpoint relates to the important public health condition of clinical pneumonia in children and the associated VT pneumococcal carriage correlates with community-level transmission. This primary endpoint may be replicated in other settings that investigate the transition from a standard to alternative PCV schedule. The primary endpoint will be measured in Year 4 when the differential effects of the two schedules have stabilised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To explore potential early impact of the alternative schedule, we will conduct a secondary exploratory measurement of VT carriage prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia in year 2, specifying a superiority hypothesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="Par103">Surveys of pneumococcal carriage in the community have little selection bias as all residents of all ages are included in the sampling frame. Compared to VT prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia, the community-level VT carriage measurement is less prone to information bias as participants do not need to meet the clinical pneumonia criteria to have a NP swab. Cross-sectional surveys are a quick and relatively inexpensive way to measure VT carriage in the study population and give a broad scope of the effects of the two PCV schedules in different age groups. The population survey of VT carriage in year 2 will allow an exploratory measurement of any immediate impact from the alternative PCV schedule. The year 2 survey will be completed in parallel with a survey of interpersonal contact patterns. The survey in year 4 will provide an important secondary endpoint evaluating the effect of the alternative schedule in the population as children receiving the alternative schedule age and accumulate within the population.</p>
                  <p id="Par104">In order to isolate the herd effects of the schedules in very young infants, the secondary endpoint of VT carriage prevalence in infants aged 6–12 weeks presenting for their first dose of PCV13 will be measured in a cross-sectional manner in year 4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Safety endpoints covering the incidence of clinical pneumonia, radiological pneumonia, IPD, hospitalisation and mortality will be measured throughout the 4 years of the trial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The incidence of clinical pneumonia associated with NP carriage of VT and NVT pneumococci will also be measured.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">The dynamics of age-dependent VT pneumococcal transmission are complex and vary by population, contact patterns and the related carriage data have important implications on accurate vaccine protection estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Including an interpersonal contact pattern survey in Year 2 parallel with the survey of VT carriage will generate data on contact patterns for planned mathematical modelling of the effect of alternative PCV schedules. The parallel surveys will give insight into the magnitude of association between age-related carriage prevalence and rates of interpersonal contact and whether infection is associated with physical or non-physical contacts.</p>
                  <p id="Par106">The emergence of NVT serotypes causing IPD in both children and adults following the introduction of PCV13 has been a source of concern. The effect of an alternative schedule on serotype replacement dynamics has not been well described.

                <title>Non-inferiority margin</title>
                <p id="Par108">We determined the non-inferiority margin using the concept of ‘the largest loss of impact of the current treatment that would be clinically acceptable’, an approach recommended by the US FDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The non-inferiority margin uses a relative metric as the relative effect of the standard schedule is likely to be constant. The introduction of the 3 + 0 schedule has reduced NP VT prevalence in children from 47 to 13%, i.e. a 72% reduction (author’s own data). Baseline risk may change over time, so an absolute value for the non-inferiority margin may not provide a reliable measure of the difference in impact of the two schedules.</p>
                <p id="Par109">Given the important advantages of the 1 + 1 schedule, the non-inferiority margin will be a 15% loss of the impact of the 3 + 0 schedule; this value is supported by empiric survey data. An online survey was sent to 72 individuals involved in pneumococcal vaccine research, policy and clinical care. Valid responses were received from 19 respondents. The survey question presented 10 hypothetical results of VT prevalence in the two trial groups, on a scale of increasing ‘loss of impact’ associated with the 1 + 1 schedule, from a baseline of no loss (i.e. a 0% loss of impact) in the 1 + 1 versus 3 + 0 group, up to a 50% loss of impact. Respondents were asked to consider themselves as decision-makers in their national immunisation programmes requested to consider a change to their national programme from a 3 + 0 to 1+ 1 schedule based on the results of the trial. Respondents selected one option corresponding to the ‘loss of impact’ which would sway their decision against introducing the new 1+ 1 schedule. Using the metric of a percentage loss of impact of the 3 + 0 schedule which would sway decisions against the new schedule the mean value was a 22% loss of impact. The results of the survey support our decision to use a non-inferiority margin that the 1 + 1 schedule be associated with a ≤15% loss of the total impact of the 3 + 0 schedule.</p>
                <p id="Par110">The prevalence of NP carriage of VT pneumococci from Jan–Sept 2015 was 17% and fell to 15% in Oct–Dec 2015 (author’s own data). Assuming VT prevalence of 13% in the 3 + 0 group at the beginning of the trial, a 15% loss of impact translates to prevalence in the 1+ 1 group of (1 − [0.72 − (0.72 × 0.15)]) × 47% = 18.3%. We used changes in VT prevalence to inform the non-inferiority margin because reductions in VT carriage following the introduction of PCV can predict the impact of PCV on IPD and because carriage prevalence is proportional to the rate of pneumococcal transmission in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">For the secondary endpoints of community pneumococcal carriage, the non-inferiority margin of a ≤15% loss of impact in the 1+ 1 compared to the 3+ 0 schedule clusters, will be used as described above. The same VT prevalence will be assumed within the community.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par112">Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcome of NP carriage of VT pneumococci in children aged 2 weeks–59 months with clinical pneumonia. The primary outcome will be measured in random samples of participants in each of the 68 clusters (if a minimum of 60 participants were sampled in each cluster there would be 1980 in each arm and 3690 in total). Using Basse data from 2015, we assumed that the prevalence of VT carriage to be 13% in both the 3 + 0 and 1 + 1 arms. Based on the non-inferiority assumptions presented in the previous section, the 1 + 1 schedule will be considered non-inferior if the upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the prevalence ratio is ≤1.38 (0.18/0.13 = 1.38). Using Basse data, we estimated the intra-class correlation (ICC) to be 0.01–0.02. We calculated study power using the methods of Farrington et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and Donner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Using the more conservative value for ICC of 0.02, a minimum number measured for the endpoint per cluster of 60, 33, and 35 clusters per arm (with design effect of 2.18) and alpha=0.05, a sample size of 1980 per arm will provide 93% power to test the non-inferiority of the 1 + 1 schedule.</p>
                <p id="Par113">To increase confidence in the power of the study we simulated trial data using 2015 data from the BHDSS based on cluster-wise VT carriage in children with pneumonia. The simulated data were designed to be similar to the villages included in this trial with respect to the mean carriage prevalence, as well as the variability in prevalence across clusters. Using 1000 simulated populations, each consisting of 68 clusters of 60 individuals, baseline prevalence of 10% and a largest acceptable increase of 4%, i.e. from 10 to 14%, study power was ≥85% in most scenarios.</p>
                <p id="Par114">As opposed to the non-inferiority hypothesis that is specified in year 4 of the study we will specify a superiority hypothesis for the measurement in year 2 of VT prevalence in children with clinical pneumonia. Setting a 5% level of significance and power of 80%, with ICC=0.02 and assuming the prevalence of VT carriage in the control group is 18%, we wish to detect an absolute difference of 8%. That is, the smallest clinically significant difference that we wish to detect is equivalent to 18% versus 26% prevalence in the two groups. Given these parameters, if we measure the endpoint in 20 individuals per cluster, we would need to include 29 clusters in each group, that is, a total of 58 clusters. We will measure the endpoint in 68 clusters.</p>
                <p id="Par115">Study power for the secondary endpoint of VT prevalence in infants aged 6–12 weeks presenting for their first dose of PCV is based on the same assumptions as for the primary endpoint and study power will be similar to that for the primary endpoint.</p>
                <p id="Par116">In the community carriage surveys in years 2 and 4, we will sample 60 residents in each of the 68 clusters. The same assumptions and methods of power calculation as for the primary endpoint were used. We assume ICC=0.02, 15% baseline VT carriage prevalence in both clusters, and a ≤1.38 prevalence ratio derived from the ≤15% NI margin. If the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of our prevalence ratio comparing the 1 + 1 to the 3+ 0 clusters is ≤1.38, then the alternative schedule will be considered non-inferior. Following these assumptions, the community carriage surveys in years 2 and 4 will have power &gt; 94% if we collect 4080 samples evenly across 68 clusters (i.e. 60 per cluster).</p>
                <p id="Par117">For the interpersonal-contact pattern survey in year 2, 1500 participants from the carriage study will be enrolled. Recruiting 1500 participants will enable us to detect an absolute difference of 1 mean contact per day between age groups, with a 5% significance level, and 90% power. These calculations are based on the work of le Polain de Waroux et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

When infants present to immunisation clinics, trial staff confirm their identity and apply the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mother/guardian of infants who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have exclusion criteria are informed about the nature of the trial as part of the informed consent process. The screening of infants and recruitment of participants is electronically entered in real-time into the trial data management system. A trial sticker is fixed to the child welfare card and the intervention schedule is marked on the child welfare card. Enrolment to receive the 1 + 1 intervention will cease 3 months prior to the close of clinical surveillance at the end of year 4 of the study.</p>
                <p id="Par119">Children aged 2 weeks to 59 months who are resident in the study area are under surveillance for clinical endpoints. Children who present unwell to health facilities in the study area are evaluated for criteria indicating the need for clinical investigation.</p>

Three-level cluster sampling using probability proportional to size will be used to select 2 villages within each of 68 clusters, with three households per village and 10 individuals per household. Ten individuals will be randomly selected from each household following the age-structure ratio 2:2:2:2:1:1 (0–11 months, 12–23 months, 2–5 years, 6–14 years, 15–44 years, 45 years and greater).

In order to select the stratifying variable of cluster-level incidence of clinical pneumonia, cluster-level prevalence of ‘high’ or ‘low’ VT carriage in children with clinical pneumonia in the BHDSS was correlated with: clusterwise population density, rates of hospitalisation, clinical pneumonia, radiological pneumonia, IPD and mortality. Of the five listed outcomes, clinical pneumonia incidence had the closest correlation with VT carriage prevalence and thus was chosen as the stratifying variable.</p>

                <p id="Par128">Each child presenting unwell to a health facility in the trial area is registered, and if resident and aged 0-59 months, is eligible to be screened for clinical pneumonia. Whenever possible, a different staff registers attendance and conceals the infant welfare card from the staff performing clinical pneumonia screening (to minimise potential bias due to knowledge of the residential location and group allocation). Trial nursing staff screen for clinical pneumonia by determining if there is a history of cough or difficulty breathing, the respiratory rate, peripheral arterial oxygen saturation, and presence of lower-chest wall indrawing (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

On isolated occasions when shippers are unavailable in the health facility, NP specimens are transported to the MRCG laboratory in Basse within 6 h. To culture NP specimens, a 10 μl loop of vortexed NP specimen is inoculated onto blood agar with 5% gentamicin and incubated in CO<sub>2</sub>. Identification of pneumococcal colonies follows recommended methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Specimens positive for pneumococcus undergo latex sweep serotyping in Basse. Morphologically different pneumococcal colonies are selected from the primary plate, purified, and stored. For internal quality control (QC), a proportion of NP specimens is processed by two different operators and results compared. External QC on sweep serotyping involves blind assessment of known spiked samples, prepared by the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) Pneumococcal Laboratory, placed among the routine specimens delivered to the laboratory. As further validation of the latex sweep serotyping, a proportion of the specimens that are positive for pneumococcus will be subjected to molecular serotyping microarray analysis by BUGS Bioscience at St George’s, University of London (SGUL). Microarray is the most sensitive method for detecting carriage of multiple pneumococcal serotypes; its specificity is similar to high-quality latex sweep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

Cross-over between groups will be defined as (a) change of residential location from a 1 + 1 to 3 + 0 cluster, and vice versa, for a period of 4 or more months and (b) receipt of the third dose of PCV at 8 months of age or greater in a 3 + 0 cluster.</p>
                <p id="Par148">The unit of inference will be the individual child. That is, we wish to estimate whether the risk of VT carriage in a child who lives in a geographic area using a 1 + 1 schedule is not greater than the given threshold when compared to a child in an area receiving the 3 + 0 schedule. The primary outcome will be presented as the proportion (prevalence) of children with clinical pneumonia and NP carriage of VT pneumococci. The contrast between the two groups will be presented as a prevalence ratio (and 95% confidence intervals), with ratios expressed as the prevalence in the 1+ 1 group compared to the prevalence in the 3 + 0 group. To account for cluster-level non-independence, the primary analysis will use generalised estimating equations (GEE) with a log link, binomial family and exchangeable correlation structure. The GEE models will adjust for stratification variables, and age will be included in the model for the endpoint of VT carriage in unimmunised infants aged 6-12 weeks, due to rapid age-related changes in prevalence in the first months of life. Non-inferiority will be established if the upper limit of the confidence interval around the prevalence ratio is ≤1.38.</p>
                <p id="Par149">We have <italic>a priori</italic> interest to examine the following potential effect modifiers: (a) age (2–12 weeks, 13 weeks–9 months, 10–23 months and 24–59 months), (b) inpatient/outpatient status and c) severity (severe pneumonia defined as clinical pneumonia with O<sub>2</sub> saturation &lt; 92%). The number of cases of each endpoint in the subgroups above may not be sufficient to assess non-inferiority in those strata but may enable the detection of differences in effectiveness between groups. We will examine the strength of evidence for differences between subgroups using interaction tests.</p>
                <p id="Par150">A secondary exploratory measurement and analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted in year 2 of the trial, in order to detect potential early development of superior impact in the 1 + 1 group. This secondary hypothesis is different to the primary hypothesis of non-inferiority and will use an alpha value of 0.05, as will the final analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par151">The secondary endpoints of community pneumococcal carriage will be measured in years 2 and 4 of the study while carriage in infants aged 6–12 weeks presenting for their first dose of PCV will be measured in year 4. Comparison of the two groups will be presented as a prevalence ratio (and 95% confidence intervals). The same analytical methods as the primary endpoint analysis will be used to account for cluster-level non-independence and the allocation of clusters. We will use the same non-inferiority measurement as the primary endpoint, where non-inferiority will be established if the upper-limit of the confidence interval around the prevalence ratio for VT carriage in the 1 + 1 versus 3 + 0 clusters is ≤1.38.</p>
                <p id="Par152">An exploratory analysis will be performed to measure the association between age-specific contact pattern frequencies and pneumococcal carriage. The association between physical and non-physical contact frequency and age-specific pneumococcal carriage will be analysed using GEE models.</p>
                <p id="Par153">The endpoints monitoring potentially different disease risk (incidence of clinical and radiological pneumonia, IPD and mortality) will be evaluated in semi-blinded safety analyses presented to the DMC at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after initiation of the interventions. These will not be formal analyses and will not influence the risk of false positive results. These analyses will be concealed from the investigators. The DMC may choose to use the results from the exploratory measurement of the primary endpoint in Year 2 to initiate further safety analyses and measurement of the incidence of clinical pneumonia associated with NP carriage of VT pneumococci. The DMC may also use the results of the community carriage survey in year 2 to inform considerations of safety. These analyses will be concealed from the investigators.</p>
                <p id="Par154">The degree of evidence sufficient to justify early stopping of the trial may be complicated by different accrual rates and potential local epidemics in different clusters. Thus, within and between cluster information will be evaluated for the DMC’s deliberations. The disadvantages of stopping a trial early, such as lack of credibility, imprecision and bias, will be accentuated in cluster-randomised studies.</p>

                <p id="Par165">Adverse events are defined according to the ICH Harmonised Guideline for GCP E6(R2). Due to the established safety record of PCV13 the trial does not record solicited events of reactogenicity. The trial uses an electronic vaccine record system to record unsolicited events of reactogenicity when reported by caregivers within 7 days of a dose of PCV. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are tabulated in reports every 3 months. Severe adverse drug reactions (SADR) and serious, severe unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) are reported to the Sponsor within 24 h. The Sponsor reports SADRs and SUSARS to the Gambia Medicines Control Agency (GMCA), while PI reports these events to the Gambia Government/MRCG Joint Ethics Committee (GG/MRCG JEC), LSHTM Ethics Committee (LSHTM EC), TSC, and DMC.</p>
                <p id="Par166">Follow-up and resolution of SAEs is recorded in electronic reports. The Sponsor, TSC and DMC are informed of SAEs at each meeting. The MRCG Clinical Trials Department Coordinator reports SAEs to the national Regulatory Authority (RA) Gambia Medicine Control Agency (GMCA). The PI reports SAEs to the TSC, DMC, and MoH. SADRs and SUSARs are reported to the GG/MRC JEC within 5 working days. Deaths unrelated to the intervention are reported to the GG/MRC JEC at the next meeting. Information on unanticipated changes that may increase the risk to participants or may affect adversely the safety of the participants or the conduct of the trial or that could alter the EC’s approval to continue the trial will be reported to the Sponsor, GG/MRC JEC, LSHTM EC, GMCA, TSC, and DMC in writing within 2 working days.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par170">The start of recruitment in the trial was delayed 17 months in 2018/2019 during negotiation of the formal agreement with the MoH regarding the collaborative approach to the trial. Recruitment began on 22 August 2019. Enrolment in the trial was suspended for 4 months in 2020, from 26 March until 30 June, due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment in the 1 + 1 clusters resumed from 1 July and was then again suspended on 5 August due to pandemic related restrictions. During these periods of suspension, participants who were already enrolled continued to receive the trial allocated schedules as recorded on infant health cards. The DMC, TSC, and Sponsor, deemed there was less risk to participants if MoH EPI staff followed the schedule indicated on the infant welfare card rather than ask EPI staff to administer PCV in a schedule contrary to that recorded on the infant welfare card. Attendance at immunisation clinics in the trial area was reduced for several months during this time but immunisation of infants was largely caught up when attendance returned to normal 3–4 months after the initial introduction of pandemic related restrictions. Clinical surveillance at health facilities was scaled back on 26 March to the two main hospitals and nursing staff were withdrawn from nine outlying clinics. Collection of NP swabs was suspended from 26 March–7 September and surveillance continued only for safety endpoints of hospitalisation and invasive pneumococcal disease. Disease surveillance was expanded site by site between 28 May and 3 August to then include all health facilities.</p>
              <p id="Par171">Infants resident in 1+ 1 villages who were not enrolled during the COVID-19 interruptions and who may have received the standard 3 + 0 schedule will constitute ‘cross-over’ between the two groups. Cross-over in 1 + 1 clusters will reduce any difference in effect between the two groups with a potential bias towards a null result. A formal evaluation in September 2020, of pandemic-related cross-over, found 1.6% of infants enrolled in the 1+ 1 group were cross-overs during this period while the proportion of all cross-overs in the 1+ 1 group since the beginning of the trial was 4.4%, primarily related to decline of consent. We project that in year 4 of the trial total cross over in the 1 + 1 group will be 3–4%. Formal statistical simulations indicated that such cross-over will have a negligible impact on study power, statistical coverage, or bias.</p>
