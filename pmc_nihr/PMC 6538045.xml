                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Cognitive training is an emerging non-pharmacological treatment to improve cognitive and physical function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Abnormal brain blood flow is a key process in the development of cognitive decline. However, no studies have explored the effects of cognitive training on brain blood flow in dementia. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility for a large-scale, randomised controlled trial of cognitive training in healthy older adults (HC), MCI and early AD.</p>

                  <p>This study will recruit 60 participants, in three subgroups of 20 (MCI, HC, AD), from primary, secondary and community services. Participants will be randomised to a 12-week computerised cognitive training programme (five × 30 min sessions per week), or waiting-list control. Participants will undergo baseline and follow-up assessments of: mood, cognition, quality of life and activities of daily living. Cerebral blood flow will be measured at rest and during task activation (pretraining and post-training) by bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, alongside heart rate (3-lead ECG), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (capnography) and beat-to-beat blood pressure (Finometer). Participants will be offered to join a focus group or semistructured interview to explore barriers and facilitators to cognitive training in patients with dementia. Qualitative data will be analysed using framework analysis, and data will be integrated using mixed methods matrices.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The incidence of dementia is rising as the population ages, with 46.8 million people living with dementia worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> By 2030, this is projected to rise to 75 million.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> However, there are currently few diagnostic or therapeutic strategies available to offer these patients. Dementia is a progressive condition characterised by gradual loss of cognitive and/or non-cognitive higher functions (ie, language, visuospatial, attention).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterised by subjective and objective decline in cognitive function, but with preserved functional independence in daily living.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It has become increasingly recognised that deranged vascular function is an early contributor to the deposition of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and that these pathologies exacerbate one another (two-hit hypothesis).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, we demonstrated clear abnormalities in vascular function across a number of imaging modalities at the MCI stage.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Thus, treatments that can improve cerebral perfusion or vascular function could represent an early treatment option for dementia.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this study, the target populations are: healthy older adults (as controls), adults with AD and MCI, to capture the effects of cognitive training on vascular physiology at an early stage in the dementia process.</p>
              <p>The Cognition and Flow Study (CogFlowS) is a feasibility, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the use of a cognitive training programme in adults with MCI, early AD and healthy older adults (HC). In addition to measuring cognitive and functional outcomes, this study will also use transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) to measure changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and after a 12-week cognitive training programme.</p>
              <p>Cognitive interventions can be considered as three broad categories: cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Cognitive training describes a structured, guided programme of standardised tasks designed to provide practice or training within a specified cognitive domain(s), to translate into functional benefits.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> This is distinguished from cognitive rehabilitation, where patient-centred approaches and goals are used to improve everyday function, rather than improve cognition function,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> and cognitive stimulation which aims to generally improve cognition, social function and quality of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Cognitive training is attractive in that it offers a cost-effective, non-invasive and acceptable intervention to patients, with no reported adverse effects.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, high-quality RCT evidence is lacking in studies of cognitive training in dementia.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 12 13</xref> Two previous Cochrane reviews<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> highlighted that the evidence was sparse, with many of the studies underpowered, of low-to-moderate quality and with relatively few for MCI.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Recent systematic reviews of cognitive training in MCI have demonstrated moderate benefits in verbal learning and memory, global cognition, non-verbal learning, working memory, attention and psychosocial functioning.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 14</xref> Thus far, studies of cognitive training in dementia have been heterogeneous in study design, participants included, type and definition of training, outcome measures and duration and intensity of intervention.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 13 15 16</xref> This hampers the adequate meta-analysis of data, and of conclusions that can be drawn from pooled analyses.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 17</xref> Few studies have included neuroimaging outcomes to explore brain plasticity or neural mechanisms underlying changes in cognition after cognitive training.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, the CogFlowS addresses the development of a future high-quality RCT of cognitive training in dementia, and aims to fill the evidence gap on the use of TCD to assess neurovascular plasticity.</p>
              <p>TCD is a non-invasive, ultrasound-based imaging modality that allows measurements of CBF velocity (CBFv) at rest<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and following activation by cognitive tasks.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> TCD has a number of advantages over other functional imaging techniques, such as: MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), including lower cost, portability, relative ease of operator training, high temporal resolution and higher acceptability to patients.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> TCD is particularly suited to older people, and those with dementia, as it can be used in patients with pacemakers, metal implants and claustrophobia.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The use of TCD is a novel method to investigate neurovascular training effects and for markers predictive of which patients may benefit from particular cognitive training programmes.

              <p>The use of neuroimaging outcomes has also been limited in cognitive training studies,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 22</xref> but understanding the training effects occurring at the physiological level may provide important mechanistic information to any potential benefits conferred by cognitive training.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref> Belleville <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated increased parietal activation in patients with MCI, following a multimodal cognitive training programme designed to improve episodic memory.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In a near-infrared spectroscopy study by Vermeij <italic>et al</italic>, patients with MCI had greater training benefits at high load working memory where participants had greater prefrontal activation,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> whereas baseline global and hippocampal atrophy were predictive of poorer training gains in healthy older adults and those with MCI.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, imaging biomarkers can potentially be used to predict and tailor interventions to individual patient’s needs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> While a number of studies have demonstrated positive structural and functional effects of cognitive training,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 27 28</xref> they have largely focused on healthy older adults,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with the use of structural<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> or functional MRI<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> and PET<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref>; there have been no TCD studies examining changes in neurovascular response to cognitive training in patients with cognitive impairment. In addition to the inclusion of neuroimaging, this study uses a mixed methods approach. This study includes a qualitative component to explore any benefits, problems or barriers to engaging with the training programme, and to identify any benefits not measured by traditional outcomes.</p>
              <p>The primary objective for this study is to determine the feasibility for a large-scale RCT of cognitive training in HC, AD and MCI. Secondary objectives seek to identify any clinical benefits of a cognitive training programme in terms of: activities of daily living, cognition, mood, quality of life and TCD-measured task activation responses in brain blood flow. In addition, the qualitative study seeks to explore barriers and facilitators to the cognitive training programme, how programmes can be adapted to support participation for patients living with dementia and any additional benefits not measured through traditional methods as perceived by patients and their carers. Finally, we plan to explore the lived experience of the patient and their carer, and the impact cognitive training has on them and their life.</p>

                <p>During the design phase of this study, a patient and public involvement (PPI) group was consulted, comprised research network volunteers from the Alzheimer’s society who were either people living with cognitive impairment or their carers. The group reviewed the study design, research questions and outcome measures, and a number of changes were made as a result. These included: providing an option of a focus group or interview to participants, changes to the recruitment procedures and the design of the cognitive training programme. All study participants will receive a lay summary at the end of the study explaining what the outcomes of the study were. A further PPI meeting was held following successful funding to refine the study documentation and procedures for participants. The trial will be overseen by a trial steering committee (TSC), consisting of patient and public members, and independent academics. The TSC will review the trial conduct on a six monthly basis. As this is a feasibility trial, the burden of intervention is to be assessed in terms of its acceptability to patients and their carers.</p>

                <p>HC will be recruited through poster advertisement, friends, family and carers of enrolled patient participants, Join Dementia Research and the research interested list at the University of Leicester. Participants with a diagnosis of MCI, or AD, will be recruited through poster advertisement, secondary care services (outpatient clinics within the University Hospitals of Leicester (acute) and the Leicestershire Partnership (mental health) National Health Service Trusts), research interested lists, Join Dementia Research and local community groups. In addition, participants will be sought through letter invitation from their general practitioner (GP) surgery. Participants will be allowed a minimum of 24 hours to decide if they would like to enrol in the study, and to contact the researcher or research delivery team at the Leicestershire Partnership Trust, who will arrange for them to undergo an eligibility assessment, formal consent and study enrolment. As part of the eligibility assessment, participants will undergo a screening cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment—MoCA) to ensure deficits are classified as mild to moderate. Participants will be consented for this, and the MoCA will not form part of the baseline assessments. For participants who lack capacity to consent to the study, a personal consultee declaration will be completed by a friend, relative or carer, in addition to verbal assent from the participant themselves where possible. Flow charts of the recruitment process and participant procedures can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2">figures 1 and 2</xref>, respectively.</p>

The investigator will be providing weekly telephone support for the intervention group, in addition to undertaking baseline and follow-up measurements, and therefore blinding of the investigator is also not possible. However, data analysis will be blinded by generating a batch-anonymised dataset. Randomisation will be undertaken at the initial visit. Once participants have been randomised to the intervention arm, they will be provided with information on how to access and use the cognitive training programme at home.</p>

                <p>All participants (intervention and control groups) will be required to attend two assessments: baseline and follow-up at 12-weeks post training. Assessments will be carried out at the participant’s home, or designated research space at the Leicestershire Partnership Trust, or Cerebral Haemodynamics in Ageing and Stroke Medicine (CHiASM) research space. Participants will be given the option to divide the assessments across two visits if necessary. This is to reduce any burden of participation for people living with dementia, who may fatigue more quickly with the baseline and follow-up assessments. It is anticipated that the majority of participants will be able to complete all assessments in one visit, and this will be included within the feasibility assessment for the study.</p>
                <p>Data will be collected on demographics, medical history and medication use. Assessments of cognition (Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III)), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale 15), activities of daily living (Lawton instrumental activities of daily living) and quality of life (Dementia Rated Quality of Life) will be carried out at both visits. An assessment of neurovascular function will be carried out at the CHiASM research space, a temperature-controlled room, free of noise and distraction. Participants will be seated throughout the protocol. All measurements will be made at rest (5 min baseline recording), and during cerebral activation (selected cognitive tasks). CBFv will be measured continuously by insonation of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCA) (DWL Doppler Box), using 2 MHz probes, fixed in place with a headframe. Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) will be measured continuously using a Finometer cuff on the non-dominant middle finger (Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and calibrated using a brachial BP recording (UA767 BP monitor). End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>(ETCO<sub>2</sub>) will be measured by capnography using nasal cannulae (Capnochek Plus), and the R-R interval will be recorded using a 3-lead ECG. The task activation protocol has been published previously.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42 43</xref> In brief, participants will be presented with five tasks selected from the ACE-III, and percentage increase in CBFv from resting baseline will be calculated at task initiation. The tasks will be selected for five cognitive domains: attention, memory, visuospatial, language and verbal fluency, based on recent studies conducted by this group.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> Data will be collected on the following parameters: average CBFv, ETCO<sub>2</sub>, HR and BP at rest over 5 min, and peak percentage change from baseline in all parameters at 5–10 s, and 10–20 s after task activation for each of the five cognitive tasks.</p>
                <p>At least 1 week after completion of the follow-up assessment, participants with a diagnosis of MCI, or AD, will be invited to attend a semistructured interview or focus group. The schedule of questions can be seen in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary information</xref>. The schedule of questions has been framed around the six constructs of the health belief model (risk susceptibility, risk severity, benefits to action, barriers to action, self-efficacy and cues to action)<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> to evaluate the cognitive training programme, and the experience of the participant and their carer. Interviews and focus groups will be recorded continuously with a digital audio recorder, and notes of non-verbal and paralinguistic clues will be made. All digital recordings will be transcribed within 5–7 days of the interview or focus group. Semistructured interviews are an iterative process, following the first couple of interviews the transcripts will be analysed and the themes and concepts emerging from these initial data will be further explored at the following interviews.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>This is a feasibility study, and thus will not be powered adequately to detect changes in the secondary end points outlined above. However, given the novel aspects of this study protocol, such as the inclusion of a TCD-measured changes in CBF responses, and the mixed methods design, this requires evaluation of the feasibility before moving to a larger, fully powered trial of cognitive training in dementia. Furthermore, this study will include assessments of patient experience and tolerability to facilitate this. Although TCD affords excellent temporal resolution in the measurement of CBFv, the MCA supplies blood to approximately 80% of the cerebral cortex, and therefore reflects a global measure of perfusion, and cannot discriminate where changes are occurring, due to poor spatial resolution. Techniques such as MRI, and PET scans afford better spatial resolution, but have their own limitations, particularly in older patients with cognitive deficits. TCD-measured CBFv relies on the assumption that the vessel diameter remains constant, despite fluctuations in CO<sub>2</sub> and BP.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This study elected to focus on healthy older adults, MCI and AD in the first instance. Deficits in CBFv have been demonstrated in both MCI and AD, but inclusion of participants with vascular cognitive impairment would provide further information on the capacity for plasticity to neurovascular physiology among dementia subtypes. In addition, only participants with mild-to-moderate deficits will be included, given that data thus far do not support the use of cognitive training in more advanced dementia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12</xref> Only participants who are undertaking the training programme will be offered telephone support, as it is primarily to support technical issues with delivery of the programme. However, this could introduce a placebo effect, and future studies would ideally correct for this by providing support to both groups. Finally, one investigator is undertaking both baseline and follow-up assessments, and providing telephone support, which carries a risk of introducing researcher bias into the study. As this is primarily a feasibility study, this is of lesser importance here, but a future trial should ideally have separate team members conducting these different roles to minimise the risk of bias.</p>

                <p>The study will be monitored at six monthly intervals throughout its duration by a TSC, independent of the funder, consisting of lay and independent academic members. Each site will have a lead investigator who is responsible for the identification and recruitment of participants, data collection and completion for CRFs, follow-up measurements and adherence to study protocols. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the sponsor within one working day of identification, and the sponsor will report all serious unexpected or adverse reactions to the ethics committee concerned. The chief investigator will submit an annual report to the ethics committee which lists all SAEs. Where necessary, protocol amendments will be submitted to the study sponsor or ethics committee for approval.</p>
