                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study examined whether the early introduction of 6 allergenic foods from 3 months of age in exclusively breastfed infants prevented the development of food allergy. The intervention was effective in the per-protocol analysis for allergy to 1 or more foods and for egg and peanut individually, but only 42% of early introduction group (EIG) children met the per-protocol criteria.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>We sought to identify which factors were responsible for nonadherence in the EAT study.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Factors influencing adherence within the key early introduction period in the EIG (up to 6 months of age) were divided into enrollment and postenrollment factors, and their association with nonadherence was explored.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In an adjusted analysis, at enrollment, increased maternal age, nonwhite ethnicity, and lower maternal quality of life were independently and significantly associated with overall nonadherence in the EIG. Enrollment eczema and enrollment serum allergen-specific IgE sensitization to 1 or more foods (≥0.1 kU/L) were not related to overall nonadherence. After enrollment, 2 factors were significantly related to EIG overall nonadherence: parent-reported IgE-type symptoms with infant allergenic food consumption by 6 months of age and reported feeding difficulties by 4 months of age.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>If early introduction of allergenic foods were to be considered a strategy to prevent food allergy, families of nonwhite ethnicity, those with older mothers, and those with infants with reported feeding difficulties or early-onset eczema would benefit from support to promote early and sustained consumption.</p>

            <p id="p0010">The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study was a large randomized food allergy prevention trial of the early introduction of 6 allergenic foods from 3 months of age in exclusively breast-fed infants recruited from the general population.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The EAT study achieved markedly different rates of exposure to allergenic foods between the randomized groups (the early introduction group [EIG] and the standard introduction group [SIG]) before 6 months of age.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> However, the study did not show statistically significant efficacy in an intention-to-treat analysis but did show a significant per-protocol effect for allergy to 1 or more foods and for egg and peanut individually.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0015">There are 2 explanations for this discrepancy. First, the per-protocol analysis was effective because the population adhered to the intervention. Second, the intention-to-treat analysis was not effective because among the large group of children who did not adhere to treatment, those with nascent allergy with food sensitization had subclinical symptoms, food aversion, or both and were therefore unable to adhere. Further analyses suggested that food allergy prevention through early introduction of multiple allergenic foods in normal breastfed infants might depend on adherence and dosage.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0020">The EAT study per-protocol criteria for the EIG were stringent. By 6 months of age, EIG infants were expected to have achieved sustained high-dose consumption of 5 or more of the 6 early introduction foods. Achieving such per-protocol adherence in the EIG proved difficult. Only 42% (223/529) of adherence-evaluable EIG children complied entirely with the protocol (34% (223/652) of the whole EIG group).</p>
            <p id="p0025">After the completion of the study, we measured serum allergen-specific IgE sensitization in the EAT participants and demonstrated in an intention-to-treat analysis that the intervention successfully reduced the development of food allergy among EIG infants who were sensitized on specific IgE testing at enrollment. Infants with the early emergence of food-specific IgE sensitization to foods are known to be at high risk of developing a food allergy.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
            <p id="p0030">In this article we explore how these and other data collected in the EAT study influenced the issue of nonadherence to the recommended level of consumption of the 6 early introduction foods (overall nonadherence), as well as nonadherence to consumption of individual foods (food-specific nonadherence). We determined whether occult sensitization and early symptoms were responsible for the high nonadherence rate.</p>
            <p id="p0035">The UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition has issued the following statement after its review of the evidence on feeding in the first year of life: “The available evidence indicates that the deliberate exclusion or delayed introduction of peanut or hen's egg beyond 6 to 12 months of age may increase the risk of allergy to the same foods.”<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> We address how barriers to the prompt introduction of allergenic foods might be mitigated, thereby enhancing the possibility of food allergy prevention.</p>

                <p id="p0040">One thousand three hundred three 3-month-old infants were recruited from the general population in England and Wales through direct advertising and were enrolled between November 2009 and July 2012. Details of the EAT study methodology have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Maternal age at enrollment ranged from 19 to 46 years (median, 33 years), and there was no difference in maternal age between study groups. The median age was used as the cutoff for dividing mothers into younger (&lt;33 years) and older (≥33 years) groups. All children were generally well, exclusively breastfed, and born at term (≥37 weeks' gestation). Ethnic origin of the child was based on their parent-defined ethnicity coded by using the classification used in the 2001 UK Census.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> One thousand one hundred four (84.7%) of the enrolled infants were white, 119 (9.1%) were mixed, and 80 (6.1%) were black, Asian, or Chinese. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN (registration no. 14254740). Ethical approval for the EAT study was provided by St Thomas' Hospital REC (REC reference 08/H0802/93), and informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children enrolled in the study.</p>

                <p id="p0045">Participants were randomized to the SIG or the EIG.

                <p id="p0050">The EIG parents were asked to introduce 6 allergenic foods to their infants: cow's milk (yogurt), peanut, cooked (boiled) hen's egg, sesame, white fish, and wheat.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Cow's milk was always introduced first as yogurt. The order of introduction of the next 4 foods was randomly determined to avoid any bias from one food being introduced consistently before another.

                <p id="p0055">An online questionnaire was sent to each family monthly to 1 year of age and then every 3 months until the child reached 3 years of age. Each questionnaire allowed families to report any suspected symptoms with food ingestion and to list suspected foods. Clinical judgement was used to divide these into IgE-type and non–IgE-type symptoms. The online questionnaires also ascertained maternal quality of life using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF questionnaire,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> infant sleep using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and parental reporting of feeding difficulty and aversive feeding behavior by using questions based on previously published work.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Clinic visits took place at enrollment and at 1 and 3 years of age.

                <p id="p0060">Food-specific IgE levels to each of the 6 foods were measured at enrollment and at 1 and 3 years of age in both groups using ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) assays.

Food-specific per-protocol adherence was based on the same criteria (ie, consumption of ≥75% of the recommended amount of the specific food for at least 5 weeks between 3 and 6 months of age). The window in which 5 or more weeks of consumption could be achieved was narrow, as explained in more detail in the “Restricted window to achieve per-protocol status” section in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section in this article's Online Repository.</p>

An exploration of the likely true adherence status of the 123 EIG participants (19% of the EIG) whose adherence status was nonevaluable, as well as the effect of including or excluding them in the analyses undertaken for this article, are reviewed in detail in the “EIG adherence nonevaluable participants” section in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Results</xref> section and in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E2</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs E1 and E2</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0025">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>.</p>
              <p id="p0080">Although overall adherence to the EAT early introduction regimen was low at 42%, families found it easier to introduce some foods than others (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), with the result being that food-specific adherence varied by food: milk, 84% (451/537); peanut, 61% (336/549); whitefish, 59% (318/543); sesame, 52% (288/550); egg, 42% (234/551); and wheat, 39% (216/553, see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E3</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0030">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). Although randomization had been effective in ensuring the median age of introduction of peanut, egg, sesame, and fish was the same at 19.6 weeks, there remained the possibility that the position in the order in which a specific food was introduced might be associated with overall or food-specific adherence. Specific foods introduced later in the sequence reduced the likelihood of being per-protocol adherent to that food (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig E3</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0035">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>). However, the order of introduction of each of the foods was unrelated to overall per-protocol adherence.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Adherence with introduction of allergenic foods in the EIG up to 1 year of age.

              <p id="p0085">The key period for defining per-protocol adherence was consumption through 6 months of age. However, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> clearly indicates that there were certain foods in which the ability to meet the per-protocol threshold (3 g/wk of allergen protein) continued to improve between 6 and 12 months of age. High sustained levels of consumption were achieved by 6 months of age for milk and shortly after 6 months of age for wheat. Per-protocol consumption of fish and egg continued to improve beyond 6 months, plateauing at 9 months for fish and 10 months for egg. Most remarkable were the patterns observed for sesame and peanut. The level of consumption of these 2 foods that had been achieved by 6 months of age did not materially change throughout the rest of the first year of life. Hence by 1 year of age, there was still a significant minority who were not eating peanut or sesame at the per-protocol recommended level.</p>

                <p id="p0145">SIG participants with eczema at enrollment made up 24.3% of the study population but were responsible for 61.9% of the food allergy cases. Likewise, 15.6% of the SIG were sensitized on IgE testing at baseline to 1 or more foods but were responsible for 69.2% of food allergy cases in the SIG. Of the SIG, 15.3% were of nonwhite ethnicity but accounted for 28.6% of food allergy cases in the SIG, and a significantly greater proportion of nonwhite participants had visible eczema and/or IgE food-specific sensitization at enrollment (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E5</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig E9</xref>). Furthermore, in the EIG adherence was significantly lower in those participants of nonwhite ethnicity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>, <italic>A</italic>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0160">Whilst 5.6% of EIG participants had a food allergy in the EAT study, 58% were nonadherent with the early introduction protocol. Hence the nonadherence rate was 10-fold greater than the food allergy rate. Notably, the nonadherence rate also significantly exceeded the prevalence rate of risk factors associated with developing a food allergy: visible eczema at enrollment (25%), enrollment sensitization to 1 or more foods on specific IgE testing (16%), and nonwhite ethnicity (15%).</p>
              <p id="p0165">In univariate analysis nonwhite ethnicity, older maternal age, lower enrollment maternal quality-of-life scores, and increasing SCORAD were associated with nonadherence to the EIG protocol. The enrollment factors that were found to remain significantly associated with nonadherence in the adjusted analysis were nonwhite ethnicity, older maternal age, and lower enrollment maternal psychological quality of life. Nonwhite ethnicity and older maternal age were associated in both study groups with postponing the introduction of allergenic foods, compromising the ability to be per-protocol adherent because the window for per-protocol–defined adherence was so short. This delay being present in the SIG could have been anticipated, having been reported in the Infant Feeding Survey undertaken in 2010 (Infant Feeding Survey 2010),<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and considered in more detail in the “Comparison with the Infant Feeding Survey 2010 findings” section in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref> section in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0090">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>. However, unexpectedly, this delay was present in the EIG as well, despite all EIG families having being asked to introduce the allergenic foods as rapidly as possible.</p>
              <p id="p0170">After enrollment, although the reporting of IgE-type symptoms in EIG participants in the key early introduction period was common (16%), this too fell far short of the 58% nonadherence rate. Furthermore, the great majority of EIG participants reporting such symptoms were neither sensitized to any food at enrollment (76%) nor had a food allergy (82%). The strongest association with nonadherence was the early emergence of feeding difficulties, with 40% of non per-protocol EIG families reporting some or great difficulty feeding their infant at 4 months of age compared with 20% of the per-protocol EIG families.</p>
              <p id="p0175">Enrollment eczema was not associated with overall adherence in the adjusted analyses (although it was associated with food-specific adherence to sesame and fish). This is likely to reflect the mild phenotype of infants with eczema in the EAT study. Of the 160 EIG infants with enrollment eczema, in 123 it was mild (SCORAD &lt;15), in 31 moderate (SCORAD 15 to &lt;40), and in only 6 was it severe (SCORAD ≥40). Having eczema in childhood is strongly associated with dietary restriction and a reluctance to include allergenic foods in the diet. In a study of 100 children attending a pediatric dermatology clinic, 75% were having some form of parent-instigated dietary exclusion, and allergenic foods, including dairy products, eggs, and cow's milk, were being omitted by 48%, 27%, and 25%, respectively.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0180">It might have been anticipated that enrollment sensitization could lead to subclinical symptoms, resulting in a subclinical form of pre-existing food allergy that prevented adherence. This was not the case. Enrollment sensitization was not associated with overall or food-specific adherence. Furthermore, the EAT intervention was effective in an intention-to-treat analysis in the enrollment-sensitized EIG infants.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0185">The early emergence of parentally perceived feeding difficulties and aversive feeding behavior by 4 months of age, when families had only just started introducing solids to their EIG infants, had the strongest associations with nonadherence in the EIG and were also associated with later introduction of allergenic foods. This finding suggests that families were trying to feed their infants the allergenic food, but if the family perceived that the infant was not ready or mature enough and they were struggling to achieve the study's stipulated consumption levels, then, particularly for certain foods and having reached a specific level of consumption in the key early introduction period, they did not attempt to escalate this level further beyond 6 months.</p>
              <p id="p0190">That infant maturity might be a key factor was demonstrated in our recent analysis of sleep data within the cohort. In this study we showed in an intention-to-treat analysis that early introduction in the EIG was associated with greater duration of sleep and fewer night wakings, as well as significantly less parent-reported very serious sleep problems.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Notably, EIG infants who were sleeping better at enrollment were more likely to subsequently be per-protocol adherent, suggesting that infant maturity is the link between the ability to sleep and eat better.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0195">Feeding difficulties were also shown in the Infant Feeding Survey 2010 to have a strong association with ethnicity (considered in more detail in the “Comparison with the Infant Feeding Survey 2010” section findings in the <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref> section in this article's Online Repository).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> However, survey questions about feeding difficulties in the context of a randomized controlled trial in which the intervention sets high expectations for the introduction of foods are likely to overestimate the prevalence of true feeding difficulties, which might be seen if a parent were left to introduce solids at a time and in a way of their choosing.</p>
              <p id="p0200">The primary strength of this analysis is that the EAT study cohort was recruited from the general population. The children were meticulously studied and have been shown to have demographic characteristics broadly similar to those of the population of England and Wales.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The potential weakness of our findings is the extent to which it can be concluded that factors pertaining to the difficulty in following the highly prescriptive EAT early introduction regimen might relate to the success of early allergenic food introduction in the real world. However, we have previously shown with modelling of our consumption data that mean weekly consumption of 2 g of peanut protein (50% of the recommended EAT weekly dose) was associated with prevention of peanut allergy, and a dose-response relationship for protection against peanut allergy and egg allergy was apparent.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0205">It has been recognized by others that when clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in trials, such as EAT and particularly LEAP, translating this into a public health intervention is complex, and the results are likely to be subject to effect modification in different populations.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Hence the call for plausibility trials to evaluate the effect of large-scale public health programs. Such trials serve to identify the barriers and facilitators of the intervention in the real world.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0210">Our findings suggest that there are certain groups who could benefit from directed support should the recommendation of early introduction of allergenic foods be adopted as a way to prevent food allergy. Specifically, the important factors were found to be nonwhite ethnicity, older mothers, and mothers with poorer quality of life. This also applies to infants with early-onset eczema in that although their adherence to per-protocol consumption of specific foods was not compromised compared with children without eczema, it is within this group that the majority of food allergy develops. Although these factors explain only a small part of the 58% of EIG families who were nonadherent, these groups of infants contributed disproportionately to the overall prevalence of food allergy in the EAT population. Indeed, our modelling shows that improved adherence in infants manifesting early eczema and from ethnic minorities raises the possibility of a substantial reduction in the burden of food allergy, with a 49% reduction if 85% adherence were achievable. Sufficiently high adherence rates with an early introduction regimen in these populations will be more challenging yet of great value.</p>
              <p id="p0215">The issue of ethnic differences in adherence to public health recommendations is well recognized.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> There is less of a literature on ethnic differences in adherence within the context of a randomized trial in which subjects have consented to enroll.</p>
              <p id="p0220">A recent study of 1000 expecting and 1000 new caregivers of infants less than 1 year of age reported questionable support for early allergenic solid food recommendations.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> However, it has been shown in Australia that updated guidelines issued in 2008 removing recommendations to delay allergenic solids have been associated with reduced delay in parents introducing egg and peanut into the diet.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Cultural factors might well be important. Although US caregivers can perceive early peanut introduction to be difficult, the majority of Israeli infants are eating 2 g of peanut protein per week without the support of guidelines or a public health campaign.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0225">A number of countries, including the United States,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Australia,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and the United Kingdom,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> have issued new infant feeding guidelines in light of the EAT and LEAP study findings. Where a public health policy of early allergenic food introduction is being recommended, a significant amount of public health support is likely to be necessary to help specific groups at risk of low adherence in order to achieve a substantial reduction in the prevalence of food allergy.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Clinical implications</title></caption><p id="p0230">Nonwhite families, those with older mothers, and those with infants with early reported feeding difficulties or early-onset eczema would benefit from support to achieve early and sustained allergenic food consumption.</p></boxed-text></p>
