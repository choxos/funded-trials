                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a symptom complex affecting 12–14% of the UK adult female population. Symptoms include urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, increased daytime urinary frequency and nocturia. OAB has a negative impact on women’s social, physical, and psychological wellbeing. Initial treatment includes lifestyle modifications, bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercises and pharmacological therapy. However, these measures are unsuccessful in 25–40% of women (refractory OAB). Before considering invasive treatments, such as Botulinum toxin injection or sacral neuromodulation, most guidelines recommend urodynamics to confirm diagnosis of detrusor overactivity (DO). However, urodynamics may fail to show evidence of DO in up to 45% of cases, hence the need to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. FUTURE (Female Urgency, Trial of Urodynamics as Routine Evaluation) aims to test the hypothesis that, in women with refractory OAB, urodynamics and comprehensive clinical assessment is associated with superior patient-reported outcomes following treatment and is more cost-effective, compared to comprehensive clinical assessment only<bold>.</bold></p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">FUTURE is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority randomised controlled trial. Women aged ≥ 18 years with refractory OAB or urgency predominant mixed urinary incontinence, and who have failed/not tolerated conservative and medical treatment, are considered for trial entry. We aim to recruit 1096 women from approximately 60 secondary/tertiary care hospitals across the UK. All consenting women will complete questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 15 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome is participant-reported success at 15 months post-randomisation measured using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The primary economic outcome is incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained at 15 months. The secondary outcomes include adverse events, impact on other urinary symptoms and health-related quality of life.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par47">Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome has been defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia, in the absence of any other pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">The Leicestershire MRC (Medical Research Council) Incontinence Study showed a 21% overall prevalence of OAB in women aged ≥ 40 years in the United Kingdom (UK); UUI and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) represented 11% and 36% of these women respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Epidemiology of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (EpiLUTS) study reported relatively higher UUI prevalence rates of 13.3% for men and 30.3% for women in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2016, Komeso reported a large epidemiological study showing that the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) increases with age; this was most apparent for UUI and MUI: the odds of occurrence of UUI were 2- and 9-fold increased in the 7th and 10th decades, compared with the 6th decade (OR 2.18; 95%CI = 1.5–3.15 and OR = 9.19; 95%CI = 5.56–15.20) respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The prevalence of MUI also significantly increased in the 8th to10th decades (both <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.005), but interestingly, the prevalence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) did not seem to increase with age in this study. Similar results were shown by the EPINCONT study of 28,000 women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The EPIC prevalence data estimates that the worldwide number of adults aged ≥ 20 years with UUI or MUI was 103 million in 2008, with projected increase to 127 million in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the prevalence of OAB/MUI is likely to increase in the years to come, especially given the ageing population in the UK.</p>
                <p id="Par49">OAB and UUI have been shown to have a negative impact on a woman’s social, physical and psychological wellbeing, leading to embarrassment, low self-esteem and negative effects on the productivity of working women. In extreme cases, women reported avoiding employment because of fear of embarrassing situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; 60% avoided going away from home; and 50% reported avoidance of sexual activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This debilitating social problem has significant cost implications to the health resources in the UK. The total annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) is £301 million or 0.3% of the total NHS budget in 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Costs borne by women and their families (e.g. for containment products) were £230 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Health-related costs for management of OAB and UUI was estimated at approximately €7.0 billion in 2005 across 6 countries: Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) shows the standard benchmark rate for a referral into a UI service for UK women is 0.8% (800 per 100,000 adult female/ year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In women diagnosed with OAB, the NICE Guideline CG171 recommends initial conservative treatment which includes the following: lifestyle modifications, bladder training and pelvic floor exercise and pharmacological therapy (anticholinergics and/or beta-3 agonist). However, these measures are unsuccessful for approximately 25–40% of women (i.e. refractory OAB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For these women, NICE recommends “urodynamics” investigation to confirm the diagnosis of detrusor overactivity (DO) before proceeding to invasive treatments such as Botulinum toxin-A injection (BoNT-A) or sacral neuro-modulation (SNM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NICE CG171 was the relevant guideline at time of the FUTURE study planning; however, the recommendation has not changed in the updated NICE NG123 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par51">Invasive urodynamics is a diagnostic test that involves the insertion of one to two catheters into the bladder and another one into the vagina or the rectum. The rationale for urodynamics is to reproduce the women’s symptoms and to identify the underlying pathology. During bladder filling, DO may be seen; these are uninhibited bladder contractions, which hinder effective urine storage, and are frequently associated with urgency and/or UUI. Urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) may also be seen, and if USI and DO incontinence (DOI) are both present, the woman is diagnosed with MUI. Urodynamics can also identify other pathology, for example bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor underactivity, which may influence the choice of therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Although urodynamics is currently the recommended investigation in the NICE guidelines for the assessment of women with refractory OAB and/or MUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the clinical and cost-effectiveness of urodynamics have not been demonstrated in well designed, adequately powered clinical trials. Interestingly, some of the current evidence on the value of urodynamics in these women suggests little impact, if any, on the post-treatment patient-reported outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Invasive treatments for refractory OAB</title>
                <p id="Par53">Current guidelines recommend BoNT-A or SNM as the treatments for women with refractory OAB following failure of conservative and medical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par54">BoNT-A treatment is an injection into the bladder wall using a cystoscope (rigid or flexible), either under general or more commonly local anaesthesia. The treatment, if successful, is usually repeated every 6 to 12 months.</p>
                <p id="Par55">In women with refractory OAB and associated DO on urodynamics, Brubaker et al. showed that approximately 60% who received BoNT-A had a positive clinical response on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale (PGI-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Secondary analyses from two recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of BoNT-A versus placebo suggested that successful treatment outcomes did not appear to be related to the pre-operative urodynamics diagnosis of DO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Chapple et al., in a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT, showed that BoNT-A significantly improves all symptoms of refractory OAB and quality of life (QoL); there was no impact of the pre-operative diagnosis of DO on the treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, Rovner et al. in a placebo-controlled RCT showed 57% of the patients were satisfied compared to 19% placebo at 3 months following BoNT-A treatment, irrespective of the presence of DO on urodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. BoNT-A is now licensed in the UK for treatment of idiopathic refractory OAB symptoms (with symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency) without the need for pre-operative urodynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">In a recent observational study embedded within the BUS RCT, 666 women with non-refractory OAB underwent urodynamics; the results suggested that clinicians and patients appeared to be guided in part by the urodynamics diagnosis in selecting treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Several confounding influences were identified, such as natural fluctuation of disease state, regression to the mean and Hawthorne effects. The economic modelling within the BUS study suggested that urodynamics can be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for women with predominant symptoms of OAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, this was based on fewer women undergoing invasive treatment in the urodynamics group. The authors reported significant cost savings in the urodynamics group associated with a small reduction in clinical effectiveness. It is important to highlight that the BUS study assessed a different cohort of women with significantly milder OAB symptoms and therefore the results could not be generalised to women with refractory OAB.</p>
                <p id="Par57">The principle of SNM is that electrical stimulation of the sacral reflex pathway will inhibit the reflex behaviour of the bladder. SNM is a two-stage procedure; stage one is a SNM test using either a temporary or permanent lead, connected to an external stimulator, while the second stage involves the placement of a subcutaneous implantable pulse generator (permanent implant). If a patient reports at least 50% improvement of the refractory OAB symptoms during the test phase, as recorded in the bladder diaries, they are offered the permanent implant. SNM has the unique advantage that patient outcomes are assessed before a commitment is made to the permanent procedure.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Three RCTs comparing SNM to placebo showed that 52% of patients were dry at 18 months and a further 24% reported at least 50% reduction in leakage episodes (<italic>n</italic> = 58); at 3 years, 46% were dry and 13% improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In one RCT, patients with urgency and frequency showed improvements in several SF-36 domains in the active treatment group (<italic>n</italic> = 51; 90% women) at 6 months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. NICE concluded that following SNM, up to two-thirds of patients achieve continence or substantial improvement in symptoms, with the beneficial effects lasting for up to 3–5 years after implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Around one third of patients may require reoperation, most often due to pain at the implant site, infection, or the need for adjustment and modification of the lead system. Interestingly, while urodynamics investigation is considered a standard practice prior to SNM treatment in NICE CG171 and NG123, confirmation of DO is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One recent observational study reported that pre-operative diagnosis of DO was not a prerequisite selection criterion for SNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Sequence of treatment in women with refractory OAB</title>
                <p id="Par59">The best sequence of interventions for women with refractory OAB is not known.</p>
                <p id="Par60">In 2013, NICE CG171 included a heath economic evaluation which suggested that BoNT-A was a cost-effective intervention, in comparison with either no active treatment or SNM and NICE recommended offering BoNT-A as first intervention to women with refractory OAB and DO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They recommended SNM for women unable to catheterise or who have a cultural or ethical objection to catheterisation (slightly amended in NG123 to women unprepared to accept risks of clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) with BoNT-A), or those with persistent symptoms following BoNT-A treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par61">Interestingly, evidence from one recent study highlighted that 61% of women receiving BoNT-A discontinued their treatment at 3 years while 64% discontinued at 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Most recently, Marcelissen et al. showed that only 30% of their patients initiated on BoNT-A treatment were still on treatment at minimum follow-up of 5 years; the majority of patients who discontinued treatment (98%) did so after the 1st or 2nd injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In an economic model comparing SNM with BoNT-A over a 5-year period with a societal perspective, Leong et al. reported a greater gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and a greater associated cost savings when patients were initiated on SNM treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. As the QALY gain from BoNT-A injection was lower due to the loss of effect with reinjections over time, SNM became cost-effective after 5 years compared with BoNT-A, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 27,991 Euros, within the accepted NICE threshold of £20,000 to £30,000.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Accordingly, UK practice varies and usually relies on treatment options available locally within the units. Our brief survey of the potential collaborating centres for the FUTURE study suggests a considerable number of units and surgeons offer BoNT-A treatment for women with refractory OAB with and without urodynamics evidence of DO. In addition, in tertiary units where SNM may be readily available, surgeons tend to offer women with confirmed DO the choice between BoNT-A or SNM after discussion by the local multidisciplinary team (MDT). Some surgeons indicated that they favour SNM in younger patients and/or those with associated voiding dysfunction or faecal incontinence.</p>
                <p id="Par63">In summary, the current evidence highlights the uncertainties and the need for a robust RCT to address this important research question which was prioritised by the NICE guideline CG171 research recommendations: “Further research is needed to answer the question of whether the use of invasive urodynamics, prior to initial or subsequent treatments, affects the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions in women with UI or OAB” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Rationale for the trial</title>
                  <p id="Par64">NICE recommends urodynamics investigation to confirm the diagnosis of DO in women with refractory OAB before proceeding to invasive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par65">For clinicians, urodynamics is traditionally considered to inform the counselling of women on the chances of success of subsequent treatments. However, in women with refractory OAB, urodynamics fails to show evidence of DO in up to 45% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The accuracy of urodynamics relies on well-calibrated equipment, experience of investigators and their interpretation of a number of subjective parameters. Standardisation of urodynamics is difficult and is influenced by wide variation in staff practice and equipment used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These factors raise a valid debate on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of urodynamics and whether it actually improves the outcomes of subsequent treatments compared to treatment guided by comprehensive clinical assessment only.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">From the patients’ perspective, many describe urodynamics as an invasive and embarrassing investigation and associated with an element of emotional distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Urodynamics is also associated with a risk of discomfort and urinary tract infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the majority of women find it acceptable if it will improve their outcomes post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Unfortunately, the urodynamics test may not replicate the patients’ symptoms in their day to day lives which questions the validity of the treatment options offered based on its results.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">For policy makers, inevitably urodynamics is costly to the NHS, including purchase of equipment and disposables, and the need for specialist staff. The urodynamics tariff was £256/patient at the time of the development of the study protocol. Policy makers are faced with the current pressure on health resources in the UK; therefore, there is a pressing need to direct resources towards evidence-based interventions that are proven to positively improve treatment outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Urodynamics is one such test that has been embedded in clinical practice without robust evidence of its clinical or cost-effectiveness. Current evidence shows urodynamics to have no impact on the patient-reported outcomes following conservative treatment of UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and for those undergoing surgical treatment for symptoms of pure SUI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, NICE CG171 has prioritised research to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of urodynamics in treatment of refractory OAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par69">The outcome of the FUTURE study would inform patients, clinicians and policy makers whether routine urodynamics investigation improves the treatment outcomes in women with refractory OAB and whether it is cost-effective.</p>

                <p id="Par103">We are comparing “urodynamics and comprehensive clinical assessment” versus “comprehensive clinical assessment only”.

                <title>Treatment pathways following intervention</title>
                <p id="Par110">In the urodynamics plus comprehensive clinical assessment arm the treatment pathway is guided by the urodynamics diagnosis and is in line with the NICE guideline (CG171; See Additional file 1 Treatment Pathway A). The latter recommends BoNT-A 200 units as the first treatment; however since its publication, further evidence confirmed the efficacy of BoNT-A treatment at the lower dose of 100 units with less adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and it has since been licensed in that dose. Note: Subsequent NG123 also recommended initial treatment with 100 units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">NICE CG171 also recommends offering SNM treatment for patients who are unable or unwilling to perform CISC or following unsuccessful BoNT-A treatment pending MDT discussion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, in view of the lack of robust evidence on the best sequence of treatments in women with refractory OAB, participants in both arms of the FUTURE study can be offered either BoNT-A (100 units) or the SNM test; the decision will be discussed in the local MDT or as per local standard best practice. This approach will vary between units depending on their local clinical practice and the availability of treatments. Participants with other diagnoses on urodynamics would be offered the appropriate treatments.</p>
                <p id="Par112">Depending on the clinical outcome of treatment, we will offer participants with persistent or de novo symptoms urodynamic tests and treatment accordingly or further/ repeat treatment according to comprehensive clinical assessment only.</p>
                <p id="Par113">In the comprehensive clinical assessment only arm, the treatment pathway is guided by the clinical diagnosis and non-invasive tests (See Additional file 1 Treatment Pathways B). Considering the evidence above, we will offer participants with clinically diagnosed refractory OAB or urgency predominant MUI either BoNT-A (100 units) or SNM test. We will discuss the decision in the local MDT or as per local standard best practice. This approach will vary between units depending on their local clinical practice and the availability of treatments. We will offer participants with other clinical diagnoses (such as overflow incontinence or SUI predominant MUI) and other appropriate treatments such as CISC, SUI surgery or other medical/conservative treatments as per local standard best practice.</p>
                <p id="Par114">Depending on the clinical outcome of initial treatment, we will offer participants with persistent or de novo symptoms urodynamics and treatment accordingly or may consider repeat/further treatment according to comprehensive clinical assessment only (e.g. we may offer patients with persistent OAB symptoms following treatment with 100 units of BoNT-A treatment the option of repeat BoNT-A treatment).</p>
                <p id="Par115">Deviation from the treatment pathways may occur depending on the local clinical practice and the availability of treatments in the participating units. However, the Chief Investigator (CI) or delegate will assess patterns of deviations.</p>

                <p id="Par160">A survey of the collaborating units showed that in clinical practice, the majority of women with refractory OAB are initiated on BoNT-A treatment (60–70%) compared to SNM (15–20%) or other/no treatments (10–25%). In addition, Rovner et al. and Chapple et al. both showed a success rate of around 60% in women with refractory OAB without the urodynamics diagnosis of DO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

                <p id="Par161">We have also established a consensus amongst clinicians and patient and public involvement groups (PPI) that for urodynamics to be worthwhile, it will need to demonstrate a minimum of 10% superiority over comprehensive clinical assessment only.

                <title>Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a}</title>
                <p id="Par184">We will compare primary and secondary outcomes using generalised linear models, with adjustment for the minimisation covariates (centre and diagnosis of OAB versus MUI). We will use sensitivity analyses to explore additional adjustment of healthcare professional effects which arise from a better diagnosis being made due to the use of urodynamics. This is similar to adjusting for surgeon effects when there is more than one surgeon within a centre.</p>
                <p id="Par185">The primary outcome is participant-reported success as measured by the PGI-I at 15 months post-randomisation (approximately 12 months post-treatment). For the primary analysis, the PGI-I responses will be dichotomised to “success” defined as “very much improved” or “much improved” as this is felt to be the best categorisation of whether the women are satisfied with their treatments and interventions. We will use a repeated measures mixed effects logistic regression, including the 6-month measurement to increase the power to estimate the treatment effect at 15 months post-randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par186">We will analyse secondary outcomes using the appropriate linear model. For example, we will analyse the less strict definition of success using a repeated measures mixed effects logistic regression in the same way as the primary outcome will be analysed. We will also analyse the proportion of women receiving invasive treatment using a logistic regression. We will analyse continuous outcomes such as the ICIQ-FLUTS scores and quality of life scores and the EQ-5D-5L using a repeated measures mixed effects linear regression.</p>

We will estimate QALYs using linear interpolation between time points. We will undertake exploratory analysis to assess the QALY loss related to urodynamics (e.g. anxiety and discomfort) by estimating the degree to which EQ-5D-5L values at 3 months post-randomisation are affected by time since urodynamic testing. If a robust estimate of QALY loss is produced, we will examine the impact of its incorporation into the cost-effectiveness analysis using a sensitivity analysis.</p>

The analysis will calculate total costs and QALYs for each patient and estimate the incremental costs and QALYs using a seemingly unrelated regression model with baseline covariates including age and baseline EQ-5D-5L score and missing data imputed using multiple imputation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par190">We will base the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves on the adjusted and imputed analysis described above. We will undertake deterministic sensitivity analyses to look at three sources of methodological uncertainty; societal perspective, the EQ-5D-5L tariff and any QALY loss associated with urodynamics identified in the exploratory analysis described above. Undertaking a sensitivity analysis with the EQ-5D-5L tariff is required as alternative tariffs are available; the current recommended tariff is the van Hout “cross-walk” tariff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]</p>

                <title>Patient lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                <p id="Par191">The primary analysis is model based. Such an approach is considered superior to trial-based analyses as it can be designed to better fit the research question and incorporate other relevant sources of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this particular situation, the model can incorporate the longer-term costs and consequence of using urodynamics which cannot be observed in the trial. However, the first 15 months of the model will be based on the trial results. The structure of the model beyond 15 months will be based on a pre-existing model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A key improvement over this model is the use of more appropriate utilities taken from the trial. In addition, we will undertake targeted literature searches to assess whether any relevant new studies have been published for the other parameters.</p>
                <p id="Par192">In line with the Rachaneni model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], exploratory analyses examine whether targeted urodynamics for a subgroup of patients has the potential to be cost-effective. In addition to Rachaneni, we will undertake two exploratory analyses:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par193">A non-randomised comparison of the cost-effectiveness of different sequence of treatments (i.e. initiated on BoNT-A vs SNM).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par194">A non-randomised comparison of the cost-effectiveness of SNM according to clinical assessment only compared to treatment guided by urodynamics.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par195">These two comparisons take account of the lack of randomisation using methods consistent with those of the analogous clinical analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par196">We will also undertake a probabilistic sensitivity analysis on the modelled results and its associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves generated. We will undertake a value of information analysis using SAVI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/">http://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/</ext-link>). The partial values are used to identify those parameters where there is greatest value in resolving outstanding uncertainty. We will undertake a deterministic sensitivity analyses to look at the three sources of methodological uncertainty; societal perspective, the EQ-5D-5L tariff and the length of disutility associated with urodynamics.</p>

                <p id="Par198">Interviews are semi-structured and follow a topic guide informed by literature review and discussion between study researchers and encourage participants to discuss their perspectives with regard to the qualitative study aims. Interviews are audio recorded, transcribed verbatim (including descriptions of non-verbal factors where appropriate) and uploaded onto a qualitative software package (QSR Nvivo 10) to aid data management. The qualitative researcher will conduct the analyses according to principles of thematic content analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par199">We will use theoretical purposive (non-probability) sampling to ensure the diverse characteristics of the population are sampled (e.g. participants varying in age, relevant clinical history (MUI vs OAB), investigations received (urodynamics and comprehensive clinical assessment versus comprehensive clinical assessment only), and treatments received (SNM vs. BoNT to include day case vs. local anaesthetic procedures). Sampling and analyses continue in iterative cycles until data saturation is achieved. It is anticipated a minimum of thirty to forty patient interviews will be undertaken to effectively capture the opinions of those in both arms of randomisation, the numerous potential treatments and treatment considered successful and failed. Approximately ten to fifteen clinician interviews are proposed to explore the clinical aspects of urodynamics with regard to clinical decision-making.</p>

                <p id="Par215">In FUTURE, we will only record adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the study interventions. A serious adverse event is defined as any AE that results in death, is life threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation or is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator.</p>
                <p id="Par216">All AEs and SAEs meeting the criteria for recording within the trial are recorded from the time a participant consents to join the trial until the end of their follow-up period. Every follow-up visit and questionnaire will inquire on expected AEs/SAEs. In addition, we will use open ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant to enquire about AE/SAE occurrence or re-admission to hospital and any further treatment received.</p>
                <p id="Par217">Depending on severity, when an AE/SAE meeting the criteria for recording within the FUTURE Study occurs, it is the responsibility of the local PI (or delegate) to review appropriate documentation (e.g. hospital notes, laboratory and diagnostic reports) related to the event. The PI or delegate should then record all relevant information in the CRF (and on the SAE form if required).</p>
                <p id="Par218">PI or delegates are responsible for notifying the trial office of any SAEs that require to be recorded in line with the FUTURE study protocol.

              <p id="Par226">BAUS, UKCS and BSUG are the UK specialist bodies with the responsibility of guiding clinical practice, policies, research priorities, governance and training in matters related to UI in women. UKCS provide urodynamics guidance and unit accreditation in the UK. They are well placed to implement the findings by influencing NHS policy and dissemination of evidence-based clinical practice to its members. The results of the trial will be included in updates of NICE and EAU guidelines, which directly influence practice in the UK and beyond.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par229">The FUTURE trial is a large, pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine urodynamics plus comprehensive clinical assessment versus comprehensive clinical assessment only in the management of women with refractory OAB symptoms.</p>
              <p id="Par230">The trial team established collaboration with the largest relevant patient support groups in the UK to provide insights from the patient’s perspective. The Bowel and Bladder Foundation advised on the treatment pathways, proposed assessment tools and outcome measures at time of study design. Unfortunately, they later ceased to exist as an independent PPI group. Bladder Health UK is a grant holder and part of the PMG providing clear leadership on the patient perspective and is integral to the development of the study protocol and all the study documents including the patient information sheet; letters of invitation/reminders; participants’ questionnaires and the bladder diary.</p>
              <p id="Par231">To maximise recruitment into the trial, FUTURE adopted a hub structure. Each hub has approximately 10 allocated centres and is led by a hub leader and a funded part time hub coordinator. The hub leader and coordinator support the trial manager with the set-up of centres, ensure continuous engagement of PIs and research nurses and promote recruitment within their hubs.</p>
              <p id="Par232">As with most clinical trials, recruitment and participant retention are key challenges. The study team has adopted several strategies to promote recruitment and retention within FUTURE. These include the following: the inclusion of Participant Identification centres (PICs), encouragement of collaborating centres to engage both Gynaecology and Urology departments, and organisation of regional hub meetings at which the CI and trial manager attend. We have made a recruitment illustration video which is available on the study website to aid sites through recruitment. We also utilise regular site and participant newsletters to sustain positive engagement with centres and participants. Finally, we opened more centres than originally planned (65 vs planned 38 centres)</p>
              <p id="Par233">NICE CG 171 was the relevant guideline at the time of the FUTURE study planning in 2017. In 2019, NICE updated their guideline on the management of UI in women with the publication of NG123. NG123 slightly amended their recommendation to “consider offering BoNT-A treatment, following MDT discussion, to women with refractory OAB in whom DO was not demonstrated on urodynamics” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There were no changes to the recommendation of routine urodynamics investigations in women with refractory OAB. These changes did not require any change to the FUTURE study protocol.</p>
              <p id="Par234">The results of the FUTURE study are expected to answer the important research question on whether routine urodynamics investigation in addition to comprehensive clinical assessment improve patient-reported outcomes following treatment and is cost-effective, compared to comprehensive clinical assessment only, in women with refractory OAB symptoms. The study results will have an impact on all the major stakeholders involved in the management of refractory OAB in women. The findings are expected to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines and treatment recommendations from NICE, UKCS, BSUG and EAU. For patients and clinicians, the study results are expected to facilitate and guide treatment decision-making. The results will also provide cost-effectiveness evidence for the NHS, which will facilitate decision-making regarding the allocation of resources for treatment, and provision of services.</p>

              <p id="Par235">The first participant was recruited in November 2017. The current protocol version is 10.0, 01/07/2021. Recruitment was due to complete on 31st May 2020. However, on instruction by the Trial Sponsor, recruitment was suspended on 16th March 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. At this point, 1022 participants had been randomised. Recruitment restarted in August 2020 and the recruitment end date extended to 31st January 2021. Please see additional file 3 for further implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
