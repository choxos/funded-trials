                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Postnatal depression (PND) is a global public health problem. There is a high prevalence of PND amongst ethnic minority women and major ethnic inequalities in mental health care in the U.K. Language and cultural barriers pose a significant challenge for access to timely treatment and interventions for British South Asian (BSA) women with PND.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The study, carried out in Manchester and Lancashire, England, was a two-arm single-blind exploratory randomised controlled trial. BSA women (<italic>N</italic> = 83) having a baby &lt;12 months were randomised either to the group receiving the culturally adapted Positive Health Programme (PHP) (<italic>n</italic> = 42) or to the group receiving treatment as usual (TAU) (<italic>n</italic> = 41). Follow-up assessments were at 3 months (end of intervention) and 6 months after randomisation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Using an intention to treat analysis, there was no significant difference between PHP intervention and TAU groups in depression measured using Hamilton Depression Rating Scale both at 3 and 6 months follow up. Using modified intention to treat analysis, women who attended four or more sessions showed significant reduction in depression in the PHP group compared to the TAU group and the greater number of sessions attended was associated with greater reductions in depression scores.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p>The sample was relatively small and the study was conducted in one geographical area in Northwest England; hence, these results may not be generalizable to other regions and populations.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>The recruitment and trial retention figures highlighted the ability of the research team to engage with BSA women, having implications in planning services for this group.</p>

              <p id="p0035">Postnatal depression (PND) is a significant public health concern and even though the burden of postnatal depression is high, it is often under diagnosed and, therefore, under treated (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Wan Mohamed Radzi et al., 2021</xref>). PND, which can range from low mood to psychosis, affects nearly 10 % to 15 % women during childbearing age (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Langan &amp; Goodbred, 2016</xref>) and, if left untreated, its impact goes beyond the mother and include developmental delays at one year of age, more frequent illnesses for the baby, failure to thrive, and impaired mother baby interactions (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Dadi et al., 2020</xref>). Long-term implications for children having mothers with PND include insecure attachment bonds and social difficulties with peers (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Glasheen et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, PND affects not only the child and the family but also comes at an immense cost and resource burden on the healthcare system (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bauer et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0040">The experience of PND is different across cultures and countries (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Arifin et al., 2018</xref>). The UK is a diverse nation and is increasingly being represented by individuals coming from different countries and ethnicities with heterogeneous cultures, religions, and languages (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Sihre et al., 2019</xref>). The British South Asian (BSA) population mainly comprising of women from Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh is the largest and fastest growing minority ethnic group (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Census, 2021</xref>). Literature suggests BSA women have high rates of PND (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Sihre et al., 2019</xref>). This disparity may be due to social isolation, financial problems, discrimination, deprivation, being a migrant and most importantly inequity in access and utilization of health care (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Latif, 2014</xref>). BSA women are often considered to be ‘difficult to reach’ due to language and a lack of understanding of culture (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Masood et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0045">Postnatal depression is a preventable and treatable condition but can be challenging as nursing mothers are often reluctant to take medications and lack knowledge about psychological treatments available for postnatal depression (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Howard &amp; Khalifeh, 2020</xref>). The Saving Lives, Improving Mothers' Care report (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Knight et al., 2015</xref>) for the period 2011–13, revealed that mental health problems were the cause of approximately one-quarter of all maternal deaths between 6 weeks and 1 year after childbirth, and that one in seven of those women had died by suicide. The report further suggests that in approximately 40 % of cases, if there was better health care, the outcomes could have been different. It has been reported that majority of the women do not access appropriate mental health support due to lack of awareness, family pressures, cultural differences, language and communication barriers, hence the women often suffer in silence (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Nilaweera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Sihre et al., 2019</xref>). When considering interventions that work best for women from ethnic minorities, social isolation, loneliness and lack of support are important elements that need to be included in interventions (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Masood et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of this approach in ethnic minority women and requires further research. <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">NICE (2011)</xref> guidelines emphasize the need to improve access to care for ethnic minorities and tailor health services to make them culturally sensitive. Therefore, in this exploratory trial, ROSHNI-D (<italic>Roshni</italic> means light in Urdu/Hindi), we tested feasibility, acceptability and the efficacy of a culturally sensitive group CBT intervention, the Positive Health Programme (PHP) (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2019</xref>) in BSA women with PND and compared it to a routine treatment group.</p>

The letter enclosed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Cox et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2014</xref>) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke et al., 2001</xref>) for completion and return in a pre-paid envelope. In addition, potential study participants were identified using GP Practice-based electronic case records. Practice staff and/or Clinical Studies Officers (CSO) from the Primary Care Network carried out the search. The search criterion was filtered to identify South Asian mothers having a baby &lt;12 months old. With the G.P.s' permission, identified mothers were contacted directly by phone via the practice or in person, in both cases by a CSO/practice staff member along with a bilingual Research Assistant. Female multilingual researchers also recruited participants from children centres, community centres, baby clinics, baby weight appointments and immunisation clinics. Other promotional methods included display of posters in community centres, and advertising via ethnic radio and T.V. channels.</p>

Women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were then asked to provide a second written consent for randomisation. Consenting eligible participants were randomised via an independent remote telephone randomisation service based at Manchester Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). The randomisation was stratified by centre. Ethics approval was obtained from the North West Research Ethics Committee (10/H1005/62). The outcome assessors were kept blind to the participant's allocation. All efforts were made to ensure that the period between baseline assessment and randomisation was no longer than 4–6 weeks. The G.P. was informed about the patient's participation in the trial and treatment allocation by a letter, which was to be kept with the participant's medical notes.</p>

There were no significant differences in age, or any of the questionnaire scores at baseline, although the PHQ-9 scores were substantially higher in the PHP intervention than in the TAU group, and almost statistically significant. There was no significant difference between PHP intervention and TAU groups for any of the scores at either follow up.

              <p id="p0215">Of the 66 patients who were depressed at baseline using EPDS score 12 or more, there was no significant difference between groups at either follow up on the numbers depressed. At 3-month follow up, 8 out of 26 PHP intervention and 9 out of 27 TAU participants were still depressed, and at 6 months follow up, 11 out of 26 intervention and 10 out of 25 control participants were still depressed. The analyses were repeated for the subgroup of 33 patients in each group who had an EPDS score of 12 or more at baseline. The PHP intervention group had significantly higher baseline EPDS scores than the TAU (mean = 18.7, sd = 4.1 vs. mean = 16.5, sd = 3.3, <italic>t</italic> = 2.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018), and they also had significantly higher baseline PHQ-9 scores than the TAU (mean = 12.7, sd = 6.4 vs. mean = 9.0, sd = 5.7, t = 2.4, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021), but there were no other baseline differences between the groups.

              <p id="p0220">Following the initial intention to treat analysis, a further analysis based on PHP group attendance was conducted. After developing consensus with our colleagues, completers were defined as those participants who had attended 4 or more sessions. Fifteen of the 42 participants in the PHP group did not attend any sessions, while the remaining 27 patients attended at least 4 sessions. Overall, the mean number of sessions attended was 6.6 (sd = 5.2, range 0–12). Spearman's correlation coefficient between the number of sessions attended and reduction in Hamilton score from baseline to 3 month follow up was 0.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048, with greater reductions in Hamilton score being associated with more sessions attended.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0225">This exploratory RCT was the first in the U.K. designed to meet the psychological needs of BSA women with PND. BSA women are often excluded from psychological therapies because of gender, language or cultural differences. Culturally adapted, evidence based preventive programmes to support maternal mental health problems are showing potential, though require further work (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2022</xref>). Through this exploratory trial, we were, firstly, able to demonstrate the feasibility of the trial procedures: we met our anticipated recruitment targets, the mothers were successfully randomised and retained in both arms, and no trial related adverse events were reported. Secondly, even though we were not able to provide evidence on the efficacy of the intervention, no significant difference between PHP intervention and TAU groups for depression at both 3 and 6 months follow-ups were reported. The present study can be considered an important step to improve current knowledge on conducting research with a hard to engage group who is at an elevated risk of PND. Thirdly, we also tested our ability to run a series of group sessions at multiple sites, in the local Sure Start children's centres in Manchester and East Lancashire.</p>
              <p id="p0230">A systematic review of guidance on exploratory studies to decide whether and how to proceed with full-scale evaluations of public health interventions (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Hallingberg et al., 2018</xref>) suggests randomisation within an exploratory study as necessary for examining feasibility of recruitment. We were able to recruit (<italic>n</italic> = 560) and randomise 42 mothers in the intervention group and 41 in TAU. Our exploratory trial also adhered to all key aspects considered crucial for conducting feasibility trials as proposed by <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Thabane et al. (2010)</xref> and these included: assessing the safety of interventions; assessing recruitment potential; assessing the feasibility of coordination for multi-centre trials; and increasing clinical experience with the intervention for future large scale trials. All efforts were also made to ensure that the duration between baseline and randomisation matched the average wait time for therapy of 6–8 weeks. There was no difference in this approach between the two arms.</p>
              <p id="p0235">Considering this is a hard to engage population, the trial retention figs. (76 %) highlight the ability of the research team to successfully respond to the needs of the mothers. Previous studies on group interventions with British Pakistani mothers have documented 66 % (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2019</xref>) and 50 % (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2009</xref>) respectively as trial retention figures. Several factors such as using native language, culturally aware therapists and facilitators, childcare facilities and transport assistance helped us to better engage and retain participants in our exploratory trial. These factors were identified in earlier studies conducted with British South Asian populations (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Gater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Mir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0240">Qualitative research is encouraged for assessment of intervention acceptability, its implementation, to examine retention rates, and reasons for drop out (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Eldridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">O'Cathain et al., 2015</xref>). We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 17) with mothers who attended the group intervention and the responses suggested that the culturally adapted PHP was acceptable to the service users. Cultural beliefs, values and traditions are considered essential in intervention planning and execution for maternal depression (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Jidong et al., 2021</xref>). The participants in our study also felt an overall positive change in their attitudes, behaviour and confidence level after attending the sessions (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Masood et al., 2015</xref>). Similar findings have been reported by <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2019)</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0245">A modified analysis of participants found that greater number of sessions attended was associated with significantly greater reductions in depression scores both using interviewer administered HDRS and self-reported EPDS scores. Similar results have been documented in a recent study on lower versus higher frequency of sessions in mental health care (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Tiemens et al., 2019</xref>) and the findings suggested that both improvement and recovery were associated with a higher frequency of sessions during the first three months of treatment. <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Forde et al. (2005)</xref> report that for reducing depression, attending 6–8 sessions offers more benefit than attending 1–5 sessions.</p>
              <p id="p0250">We benefitted immensely from the involvement of service users and the public. One of the main outcomes of the trial was that we were able to enhance awareness about mental health problems in this underrepresented population. We also ensured extensive patient and public involvement throughout the trial, including their input in refinement of the psychological intervention and the interpretation of the research findings. Several community events were held which offered Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) opportunities and we held regular research meetings at various clinics across Manchester and Lancashire to discuss the trial, which promoted the interest of the service users. Some of the participants were invited to attend our annual 2-day qualitative research methods course at the University of Manchester to develop skills to assist in interpreting qualitative data. The availability of a culturally acceptable intervention of proven effectiveness is the next critical first step in improving access. Further to this pilot trial, our PHP intervention is currently being evaluated in a NIHR funded multi centre RCT “ROSHNI-2” (ISRCTN10697380).</p>

              <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
              <p id="p0255">One of the major strengths of our study was that the team was able to reach out to a population which typically has trust deficit and reservations to access the health care system for postnatal depressed British South Asian women (BSA) and carry out the study with bilingual researchers which allowed participants to complete the intervention in their preferred language. Our strength, which has implications for service delivery, was also in our ability to run multi-site interventions for several groups across Manchester and East Lancashire area. The project has also provided a good example of collaboration with psychological intervention delivery through established Sure Start centres and multidisciplinary working including primary care, IAPT, community workers and health visitors.</p>
              <p id="p0260">There were a number of limitations that should be considered. The sample was relatively small. Further, the study took place in one geographical area in England; hence, these results may not be generalizable to other regions and populations. Further, the geographical proximity of many of the participants, both in the PHP intervention and TAU groups, can lead to the assumption that they were acquainted with each other with a possibility of sharing their experiences of participation in the intervention as well. Potential contamination therefore cannot be excluded. Another limitation of this study is the that we did not have documented reasons from mothers who dropped out and did not attend any of the sessions as this information would have helped us better understand the acceptability of the PHP intervention and the constraints mothers face in attending such sessions.</p>
              <p id="p0265">Our exploratory randomised controlled trial (RCT) has limitations regarding internal validity due to the discrepancy between estimated large effect size, which informed our sample size calculations, and the observed low effect size. This discrepancy suggests the study is underpowered, potentially leading to underestimation of the intervention's true effects, increasing the risk of Type II error, and thus compromising the internal validity. Additionally, the small sample size could have increased the impact of potential confounding variables, further limiting the findings of the study. While these issues are present, the value of this study as an exploratory RCT should not be underestimated. Exploratory trials are crucial steppingstones towards informing methodologies in future research. They can offer initial insights into an intervention's effects, help identify potential confounding variables, and guide more accurate effect size predictions for definitive studies. Therefore, despite our observed low effect size, our study's findings remain a significant contribution to the larger body of evidence, paving the way for adequately powered and methodologically sound future RCTs.</p>

              <p id="p0270">To our knowledge, this is one of the first exploratory RCT designed to examine the psychological needs of BSA women with PND. We have been able to assess the feasibility and acceptability of working with BSA women with postnatal depression, willingness for the participants to be randomised and the preliminary data to calculate sample size and power calculations for a larger definitive trial - ROSHNI-2 (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Husain et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
