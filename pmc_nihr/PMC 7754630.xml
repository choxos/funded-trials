                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Pharmaceutical treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have increased to include multiple classes of oral glucose-lowering agents but without accompanying guidance on which of these may most benefit individual patients. Clinicians lack information for treatment intensification after first-line metformin therapy. Stratifying patients by simple clinical characteristics may improve care by targeting treatment options to those in whom they are most effective. This academically designed and run three-way crossover trial aims to test a stratification approach using three standard oral glucose-lowering agents.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>TriMaster is a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial taking place at up to 25 clinical sites across England, Scotland and Wales. 520 patients with T2DM treated with either metformin alone, or metformin and a sulfonylurea who have glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) &gt;58 mmol/mol will be randomised to receive 16 weeks each of a dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitor, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor and thiazolidinedione in random order. Participants will be assessed at the end of each treatment period, providing clinical and biochemical data, and their experience of side effects. Participant preference will be assessed on completion of all three treatments. The primary endpoint is HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 4 months of therapy (allowing a range of 12–18 weeks for analysis). Secondary endpoints include participant-reported preference between the three treatments, tolerability and prevalence of side effects.</p>

              <title>Background and rationale</title>
              <p>In recent years the choice of therapies designed to lower glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has increased<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> but there remains limited information as to which patients may respond well, moderately or poorly to any of the treatment options.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Treatment intensification is recommended in a stepwise approach, with guidelines usually including a number of different agents after metformin in those without established cardiac or renal disease.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4</xref></p>
              <p>T2DM is a heterogenous condition and response to glucose-lowering therapy appears to vary substantially between individuals. Therefore, identification of subgroups of patients who respond well or poorly to a specific therapy, or with an altered risk of treatment-specific side effects, could improve targetting of treatment. This stratified approach to therapy is most likely to be successful if based on clinical characteristics and biomarkers that are readily available in routine clinical care: T2DM is common, most therapies are relatively inexpensive and most management is undertaken in primary care, therefore stratification based on expensive biomakers, or those with limited availability, is unlikely to be widely adopted.</p>
              <p>A number of previous studies have shown simple clinical characteristics and biomarkers are associated with variation in glycaemic response for individual therapies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> However, to be most useful for stratification a marker needs to predict differential response between therapies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Work by the MASTERMIND consortium using routine and trial data has strengthened the evidence that clinical features are associated with differential glycaemic response to dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP4)-inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)-inhibitors and thiazolidinediones.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Analysis of data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and a Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial (ADOPT) trial showed that sex and body mass index (BMI) above and below 30 were associated with differential glycaemia response between sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, individuals within a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) range, with a higher eGFR show a better glycaemia response to SGLT2 inhibitors while individuals with a lower eGFR may have a better glycaemic response when taking a DPP4 inhibitor (Janssen, personal communication from MASTERMIND industry group, 2014). The features identified (sex, obesity and renal function), are routinely measured at low cost, meaning potential stratification using these characteristics could be easily implemented in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>TriMaster aims to test potential glycaemic therapy stratification in T2DM using response to three standard glucose-lowering agents. It will determine whether subgroups defined by routinely measured features respond to a greater or lesser degree (with regard to glycaemic change) to DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones, and provide a resource for further investigation of stratification between these therapies in the future.</p>
              <p>These therapies were selected on the basis of differential response seen in pilot studies, and the choice of available oral third-line therapies at the start of the study.</p>

                <title>Overview of trial design</title>
                <p>TriMaster is a phase IV, academically designed and run, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 12-month crossover trial of a DPP4 inhibitor (sitagliptin), thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) and SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin) as a second-line or third-line therapy in patients with T2DM who have suboptimal glycaemic control on metformin alone or metformin and sulfonylurea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The three-way crossover will be undertaken as an efficient, faster and more cost-effective approach to address both hypotheses, requiring fewer participants than performing two 2-way cross over studies.</p>

                <p>Five hundred and twenty participants with T2DM will be recruited, aged 30–80 years on stable doses of metformin alone or metformin and a sulfonylurea with HbA<sub>1c</sub>&gt;58 mmol/mol (&gt;7.5%) and ≤110 mmol/mol (≤12.2%). Each participant will attend one screening and, if eligible, five research visits over a 12-month period (50–60 weeks max/min visit windows). They will receive the three blinded second-line and third-line oral therapies in random order for 16–18 weeks each, with no washout period between therapies. Participant feedback from pilot studies found repeated washout periods increased rates of withdrawal due to poorly tolerated hyperglycaemia. Once stopped, none of the three glucose-lowering agents used in this study have a continuing glucose-lowering effect beyond 4 weeks (all three drugs have half-lives between 7 and 14 hours so their effects should be negligible after a week)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> and HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurement reflects glycaemia over the preceding 8 weeks to 12 weeks period. HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements taken after 16 weeks will therefore allow a 4-week ‘wash-in’ period and effectively reflect response to each treatment period.</p>
                <p>Participants will each act as their own control, and on completion of all three treatments will be asked to rank the treatments taken in order of preference. Eligible participants will be recruited at 20–25 UK sites; the trial is sponsored by the Royal Devon and Exeter National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust and hosted at the National Institute for Health Research Exeter Clinical Research Facility. A full list of recruiting sites will be available via the ISRCTN registration.</p>

                <p>In line with WHO guidelines, response to therapy will be assessed by measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub>.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The primary outcome is the HbA<sub>1c</sub> value achieved after each 16-week treatment period. Should a participant be unable to complete a full 16-week treatment period, HbA<sub>1c</sub> will be measured and included in the main analysis if the participant has taken the study drug for at least 12 weeks.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes will be participant-reported preference between the three treatments, tolerability of the three treatments and prevalence of side effects. In addition, we will explore sex differences in response to the three drugs.</p>
                <p>Participant willingness to continue a drug long-term will be recorded at the end of each treatment arm. Treatment preference, taken as a ranking of the three study drugs will be recorded at study completion. To inform this decision, in addition to their experience on each drug, clinical information including HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements and weight change will be fed-back to each participant. Frequency and severity of side effects will be recorded throughout the study alongside the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) to allow a formal validated assessment of participant satisfaction.</p>
                <p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> assessment during the study will be performed in local NHS laboratories to ensure results are available for screening, and to inform final patient preference. Central laboratory analysis will be undertaken at the Exeter Clinical Laboratory at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust for all other non-safety sample analysis. All analyses are routine biochemistry tests available in the NHS test repertoire. All assays are CE marked, fully validated and accredited by the UK Accreditation Service.</p>

                <p>Investigational medicinal products (IMPs) will be supplied directly to recruiting site pharmacies by Tayside Pharmaceuticals, Dundee, UK. Tablets will be over-encapsulated in a hard gelatin capsule so that the IMPs are near identical in size and colour, and packed into bottles and distributed to each recruitment site (see the Randomisation, allocation and blinding section for further details).</p>
                <p>Participants will be instructed to take one capsule, once daily, alongside their existing diabetes treatment and usual medications. They will be given a Drug Information Sheet in place of a standard summary of product characteristics stating the expected side effects of all three treatments. To allow feasible visit windows and prevent participants running out of IMP, each IMP bottle will contain 126 capsules, the equivalent of 18 weeks’ medication.</p>
                <p>Where a participant is unable to tolerate a therapy, they will move to the next IMP in their randomised order, providing they remain clinically safe to continue in the study.

                <title>Randomisation, allocation and blinding</title>
                <p>The study has six treatment sequence permutations: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA; participants will be randomly allocated to one of the six sequences when confirmed as eligible in the study database. The study is double-blind and all clinical, participant and laboratory assessments will be made prior to database lock, final analysis and unblinding of the drug order.</p>
                <p>A block randomisation list (block size 12) will be created using Statsdirect by the Trial Statistician and the randomisation seed recorded. The randomisation list will be provided to the study database team who will randomly allocate blocks of 12 to each of the recruitment sites (to ensure balance between the six treatment orders at each site), with the allocation remaining blinded to the rest of the study team. The IMP supplier will provide each site with blocks of 12 drugs (four of each of the three study drugs) with the 12 bottle IDs labelled in random order to avoid the drug type being easily identifiable. The bottle IDs and contents assigned to each recruitment site will be recorded in the study database and accessible only to the database team.</p>
                <p>To ensure allocation concealment, randomisation will be centralised via the study database. Eligibility will be confirmed by research teams and the participant randomised to a blinded treatment order, allocated by the study database. Prior to research visits one, two and three, the database will allocate the next available IMP bottle of the correct drug type held at that site, according to this treatment order. Study prescriptions detailing the allocated bottle ID will be processed and dispensed by the site clinical trials pharmacy.</p>
                <p>Participants will not be recruited against specific strata; BMI and eGFR defined stratum will be monitored as recruitment and randomisation progresses. Data on the distribution will be provided to the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and if enrolment is unevenly distributed to an extent that the study hypotheses cannot be robustly tested, the relevant stratum may be ‘switched off’ by the data programmer to prevent further randomisation into the relevant strata.</p>
                <p>Participants who withdraw before randomisation will be replaced. However, once randomised, their data will be included in analysis. To maintain data quality and trial integrity, unblinding via code breaks will occur only in exceptional circumstances where knowledge of the IMP is deemed essential for the correct clinical management of the participant, a medical emergency where someone other than the participant has taken the IMP, or where this information is needed to establish expectedness of a potential Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction. The emergency code break table is available electronically on the study database requiring multiple confirmation steps to avoid accidental unblinding, and on paper in the central coordinating centre. In the event a code break is required this will be done by a member of staff independent of the main trial team. A study involvement card with study ID, IMP details, and contact information for local and central emergency unblinding will be provided to all participants.</p>

                <p>Within 2 weeks of screening, participants will attend a fasting baseline research visit. Baseline physiological data will be collected, along with self-reported compliance to existing diabetes medication. Participant’s personal priorities in choosing between treatment options and experience of side effects on current treatment will also be recorded. Participants will have underlying pathophysiology assessed in a 2-hour mixed-meal tolerance test using a standard meal drink (Fortisip). The meal test will be undertaken using 250 mL of Nutricia Fortisip or 160 mL of Nutricia Fortisip Compact. Equivalent products may be used where Fortisip cannot be tolerated. Blood and urine samples will be collected for analysis and future biomarker discovery at baseline, and then at 30 min intervals (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) following the meal drink. Participants at the central Exeter site will also be invited to provide a self-collected genital swab sample to identify development of subclinical colonisation of candida or bacteria.</p>
                <p>Subsequent research visits will take place after 16–18 weeks of study treatment. However, patients will be offered the opportunity to stop a treatment early and move onto the next treatment period if they are unable to tolerate the therapy. Visits will repeat the baseline physiological measurements with samples collected at a single time point. Participants will provide fasting blood samples for immediate measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and subsequent assessment to include fasting glucose, c-peptide, insulin, glycosylated albumin, creatinine, lipid profile and drug levels. Weight, blood pressure, adherence and data about patient experience will also be collected, including perceived side effects, preparedness to remain on the drug long-term and health-related quality of life. Where collected at baseline, subsequent genital swabs will be repeated at study visits two to four.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses and reporting will follow Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidance for randomised crossover trials.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This study is not designed to test drug efficacy but the effectiveness of stratification. Therefore, only patients completing at least 12 weeks on therapy (sufficient to allow HbA<sub>1c</sub> to reflect glycaemia control on the drug) will be included in primary analysis. In addition, we will perform a secondary analysis of tolerability examining whether the proportion of participants completing at least 12 weeks differs for each drug, both within strata and overall.</p>
                <p>Prior to main analysis, we will determine whether there is any evidence of carryover or period effects. Any carryover effect identified will be reported but not adjusted for in subsequent analysis. Period effects will be reported and adjusted for. We do not anticipate treatment effect carryover and have designed the study to limit potential carryover (as far as possible). Any period effect in the maximum 8 months between on treatment HbA<sub>1c</sub>s is likely to be minimal as mean progression is 1.0 mmol/mol/year (E Pearson, personal communication, data from GoDARTs population data).</p>
                <p>There will be two primary analyses, one for each of the study hypotheses. For each hypothesis the primary analysis will be to assess whether the difference in achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements for the two drugs is similar for the two groups of participants. The two hypotheses will be tested separately using linear mixed effects models to compare the strata on the two drugs of interest, with a random effects term for the participant. The key contrast of interest is the drug*strata interaction, where the strata is either obesity group or eGFR group. To determine whether there is a difference between drug classes in terms of the overall achieved HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 4 months on each of the drugs, we will fit an additional model. Drug will be a factor and coded as a dummy variable as the comparison will be across three rather than two drug classes. Least square means will be extracted for the three drugs. Similar analysis will be carried out with weight after 4 months as the outcome.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will examine the distribution of side effects reported across each of the three drugs. However, given the total numbers reporting each individual side effect will likely be small, we anticipate this will largely be descriptive, examining proportion of side effects observed with each drug.</p>
                <p>For analysis of patient preference, we will only analyse the dataset where the participants have tried all three drugs. The mean rank for each drug will be calculated and tested against the null hypothesis that there is not a preferred drug and therefore the expected value of the rank for a given drug will be two. Further investigation of patient preference will be exploratory.</p>
                <p>Reasons for missing data will be documented and the baseline characteristics of those with and without missing data compared.</p>

The original criteria were unnecessarily strict and did not reflect real-world prescribing habits. The amendment also removed the blanket exclusion for patients in concurrent clinical trials, providing sufficient washout period between IMPs.</td>

                        <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amendment to eligibility criteria to include patients taking metformin-only, or metformin and a sulfonylurea. This was adjusted due to the change in guidelines and prescribing trends leading to decline in use of sulfonylureas. At the time of study design sulfonylureas were the most commonly prescribed second line therapy in the UK. Subsequent decline in their use in favour of DPP4 inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> resulted in the inclusion of patients currently treated with either metformin and sulfonylureas or metformin only. We will perform a sensitivity analysis to determine if the difference in study ‘epoch’ (before/after this amendment) has any impact on the main study outcomes.<break/>Altered exclusion criteria also added ‘limb ischaemia’ due to updated safety information for canagliflozin, and an upper limit of HbA<sub>1c</sub>&gt;110 mmol/mol.</td>

                        <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amendment to sample size due to over-cautious sample calculations (alpha changed to 0.05), extension to recruitment period due to delays in regulatory approvals at study set-up and slow early recruitment, and additional secondary analysis included on the advice of the Data Monitoring Committee.</td>

Following advice from the Trial Steering Committee statistician, the protocol was amended to analyse only those completing at least 12 weeks on therapy, as this will determine whether the strata result in differences in response (we cannot adequately measure glycaemic response by HbA<sub>1c</sub> if the patient has been on the drug for less than 12 weeks). A separate analysis will be performed to determine whether the strata influence tolerability by assessing whether the proportion completing at least 12 weeks on therapy differs by drug and strata.</td>

                        <td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amendment to ensure ongoing participant safety and study integrity during COVID-19 pandemic. Urgent safety measures included (i) extension of visit windows to 14–18 weeks to allow greater flexibility for participants who are unwell/isolating, (ii) provision for remote visits with sample collection outside the usual research setting, (iii) ensuring participants remained on study therapy when only a remote visit is possible, by allowing an additional ‘continuation’ bottle of the same IMP to be issued, or when no other option, transfer to the next IMP without collection of blood samples.</td>

                <p>Patients were involved in the design and conduct of this study. Following pilot studies, the TriMaster Patient Involvement Group provided feasibility feedback on the study design and the outcome measures used to record patient preference and experience of the study drugs. This group and the Peninsula Research Bank Lay Committee members assisted in the design of patient-facing documents, including consent forms, study and drug information sheets and data collection forms to assess patient preference.</p>
