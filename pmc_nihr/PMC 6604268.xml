                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Reduction in sensorimotor function of the upper limb is a common and persistent impairment after stroke, and less than half of stroke survivors recover even basic function of the upper limb after a year. Previous work in stroke has shown that repetitive sensory stimulation (RSS) of the upper limb may benefit motor function. As yet, there have been no investigations of RSS in the early-acute period despite this being the time window during which the neuroplastic processes underpinning sensorimotor recovery are likely to occur.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A single-blinded, stratified, randomised controlled feasibility study was undertaken at two NHS acute trusts to determine the recruitment rate, intervention adherence, and safety and acceptability of an RSS intervention in the early period after stroke. Participants were recruited within 2 weeks of index stroke. Stratified on arm function, they were randomised to receive either 45 min of daily RSS and usual care or usual care alone (UC) for 2 weeks. Changes from baseline on the primary outcome of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) to measurements taken by a blinded assessor were examined after completion of the intervention (2 weeks) and at 3 months from randomisation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Forty patients were recruited and randomised (RSS <italic>n</italic> = 23; UC <italic>n</italic> = 17) with a recruitment rate of 9.5% (40/417) of patients admitted with a stroke of which 52 (12.5%) were potentially eligible, with 10 declining to participate for various reasons. Participants found the RSS intervention acceptable and adherence was good. The intervention was safe and there were no serious adverse events.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This study indicates that recruitment to a trial of RSS in the acute period after stroke is feasible. The intervention was well tolerated and appeared to provide additional benefit to usual care. In addition to a definitive trial of efficacy, further work is warranted to examine the effects of varying doses of RSS upon arm function and the mechanism by which RSS induces sensorimotor recovery in the acute period after stroke.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Over 15 million people experience a stroke each year worldwide and, in high-income countries, stroke is the single main cause of acquired disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are more than 1.2 million stroke survivors living in the UK with over 100,000 new cases of stroke each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">Advances in acute care have dramatically reduced stroke mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] but recovery of sensorimotor function of the upper limb remains problematic. Whilst two thirds of stroke survivors go on to walk independently, less than 20% recover full upper limb function and over half do not regain basic functions of the upper limb after several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Completing even simple Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) often requires a substantial level of upper limb ability and so persistent impairments in upper limb function produce negative effects upon daily functioning and significantly reduce independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Consequently, improving upper limb function is a core element of stroke rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Current treatment guidelines emphasise that rehabilitation should include high numbers of repetitions of motor tasks (repetitive task training, RTT) to improve sensorimotor function after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent work has also identified a 5-week critical window after stroke in which most of the neuroplasticity that underpins recovery of sensorimotor control of the upper limb occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This period presents a short but sensitive phase of increased responsiveness to rehabilitation after stroke. It also indicates that the intensity of training is likely to be key in this 5-week period to maximise neuroplastic processes and optimise the recovery of the upper limb. However, in practice, delivering high-intensity RTT in the acute and early subacute period after stroke is challenging. Difficulties arise as it requires participants to be consistently and highly motivated, and rehabilitation staff need to have the time and resources to support RTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Consequently, there is a clear and urgent need to develop and evaluate new treatments. Such treatments need to be delivered in the early, sensitive period after stroke, must not require significant increases in staff time, cannot be reliant on consistently high levels of motivation in people after stroke, and be able to be used by people with severe hemiparesis.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Repetitive sensory stimulation (RSS) is a largely passive treatment which has been recognised in healthy people to produce neuroplastic changes, similar to those elicited by repetitive task training. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These include lasting changes in corticospinal excitability which may be elicited via a GABA-ergic disinhibition and long-term potentiation produced by glutaminergic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">RSS interventions have predominantly been evaluated in studies of people many months or even years after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with benefits to sensation, arm and hand function. Recently, a small randomised, sham-controlled trial evaluating a 2-week RSS intervention in people commenced in the early subacute stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (at least 3 or 4 weeks) after stroke showed significant benefits to sensorimotor function including tactile discrimination and global hand function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, no studies have used RSS in the acute/very early subacute period (first few days or weeks) after stroke, despite this being likely to be the optimal period for recovery of sensorimotor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, there may be practical factors which influence the feasibility and acceptability of using the RSS in the first few days after stroke and of recruiting to, and conducting, a trial of its effectiveness during this period. Therefore, a study was conducted to determine: the feasibility and acceptability of using RSS in the first 2 weeks after stroke (acute and early subacute period) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Collectively this information will inform a future, adequately sized, randomised controlled clinical trial of RSS early after stroke.</p>

Supra-sensory pulses were delivered at a frequency of 20 Hz with an intensity of 1 to 20 mA by electrodes within each glove positioned on the distal and proximal phalanges, providing stimulation to all fingers. The intensity of the current was increased to the highest level that the participant could tolerate and, once this intensity was reached, the participant received 45 min of stimulation. This duration was chosen as 30 min of supra-sensory hand stimulation has been shown to increase cortical excitability, which plateaus by 45 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

                  <p id="Par30">Demographic data comprising type of stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic), pre-stroke and immediate post-stroke function (mRS), stroke severity (NIHSS) were collected on all participants prior to commencement of the study. Outcome tools that were anticipated to be the primary indicators of effectiveness in a future trial were used to measured arm function. The anticipated primary outcome tool was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). The ARAT is a 19-item observational tool. Items are categorised into four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement) with increasing difficulty. A participant’s performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally). It is well-validated in stroke rehabilitation and is recommended as the key functional outcome tool of arm activities after stroke by an international, multi-disciplinary expert group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Total scores either indicate no upper limb capacity (0–10), poor capacity (11–21), limited capacity (22–42), notable capacity (43–54) or full capacity (55–57) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The ARAT was assessed by an independent blinded assessor by viewing the video recording of the participants performing completing this test both at 2 weeks and at the end of 3 months from the randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par31">Secondary anticipated outcomes included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of upper extremity outcome tool (FMA-UE) which is a well-recognised and recommended observational measure of upper limb impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This test comprises four sections for the upper limb and each of the 33 items is a scored on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = cannot perform to 3 = performs fully). A maximum score of 66 indicates full upper limb capacity, a score between 48 to 53 indicates notable capacity, 32 to 47 limited capacity, 23 to 31 poor capacity and 0 to 22 no capacity. The time taken to complete the nine-hole peg test (NHPT) was also used to indicate dexterity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These outcomes were re-assessed 2 weeks after starting the intervention and at 3 months’ follow-up by a blinded assessor who viewed video recordings of participants completing the items on each outcome tool.</p>

Logistic regression was also used to assess the association between intervention and outcome, both directly and adjusted for baseline ARAT scores. It should be noted that as this is pilot study the study is not powered to detect differences in outcome measures and as a consequence no formal hypothesis testing is undertaken. The changes in scores in the RSS and UC groups were compared to published values of minimal clinical important differences (MCID) in acute and chronic stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Twenty-eight participants had known hypertension (RSS = 16, UC = 12), 12 had a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) (RSS = 5, UC = 2) and five had survived a previous stroke (RSS = 3, UC = 2). Seven participants had a stroke affecting their dominant side in the RSS group, with eight having a stroke on their dominant side in the UC group.

After adjusting for baseline ARAT score those patients who used the glove were still over three times more likely to achieve a good outcome at 2 weeks (adjusted OR = 3.10, 95% confidence interval (0.79, 11.39)) and 1.3 times at 3 months (adjusted OR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval 0.37, 5.02)). These differences are not statistically significant, but the study was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference. However, it provides sufficient evidence of efficacy to go forward to a definitive trial.</p>

                <p id="Par57">Based on these results, the sample size needed for a definitive trial of effectiveness of RSS in the acute period after stroke will be 550 participants, including a 10% attrition rate.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par59">This is the first study to examine an RSS intervention in the acute, very early period after stroke and provides important data regarding the feasibility of a trial of RSS and the safety and acceptability of the RSS intervention during this time. The rehabilitation undertaken in the first few days and weeks after stroke is likely to be immensely influential on long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The finding of this study indicate that the RSS intervention delivered in the acute and early subacute phases after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] appears safe and acceptable and may benefit upper limb function when used to augment usual care.</p>
              <sec id="Sec14">
                <title>Feasibility and acceptability</title>
                <p id="Par60">The first aim of the study was to examine the feasibility of an RSS intervention during the early acute period after stroke. The majority of inpatients after stroke did not conform to the inclusion criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 365) or declined to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 10) resulting in a recruitment rate of 11%. The largest number of potential participants were excluded as they had no or very mild arm involvement after stroke and/or had significant functional restrictions prior to having their stroke. Other trials using forms of RSS have reported some challenges in recruiting suitable participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This may have been exacerbated in the current study as participants were approached in the first days after stroke and so may have been more likely to decline to participate whilst others were unable to clearly give informed consent due to cognitive or communication problems (<italic>n</italic> = 37). These findings indicate that for a future trial of RSS, a multi-centred design will be required to ensure that the study is adequately powered and that different formats of presenting information and gaining consent for those with communication difficulties and/or cognitive problems should be considered to broaden inclusion.</p>
                <p id="Par61">Once recruited to the study, adherence to the use of the RSS glove was good with 19 from 23 participants completing over 75% of the entire treatment dose. There were few adverse events and those that were reported were relatively minor (dry skin, shoulder discomfort). There were no drop outs from the RSS group, suggesting that the intervention was well tolerated. From those that returned the questionnaire, participants found the glove relatively easy to use after practice and familiarisation and most reported benefit. These findings agree with other reports of RSS in subacute stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and indicate that RSS may be an attractive treatment for people early after stroke but are limited as a standardised tool to quantify acceptability was not used, and it is not known why less than half of those asked returned their questionnaires and hence this part of the result should be interpreted with some caution.</p>

                <title>Changes after the intervention</title>
                <p id="Par62">The ARAT, FMA-UE and 9HPT all indicated somewhat greater improvement in the RSS group when compared to the UC group, with benefits exceeding the MCID for the majority of RSS participants on the ARAT and FMA-UE. These outcomes were chosen as they are recommended by a recent roundtable for stroke rehabilitation experts and have demonstrated excellent validity, reliability and responsiveness to rehabilitation interventions for the upper limb after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Improvements on all outcomes were most marked immediately after the intervention period and the rate of improvement appeared to attenuate after the intervention had ceased. This might indicate that an intervention period longer than 2 weeks used in the current study might elicit even greater improvements. Few have used an intervention period of more than 2 weeks when evaluating RSS. Peurala et al. (2002) applied RSS twice a day for 3 weeks in 59 people with chronic stroke; Conforto et al. (2010) used it three times a week for 1 month in 22 people with subacute and chronic stroke whilst participants in Smith et al.’s (2009) study received 9 min of sensory stimulation four times a week for 6 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Whilst all reported some improvements in upper limb function, none used similar outcome measures either to each other or to the current study, making direct conclusions about the effects of dose impossible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This indicates that future studies should consider the effect of dose on response to inform the clinical use of RSS.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec16">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par63">A key limitation of this study was that the RSS and UC groups were not matched for time and attention and so the differences between groups may be simply attributable to a greater dose of therapy or the effect of more time spent with a health professional in the RSS group, and unrelated to the intervention content. The RSS group received over 165 min more treatment (RSS and usual care) than the UC group during the intervention period and the treatment received after the intervention had finished was not standardised nor monitored in either group. Others have shown that more intensive treatments can elicit greater improvements in upper limb function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and it has been suggested that this may be independent of the content of the intervention to some degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In their randomised controlled trial of RSS in the acute/sub-acute period after stroke, Kattenstroth et al. (2018) included a time-matched control intervention (sham) and found that there were very few significant differences between groups on individual outcome measures, including the NHPT used in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This highlights that inclusion of an appropriate sham treatment is vital in a future trial of RSS to ensure that treatment times and expectations of benefit are as closely matched as possible so that the presence and magnitude of any effect of RSS can be clearly identified.</p>
                <p id="Par64">Another limitation of the current study was that the groups were not fully equivalent at baseline. The RSS group was randomised to start their treatment 2 days earlier than the UC group, and the RSS group had slightly better function prior to their stroke (median pre-stroke mRS scores, interquartile range (IQR) RSS = 1, 2; UC = 2, 2) and marginally better stroke status (median NIHSS scores, IQR RSS:6, 5; UC 7, 7). However, despite stratification on NIHSS arm scores the RSS group demonstrated poorer arm function at baseline (ARAT FMA-UE), suggesting that the NIHSS arm score may not be sensitive or suitable to stratify groups in a definitive trial. Other tools which could be used to stratify groups to ensure equality in a future trial include the SAFE score and/or PREP2 algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These tools have shown an ability to predict the recovery of arm function in 75% of people after stroke but are complicated by their need to use transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may not be available in some clinical settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par65">Despite potential practical limitations, exploration of sensorimotor cortical function does have an important role in providing an understanding of the mechanisms by which RSS may elicit changes in upper limb function after stroke. Some have reported specific reductions in GABA-ergically mediated intra-cortical inhibition in the motor cortex which can be present even after a single 2-h RSS session in people with chronic stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] whilst others have found that a longer 4-week duration of thrice weekly RSS in people with chronic stroke did not significantly alter corticomotor excitability from baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings are supported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and indicate that the primary mechanism of RSS is likely to be potentiation via glutamatergic connections between the primary sensory and motor cortices, rather than alterations in intra-cortical excitability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, further research is needed to inform an ‘optimum’ dose of RSS to benefit motor function after stroke as inconsistencies in the data mean that there is little evidence on which to base current treatment parameters.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par66">The results from this single-blinded, randomised controlled feasibility study show that RSS is acceptable to use in the early acute period after stroke and that recruitment to a trial to determine its effectiveness is feasible but is likely to require a multi-centre design. This is the first study of RSS in the acute period after stroke and showed that an RSS intervention was well tolerated and that participants were largely adherent to the daily RSS programme over 2 weeks. The differences between groups at baseline suggest that a definitive trial of the effectiveness of RSS for people in the early period after stroke should consider using a more sensitive measure of arm function and/or a prognostic indicator to stratify groups to ensure equality. The RSS intervention appeared to elicit a tendency towards larger improvements during the intervention period than usual care alone, but groups were not matched for time and attention and the trial was too small to identify any significant statistical difference. Therefore, a future trial should include a credible control intervention, such as a sham glove. The differences between the measures of upper limb function between the UC and RSS groups were most marked during the intervention and were attenuated at 3 months. Whilst many studies have used a shorter intervention period than the current work, these findings suggest that further research is necessary to determine if a longer or more intensive programme of RSS could elicit larger changes in upper limb function than those seen here and to elucidate the mechanism by which RSS may improve sensorimotor function.</p>
