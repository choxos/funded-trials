                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>To characterize safety and tolerability of the selective PI3Kβ inhibitor AZD8186, identify a recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and assess preliminary efficacy in combination with abiraterone acetate or vistusertib.</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>This phase I open-label study included patients with advanced solid tumors, particularly prostate cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and squamous non–small cell lung cancer. The study comprised four arms: (i) AZD8186 monotherapy dose finding; (ii) monotherapy dose expansion; (iii) AZD8186/abiraterone acetate (with prednisone); and (iv) AZD8186/vistusertib. The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and identification of the RP2D of AZD8186 monotherapy and in combination. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and tumor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In total, 161 patients were enrolled. AZD8186 was well tolerated across all study arms, the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal symptoms. In the monotherapy dose-finding arm, four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (mainly rash). AZD8186 doses of 60-mg twice daily [BID; 5 days on, 2 days off (5:2)] and 120-mg BID (continuous and 5:2 dosing) were taken into subsequent arms. The PKs of AZD8186 were dose proportional, without interactions with abiraterone acetate or vistusertib, and target inhibition was observed in plasma and tumor tissue. Monotherapy and combination therapy showed preliminary evidence of limited antitumor activity by imaging and, in prostate cancer, PSA reduction.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>AZD8186 monotherapy had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and combination with abiraterone acetate/prednisone or vistusertib was also tolerated. There was preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, meriting further exploration of AZD8186 in subsequent studies in PI3Kβ pathway–dependent cancers.</p>

              <p>The PI3K signaling pathway plays an important role in many tumor types, but development of PI3K inhibitors is challenging because of toxicity risks associated with inhibiting multiple PI3K isoforms. AZD8186 is a potent, selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ. In this phase I open-label study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and recommended phase II dose of AZD8186 monotherapy and in combination with abiraterone acetate or vistusertib. Eligible patients had advanced prostate cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, or squamous non–small cell lung cancer, and patients with other solid tumor types were eligible if they were PTEN deficient/mutated or PIK3CB mutated/amplified. As monotherapy and in combination, AZD8186 was well tolerated, with few dose-limiting toxicities reported. Both monotherapy and combination therapy showed preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, which merits further assessment in subsequent studies.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The PI3K signaling pathway plays an important role in many tumor types, controlling cell growth, proliferation, survival, metabolism, migration, and angiogenesis (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>). PI3K enzyme complexes comprise a heterodimer between a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit. The p110 catalytic subunit is further subdivided into four isoforms: PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although the PI3Kγ and δ isoforms are largely associated with regulation of immune cells (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>), PI3Kβ has a broader tissue distribution and plays a key role in driving tumor progression, particularly in scenarios of inactivation or loss of the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7, 8</xref>). Increased PI3K signaling driven by PTEN loss is implicated in the development of solid tumors, including breast, colon, lung, and prostate (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>Development of PI3K inhibitors is challenging because of toxicity risks associated with inhibiting multiple isoforms, so one way to optimize efficacy while minimizing potential toxicity is to develop isoform-specific drugs. AZD8186 is a potent, selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ (IC<sub>50</sub>, 4 nmol/L), with minimal activity against PI3Kδ and selectivity over PI3Kα and γ (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>). Preclinically, AZD8186 has single-agent activity across cell lines and tumor models enriched for PTEN loss. In PTEN-null tumor models, AZD8186 combines in an additive manner with antiandrogens (e.g., abiraterone acetate), docetaxel, PI3K pathway inhibitors (e.g., PI3Kα inhibitors AZD8835 and BYL719), and the mTORC 1/2 inhibitor vistusertib, to deliver increased antitumor activity (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 12, 13</xref>). The vistusertib combination was initiated to determine its potential to achieve comprehensive targeting of PI3K pathway. This was in response to a number of preclinical studies that demonstrated PI3K pathway reactivation attributed to vistusertib's intrinsic mechanisms of resistance (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 14</xref>).</p>
              <p>We present data from a first-in-human, phase I, open-label, multicenter study of AZD8186 in patients with solid tumors. The aims were to: characterize safety and tolerability; identify a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for different schedules of AZD8186 monotherapy and in combination with abiraterone acetate (with prednisone) or vistusertib; and assess the preliminary efficacy of AZD8186 combined with abiraterone acetate or vistusertib in PTEN-mutated/deficient or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB-</italic>mutated/amplified triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), respectively.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This phase I, open-label, multicenter trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01884285) was conducted at 13 centers in Canada, the United States, Spain, and the UK between July 2013 and February 2020. The study had a multi-arm design (Supplementary Fig. S1) and included patients with mCRPC, TNBC, and squamous non–small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC). Patients with other advanced solid tumors with known PTEN deficiency/mutation or mutation/amplification of <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> were included if the tumors were resistant to standard therapies, or no standard therapies were available.</p>
                <p>The study comprised four arms (Supplementary Fig. S1). In an AZD8186 monotherapy dose-finding arm, patients received escalating doses and different schedules of AZD8186 monotherapy [5 days on, 2 days off (5:2); 2 days on, 5 days off (2:5); or continuous daily dosing]. Intermittent dosing schedules were investigated initially in preclinical studies and the 5:2 schedule was found to be as efficacious as continuous dosing. Hence, the intermittent schedules were taken forward into the combination arms.</p>
                <p>All AZD8186 doses were given twice daily (BID) on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing) with two doses taken at least 12 hours apart. From a starting dose of 30-mg BID (based on non-clinical efficacy and toxicity studies), escalations to higher dose levels (60, 120, 180, 240, and 360-mg BID) were permitted if no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in a cohort of three to six evaluable patients after review of safety data from three or more evaluable patients. The cohort was expanded to include six evaluable patients if one patient experienced a DLT, but recruitment ceased if two or more patients experienced a DLT.</p>
                <p>In an AZD8186 monotherapy dose-expansion arm, patients with PTEN-deficient/mutated mCRPC or TNBC willing to undergo paired tumor biopsies (pre-dose and on-treatment) received AZD8186 at dose(s) and schedule(s) defined from the dose-finding arm.</p>
                <p>In an AZD8186/abiraterone acetate dose-finding arm, patients with mCRPC received AZD8186 (60 or 120-mg BID; 5:2 schedule), plus abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg and prednisone 10 mg once daily in a fasted state (water only for at least 2 hours prior and 1 hour after each dose). In a dose-expansion cohort, patients with PTEN-deficient/mutated or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB-</italic>mutated/amplified mCRPC received AZD8186 plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone at the doses and schedule established in the dose-finding arm.</p>
                <p>In an AZD8186/vistusertib dose-finding arm, patients with mCRPC, TNBC, sqNSCLC, or other solid tumors received AZD8186 [30, 60, or 120-mg BID (5:2)] plus vistusertib 100 mg or 125-mg BID (2:5). A dose-expansion cohort (AZD8186 plus vistusertib in patients with PTEN-deficient/mutated or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic>-mutated/amplified TNBC) was planned but not conducted as clinical development of vistusertib was stopped.</p>
                <p>PTEN deficiency (centrally determined by IHC using the CST138G6 PTEN antibody assay and defined by an H-score ≤10; ref. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and deleterious alterations in PTEN and/or activating alterations in <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> [determined by local testing using Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified next-generation sequencing (NGS)] were prospectively examined in the dose-expansion cohorts. In the other study arms, testing was not mandatory, but PTEN IHC assessments were performed retrospectively when tissue was available.</p>
                <p>The study was designed, conducted, and reported in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The protocol was approved by independent ethics committees and institutional review boards at each study site. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>

                <p>Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years old) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. All patients had histologically or cytologically proven advanced cancer: mCRPC, sqNSCLC, TNBC, or confirmed PTEN-deficient/mutated or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB-</italic>mutated/amplified solid malignancy that had progressed after standard-of-care treatment. Patients with mCRPC were required to have a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥2 ng/mL. In the AZD8186/abiraterone acetate arms, patients could have received treatment with abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and/or docetaxel. The key exclusion criteria included: prior exposure to AZD8186 or any inhibitor of PI3K, AKT or mTOR; any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, or other anticancer drugs within 14 days before study enrollment; and inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function. Full inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Table S1.</p>

                <p>In total, 161 patients were enrolled, including 67, 25, 35, and 34 in the monotherapy dose-finding, monotherapy dose-expansion, AZD8186/abiraterone acetate, and AZD8186/vistusertib arms, respectively. Of these, 147 patients [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 63 (94.0%), 20 (80.0%), 34 (97.1%), and 30 (88.2%), respectively] received at least one dose of study medication (Supplementary Fig. S2). Of 14 patients who were enrolled but did not receive study treatment, the most common reason was failure to fulfill eligibility criteria (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 10). The most common reason for AZD8186 discontinuation in each study arm was disease progression [monotherapy dose-finding arm, 71.4% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 45); monotherapy dose-expansion arm, 90.0% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 18); AZD8186/abiraterone acetate arm, 64.7% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 22); AZD8186/vistusertib arm, 53.3% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16); Supplementary Fig. S2]. Across the four study arms, median age was 60–70 years (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most patients were male (60%–100%) and had metastatic disease (84%–100%), and the most common primary tumor location was prostate (65%–100%). The distribution of patients across the different doses and schedules is shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

                    <p>Of 63 patients in the safety analysis set, 53 were evaluable for DLTs. Four patients (7.5%) experienced a DLT [one patient in each of the 120-mg BID (5:2) and 300-mg BID (5:2) cohorts and two patients in the 360-mg BID (5:2) cohort]. In all four patients, the DLT was a grade 3 rash (macular, maculo–papular, or unspecified). One patient in the 360-mg BID (5:2) cohort, in addition to grade 3 macular rash, experienced grade 2 abdominal pain and nausea, and grade 1 diarrhea and vomiting, which were considered as AEs of special interest and counted as DLTs.</p>
                    <p>The RP2D of AZD8186 monotherapy was formally declared as 60-mg BID (5:2) by the safety review committee at the end of dose-escalation period and was, therefore, further investigated in the expansion arm. However, on the basis of subsequent evaluation of the overall safety profile observed at the different monotherapy schedules and doses evaluated in the monotherapy dose escalation, doses of 120-mg BID (continuous and 5:2) were later considered to be tolerated and further evaluated in subsequent arms of the study.</p>

Single cases of grade 4 AEs were observed, of which one event each of hypokalemia (120-mg BID; 5:2) and platelet count decreased (180-mg BID; 5:2) were considered related to AZD8186 treatment. Eleven patients (17.5%) had AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment (Supplementary Table S5). No deaths were reported in the AZD8186 monotherapy dose-finding arm.</p>

SAEs causally related to AZD8186 only (Supplementary Table S4) or vistusertib only were each reported in 11 patients (36.7%). The most common AEs causally related to AZD8186 were diarrhea (56.7%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 17), nausea (53.3%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16), and fatigue (36.7%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11). The most common grade ≥3 causally related AEs were increased alanine aminotransferase and diarrhea (16.7%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5 and 13.3%; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4, respectively). Six patients (20.0%) had an AE leading to discontinuation of AZD8186 (Supplementary Table S5). Two AEs leading to death (6.7%) were reported during safety follow-up (subarachnoid hemorrhage, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1; pulmonary embolism, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1); neither was considered to be causally related to study medication.</p>
                    <p>Overall, 20 patients (66.7%) and five patients (16.7%) had dose interruptions or reductions, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). The most common reasons for interruptions and reductions of AZD8186 were AEs (56.7% and 16.7%, respectively). Dose interruption or reduction of vistusertib occurred in 18 patients (60.0%) and seven patients (23.3%), respectively. No significant effects on cholesterol or glucose levels and blood pressure were observed following treatment with AZD8186 + vistusertib.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This was the first-in-human study of AZD8186, in which the optimal dosing and schedule were identified and supported by safety and PK data. AZD8186 had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, both as monotherapy and in combination with abiraterone acetate (and prednisone) or vistusertib, when compared against other PI3K inhibitors such as copanlisib and idelalisib (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24, 25</xref>). Dose-dependent effects of target inhibition were observed in plasma (60-mg and 120-mg BID AZD8186) and tumor tissue (120-mg BID AZD8186). The PKs of AZD8186 were dose proportional, without interactions with abiraterone acetate or vistusertib. AZD8186 (as monotherapy and in combination) also showed preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity by both radiography and PSA reduction.</p>
              <p>Dose discontinuations and reductions were consistent with rates described for licensed PI3K inhibitors, idelalisib and copanlisib (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>). Dose interruptions were slightly higher in the AAP and vistusertib combinations, mainly to allow patients to recover and restart therapy to derive further benefit from study medication.</p>
              <p>Gastrointestinal AEs (constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) and fatigue were the most frequently reported treatment-related AEs during AZD8186 treatment, and most were grade 1 or 2 in severity. In general, treatment-emergent AEs, including colitis, diarrhea, and rash, were easily manageable by best supportive care and short treatment interruptions at recommended doses but were dose limiting at the highest doses tested. This safety profile could be the consequence of PI3Kδ inhibition at highest doses tested but not at the recommended doses where PI3Kβ inhibition prevails.</p>
              <p>There was no clear pattern regarding the efficacy of AZD8186 in patients with PTEN alterations: of two patients with RECIST 1.1 partial responses, one had PTEN-deficient disease and one did not (mutation status unknown). Of five patients with prostate cancer with PSA responses, three were in PTEN-deficient disease, one was in PTEN-mutant disease, and one had no PTEN deficiency (mutation status unknown). It should be noted, however, that patient numbers were small, most patients with mCRPC were heavily pre-treated, and PTEN testing was mandatory only in the dose-expansion cohorts and was performed by IHC without assessment of genetic loss. AZD8186 remains to be tested in a different patient population and/or with a different combination partner other than abiraterone or vistusertib. Analogous data have been reported in similar studies, in which PTEN/PI3K mutation status was again evaluated only in a subset of study participants (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Further studies with AZD8186 or other PI3K inhibitors will be needed to establish the predictive potential of PTEN as a biomarker. In addition, PTEN deficiency/inactivation is only one of several mechanisms leading to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Several potential mechanisms of resistance to PI3K inhibitor treatment have been identified, including signaling through the RAS–MEK–ERK pathway via HRAS, compensatory increases in HER2/3 expression activating ERK signaling, and activation of the NOTCH–MYC pathway (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30, 31</xref>).</p>
              <p>A second PI3Kβ inhibitor, GSK2636771, is currently in development for solid tumors. As with AZD8186, first-in-human results confirmed clinically relevant target inhibition with the RP2D (400 mg) and a manageable safety profile (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), further demonstrating the proof of mechanism of this PI3Kβ inhibitor. A preliminary association between <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CB</italic> genomic aberrations and clinical benefit was also reported (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). As in the present study, the most common treatment-related AEs were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) and fatigue. A dual PI3Kβ/δ inhibitor, KA2237, has been investigated in patients with lymphoma, with preliminary results from a first-in-human study showing a manageable toxicity profile and promising single-agent clinical activity in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p>
              <p>The multi-arm trial design, allowing several different regimens, schedules, and combinations to be evaluated, is an important strength of the present study. However, the small numbers of patients in each treatment cohort mean that conclusions, particularly related to efficacy, should be drawn with care. In the future, trials with larger cohorts will be needed to further explore the efficacy and tolerability of AZD8186. Additional trials will also be needed to help understand whether PTEN deficiency or mutation status is predictive of response with PI3Kß inhibitors. One avenue for future development is the combination of PI3K inhibitors with immunotherapy, such as T-cell vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Other possible combinations for PI3Kß inhibitors include docetaxel and paclitaxel, as well as other novel therapies such as PI3Kα inhibitors in patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who progress after alpelisib treatment, where PTEN deficiency is a known resistance mechanism (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The efficacy and safety of AZD8186 are currently being evaluated in studies in combination with docetaxel in solid tumors (phase I; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03218826), and with weekly paclitaxel in gastric cancer (phase I/II; NCT04001569).</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>In this phase I study, optimal dosing for AZD8186 was identified and supported by PK and PD data. AZD8186 monotherapy at the selected RP2D had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, and combination with abiraterone acetate (and prednisone) or vistusertib was also tolerated. Target inhibition was observed in plasma and tumor tissue at the RP2D selected for further development, and there was some preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. This merits further exploration of the potential of AZD8186 to affect PI3Kβ-driven disease in larger clinical studies, in a more precisely defined population and in combination with other agents targeting this pathway.</p>
