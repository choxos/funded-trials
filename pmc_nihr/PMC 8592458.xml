                  <p>Improving adherence to self-protective behaviours is a public health priority. We aimed to assess the potential effectiveness and ease of use of an online version of the Risk Acceptance Ladder (RAL) in promoting help-seeking for cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, insufficient physical activity, or low fruit and vegetable consumption.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>843 UK adults were recruited, of whom 602 engaged in at least one risky behaviour. Those with no immediate plans to change (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 171) completed a behaviour specific RAL. Participants were randomised to one of two conditions; a short message congruent (on-target, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 73) or incongruent (off-target, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 98) with their RAL response. Performance of the RAL was assessed by participants’ ability to select an applicable RAL item and reported ease of use of the RAL. Effectiveness was assessed by whether or not participants clicked a link to receive information about changing their target behaviour.</p>

Compared with the off-target group, participants allocated to the on-target group had greater odds of clicking on the link to receive information (31.5% vs 19.4%; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.01–4.26).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Improving adherence to self-protective behaviours, or reducing harmful behaviours, is an important goal for public health [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This includes, but is not limited to, stopping tobacco use, reducing alcohol consumption, improving diet and increasing physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A commonly used framework for the systematic development of behaviour change interventions is the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A key process in this framework is identifying which aspects of someone’s capability, opportunity and/or motivation need to change in order for the behaviour to change [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This paper describes a preliminary evaluation of a self-report measure, the Risk Acceptance Ladder (RAL) [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], that aims to establish what aspects of capability, opportunity and/or motivation to focus on in a behaviour change intervention to prompt someone to take an initial step in making the change.</p>
              <p>There has been a large amount of research on tailoring behaviour change interventions to individual characteristics. A commonly used model, the transtheoretical model, has been used to tailor interventions according to a putative stage in the change process: ‘precontemplation’, ‘contemplation’, ‘preparation’, ‘action’, and ‘maintenance’ [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259949.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is mixed evidence that stage-matched interventions are more effective than mismatched ones [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0259949.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and there is also evidence that interventions that ignore stage matching can be more effective than ones that seek to identify the stage of change and only offer support to people who show an interest [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Risk Acceptance Ladder (RAL) was developed with the idea that people might themselves have some level of insight into what would be required for them to change their behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model as basis, the RAL proposes that there might be a natural hierarchy of factors leading to the current risky behaviour. The person may never have heard that it was risky, may have heard about it but not understood the message, may have understood it but not believed it, may have believed it but not been concerned about it, may have been concerned but not enough to outweigh the perceived benefits of the risky behaviour, or may have been sufficiently concerned but found it difficult for a number of external or internal reasons. If it turns out that people have some insight into what is preventing change, and this can be classified hierarchically, a brief questionnaire may provide a useful starting point for targeting interventions to initiate change. This is an unknown and so it was important to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the RAL.</p>
              <p>This study aimed to evaluate an online version of the RAL focusing on four important health-related behaviours: smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical activity. In principle, the approach could be used for other health behaviours such as risky driving, infection control or sexual health behaviours. The choice of an online test of the tool was motivated by the fact that, if it was shown to have some value, it would be easy to implement through websites and online platforms, and also that it was possible to establish an easily measurable behavioural response in terms of ‘clicking through’ to a page that would represent a first stage in the change process.</p>
              <p>The research questions addressed by the current study were:</p>

                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>To assess effectiveness: Does messaging that directly addresses the selected ‘rung’ (on-target messaging) lead to a greater likelihood of taking an initial step in making the change than messaging that addresses a different ‘rung’ (off-target messaging)?</p>

                <p>A tiered eligibility procedure was employed (see <xref rid="pone.0259949.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To be eligible to take part, participants had to reside in the UK, be aged 18+ years, engage in at least one unhealthy behaviour (i.e. cigarette smoking, daily or almost daily alcohol consumption, lack of daily physical activity of at least 30 minutes, or eating less than five portions of fruit or vegetables daily) and have no immediate plans to change their behaviour.</p>

                <p>A link to the study was sent to students at a large UK university via a monthly e-newsletter and the study was advertised on four websites which allow researchers to connect with potential participants. In addition, a pay-per-click advert was posted on Facebook and a link to the study website was shared by members of the research team on social media platforms, including Twitter. Due to the recruitment strategies used, it was not possible to determine how many people were reached by the recruitment methods and to estimate a response rate.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>A website was built that enabled participants to take part in the research using either a computer or a mobile device. First, information about the research was provided and participants were asked to provide informed consent. Consenting participants were presented with an online survey to determine eligibility. Those who indicated that they engaged in at least one unhealthy behaviour were assigned a target for change. Participants who engaged in more than one unhealthy behaviour were randomly assigned to a single target behaviour by a computer algorithm. Next, participants were asked about plans to change their behaviour. Those with no immediate plans to change were presented the RAL (see <xref rid="pone.0259949.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and asked to select one statement that most closely described what they believed would need to change in order to change their target behaviour. Participants who completed the RAL were subsequently individually randomised using computer-generated random numbers on a 50–50 basis to one of the two intervention conditions.</p>

                  <title>Bayes factors</title>
                  <p>Given the relatively small sample size and thus low level of power to detect anything other than large effects, classical inferential statistics is limited in the event of non-significant results as it is unable to distinguish between insensitive data and the null hypothesis being correct. For this reason, we planned to analyse the data using a Bayesian approach in the case of non-significant results. The calculation of a Bayes Factor (BF) establishes the relative likelihood of the null versus the experimental hypothesis. Values greater than 3 or smaller than 1/3 are typically regarded as providing substantial evidence for the alternative or null hypothesis, respectively, with intermediate values indicating that data are insensitive to distinguish between the two [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. BFs were calculated using an online calculator (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_Dienes/inference/Bayes.htm" ext-link-type="uri">www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_Dienes/inference/Bayes.htm</ext-link>) with the alternative hypotheses conservatively represented in each case by a half-normal distribution, where the alternative hypothesis is represented by a population mean of zero and the standard deviation of the distribution specified as an expected, reasonable effect size. This means that plausible values have been effectively represented between zero and twice the effect size, with smaller values represented as being more likely. As no prior data existed on likely effect sizes, we calculated BFs for postulated small (OR = 1.68), medium (OR = 3.47) and large (OR = 6.71) effects [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <p>A total of 177 participants had no immediate plans to change their target behaviour. This group was older and more likely to be male than those with plans, but no other differences were observed (see <xref rid="pone.0259949.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Other than the item ‘I heard that [insert target behaviour] is risky but never fully understood what the problem was’, all RAL items were endorsed at least once. The most commonly endorsed items were ‘I think it is worth [changing target behaviour] but it is not a priority at the moment’ (28.3%) and ‘Other’ (31.1%) (see <xref rid="pone.0259949.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Motivation (captured by three RAL items; see <xref rid="pone.0259949.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) was the most frequently endorsed COM-B category (65.8%).</p>

Over half of those who selected ‘Other’ (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 29) provided their own reason for not yet changing their target behaviour (see <xref rid="pone.0259949.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most common themes were that participants disputed that their current behaviour is problematic and that a physical illness or condition prevented behaviour change. These themes align with the COM-B categories of psychological and physical capability, respectively. The remaining themes also addressed issues captured by COM-B categories, such as motivation and opportunity, including enjoyment of the risky behaviour, monetary costs of changing the behaviour, and beliefs about health consequences, such as: “<italic toggle="yes">To give up (smoking)</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I feel</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">would put my body into shock</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and would probably kill me</italic>”.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study examined the potential effectiveness and ease of use of an online version of the RAL in promoting help-seeking for a range of health behaviours. The RAL appeared to be relatively easy to complete by the participants, with most participants being able to select a single ‘rung’ on the ladder. Tailoring messaging to the selected rung may have increased the likelihood that the participant would take an initial step towards changing their behaviour. This finding adds to the currently mixed evidence on the effectiveness of health interventions tailored to participants’ motivational stage, assessed at baseline [<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0259949.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>As over two thirds of participants were able to successfully use the RAL to classify the source of their inability to change, and a similar proportion found the RAL easy to use, it would seem that this new measure has good usability. The scalability of the RAL and the targeted messaging is also promising; once targeted messages have been developed, they can be delivered to a large number of people at the click of a button. This requires few resources and minimal input from trained staff. Hence, the RAL might be useful for clinicians and policy makers who wish to assess reasons for health behaviour inertia and to prompt engagement with health behaviour change interventions.</p>
              <p>When asking participants who selected ‘Other’ on the RAL to provide their own reason for not changing, the most commonly provided response was that participants did not think that their current behaviour, or the level at which they were currently performing a particular behaviour, was unhealthy or problematic. This theme closely relates to existing items on the RAL (i.e. the first two items), and maps onto the construct of psychological capability in the COM-B model. Nearly half of the participants who selected ‘Other’ fell into this category. Rewording the existing two items to more closely reflect people’s understanding of its content (e.g. by means of cognitive interviews) may therefore help people self-classify more easily on the RAL. However, some free-text responses were not easily captured by existing RAL items, most notably the inability to change behaviour due to a physical illness or condition (endorsed by a quarter of participants who selected ‘Other’). This previously unaddressed theme relates to physical capability in the COM-B model and an additional item to capture this issue (e.g. “I don’t think I can XXXX because I am not physically able to do so” or “I don’t think I can XXXX because it will make me physically uncomfortable in some way”) has the potential to add to the value of the RAL. Thus, further qualitative work is required to explore a wider range of RAL items. Moreover, further research using the RAL would benefit from allowing participants to rate the messages they received in terms of perceived personal relevance and interest. Following further development of the measure, our results indicate that the evaluation of the RAL-based targeted messaging in a fully powered RCT may be warranted.</p>
              <sec id="sec029">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study had several limitations. First, as this pilot study was not pre-registered, the results should be considered exploratory. Second, there was a lack of early user involvement in the development of the RAL. As mentioned above, further qualitative work is therefore needed to explore a wider range of RAL items. Third, due to the small sample size, it was not possible to estimate whether the targeted messages were equally effective for all health behaviours. Fourth, although the on-target intervention was found to increase subsequent engagement with health messaging, it is unclear whether this engagement translates to actual behaviour change. Fifth, respondents who selected ‘Other’ on the RAL received off-target messages, with sensitivity analyses conducted to assess whether the direction of the effect remained robust when excluding this group. Although the exclusion of those who selected ‘Other’ did not alter the direction of the effect, the difference no longer reached statistical significance. This may be due to low power for this comparison or be indicative of a potential bias whereby those selecting ‘Other’ were consistently less motivated to change compared with those who were able to select a single ‘rung’ on the RAL. Sixth, our recruitment primarily targeted university students, with the resulting sample being predominantly White, female and relatively young (i.e. an average age of ~30 years). This likely limits the generalisability of the results to the general population without current plans to change the selected health behaviours. Finally, as the study was conducted in 2015, future applications of the RAL may benefit from updating the website design to ensure it aligns with users’ evolving expectations.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Review PLOS ONE - Risk Acceptance Ladder</p>
              <p>This article describes a study exploring the use and potential effectiveness of an electronic questionnaire and automated response to promote help seeking for four risky health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and fruit/vegetable consumption). Among 816 participants included, 602 had at least on risky behavior, and 28% of these had no plan to change this/these behavior(s) and took part in the study. About 2/3 of participants were able to select an applicable item on the tested scale (the Risk Acceptance Ladder - RAL). Also, about 2/3 of participants reported that it was easy to select one option. Participants were then randomized to receive a short message, which was either congruent or incongruent with their RAL response. Compared with the incongruent group, participants allocated to the congruent group had greater odds of clicking on a link to receive further information about this risky behavior.</p>
              <p>Overall, this study is scientifically sound and was carefully conducted. The reporting is of excellent quality in general. Nevertheless, a few caveats are to be considered to strengthen this manuscript. Those are listed below.</p>
              <p>p.5 lines 118-129, Procedure. This section describes the participants flow. Part of it is redundant with the first section of the results (p. 9-10).</p>
              <p>p.8, line 211, “Free-text responses were coded and summarised in line with standard thematic analysis (17)”. Authors should develop their description of this analysis. Referring to a methods article is not sufficient. Qualitative analysis should be indicated as a sub-heading and details on how it was conducted should be provided. How exactly were data coded? Who did code the responses? Was there double coding? Any triangulation of the data and related coding? Also, authors should discuss the potential limitations of their analytic perspective in the relative discussion section.</p>
              <p>The discussion is quite succinct and does not put the findings in perspective with the literature in the field.</p>
              <p>Discussion, 2nd paragraph. Authors should discuss the small effect size and the low proportion of participants “engaging” further (31%, respectively 19%, accessed a website, but we do not know how far they went on this website).</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This paper is clear and well written. It reports on a potentially useful approach for targeting health behaviour change with patients in time constrained settings.</p>
              <p>A few suggestions to enhance the completeness of the paper:</p>
              <p>- Recruitment targeted university students in one avenue, did this limit the demographics of the sample – they were predominantly white, were they also educated, and what are the potential implications of this?</p>
              <p>- The data is quite old, having been collected in 2015. I’m not sure if that is relevant but it seems a long gestation time for this study.</p>
              <p>- The measure of ‘excessive alcohol consumption’ seems somewhat crude – drinking every day is not in itself excessive if the daily consumption is limited to less than two standard drinks – perhaps the authors could provide some explanation/justification for the health behaviour measures chosen.</p>
              <p>- The high rate of endorsement of ‘other’ seems to suggest that the RAL is missing important patient beliefs which could be incorporated in an adjusted version. The authors mention possible re-wording but could provide more specific examples of potential future adaptations.</p>
              <p>- The authors have conducted appropriate sensitivity analysis to capture the potential bias, nut could be more explicit in the discussion in addressing the fact that respondents selecting ‘other’, who all cited negative attitudes towards behaviour change or disbelief of the risks of the behaviour, were allocated to off target messages – this could bias the results in that the motivation levels of these individuals would appear to be lower than that of people who can least appreciate the value of the indicated behaviour change.</p>
              <p>- The limited nature of outcome assessment should be specifically addressed in the discussion – the impact of targeted messaging is limited to clicks to relevant websites which is an immediate measure only, and does not indicate intentions or actual behaviour change.</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Shahab,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p> Our guidelines for data availability (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>) indicate that: For studies analyzing data collected as part of qualitative research, authors should make excerpts of the transcripts relevant to the study available in an appropriate data repository, within the paper, or upon request if they cannot be shared publicly. If even sharing excerpts would violate the agreement to which the participants consented, authors should explain this restriction and what data they are able to share in their Data Availability Statement.As your manuscript only contains one quote, we don't think that this has been met. We request that you update your data availability statement and indicate whether the qualitative data can be shared, and where they can be obtained. Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 29 2021 11:59PM.

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Authors adequately addresed reviewers' comments and the current manuscript has been improved and would be ready for publication.</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>7. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
              <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
              <p><bold>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review?</bold> For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.plos.org/privacy-policy" ext-link-type="uri">Privacy Policy</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>[NOTE: If reviewer comments were submitted as an attachment file, they will be attached to this email and accessible via the submission site. Please log into your account, locate the manuscript record, and check for the action link "View Attachments". If this link does not appear, there are no attachment files.]</p>
              <p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com/</ext-link>.
