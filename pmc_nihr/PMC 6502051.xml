                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>This feasibility study and process evaluation assessed the likely success of a definitive trial of intramedullary fixation with locked retrograde nails versus extramedullary fixation with fixed angle plates for fractures of the distal femur.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design &amp; setting</title>
                  <p>A multicentre, parallel, two-arm, randomised controlled feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation was conducted at seven NHS hospitals in England. Treatment was randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio, stratified by centre and chronic cognitive impairment. Participants, but not surgeons or research staff, were blinded to the allocation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Patients 18 years and older with a fracture of the distal femur, who their surgeon believed would benefit from internal fixation, were eligible to take part. Participants were allocated to receive either a retrograde intramedullary nail or an anatomical locking plate.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcomes for this feasibility study were the recruitment rate and completion rate of the EQ-5D-5L at 4 months post-randomisation. Baseline characteristics, disability rating index, quality of life scores, measurements of social support and self-efficacy, resource use and radiographic assessments were also collected. The views of patients and staff were collected during interviews.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Recruitment and data completion were lower than expected. 23 of 82 eligible patients were recruited (nail, 11; plate, 12). The recruitment rate was estimated as 0.42 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.62) participants per centre-month. Data completeness of the EQ-5D-5L at 4 months was 61 per cent (95% CI 43% to 83%). The process evaluation demonstrated that the main barriers to recruitment were variation in treatment pathways across centres, lack of surgeon equipoise and confidence in using both interventions and newly formed research cultures that lacked cohesion.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>A modified trial design, with embedded recruitment support intervention, comparing functional outcome in cognitively intact adults who have sustained a fragility fracture of the distal femur is feasible.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Distal femur fractures have an incidence of 10 per 100 000 and have a bimodal distribution with age, with approximately 85% sustained by older patients after a fall from a standing height and the remainder sustained by patients after major trauma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
                <p>There is currently no consensus about the best way to treat these fractures. A recent Cochrane review identified few trials in this area, many using outdated implants or with important methodological limitations and suggested that future patients’ functional outcomes could be improved by a well-designed randomised controlled trial comparing modern treatments.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
                <p>In a multicentre retrospective study to review current practices, we found that the treatments commonly used in the UK are fixation with a locked retrograde nail (nail) and fixation with an anatomical, angular stable plate (plate).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Nails offer minimal disruption of the fracture site, a potential mechanical benefit from a device close to the axis of the femur and stimulated blood supply from reaming of the intramedullary canal.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> On the other hand fixed-angle plates are specifically designed for osteoporotic bone, and the bone-plate constructs have excellent biomechanical properties.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However plates require larger incisions and are more expensive than nails. Limited evidence suggests that there may be a benefit of using nails over plates in terms of patients’ quality of life, with small studies identifying differences of 0.09 and 0.1 in EQ-5D-5L-derived utility scores at 1 year.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>
</p>
                <p>This study of fracture fixation with nails compared with plates aimed to assess the feasibility of a future definitive trial, and perform a process evaluation to understand the generalisability and likely success of a future trial.</p>

                <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
                <p>Patients aged 18 and over who were admitted to one of seven participating NHS hospitals in England with a fracture of the distal femur, which their treating surgeon believed would benefit from internal fixation, were potentially eligible to take part. Patients with a loose knee or hip arthroplasty requiring revision, or an arthroplasty or pre-existing femoral deformity that precluded nail fixation, were excluded.</p>
                <p>All potentially eligible participants for Trial of Acute Femoral Fracture Fixation (TrAFFix) and their carers, as well as all staff involved with the study at participating centres, were eligible to be interviewed for the process evaluation.</p>

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>Where patients had capacity to consent to be involved in the study prior to surgery, this was sought by hospital research teams. For patients lacking capacity to provide informed consent, the hospital research teams sought agreement from an appropriate consultee, either a nominated consultee (eg, treating surgeon who was not part of the research team) or a personal consultee such as the next of kin. Where a consultee gave agreement prior to surgery and the patient regained capacity following surgery, consent for continued participation in the study was sought from the patient.</p>
                <p>During the consent process patients and carers indicated their willingness to be approached for interviews for the process evaluation. Consent for interviews was sought at the start of each interview by a researcher from the University of Oxford.</p>

                <p>Following consent from the patient or agreement from an appropriate consultee, participants were randomised prior to surgery to receive either nail or plate in a 1:1 ratio using an online randomisation system. The trial statistician generated the allocation sequences. Allocations used fixed blocks of size 4 and were stratified by centre to ensure any clustering effect related to centres was distributed across arms, and by the presence of chronic cognitive impairment to ensure this important effect modifier was distributed evenly across groups.</p>
                <p>Participants were not informed of their allocation during the trial but were able to request to be informed of their allocation at the end of the study. Surgeons and research staff were not blinded. Radiographs were reviewed by independent assessors, however due to the presence of the implants they were also not blinded.</p>

                <p>Potential participants were reviewed in daily trauma meetings and operated on at the next available theatre time. Patients were assessed and received anaesthesia, analgesia and prophylactic antibiotics as per local practices. Preparation, positioning and reduction of the fracture, details of incision and approach and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary fixation</xref> with wires or screws were left to the discretion of the treating surgeon.</p>
                <p>For patients allocated a nail, fixation of the fracture was achieved with a proximally and distally locked nail that spanned the entire diaphysis of the femur. All nails were introduced retrograde through the knee joint. For patients allocated plates, fixation of the fracture was achieved with anatomical distal femoral locking-plate and screws, defined as those in which at least one fixed angle locking screw was placed distal to the fracture.</p>

                <p>We used a mixed methodology approach using a variety of data sources in the process evaluation including qualitative interviews with patients (n=9), carers (n=2) and staff (n=24), screening logs, national datasets and a 1 day workshop with patients and public representatives. Interviews were based on a topic guide that included participants’ experience of taking part in TrAFFix and the experiences of staff recruiting to TrAFFix. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim; data were managed using NVivo 10 (QSR International, Warrington, UK). Data were analysed inductively using a thematic analysis. Quantitative data were summarised using standard descriptive statistical techniques. The analyses were integrated using the framework of a process evaluation and summarised in tables.</p>

                <p>Of the 173 patients screened, the most common reason that patients were not recruited were surgeon preference for either a nail or plate (23%; 39/173), presence of a pre-existing arthroplasty (19%; 33/173) and a decision to treat the patient non-operatively (18%; 31/173).

                  <title>Reach of screening</title>
                  <p>During the 10 months recruitment period, 91 patients were screened and recorded on screening logs, usually by a research associate (RA). Of these, 54 were eligible to participate in the study. Retrospective review of screening by orthopaedic surgeons at each participating centre found a further 82 unscreened patients with distal femur fractures including 31 eligible patients who were not included on the screening logs. The number of patients added after rescreening varied by centre with between 0 and 34 patients added. At interview, staff emphasised that there were few patients eligible for the study, suggesting that they were unaware that potentially eligible patients were being missed.</p>

                  <p>The differing levels of experience of the research teams and research culture, evident in the approaches to screening, recruitment and data collection, within the centres may explain differences in the number of patients missed from screening logs. In some centres, not all surgeons within the team screened and identified eligible patients, while in other centres patients deemed ineligible might not have been recorded in the screening logs.</p>

                  <p>Interviews with research staff revealed that several centres relied on research teams to screen patients as the clinical team tended not to notify the research team of eligible patients. Screening was facilitated by the presence of the research team in the daily trauma meeting, as they were able to prompt the clinical teams to consider whether patients were eligible. The attendance of the research team in this meeting varied between the centres due to staffing and other commitments. Additionally, some centres found it difficult for the clinical team to keep the study in mind as potentially eligible patients were infrequent.</p>

                <title>Context</title>
                <p>Contextual differences between the participating centres may have led to differences in how the study was implemented. Surgeons’ working in departments where several trials were running may have been more engaged in research and more inclined to participate.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>‘However, that’s changing and we’ve got a lot more of the consultants on board now and a lot more involved in the trial… there’s consultants that are running trials in hand orthopaedics, the more elective side of things but also do the trauma lists and so are getting more involved with what’s going on in research and therefore they’re more happy to be involved in it and identifying the patients and things like that.’ Staff (RA) 4</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Some staff felt that differences in the size of the research team, their workload and working hours could influence how the study was implemented. For example, the presence of RAs in the trauma meeting could facilitate screening but required RAs to start work before eight, which was not possible in every centre.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>‘I’m keen to see what is going to happen when we do get the other research nurses going to the trauma meeting because I feel that that’s going to make a big difference and I think our recruitment will increase quite a lot but I might be completely wrong in thinking that.’ Staff (RA) 4</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have reported a randomised feasibility study, and to our knowledge the first with an embedded process evaluation, to plan a future trial of the treatment of patients with a fracture of the distal femur. We found the number of eligible patients screened closely matched the original estimate of 1.5 patients per centre-month. The recruitment rate into the trial, however, fell substantially short of this. The process evaluation identified very significant surgeon-related barriers to recruitment into the study. Research cultures were found to vary widely between centres; a positive culture was a strong predictor of improved recruitment performance.</p>
              <p>This study has challenged many of the assumptions which underpinned the development of the trial protocol. The recruited population had a much lower prevalence of cognitive impairment, less frailty and was physiologically fitter than the previously characterised incident fracture population.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Surgeons were actively selecting fitter patients for operative treatment in a way that we had not anticipated. The eligible population is therefore somewhat different than we originally expected and hence the design for the definitive trial can be modified in important ways.</p>
              <p>It is clear that research staff can and do miss potentially eligible patients if the working practices at hospitals do not facilitate full integration of the research staff into the clinical team. Although the specifics vary between hospitals, crucial decision points exist within the clinical process, such as daily trauma meetings, into which research staff must be integrated in order to be able to engage clinicians in research studies.</p>
              <p>Surgeons reported a lack of their confidence in the management of this relatively uncommon fracture, the operative treatment of which is perceived to be technically demanding. The combination of this common anxiety and some individuals’ lack of equipoise, posed a very significant barrier to recruitment into this study. Similar challenges have been previously identified in other surgical trials.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> Interventions that have included training on community equipoise have been successful when targeted at multidisciplinary teams and surgeons, improving both clinicians’ confidence and potentially recruitment rates,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> though definitive evidence is lacking.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> We propose that a modified protocol that includes an intervention to promote awareness and understanding of the existing community equipoise will be able to overcome these surgeon-related barriers to recruitment.</p>
              <p>Our findings demonstrate that the trial design tested in this feasibility study is unlikely to be successful on a larger scale. However, the recruitment rate of 0.42 participants per centre-month is in line with that reported by the FixDT trial, which tested similar interventions for treating fractures of the tibia and delivered to target and budget.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</p>
              <p>We propose a modified definitive trial with a further internal pilot to confirm recruitment rates; this will be based on the findings of this feasibility study, with an integrated recruitment intervention to support surgeons in their decision-making to recruit participants.</p>
              <p>A future study may choose to exclude the small number of patients with chronic cognitive impairment to simplify trial procedures for research staff or reduce the number and length of questionnaires to reduce the burden on participants and improve retention rates. Similarly a future study may consider a trial design that accounts for surgeons’ treatment preferences during the allocation of treatment to improve surgeon participation and willingness to randomise.</p>
              <p>We conclude that a trial comparing functional outcome in cognitively intact patients aged 18 years or older who have sustained a fragility fracture of the distal femur, defined as a fall from standing height, treated with a nail or plate, is feasible with appropriate mitigation strategies incorporated to avoid failure.</p>
