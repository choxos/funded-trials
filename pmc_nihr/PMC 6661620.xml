                  <p>Permanent artificial pacemaker implantation is a safe and effective treatment for bradycardia and is associated with extended longevity and improved quality of life. However, the most common long-term complication of standard pacemaker therapy is pacemaker-associated heart failure. Pacemaker follow-up is potentially an opportunity to screen for heart failure to assess and optimise patient devices and medical therapy.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study is a multicentre, phase-3 randomised trial. The 1200 participants will be people who have a permanent pacemaker for bradycardia for at least 12 months, randomly assigned to undergo a transthoracic echocardiogram with their pacemaker check, thereby tailoring their management directed by left ventricular function or the pacemaker check alone, continuing with routine follow-up. The primary outcome measure is time to all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalisation. Secondary outcomes include external validation of our risk stratification model to predict onset of heart failure and quality of life assessment.</p>

              <p>Permanent artificial pacemaker implantation is a safe and effective treatment for bradycardia<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is associated with extended longevity<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and improved quality of life.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> An estimated 350 000 people in the UK have a pacemaker, with over 40 000 new implants per year.</p>
              <p>However, long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing has been linked to adverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> such that the most common long-term complication of standard pacemaker therapy is pacemaker-associated chronic heart failure (CHF) due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> While up to 2%–3% of the general population have CHF, the condition is much more common in pacemaker patients with a prevalence up to 50%<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9</xref> and 12% of people admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (HF) (4% with a de novo admission for HF) have a pacemaker.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>It is clear that RV pacing alone can lead to LVSD; however, the risk is especially high in people requiring a high proportion of ventricular pacing, those with diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction and raised creatinine.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Data examining the relationship between pacemaker use and cardiac dysfunction predominantly originate from retrospective cross-sectional analysis or secondary analyses.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> We provided the first evidence that reducing RV pacing through careful reprogramming is associated with an improvement in LV function without affecting quality of life or functional capacity,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> confirming somewhat the suggestion that RV pacing is contributory to LV dysfunction in pacemaker patients and not just a bystander in a multimorbid patient population.</p>
              <p>Although there is increasing recognition of the axis of RV pacing and LVSD, it remains the case that HF is frequently overlooked in the pacemaker population with symptoms often ascribed to pacemaker syndrome, chronotropic incompetence or comorbidities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> HF and undiagnosed LV dysfunction have a major effect on mortality and morbidity among pacemaker patients.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> Since HF management accounts for approximately 2% of the healthcare budget in many developed countries, more than 60% of which relates to hospitalisation costs,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> optimal management of people with HF whether or not they have a pacemaker is a key strategy for controlling healthcare costs while increasing quality of life.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>There are, however, no data on the potential benefits of screening people with pacemakers for HF, and while there are now a series of algorithms to limit RV pacing,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> no clear strategy for the use of these is outlined in current guidelines. This situation is compounded by a lack of published evidence around the benefits of medical management of pacemaker-related HF since people with pacemakers were excluded from most of the large HF studies.</p>
              <p>Prospective randomised studies of pacemaker follow-up programmes to risk stratify patients and optimise management have not yet been of adequate size and duration to assess the clinical effectiveness of such an approach in a real-world general healthcare setting. Pacemaker follow-up is a rarely realised opportunity to screen for HF and assess and optimise patient devices and medical therapy.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>The OPTimising PACEmaker therapy (OPT-PACE) trial has been designed to address these issues and quantify time to all-cause mortality or HF hospitalisation, as well as validate a HF risk stratification model based on simple variables available in pacemaker clinic. Secondary aims are to establish whether N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) improves this risk stratification model. Subsequently, we aim to provide data on the effects of establishing the presence of LVSD on medical therapy, device programming and patient quality of life.</p>

                <p>The design of the pacemaker optimisation intervention used in the OPT-PACE trial is based on data from an observational cohort of 66 patients, referred for pacemaker generator replacement, recruited consecutively from a single tertiary centre (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> All patients recruited had been referred for pacemaker generator replacement. Exclusion criteria were inability to consent, underlying complete heart block, a life expectancy of &lt;1 year in the opinion of the clinician (eg, terminal malignancy), the presence of a device-related complication or those with known LVEF &lt;50%.</p>
                <p>In patients recruited with avoidable RV pacing, a prespecified protocol was followed to reduce this as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>, including a reduction in the diurnal base rate (BR) to 50 beats/min with nocturnal rate or hysteresis to 40 beats/min along with the deactivation of rate-adaptive pacing. In addition, where sinus rhythm and heart block had been documented, the atrioventricular delays were extended or a device with RV avoidance algorithms was implanted. The patients were reassessed 6 months post randomisation. The primary endpoint was LVEF at follow-up calculated as an average over three non-paced, normally conducted beats using modified Simpson’s method as per American Society of Echocardiogrpahy guidelines.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The protocol was tolerated in all but two subjects in whom rate-responsive pacing was reactivated. Nevertheless, application of the protocol reduced absolute RV pacing percentage by a mean of 49% (95% CI 41% to 57%; p&lt;0.0001) from baseline and resulted in a mean absolute improvement in LVEF of 6% (95% CI 2% to 8%; p&lt;0.0001). This occurred without reduction in exercise capacity, NT-proBNP or quality of life. An association was seen between the reduction in RV pacing and magnitude of change in LVEF (p=0.04). The intervention was considered safe to use without adaptation in OPT-PACE.</p>

              <p>OPT-PACE is a multicentre, randomised, non-blinded parallel trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in the UK (NIHR-CS-2012-032) and registered with the Clinical Trials registry. The trial design and protocol have received approval from necessary regulatory and ethics boards as well as an independent trial steering committee.</p>
              <p>The trial will recruit 1200 patients, which began in June 2013 and all patients will be followed up for a minimum of 12 months.</p>
              <p>Trial participation may be terminated via voluntary refusal to continue at any time or through significant clinical deterioration assessed by medical staff. Participants suffering from trial-related problems or adverse events (AEs) may obtain medical treatment as compensation, and the trial is insured to compensate.</p>

                <p>Patients are recruited from one tertiary centre (Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust) and two district centres (Harrogate District Foundation Trust and Bradford District Trust). Participants will have an implantable pacemaker for bradycardia for at least 12 months according to any indication in current accepted clinical guidelines<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and be able to provide written informed consent. Both atrial and ventricular pacing burdens will be documented. Participants will be excluded if they have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronisation device, are less than 18 years old, pregnant, awaiting heart transplantation or have a severe comorbidity with life expectancy of &lt;1 year. We will also exclude people with significant cognitive impairment and any already under the care of HF services.</p>

Potential participants will be asked to voluntarily provide written informed consent prior to randomisation in line with the Declaration of Helsinki 2002.</p>
                <p>Consecutive pacemaker clinic attendees agreeing to participate will be enrolled and randomised centrally using a study-specific electronic system.

Usual care pathways follow National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and patients will undergo routine, usually annual, pacemaker follow-up. Interventional pathways consist of enhanced or optimised care predetermined by each recruiting site. The echocardiographically informed pathways will consist of either a primary care driven management plan based on the echocardiogram that will be forwarded to the primary care team (enhanced care, n=300) if recruited in one of the district centres or a comprehensive care package consisting of optimised programming and medical therapy co-ordinated by a regional HF service (optimised care, n=300) if recruited in the tertiary centre. This interventional package will include the RV pacing avoidance algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) and in those with LVSD (LVEF &lt;50%) medical therapy following the NICE guidelines for the management of CHF.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the presence of LVSD, patients recruited at the tertiary centre will be referred to an outpatient HF clinic (optimised care), and in the district centres an echocardiogram report will be sent to the patients’ general practitioner (enhanced care).</p>

                <p>The primary outcome measure is a combined endpoint of time from randomisation to date of first event of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalisation as assessed by the Endpoint Review Committee. The Endpoint Review Committee will ensure the quality of conduct and assess protocol deviations due to the low risk associated with intervention (echocardiography).

Validation will be achieved by assessing against prespecified criteria, formed from the CIs of the initial pilot data analysis of the model.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>Other secondary outcome measures are to determine (1) the utility of BNP testing as a way to improve risk score for prevalent LVSD and future admissions, (2) hospitalisation rates and mortality across randomised arms, (3) utility of a diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction on achieving standard of care medications and doses and (4) quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) at baseline and 12-month postenrollment.</p>
                <p>All AEs related to the interventions will be recorded and monitored until resolved. Medical personnel will decide if continued trial participation is feasible based on these reports, with the final decision made by the participant.</p>

Time to event will be summarised across randomised groups using Kaplan-Meier estimates, HRs and comparison across groups using log-rank tests, reporting 12-month survival.</p>

                <p>The research question developed as a large number of pacemaker patients was seen in HF clinic with deterioration in their ventricular function and symptoms who were followed-up annually in pacemaker clinic and yet, these had not been detected. The study was initially discussed with a well-established local patient and public involvement (PPI) advisory group (AG) consisting of cardiovascular patients and their families. The AG particularly felt that undergoing all study assessments in 1 day was appealing to potential participants but that the intervention was not a large burden and that it was more important to know the effect on patient survival and the number of times patients were hospitalised, not just whether there was an improvement in heart function from optimised care in terms of outcome measures. Once the final protocol was established, it was reviewed by the PPI-AG along with patient information sheets to ensure the plain English was at an appropriate level. Regular updates will be presented regarding recruitment and any AEs. Study results will be discussed and an appropriate method of dissemination will be designed together between the AG and the researchers to deliver these to participants.</p>

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p>Patients with permanent pacemakers are at increased risk of prevalent HF with a reduced quality of life and incident HF leading to hospitalisations and a poorer prognosis. Despite increasing recognition of this, and the development of device-based options to limit unnecessary ventricular pacing, patients with permanent pacemakers rarely undergo any assessment to identify prevalent HF or their future risk of HF. Pacemaker follow-up services have remained resolutely technical with intervals based on historical risk of pacemaker device failure rather than focusing on patient requirements in the face of negligible pacemaker failure rates and extended battery longevity.</p>
                <p>A validated tool combining clinical and technical data by which patients’ risk of the one major complication of pacemaker therapy—HF—could be assessed, allowing individualised follow-up intervals has the potential to substantially improve patient experience while also offering the opportunity to focus screening and lead to the initiation of optimal therapy. Although there are several clinical and pacemaker-related features linked to the presence of cardiac dysfunction, no validated risk score exists to select those that should be referred for assessment.</p>
                <p>The management pathways used in this trial will offer individualised healthcare and establish the relative benefits of primary, secondary and tertiary expertise and interventions. Our previous data have shown that reprogramming to avoid RV pacing is safe and well tolerated by patients. Combining this with medical therapy for HF in collaboration with a HF service as a new model of care for people with pacemakers is feasible and could improve their quality of life and overall prognosis while also being highly cost-effective. We aim to test the clinical effectiveness of this approach when applied to a large number of patients at multiple sites.</p>
