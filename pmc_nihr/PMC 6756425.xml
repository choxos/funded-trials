                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Falls have major implications for quality of life, independence and cost to the health service. Strength and balance training has been found to be effective in reducing the rate/risk of falls, as long as there is adequate fidelity to the evidence-based programme. Health services are often unable to deliver the evidence-based dose of exercise and older adults do not always sufficiently adhere to their programme to gain full outcomes. Smartphone technology based on behaviour-change theory has been used to support healthy lifestyles, but not falls prevention exercise. This feasibility trial will explore whether smartphone technology can support patients to better adhere to an evidence-based rehabilitation programme and test study procedures/outcome measures.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A two-arm, pragmatic feasibility randomised controlled trial will be conducted with health services in Manchester, UK. Seventy-two patients aged 50+years eligible for a falls rehabilitation exercise programme from two community services will receive: (1) standard service with a smartphone for outcome measurement only or (2) standard service plus a smartphone including the motivational smartphone app. The primary outcome is feasibility of the intervention, study design and procedures. The secondary outcome is to compare standard outcome measures for falls, function and adherence to instrumented versions collected using smartphone. Outcome measures collected include balance, function, falls, strength, fear of falling, health-related quality of life, resource use and adherence. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 3 and 6-month post-randomisation. Interviews/focus groups with health professionals and participants further explore feasibility of the technology and trial procedures. Primarily analyses will be descriptive.</p>

                  <p>The study protocol is approved by North West Greater Manchester East Research Ethics Committee (Rec ref:18/NW/0457, 9/07/2018). User groups and patient representatives were consulted to inform trial design, and are involved in study recruitment. Results will be reported at conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. A dissemination event will be held in Manchester to present the results of the trial. The protocol adheres to the recommended Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist.</p>

              <p>Falls are an important public health issue, with over 30% of people aged 65 and over falling at least once a year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This has implications for quality of life, independence and cost to the health service.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Strength and balance training (SBT) comprises ‘carrying out exercises that increase muscle strength in the legs and improve balance’.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Strength and balance exercise programmes are effective in reducing risk and rate of falls and injuries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Sherrington <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> have shown that for strength and balance programmes to be effective they need to be progressive, tailored and of adequate dose (3× a week for 50 hours, and then maintained). Work carried out by Public Health England<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> illustrates that to see a return on investment, fidelity to the evidence-base has to be carried out (adequate dose, progression).</p>
              <p>However, Nyman and Victor<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> report that adherence to evidence-based strength and balance programmes is poor.

              <p>Unless there are innovative new solutions to support the delivery of falls prevention exercises sufficiently to reduce falls risk and to prevent re-referral to services, over the coming decade it is estimated that population changes will result in service demand beyond the reach of current interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>The use of smartphones to support falls rehabilitation could be one of the solutions. The proportion of older adults using smartphones is growing rapidly, with 39% of those aged 65 to 74% and 15% of those aged over 75 using smartphones.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Smartphones offer multiple opportunities to support healthy ageing and falls prevention as they are portable, can be body-worn and can therefore be used for falls detection, movement detection and motivation<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> The evidence which looks at the role of the smartphone for falls prevention is sparse,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> particularly for interventions focused on rehabilitation/SBT. Although there is a lack of specific evidence related to falls prevention interventions, there is evidence that older adults find mobile phones more usable than using a new device, for example a falls alarm.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It has also been suggested that barriers to smartphone use in this population can be overcome through adequate support and affordability.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> There is evidence supporting the use of mobile phone-based healthy lifestyle programmes,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> including to increase physical activity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> King <italic>et al</italic>

              <p>Smartphone technology-based motivational applications underpinned by behaviour change theory and developed with health professionals and older adults could be an effective way of encouraging maintenance of exercise and of successfully supporting adherence to evidence-based SBT. We have already carried out usability and acceptability testing of the technology and two motivational apps (one for health professionals and one for patients), before planning this trial. The smartphone apps have been developed through several cycles of user-led design. Initially we carried out engagement workshops with older adults (AgeUK) and health professionals from one falls service in Manchester, followed by usability/acceptability testing with another falls service in Manchester and their patients (Integrated Research Application System. IRAS:205980). The use of this approach has enabled us to develop the apps, establish whether the technology is acceptable to older adults and health professionals (qualitative methods) and to check its usability (technology testing). Overall, the apps were acceptable to both patients and health professionals with the majority of suggested changes made to the health professionals’ app to ensure it fit more easily with their practice. Changes following this testing included improvements in the delivery of messages and a more streamline approach to scheduling activities for the health professional. Another suggested change was to make smartphone pens available to participants to aid in the use of the touchscreen.</p>
              <p>This study now aims to explore whether it is feasible for smartphone technology to be used to support patients to sufficiently adhere to an evidence-based exercise rehabilitation programme. As a secondary aim it will assess whether technology-based outcome measures (smartphone-based falls alarm and timed up and go test (TUG))<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> are reliable when compared with standard methods (eg, falls calendars). Through a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) we will explore the feasibility of using smartphone technology to support falls rehabilitation and test study procedures (eg, suitability of outcome measures, SD of the outcome measure, recruitment, randomisation, follow-up rates, retention, time required for analysis). Both arms of the trial will receive rehabilitation exercises and will report their exercises on a study provided smartphone but only the intervention arm will carry out goal setting and receive feedback through the phone.</p>
              <p>The intervention has the potential to:</p>

The two sites see patients from diverse socioeconomic populations. Exclusions include older adults who are unable to follow instructions (unless supported by a family member/carer), who are unable to understand written English (unless supported by a family member/carer), with severe visual impairment, those in long-term residential or nursing care and those with terminal illness or expected shortened lifespan, defined as less than 6 months, as determined by the NHS teams. Patients need to have good 3G/4G mobile phone reception (able to access webpages) or wifi in their home and this is assessed by the health professional before they handout participant information or by the researcher when taking consent.</p>

Participating staff can choose to be part of a one-to-one interview if they prefer not to be interviewed with colleagues or if for staffing reasons it is not feasible for them to attend the focus group.</p>

                    <p>The primary outcome for any future definitive trial would be falls, expressed as fall rate per person per months of follow-up observation after randomisation. This study collects falls data for the purposes of testing feasibility of data collection, and to inform us of falls rates and intervention effect size for a future sample size calculation.</p>
                    <p>All participants will wear the smartphone in their pocket or on a waistband and this will act as a falls detector, running the FallsMonitor@home app developed by the University of Bologna.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> If the patient chooses then they can also use the app on the phone as a falls alarm. The fall detection system application allows the user to identify a list of formal/informal caregivers who will receive an SMS if a fall is detected. Patients are given an opportunity to de-active the falls alarm through an application on the smartphone if there is a false alarm, enabling the user to maintain control and prevent unwanted intrusion. Participants are asked if we can use their anonymised falls data for further development of the app and in the FARSEEING real-world falls database.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>

The blinded assessor will complete the normal TUG and the mTUG as outcome measures (the standard TUG as a validation measure) to explore whether the mTUG is usable as an outcome measurement for the definitive RCT. The health professional will carry out the mTUG with a sub-sample of 10 patients at each site to assess their experiences of its use.</p>

                <p>Quantitative data are analysed using SPSS Release V.22.0. The main analyses is descriptive, involving the estimation of recruitment rates, attrition rates, non-compliance rates, means and SD of outcomes by group at baseline and end trial, and 95% CI for differences of means of outcomes between groups and assessment of change following the intervention at end trial. The health economics analysis is focused on informing relevant measures and means of collection of health-related quality of life and resource use for the future definitive study. Only an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted; for all measures we will report mean values and sample variability alongside information on missing values.</p>
                <p>Data from the smartphone-based outcome measures (FallsMonitor@home, mTUG, My activity programme/control self-report app) will be compared with the traditional measures (falls calendar,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> TUG,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> EARS<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) alongside qualitative feedback as part of their validation.

                <title>Ethical issues</title>
                <p>Regional and site-specific approvals have been obtained. We are collecting and storing personal information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018. As this is a study with older patients a number of ethical issues could arise. To address these, community services will act as gatekeepers to access patients and assess patients’ eligibility for the study. The intervention is delivered by health service staff and provided in addition to standard service; therefore patients are unlikely to be disadvantaged.</p>
                <p>If falls are detected by the smartphone, it is important that someone is informed in real time. The smartphone application allows the user to select a list of formal/informal caregivers who will receive an SMS if a fall is detected. It will be made clear that the falls service is not an emergency service so in the event of a fall the person receiving the text message would call an ambulance as they would in normal circumstances. If patients already wear a call alarm then they will be encouraged to continue to use this as well or to adopt their usual method of alerting help.</p>
                <p>The study requires monitoring of subjects and it is important that patients do not find this obtrusive (privacy issues have been identified as major barriers to the use of technology). Patients are given an opportunity to de-active the falls alarm through an application on the smartphone if there is a false alarm. However, previous consultation/usability testing with older adults raised no major privacy issues.</p>
                <p>There are ethical issues in the removal of technology at the end of studies.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> We will not be able to offer older adults the technology at the end of the 6-month study period, but they will be offered the opportunity to download the apps onto their own phones if they wish.</p>
                <p>The risk of interviews and focus groups are minimal. The patient or health professional can ask the researcher to move onto another question if they are uncomfortable at any point. Health professionals will be given the chance to discuss the trial, technology and intervention in a one-to-one interview if they do not feel comfortable giving feedback in front of colleagues.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Patient and public representatives have been involved in designing the trial including outcome measures. Feedback from previous usability testing with patients and from patients who sit on our Advisory Group (AG) provided direct information on the design of the trial for example, use of self-report app for control arm. Patients on our AG (who were formerly patients of one of the services) helped to design study material such as the patient information sheet. They assisted in training health professionals in approaching patients for recruitment and goal setting as part of the intervention. Three participants, who took part in our usability testing, became peer mentor volunteers for the trial. They will attend the first visit (if the patient gives permission) to demonstrate the technology to patients before consent is given. We will explore whether peer involvement aids recruitment. Finally, the volunteers and the patients who sit on our AG will aid with dissemination of study findings, for example helping to arrange dissemination events and providing feedback on newsletters for participants.</p>

This team, alongside academic experts (JLH, LC, SM, ASM, CTo) from the Trial Co-ordination Group will ensure overall quality of trial data. The AG meets bi-annually, giving feedback on the project, providing expert guidance and assisting in dissemination; this includes two previous patients. A risk register is reviewed by the AG. The study is subject to the audit and monitoring regime of the University of Manchester and the monitoring plan followed.</p>

              <p>A safety reporting protocol has been developed for related and unexpected serious adverse events (AEs) and directly attributable AEs. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. These AEs are recorded in the CRF and if a serious AE occurs then it is reported to the chief investigator (CI). The CI will determine whether AEs require reporting to the trial sponsor and ethics committee, in accordance with the safety reporting protocol.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first trial that we are aware of that explores the potential use of motivational smartphone apps for the support of an evidence-based falls exercise programme.</p>
              <p>As this is an active intervention and control we are unable to blind participants or those delivering the intervention. However, the design does enable us to blind those carrying out both the assessments and analysis. The fact that both arms have a smartphone minimises the risk of unblinding with the independent assessors and, we would argue, also reduces risk of drop-out. There is the potential for the control group to become motivated by reporting their activities. However, if we did not ask them to report, there is also the risk of any difference between groups being a function of differential reporting schedules rather than a function of the intervention per se.</p>
              <p>We provide participants with study phones, which may be different to using the app on their own phones. However, we need to ensure the smartphone meets the technical specification required for FallsMonitor@home to work correctly. Furthermore use of study phones enables us to maintain confidentiality of participants (if phones are lost we can wipe them remotely).</p>
              <p>This trial assesses several novel outcome measures against the gold standard, the mTUG against standard TUG, the FallsMonitor@home against standard calendar method and a self-report app against the EARS tool.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This enables us to further our understanding of whether technology has the potential to provide more objective and reliable outcome measures than current methods.</p>
              <p>We use two very different NHS sites, reflecting the reality of day-to-day practice (one specialist falls service, one general rehabilitation services) to explore the delivery of the intervention. This means that the standard service is different across the two sites adding complexity to how the control and intervention arm are delivered. However, these differences enable us to assess its scalability to full trial where different types of falls services would need to be included as sites. It also enables us to be more representative of current services and assess its potential for delivery in practice.</p>
