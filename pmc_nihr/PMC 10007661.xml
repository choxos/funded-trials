                  <p id="Par1">Sequential B cell-targeted immunotherapy with BAFF antagonism (belimumab) and B cell depletion (rituximab) may enhance B cell targeting in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) through several mechanisms.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Study design: COMBIVAS is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the mechanistic effects of sequential therapy of belimumab and rituximab in patients with active PR3 AAV. The recruitment target is 30 patients who meet the criteria for inclusion in the per-protocol analysis. Thirty-six participants have been randomised to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: either rituximab plus belimumab or rituximab plus placebo (both groups with the same tapering corticosteroid regimen), and recruitment is now closed (final patient enrolled April 2021). For each patient, the trial will last for 2 years comprising a 12-month treatment period followed by a 12-month follow-up period.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants: Participants have been recruited from five of seven UK trial sites. Eligibility criteria were age ≥ 18 years and a diagnosis of AAV with active disease (newly diagnosed or relapsing disease), along with a concurrent positive test for PR3 ANCA by ELISA.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Interventions: Rituximab 1000 mg was administered by intravenous infusions on day 8 and day 22. Weekly subcutaneous injections of 200 mg belimumab or placebo were initiated a week before rituximab on day 1 and then weekly through to week 51. All participants received a relatively low prednisolone (20 mg/day) starting dose from day 1 followed by a protocol-specified corticosteroid taper aiming for complete cessation by 3 months.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Outcomes: The primary endpoint of this study is time to PR3 ANCA negativity. Key secondary outcomes include change from baseline in naïve, transitional, memory, plasmablast B cell subsets (by flow cytometry) in the blood at months 3, 12, 18 and 24; time to clinical remission; time to relapse; and incidence of serious adverse events. Exploratory biomarker assessments include assessment of B cell receptor clonality, B cell and T cell functional assays, whole blood transcriptomic analysis and urinary lymphocyte and proteomic analysis. Inguinal lymph node and nasal mucosal biopsies have been performed on a subgroup of patients at baseline and month 3.</p>

</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p id="Par44">ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) encompasses a group of multisystem autoimmune diseases characterised by necrotising small-vessel vasculitis and the presence of circulating autoantibodies (ANCAs) directed against the neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). B cell depletion with rituximab in combination with corticosteroids is associated with a reduction in vasculitis activity and ANCA levels in the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, those with the PR3 ANCA subtype and predominantly granulomatous disease have a slower time to remission after rituximab and glucocorticoids, with a high subsequent relapse risk of 44% by 13 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is a need for newer therapies to reduce the time to remission, to spare glucocorticoid use and to promote long-lasting relapse-free remission.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The success of rituximab in AAV has underscored the importance of B cells in its pathogenesis and has paved the way for other B cell-targeted therapies. Elevated levels of circulating BAFF, a B cell survival cytokine, are observed in patients with AAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and may promote the positive selection of autoreactive B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Belimumab binds soluble BAFF with high affinity and inhibits its biological activity, resulting in apoptotic B cell death and reduction in circulating B cell numbers. BAFF antagonism with belimumab has proven to be efficacious in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including lupus nephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and is undergoing evaluation in other autoimmune diseases. To date, the experience of belimumab use in AAV is limited to the Belimumab in Remission of Vasculitis (BREVAS) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a study comparing belimumab versus placebo (plus azathioprine and low-dose glucocorticoids in both groups) as maintenance therapy following a standard induction regimen with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Changes in treatment practice led to the truncation of the study population after initiation, resulting in reduced sample size and power for some analyses. No difference in relapse rate (the primary efficacy endpoint) was observed between treatment arms in the overall patient population; however, a positive trend of improved efficacy (and higher infections) was seen in the subgroup of patients who received rituximab induction therapy followed by belimumab compared to placebo.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Sequential therapy with belimumab (BAFF antagonism) and rituximab (CD20 + B cell depletion) may enhance B cell targeting in AAV through several distinct but complementary mechanisms: (1) as belimumab targets both CD20 + and CD20 − plasmablast populations, but appears to spare CD27 + memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and rituximab effectively depletes CD20 + cells (including circulating CD27 + memory cells) but has no effect on CD20 − cells, sequential therapy may impact a broader B cell population than targeting either BAFF or CD20 alone; (2) as high BAFF levels in tissue niches may retain B cells and protect against tissue B cell depletion by rituximab, sequential therapy may enhance B cell depletion at the tissue level; (3) in patients with SLE, belimumab therapy was associated with an early rise in peripheral blood memory B cells, possibly due to mobilisation from lymphoid tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Once in the circulation, these memory B cells may be more amenable to rituximab-induced depletion; and (4) high BAFF levels during B cell reconstitution post rituximab promotes the return of autoreactive B cell resulting in more severe flares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, regulation of BAFF levels post-depletion may allow greater stringency for B cell reconstitution, preventing re-emergence of autoreactive B cells and would directly target the effect of the rebound rise in BAFF levels seen after rituximab.</p>

The recruitment target is 30 patients who meet the criteria for inclusion in the per-protocol analysis. Thirty-six participants have been randomised to one of two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: either rituximab plus belimumab or rituximab plus placebo (both groups with the same tapering corticosteroid regimen), and recruitment is now closed (final patient enrolled April 2021). For each patient, the trial will last for 2 years comprising a 12-month treatment period followed by a 12-month follow-up period.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p id="Par66">The eligibility criteria include age ≥ 18 years and a diagnosis of AAV (according to Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) with active disease (newly diagnosed or relapsing disease) defined by one major or three minor disease activity items on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis (BVAS/WG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], along with a concurrent positive test for PR3 ANCA by ELISA. Proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA was chosen instead of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA as this serotype is associated with deep tissue inflammation, slower time to remission and higher relapse rate. PR3 ANCA patients represent a subtype of AAV where maximal benefit may be gained by enhancing tissue B cell depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, MPO and PR3 AAV subgroups display clinical and genetic differences, and the inclusion of only PR3-positive patients would ensure greater homogeneity in this small experimental medicine study, which was considered important to allow interrogation of drug mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par67">The key exclusion criteria included MPO ANCA or anti-GBM antibody positivity, the presence of pulmonary haemorrhage with hypoxia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Concerns about the impact of prior immunosuppression and/or glucocorticoids on mechanistic endpoints were balanced against the feasibility of being able to recruit sufficient numbers of patients, including some with potentially life-threatening active diseases. Thus, participants were permitted a maximum of 3 g intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone or an equivalent dose of oral prednisolone in the 30 days prior to enrolment and screening period, as deemed necessary by investigators to treat any major disease activity. The other exclusion criteria included receipt of any biological B cell-depleting agents within 12 months of screening or more than three doses of IV cyclophosphamide within 6 months of screening, patients with undetectable peripheral blood B cells at screening and IgG &lt; 400 mg/dL at screening. Patients with acute or chronic infection or a history of malignancy within 5 years of screening were also excluded.

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators</title>
                  <p id="Par70">Rituximab 1000 mg was administered by IV infusions on day 8 (± 3 days) and day 22 (± 3 days). This dose was selected because it causes rapid depletion of peripheral B cells below the lower limit of quantification by flow cytometry. Although published trials of rituximab in AAV used doses of 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> a week for four consecutive weeks, the use of 1000 mg repeated after 2 weeks is more practical and is a commonly adopted protocol. A retrospective review (<italic>n</italic> = 65) that compared the two regimens for AAV showed no difference in the duration of B cell depletion or disease-free interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Both dosing regimens are approved and commissioned for AAV by NHS England in the UK. Patients were recruited in line with the policy for use of rituximab for relapsing disease or new disease where cyclophosphamide is contraindicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par71">Weekly subcutaneous (SC) injections of 200 mg belimumab or placebo were initiated a week before rituximab on day 1 and then weekly through to week 51. Belimumab 200 mg SC once weekly for 52 weeks was the dose and duration of therapy for the primary endpoint in the positive phase 3 trial of SC belimumab (BEL112341) in SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The belimumab 200 mg SC weekly dose was selected because it delivers a substantial molar excess of belimumab above free BAFF levels in the blood, resulting in rapid suppression of serum BAFF levels and is understood to be equivalent (by area under the curve (AUC)) to the belimumab 10 mg/kg IV dose, which was originally approved for SLE based on efficacy and safety data alongside reductions in the autoantibody dsDNA. Furthermore, infections with belimumab plus standard of care were similar to that of placebo plus standard of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par72">Given the observation of the immediate rise in circulating memory B cells after belimumab from prior treatment trial (within the first week of treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], rituximab was initiated 1 week after belimumab to effectively deplete the increased number of circulating memory B cells.</p>

Major and minor relapses are differentiated by the presence or absence of major BVAS items, respectively. Participants experiencing a first minor relapse, after remission, at any time during the trial are permitted to receive prednisolone up to 30 mg/day for 1 week decreasing in 5 mg decrements every 2 weeks to reach 5 mg/day. A second minor relapse or first major relapse occurring at any time point during the trial triggers a withdrawal from protocol-assigned treatment and treatment according to best practice. Patients with new/worsening major disease manifestations prior to achieving remission (major progressive disease) also trigger a withdrawal from protocol-assigned treatment and best practice treatment for refractory disease.</p>

                <p id="Par90">The primary endpoint of this study is time to PR3 ANCA negativity. B cell-derived ANCAs are implicated in disease pathogenesis and an effect on ANCA is of major mechanistic significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Because this study is investigating the differential effects of B cell monotherapy (rituximab) versus B cell sequential therapy (rituximab and belimumab), we predict not only differential effects in terms of magnitude, breadth and duration of B cell depletion, but also differential effects on B cell-derived ANCA. For PR3 ANCA, our own preliminary data (using the same ANCA assay, in a similar patient population, receiving the same control rituximab regimen) suggests that time to PR3 ANCA negativity is long (14 months median) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. With sequential therapy, we predict that ANCA levels will fall quicker. Achieving PR3 ANCA negativity is associated with clinical remission. The binary endpoint of time to ANCA negativity was chosen for the primary endpoint, to reflect both clinical and mechanistic importance.</p>

However, the sample size can be justified statistically, using an assumption regarding treatment effect size. Rituximab treatment is known to be associated with falls in PR3 ANCA levels and clinical remission. Our own preliminary data from AAV patients treated with rituximab found a median time to PR3 ANCA ELISA negativity of 14 months. With a two-sided 5% type I error rate, 15 patients per arm results in 80% power to detect a difference when the rituximab-belimumab group has a median time to PR3 ANCA negativity of 3 months.

In March 2020, the UK government introduced a national lockdown to limit the spread of COVID-19. Recruitment was temporarily paused while risk assessments were performed, and trial procedures were modified to ensure the safety of participants, including telephone assessments when face-to-face assessments are not deemed clinically essential, couriering belimumab/placebo to patients’ homes and use of blood testing in facilities local to patients’ homes with the shipment of samples, staff to wear PPE and adhere to social distancing policies for face-to-face assessments and COVID-19 screening swabs to be performed before all nasal biopsy procedures. Recruitment was restarted in June 2020 following sponsor and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approval of trial adaptations for patient safety during the pandemic. During the pandemic, every effort was made to adhere to visit time windows; however, a pragmatic approach was adopted allowing greater flexibility of study windows when needed to avoid missing samples during the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations were introduced in the UK in 2021. Participants were encouraged to have vaccinations at the earliest opportunity. All vaccines and infections are captured in the trial database. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of infections and vaccinations on trial outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par115">Several samples from key time points were not collected at the start of the pandemic when the research laboratories were unable to function at full capacity. To minimise the potential impact caused by missed time points on the primary endpoint analysis, PR3 ANCA results from trial samples will be combined with PR3 ANCA values performed during routine clinical care using the same assay.</p>

                  <p id="Par122">Blood and urine samples are taken at multiple time points, with key analyses at 3 months (time of maximal B cell depletion), 12 months (end of treatment phase) and 24 months (time of maximal B cell reconstitution and end of follow-up). A key focus of this study is understanding the mechanistic effects of belimumab-rituximab sequential therapy in tissues. For this purpose, patients provided consent for paired nasal tissue biopsies and inguinal lymph node biopsies which were performed before initiating study treatment on day 1 (or during screening) and again at 3 months. Sino-nasal inflammation is a common manifestation of AAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the nasal mucosa offers a disease-relevant and easily accessible site for tissue biopsies. Likewise, biopsy samples from the inguinal lymph nodes are safe to perform and permit direct assessment of T cell–B cell interaction and humoral responses within a secondary lymphoid organ. It is anticipated that biopsy data will be available for a subset of patents allowing for the withdrawal of consent or insufficient sampling in a minority of patents. The 3-month time point was chosen as the time of likely maximum B cell depleting effect of the sequential therapies based on the knowledge of rituximab pharmacokinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], minimal ongoing corticosteroids exposure and the time at which clinical remission is usually expected (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Biomarker analyses</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Compartment</th><th align="left">Biomarker</th><th align="left">Endpoint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Blood</td><td align="left"><p>➢ PR3 ANCA (ELISA)</p><p>➢ Lymphocyte immunophenotyping (flow cytometry)</p><p>➢ B cell receptor clonality, B cell and T cell functional assays, and whole blood transcriptomic analysis</p><p>➢ BAFF protein, BAFF-belimumab complex and cytokines</p></td><td align="left"><p>Primary</p><p>Secondary</p><p>Exploratory</p><p>Exploratory</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Urine</td><td align="left"><p>➢Lymphocyte immunophenotyping (flow cytometry)</p><p>➢Proteome analysis</p></td><td align="left"><p>Exploratory</p><p>Exploratory</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tissue biopsies (subset of patients only)</td><td align="left"><p>➢Lymphocyte immunophenotyping (flow cytometry)</p><p>➢Single cell RNA sequencing</p></td><td align="left"><p>Exploratory</p><p>Exploratory</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

Samples were sent from participating sites to Cambridge via overnight shipping resulting in a delay in sample processing. As the viability of some B cell subsets is known to decline quickly after venepuncture, blood was collected in cell stabilisation tubes (CytoChex BCT) for secondary endpoint analyses. Pre-trial validation experiments were performed to verify the performance characteristics of custom flow cytometry assays designed to evaluate the measurement of B cell subsets in the whole blood collected in CytoChex BCT tubes. Pre-trial feasibility testing was also performed on the urine processing and analysis techniques and for the tissue biopsies which demonstrated acceptable tolerability and safety profile for both local anaesthetic biopsy techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

Briefly, the primary endpoint of time to PR3 ANCA negativity will be compared between the sequential arm and the control arm using the Cox proportional hazard model with the <italic>Exact</italic> method for handling any ties and with covariates for screening PR3 ANCA levels (low vs. high by median value) and treatment group (i.e. belimumab vs. placebo). The median time to PR3 ANCA negativity will be presented for each randomised treatment group, along with the estimated hazard ratio (belimumab:placebo) of the treatments, its 95% confidence intervals and associated <italic>p</italic>-value. <italic>p</italic>-values will be based on the likelihood ratio test, and confidence intervals will use a profile likelihood approach. A HR less than 1 favours belimumab + rituximab.</p>
                  <p id="Par138">Regarding key secondary endpoints, change from baseline in PR3 ANCA will be analysed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Hodges-Lehmann method will be used to provide estimates of the median differences and non-parametric 95% confidence intervals at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. To assess the change from baseline in naïve, transitional, memory, activated and plasmablast subsets (using high sensitivity B cell flow cytometry) in the blood (3, 12, 24 months), the per cent change from baseline data will be compared between the belimumab treatment group and placebo group using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. A Hodges-Lehmann method will be used as described above. Time to clinical remission and time to first relapse will be analysed using the methods described for the primary endpoint.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par151">COMBIVAS is an experimental medicine study that encompasses a series of mechanistic investigations within blood, urine, lymph node and nasal tissue biopsies from AAV patients receiving sequential B cell targeting therapy with belimumab and rituximab compared to patients receiving rituximab alone. This study provides a unique opportunity to gain a detailed insight into the immunological mechanisms within tissues driving relapse and how synergistic effects of two B cell targeting monoclonal antibodies in combination may lead to long-lasting remission. The proposed mechanistic investigations rely heavily on techniques within the University of Cambridge, University College London, Imperial College London and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Without this collaborative scientific experience, such detailed mechanistic studies would be impractical. A barrier to the research of B cell-targeted therapy has been the difficulty in obtaining sequential cells from sites where the immune dysregulation occurs or sites of inflammation. The inclusion of both lymph node biopsies and nasal tissue biopsies in this trial will potentially permit the direct characterisation of pathogenic cells at key sites, their microenvironment and, critically, the interaction of B cells with T follicular helper cells, the primary drivers of the abnormal immune response.</p>
              <p id="Par152">The GSK MRC EMINENT programme has provided a unique opportunity to bring together vasculitis specialists from major UK institutions with GSK researchers facilitating a collaborative approach to scientific investigations and rapid recruitment of rare disease patients from specialist clinics. Combining the disease biology expertise of academic institutions with scientific expertise and access to therapies within the industry provides the opportunity for advancing scientific understanding of novel drug mechanisms in rare diseases such as AAV.</p>

              <p id="Par153">The final patient was recruited in April 2021. The last subject’s last visit will be in April 2023. A two-staged publication strategy is planned consisting of an initial report of the early mechanistic biomarkers of B cell depletion including (1) exploratory evaluation of the early pharmacodynamic effects of belimumab on B cells and B cell subsets within the first week before any rituximab administration and (2) exploratory analysis of baseline and month 3 blood, nasal biopsies, lymph node biopsies by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by the full study report when all patents have completed trial follow-up (primary and secondary endpoint analyses and remaining exploratory analyses).</p>
              <p id="Par154">Due to significant uncertainties over recruitment and trial conduct during the COVID-19 pandemic, publication of this manuscript was delayed until recruitment was complete and subsequent external and internal collaborator reviews had been undertaken, in order to provide a manuscript that was reflective of the final protocol.</p>
