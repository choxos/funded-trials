                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Eczema care requires management of triggers and various treatments. We developed two online behavioural interventions to support eczema care called ECO (Eczema Care Online) for young people and ECO for families. This protocol describes two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate clinical and cost-effectiveness of the two interventions.</p>

                  <p><italic>Design</italic>: Two independent, pragmatic, unmasked, parallel group RCTs with internal pilots and nested health economic and process evaluation studies. <italic>Setting</italic>: Participants will be recruited from general practitioner practices in England. <italic>Participants</italic>: Young people aged 13–25 years with eczema and parents and carers of children aged 0–12 years with eczema, excluding inactive or very mild eczema (five or less on Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)). <italic>Interventions</italic>: Participants will be randomised to online intervention plus usual care or to usual eczema care alone. <italic>Outcome measures</italic>: Primary outcome is eczema severity over 24 weeks measured by POEM. Secondary outcomes include POEM 4-weekly for 52 weeks, quality of life, eczema control, itch intensity (young people only), patient enablement, health service and treatment use. Process measures include treatment adherence, barriers to adherence and intervention usage. Our sample sizes of 303 participants per trial are powered to detect a group difference of 2.5 (SD 6.5) in monthly POEM scores over 24 weeks (significance 0.05, power 0.9), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be from a National Health Service and personal social service perspective. Qualitative and quantitative process evaluation will help understand the mechanisms of action and participant experiences and inform implementation.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Eczema can cause substantial impact on quality of life, primarily because of sleep disturbance and itch.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Families of children with eczema express frustration that they do not receive enough information about how to manage the condition,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> as do adults with eczema.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on eczema<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> highlights that the main cause of treatment failure is non-adherence and there is a need for new ways to support adherence.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Reasons for non-adherence include therapy being time-intensive,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> lack of understanding of treatments and how to use them,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> underuse of topical corticosteroids related to concerns about side effects,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> conflicting advice from different health professionals regarding how to use topical corticosteroids<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> and child refusal.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
                <p>Self-care includes all the health behaviours needed to look after one’s own condition. Non-adherence is related to people’s understanding of their condition and its treatment, as well as perceived need for treatments and concerns about adverse consequences of treatments.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Self-care is particularly complex in eczema as it involves regular application of topical treatments (mainly emollients for maintenance and topical corticosteroids for inflamed eczema) and avoidance of triggers (eg, soap). At present, many people and families receive little advice on how to manage the condition, or obtain advice of variable quality from the internet.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is a need for high-quality, accessible interventions, as well as evidence of whether interventions work so that, if effective, clinicians can signpost towards these as an essential part of routine care.</p>
                <p>Currently, 96% of British households have access to the internet, with 99% of adults being regular internet users.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although information about eczema is widely available on the internet, it is of variable quality, often promoting commercial products of unproven efficacy. Patients and parents/carers find it difficult to know which information is reliable.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
                <p>We have developed two web-based interventions to support eczema management: ECO (Eczema Care Online) for parents and carers of children aged 0–12 years with eczema, and ECO for young people aged 13–25 years with eczema. Parents of children with eczema and young people with eczema are likely to have different support and information needs. We have therefore developed two separate interventions to be evaluated in two separate randomised controlled trial (RCTs). This paper provides an abridged version of the full protocol that is available on the project website.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective is to determine the clinical effectiveness of two online interventions compared with usual care for eczema: one for young people aged 13–25 with eczema (ECO-YP) and one for parents and carers of children aged 0–12 with eczema (ECO-PC).</p>
                <p>The secondary objectives are (1) to determine the cost-effectiveness of the online interventions from a National Health Service (NHS) and personal social service perspective and (2) to determine the interventions’ mechanisms of action and factors related to participant engagement and treatment adherence and its outcomes.</p>

These topics include eczema treatments, infections, talking to your healthcare professional, diet and allergy, sleep and itch, physical activity, coping with stress and transitioning to self-care. The interventions also include a ‘2-week challenge’ where participants are encouraged to use their eczema treatment regularly for 2 weeks, supported by optional text and email reminders and support. Intervention content has been developed to be interactive and engaging, with tailoring to suggest topics that may be of relevance. The intervention also contains a series of animated videos focussing on the core target behaviours.</p>
                  <p>ECO-YP has been developed for people aged 13–25 years with eczema. The intervention covers the topics mentioned above, as well as additional topics that are important particularly to this age group, such as information about finances, school, university, or work and cosmetics.</p>
                  <p>ECO-PC has been developed for parents of children aged 0–12 years with eczema. This intervention covers the same wide range of topics relevant to eczema, as well as sections that are specifically relevant to parents and co-management of eczema, such as transitioning to co-management, dealing with child resistance and managing your child’s eczema at nursery and school. Intervention description follows TIDieR guidelines<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; detailed intervention development and optimisation studies will be published separately.</p>

Assuming a correlation between repeated measures of 0.70, with 90% power and 5% significance, this requires a total sample size of 121 per group in each of the two trials.

We will estimate the cost of the interventions and collect data on wider resource use (primary care, secondary care and accident and emergency use) and eczema-related prescriptions through medical notes review. Resource items will be valued using published unit costs for the most recent common price year to the time of analysis.</p>
                <p>There is currently no agreed approach to valuing health outcomes in children in economic evaluations and there has been limited use of child and adolescent population-specific measures to generate health state utilities in NICE technology assessments.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In ECO-PC for parents and carers of children aged 0–12, we will collect by proxy the CHU-9D,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> a paediatric generic preference-based instrument, in those aged 2 and older. Although the CHU-9D was developed for children aged 7 and older, its completion by proxy in younger age groups is currently being trialled<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and the developer of the instrument has given us additional guidance to use with parents and carers with children in this age group. This approach is being taken as only parents and carers are expected to interact with the intervention.</p>
                <p>In the ECO-YP (young people aged 13–25), all participants are asked to self-complete the EQ-5D-5L in order to estimate their health-related quality of life. To prevent any discontinuity, the EQ-5D-Y will not be used in those under the age of 16 as this is a different instrument from the EQ-5D-5L.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> All participants will be asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks and the scores from these will be converted to utility scores using UK preference weights in line with current recommendations at the time of the analysis.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 39</xref> Following this, the utility values will be used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for the trial period using linear interpolation and area under the curve with and without baseline adjustment.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>

                <p>Cost-effectiveness (using change in POEM between baseline and 52 weeks, secondary analysis) and cost utility analyses (primary analysis) will be performed. Costs and benefits will not be discounted given the 12-month timeframe. Using information on costs and benefits, regression analysis will be conducted to estimate the incremental cost, incremental benefit and incremental cost utility of the online intervention compared with usual care (over the trial period). If one arm is clearly dominant (less costly and more effective), a recommendation can be made on this basis. If non-dominance occurs (that is if costs are greater and the intervention is more effective or if the intervention is cheaper and less effective), an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be produced and a judgement about value for money will need to be made. The economic evaluation will be undertaken and analysed in line with guidelines.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> Missing data will be dealt with in line with the approach taken in the main clinical statistical analysis, with sensitivity analysis undertaken to test the impact of approach if missing data is a particular problem.

                  <title>Quantitative process evaluation</title>
                  <p>We will use baseline data to examine potential predictors and moderator effects of participant characteristics (eg, age, eczema symptom severity, baseline attitudes) on intervention engagement (objectively recorded detailed website usage and self-reported treatment adherence) and outcome. We will also assess and analyse hypothesised mediators of treatment adherence and intervention outcomes; specifically changes in beliefs about treatment (PETS) as well as intervention usage. Objective measures of intervention usage are automatically recorded (with informed participant consent), allowing evaluations of usage patterns, such as time spent on intervention, number of visits to the intervention website and pages visited.</p>

                  <p>Qualitative process interviews will be carried out with approximately 30–40 participants (15–20 from ECO-YP and 15–20 from ECO-PC, or until saturation of the main themes are achieved). These interviews will provide in-depth understanding of patient and carers’ experiences within the trial and provide a better understanding of factors that may influence engagement.</p>
                  <p>Interviews will be conducted via telephone or video call by a member of the research team experienced in qualitative research methods. We will interview participants from the intervention group and the usual care group and use purposive sampling to ensure a range of age, gender, ethnicity, eczema severity, website usage, deprivation index and region. Potential participants will be contacted after being in the trial for at least 3 months by a member of the research team to check whether they would like to take part in an interview or have any questions about the study. Participants will be asked to give their consent online prior to the interview. Interviews will use a combination of open-ended and focused questions and be transcribed verbatim.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative data will first be analysed using inductive thematic analysis.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> We will then explore how emerging themes may map onto theoretical frameworks in order to relate our insights to generalisable theoretical constructs and inform implementation planning.</p>

The final agreed sample size for the trials were based on seeking to detect a POEM MCID of 2.5 points between groups, based on two repeated measures (SD 6.5), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up requiring sample size of 303 participants in each of the two trials.</p>
