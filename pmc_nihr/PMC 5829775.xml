                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Eligible participants were: 18 years old or over, with a diagnosis of stroke and with self-reported mobility issues, no contraindications to physical activity, discharged from National Health Service or any other formal rehabilitation programme at least 1 month before, willing to be randomised to either control or ReTrain and attend the training venue, possessing cognitive capacity and communication ability sufficient to participate. Participants were individually randomised (1:1) via a computer-generated randomisation sequence minimised for time since stroke and level of functional disability. Only outcome assessors independent of the research team were blinded to group allocation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>ReTrain comprised (1) an introductory one-to-one session; (2) ten, twice-weekly group classes with up to two trainers and eight clients; (3) a closing one-to-one session, followed by three drop-in sessions over the subsequent 3 months. Participants received a bespoke home-based training programme. All participants received treatment as usual. The control group received an exercise after stroke advice booklet.</p>

                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Candidate primary outcomes included functional mobility and physical activity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Forty-five participants were randomised (ReTrain=23; Control=22); data were available from 40 participants at 6 months of follow-up (ReTrain=21; Control=19) and 41 at 9 months of follow-up (ReTrain=21; Control=20). We demonstrated ability to recruit and retain participants. Participants were not burdened by the requirements of the study. We were able to calculate sample estimates for candidate primary outcomes and test procedures for process and health economic evaluations.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>All objectives were fulfilled and indicated that a definitive trial of ReTrain is feasible and acceptable.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Five years after initial stroke, one in three individuals have residual physical impairment,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> equating to over 300â000 individuals in the UK living with disability from stroke.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Provision of stroke rehabilitation is typically front loaded, with resources focused on in-patient care and early supported discharge. Support tapers off after a few months,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with many individuals reporting unmet long-term needs<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>The National clinical guideline for stroke advise for secondary prevention that stroke survivors engage in 150âmin of physical activity a week, in bouts of 10âmin or more, starting light and developing across time to moderate levels of intensity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, many stroke survivors do not meet these recommendations<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> due to combinations of personal (eg, physical or psychological impairments) and environmental factors (eg, lack of programmes and facilities). To address this problem, community-based programmes are promoted.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8â10</xref> These tend to focus on cardiovascular fitness with less emphasis on functional improvements or on promoting on-going exercise self-management. National stroke guidelines<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> identify the importance of interventions for functional improvement<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and self-management,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> but evidence is lacking regarding these types of intervention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Action for Rehabilitation following Neurological Injury (ARNI) is an approach aimed at improving function and facilitating self-management<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and has a detailed self-help book. The ARNI approach embodies a set of principles (eg, instilling a commitment to regular exercise) and techniques tailored to individual need. The ARNI Institute trains registered exercise professionals to deliver key ARNI techniques. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), charitable and local authorities have started to provide community-based ARNI training for stroke survivors, which has been positively received by participants, carers and practitioners<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>; however, there is currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence for evaluating its impact on stroke outcomes or its cost-effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Background and objectives</title>
                <p>Using the Medical Research Councilâs framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and considerable Patient and Public Involvement, we have designed a testable programme called Rehabilitation Training (ReTrain).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17â20</xref> ReTrain is a community-based, manualised group programme combining ARNI principles and key techniques with best practice guidelines for stroke.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 17</xref> The overall aim of our pilot RCT was to inform the design and delivery of a definitive RCT. Our objectives were to (1) assess feasibility and acceptability of recruitment (target n=48), randomisation, allocation concealment and outcome assessment blinding; (2) determine retention rates (target of &lt;20% attrition); (3) check ReTrainâs acceptability and feasibility for participants, and refine the trainer manual; (4) test candidate outcome measures, assess their burden, levels of completion and estimate outcome variance (to inform definitive trial sample size); (5) perform process evaluation including intervention fidelity assessment and (6) calculate ReTrain costs and assess feasibility of collecting health and social service resource use.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>ReTrain was a two-group, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled external pilot trial with parallel mixed methods process and economic evaluations. Eligible participants were individually randomised 1:1 to intervention (ReTrain) or control (exercise advice booklet<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) diagnosis of stroke; (2) any time since stroke but at least 1âmonth since discharge from National Health Service (NHS) physical rehabilitation services; (3) able to walk independently indoors with or without mobility aids, but with self-reported difficulty with stairs, slopes or uneven surfaces; (4) willingness to be randomised and attend the training venue and (5) cognitive capacity and communication ability sufficient to participate.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria were less than 18 years old, currently (or within 1âmonth of) receiving ARNI training or have contraindications to moderate to vigorous physical activity (adapted from American College of Sports Medicine guidelines<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Participants were recruited from two CCGs. Participants were identified by: (1) clinicians in NHS primary care, hospital and community stroke services; (2) contacts in the local Clinical Research Network and Clinical Research Facility; (3) promotion via local stroke support networks (eg, Stroke Association) and (4) word of mouth, study flyers and adverts.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>ReTrain aims to: (1) enhance function through task-related practice, teaching compensatory techniques and providing targeted strength training (cardiovascular fitness gains also occur through these activities); (2) develop self-management skills for on-going rehabilitation; (3) deliver personalised training using negotiated goals and (4) instil a commitment to regular exercise for health improvement and longer-term maintenance. ReTrain facilitates safe and efficient practice of walking in varied terrains, kerbs, cambers and in crowds, turning and moving quickly, climbing steps and stairs without rails, getting to and from the floor without furniture or other aids and moving without mobility aids or while carrying loads. Training is based on a manual and led by personal trainers on the UK Register of Exercise Professionals (level 3 or above) who are ARNI-trained and accredited and have had additional training in the delivery of ReTrain. There was a maximum ratio of one trainer to four stroke survivors. ReTrain was delivered in a community setting (one gym, two church halls and one community centre) with twice-weekly 2-hour sessions over 3âmonths, comprising: an introductory one-to-one session (home visit); 10, twice-weekly group classes with up to 2 trainers and 8 clients (training venue); a closing one-to-one session (home visit); followed by 3Â (one per month) drop-in sessions. Participants completed bespoke home-based training (homework) throughout.</p>

                <p>All participants received treatment as usual. This ranged from zero treatment to engagement with any health service(s). We requested that all trial participants did not participate in additional physical rehabilitation (either NHS or private) but we could not prevent them from doing so. We did not monitor control group participation in any treatments during the trial but did record health service use at the end of the trial for all participants. The control group also received an advice booklet about exercise after stroke.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>The random sequence was computer generated with minimisation for time since stroke (â¤Â 3 months vs &gt; 3 months) and level of functional disability (modified Rankin Scale (mRS)<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> score â¤Â 2âvs &gt; 2). Allocation concealment was ensured by using a password protected validated web-based remote randomisation service supported by the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit. The Trial Manager requested randomisation only after a cohort of participants had been consented.</p>
                <p>Participants, trainers providing the intervention and researchers conducting the process and economic evaluations could not be blinded to allocation. However, outcomes were assessed by independent researchers (not based at research centre) who were blinded to group allocation. Participants were reminded not to reveal their allocation to assessors but any unblinding was recorded; after assessments assessors were asked to guess participant allocation.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Analysis was primarily descriptive with participant flow summarised and estimates of screening, recruitment and attrition reported. Means and SD for all outcomes are reported at baseline, 6-month and 9-month follow-up for each group.</p>
                <p>Intervention fidelity was assessed using mixed methods: qualitative video analysis comparing the trainer manual standard versus observed technique (two researchers independently assessed videos) combined with interview data and summary scores from trainer completed session checklists. Qualitative data were manually analysed descriptively and with content analysis for trial processes; additional thematic analysis was used for interview data. One person (MN) led the qualitative analysis but this was then discussed (MN and SGD), checked (RC) and agreed (MN, SGD, LP and RC).</p>
                <p>We used a micro-costing approach to calculate costs associated with ReTrain: staff time (trainers, administrator and facilitators), venue hire, training equipment (annualised over time), course materials, consumables and travel costs (participants, trainers and facilitators). The costs of the intervention were estimated as a cost per programme and a cost per participant. The estimated costs of the intervention per participant were based on the number of participants enrolled on the programme. The base case scenario assumed the average number of participants per programme across all cohorts. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the minimum and maximum number of participants enrolled for the programme and the quantity of programme materials that were wasted. We analysed the relative benefits of calculating health-related QoL using SF-6D (developed from the SF-12) over the Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculated (using EQ-5D 5âL) from the baseline measures.</p>
                <p>Sample size estimates for a definitive trial were calculated for candidate primary outcomes using the SD observed in this pilot population and published minimal clinical important difference (MCID) at 90% power and 5% alpha, and assuming 20% attrition. Where no published MCID could be sourced, we assumed a small to moderate effect size of 0.4 of a SD.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The trial statistician undertook calculations using the âsamspiâ command in STATA V.14.2</p>

                    <p>Outcome measure burden: Participants found the assessment process acceptable. Fifteen indicated no burden. Three participants indicated that they needed help from their carers to complete questionnaires, particularly recalling and reporting health resource use, placing a time burden on their carer.</p>

                    <p>Venue: Half of the ReTrain participants were very positive about the training venues. Important features were space, provision of fluids (water and tea) and easy availability of parking. For some the travelling distance was a concern; two noted their venue (a gym) was very noisy, insufficiently heated and the session time was too early. Some noted the small amount of equipment as an advantage (it aided transfer of exercises to their home), whereas others felt that the equipment was not sufficiently specialist.</p>

                    <p>Adherence to ReTrain (see also Objective 5): All 10 ReTrain interviewees reported training in the 5 core (ARNI) techniques. Homework was discussed by all but lacked specificity, only two had clear homework examples that were effectively incorporated into their training. Although goal setting was a core element, only four specifically identified how their goals were linked into their overall programme. Three participants reported not attending drop-in sessions due to lack of information. Of three who attended, two suggested the drop-ins repeated previous sessions.</p>

                    <p>Group dynamics: Group working was positively regarded and seen as integral to programme effectiveness. There were exceptions, one participant did not find âperformingâ in public a positive experience. Likewise some suggested that groups reduced training intensity relative to one-to-one training.</p>

                    <p>Comorbidities:Â Participants identified several comorbidities, such as knee replacements, cancer, angina, diabetes, amputation and depression. These had potential to impact both the training and research participation but for most any concerns were accommodated by trainers. However, in one case, some uncomfortable discussions occurred before an appropriate balance of perceived capability and training challenges was reached. Three participants with visual deficits, dyslexia and dysgraphia mentioned difficulties in completing the research documents.</p>

Accelerometry wear time (24âhours for 7 days) was high, most having 6 or more valid days (â¥16âhours per day, including â¥1âweekend day). Only two participants at baseline, one at 6âmonths and three at 9âmonths did not achieve 4 valid days of wear time. There was very little missing data. For three primary outcome measures, there was only one participant with missing data at any given assessment time-point. For secondary outcomes, there was either no missing data or only one to two participants with missing data at each time-point, apart from the exercise diary (between two and four participants with missing data at each time-point) and the service receipt inventory (between three and seven participants with missing data). There were eight participants without accelerometer data at 9-month assessment owing to hardware (device) and software (data extraction method) malfunctions.</p>

                <p>We implemented a comprehensive video recording schedule (over 200 recordings) to capture participant and trainer adherence to key ARNI techniques. Both trainers and participants demonstrated high adherence. Modifications to techniques (to accommodate participant comorbidities) were captured and informed trainer manual development.</p>
                <p>We combined metrics from attendance registers and homework records to generate a âdoseâ/adherence score, categorising individuals into low (&lt;50%), medium (50%â75%) and high (&gt;75%) adherence categories. Of 23 ReTrain participants, 2 did not receive the intervention (1 returned to work; 1 withdrew from theÂ study), 5 had low adherence, 5 medium adherence and 11 high adherence. These latter 16 (70%) were considered to have received sufficient âdoseâ of ReTrain.</p>
                <p>Trainers varied in their completion of session checklists: pre-exercise and end-of-session components were less consistently reported compared with ARNI techniques but overall there was good adherence to programme delivery.</p>

                <p>ReTrain costs were generated for each cohort, accounting for different programme sizes (four or eight participants) and venues. Costs per participant ranged from Â£615 to Â£972. The total per participant cost for ReTrain (assuming 24 participants) was Â£777. We conducted medical notes review on 35/41 participants and compared this âgold standardâ with self-reported health resource use. Participants reported using fewer resources compared with case notes review. Data from medical notes informed the costâutility and effectiveness frameworks for use in a definitive trial.</p>

The trial was not powered to detect differences in outcome between trial arms or over time and so we do not interpret the patterns of means. However, the results clearly demonstrate that we were able to collect the necessary data and retained acceptable completion rates on all measures across all time points of the study. Attrition was lower than the 20% expected. For each outcome measure (except carer burden as not everyone had a carer), we achieved in excess of the 30 cases (ie, 15 completed measurements per arm) recommended for pilot studies to estimate outcome variance.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The ReTrain pilot trial met all its prestated feasibility objectives: the intervention, trial design and research processes were acceptable to participants as well as feasible and safe to deliver; we demonstrated feasibility of recruitment (recruiting above our target of 48) and retention (&lt;20% attrition). At the point of randomisation, we were slightly under target (45/48). However, due to high retention, we preserved the number of datasets required (30) to calculate sample size estimates. Furthermore, participants were not unduly burdened by study requirements and there were high completion rates for most outcome measures. We also successfully rehearsed procedures for process and health economic evaluations as well as trial governance processes (trial management and independent trial steering meetings) and maintained our strong Patient and Public Involvement. Participant interviews, outcome measurement results and fidelity assessments highlighted refinements that we have already, or can, put in place for a future definitive RCT of ReTrain. For example, we have some new insights into how to enhance delivery by trainers and engagement by participants (eg, by placing more focus on individually tailored goal setting; stressing goal and homework reviews; better explanation and promotion of the drop-in sessions). These are all relatively small amendments that are likely to enhance the impact of the training programme. Our trial compares favourably with another feasibility RCT assessing the delivery of the Bridges stroke self-management programme,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> which had relatively low recruitment, questions regarding programme delivery in addition to usual rehabilitation and recommendations for further assessment of intervention fidelity. Some of their findings were similar to ReTrain: participants were broadly positive about their programme; health professionals found it acceptable to use and researchers noted the lack of outcome measure sensitivity for detecting change.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Limitations and lessons for planning design of a future trial</title>
                <p>When planning this study we selected our candidate primary outcome measures on the basis that they were likely to measure improvements that could be attributed to our intervention; our pilot work was therefore to determine acceptability and feasibility (including their psychometric utility) of these measures. However, we were not able to identify a clear candidate primary outcome for a definitive RCT from this pilot work. It is possible that an âactivities of daily livingâ measure (as typically used in rehabilitation studies) may be more useful in a future definitive trial. Identifying robust outcome measures in rehabilitation trials is a common problem,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> compounded by variability in stroke-related disability and participantsâ comorbidities. This pilot trial was not designed (statistically powered) to test for differences between treatment arms, so no inferential analyses were performed. Any perceived trend (or absence of a trend) should not be interpreted as an indication of an effect (or its absence) and outcomes should not be selected based on any assumed trend. Acceptability outcomes coupled with a pragmatic and efficient (cost-effective) trial design better inform choice of outcome. From our sample, the Timed Up and Go task would be unsuitable due to potentially large sample size requirements (~2000 participants) and the baseline high levels of mobility meant that the Rivermead Mobility Index demonstrated a ceiling effect, so could only be used if we altered inclusion criteria. Physical activity was measured robustly via accelerometry and may be the best candidate. We had some software and hardware malfunctions but important lessons have been learned to mitigate these problems in future. Capture of frequency and intensity of activity would allow comparison with stroke guidelines. Although there is a cost implication, accelerometry provides a more objective measurement of daily activity and may also be an adequate proxy of functional mobility; however, we will also investigate the benefits of using other PA measures such as questionnaires (instead of our diaries) or using multiple measures such as accelerometry and heart rate monitors while being aware of problems with compliance and participant burden.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p>
                <p>Further limitations relate to the lack of validation of our adherence measure and the local demographics: our sample did not have a wide age range or ethnic diversity. While we did demonstrate delivery in different locations in the South West, our plans for a larger definitive trial would include a wider demographic from more centres across the UK.</p>
                <p>For a future trial, we plan to implement more readable, higher quality written (and pictorial) information and questionnaires although the amount of information provided was appropriate. We will mitigate recruitment loss prior to randomisation by establishing expression of interest and eligibility to take part but delaying taking consent until we are confident of sufficient numbers to create a cohort for randomisation; this has resource implications that will need to be built into future funding. We will run ReTrain in community centres or halls as these were more acceptable and much cheaper than gyms; we will provide a more detailed ReTrain induction to ensure trainers understand and communicate all components of the programme. For the QALY comparisons, recent policy changes mean the conversion from SF-12 to SF-6D has been phased out, and so less justification for using the SF-12 in a future study. Instead we will consider using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) as this is a valid health-related QoL measure. This may also be a better candidate self-report primary outcome measure for a definitive trial as it has shown sensitivity in long-term stroke survivors who have mild to moderate stroke.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The SIS assesses multiple facets of physical and emotional issues and so would align with perceived physical and psychological benefits participants attribute to ReTrain. Our sample size estimates for candidate objective primary outcomes (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) indicate that we will need a moderately sized trial (n=562, effect size 0.3 or n=413, effect size 0.35) for PA assessed by accelerometry or a smaller trial (n=96) if we use the physical component domain of the SIS (based on 80% power, 5% alpha and assuming 20% attrition<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We have established appropriate process evaluation methods to capture multiple facets of intervention fidelity.</p>

                <title>Generalisability</title>
                <p>This pilot study was not designed to demonstrate generalisability; however, our participant population represent the subset of community-dwelling stroke survivors who have some independent mobility but remain with stroke-related disability that affects their QoL. Our participants also represent the growing proportion of people who have more than one long-term condition. ReTrain techniques target the effects of stroke but can accommodate other conditions which trainers take into account when preparing the participantâs individually tailored programme. Some of the key ReTrain (ARNI-based) techniques are designed for people with unilateral impairment, such as hemiparesis; however, one of our participantâs main unilateral impairment was due to diabetes-related lower limb amputation, illustrating how ReTrain can accommodate people with multiple comorbidities.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our pilot trial has demonstrated that ReTrain is feasible, acceptable and safe. We met our recruitment and retention targets and demonstrated our ability to run our intervention in different locations. Participants were not unduly burdened by study requirements and most outcome measures had high levels of completion. We successfully tested procedures for process and health economic evaluations. Participant interviews, outcome measurement results and fidelity assessments highlighted some issues needing refinement prior to a future definitive RCT of ReTrain. Many of these have already been addressed and we intend to seek funding for a definitive trial.</p>
