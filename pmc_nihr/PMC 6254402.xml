                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Many people living with advanced dementia live and die in nursing care homes. The quality of life, care and dying experienced by these people is variable. Namaste Care is a multisensory programme of care developed for people with advanced dementia. While there is emerging evidence that Namaste Care may be beneficial for people with dementia, there is a need to conduct a feasibility study to establish the optimum way of delivering this complex intervention and whether benefits can be demonstrated in end-of-life care, for individuals and service delivery. The aim of the study is to ascertain the feasibility of conducting a full trial of the Namaste Care intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A feasibility study, comprising a parallel, two-arm, multicentre cluster controlled randomised trial with embedded process and economic evaluation. Nursing care homes (total of eight) who deliver care to those with advanced dementia will be randomly allocated to intervention (delivered at nursing care home level) or control. Three participant groups will be recruited: residents with advanced dementia, informal carers of a participating resident and nursing care home staff. Data will be collected for 6 months. Feasibility objectives concern the recruitment and sampling of nursing homes, residents, informal carers and staff; the selection and timing of primary (quality of dying and quality of life) and secondary clinical outcome measures (person centredness, symptom presence, agitation, quality of life, resource use and costs and residentsâ activity monitored using actigraphy). Acceptability, fidelity and sustainability of the intervention will be assessed using semistructured interviews with staff and informal carers.</p>

                <p>Dementia is a life-limiting condition, with a median survival, decreasing with age, of 6.7â1.9 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In advanced dementia, an individual requires full assistance with care is chair or bedbound, doubly incontinent and no longer able to communicate verbally (Functional Assessment of Staging of Alzheimerâs Disease (FAST) scale 6â7).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> People with dementia often experience a poor quality of death, preceded by a period of poor quality of life, with over and under treatment occurring.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â5</xref> There is an increasing urgency for appropriate care that will ensure a good quality of life and dying are achieved.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref>
</p>
                <p>Evidence for therapeutic healthcare interventions for people with advanced dementia is limited. Reviews of therapies such as music therapy indicate mixed outcomes for people with dementia, with a Cochrane review identifying equivocal evidence.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> More recent reviews of therapeutic interventions have identified large positive effects on behavioural, cognitive and physiological outcomes,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> to moderate effects on anxiety with small effects on behavioural symptoms and evidence for short-term improvement in mood and reduction in behavioural disturbance.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> In a Cochrane review of touch therapies, some evidence of an effect was identified, but not specifically for people with advanced dementia.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A recent review indicated that massage reduced levels of agitation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Interventions supporting person-centred care have been shown to reduce agitation and behavioural disturbance. There is some evidence for individualised interventions, within a bio-psychosocial framework, improving behavioural symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13â15</xref>
</p>
                <p>Interventions with a single focus on reducing pain, physical symptoms or specific behavioural disturbances have been found to be effective.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is recognised that for people with advanced dementia there is a need for interventions that complement and enhance pharmacological interventions. This study addresses the lack of evidence available through completed research, to consider the stage-specific efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> There is also a need for practical interventions that staff can learn to deliver which allow them to provide person-centred care.</p>
                <p>Palliative and end-of-life care interventions for people with dementia that emphasise a person-centred philosophy, and use co-design approaches, are being developed and tested.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Namaste Care is one such intervention. Non-randomised research studies have identified that Namaste Care at the end of life reduces the severity of behavioural and physical symptoms and occupational disruptiveness and may have an impact on social interaction, delirium and agitation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18â22</xref> The potential for cost savings with respect to reduced psychotropic medication use has also been indicated.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 23</xref> Qualitative evidence suggests greater family and staff satisfaction with care.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, none of these studies have compared this intervention with other approaches to palliative and end-of-life care for this population. We do not yet know the optimum way of delivering this complex intervention and which benefits (including cost-effectiveness) can be demonstrated in end-of-life care, for individuals and service delivery.</p>
                <p>In Phase i of this study, a realist review of 85 papers that considered Namaste Care and sensory interventions (such as music therapy or massage) for people with advanced dementia identified three contextâmechanismâoutcome configurations. This indicated what needs to be in place for Namaste Care to work for this population. The overarching theme was the importance of providing activities that enabled the development of moments of connection for people with advanced dementia. This can occur when the following three elements are in place: provision of structured access to stimulation (social and physical), equipping care home staff to be able to cope with complex variable behaviours and providing a framework for person-centred care.</p>

                <title>Intervention development</title>
                <p>The Namaste Care intervention is already promoted using existing resources.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> In this study, a four-stage approach to the development and refinement of the intervention resources was used. This entailed (1) collating the existing intervention materials and the findings of the realist review to draft an intervention description; (2) exploring the readability, comprehensibility and utility of the materials with staff unfamiliar with Namaste Care; (3) using a modified nominal group techniques with people with Namaste Care experience to refine and prioritise the intervention implementation materials; and (4) final refinement with the studyâs patient and public involvement panel. This led to production of a 16-page A4 booklet. The booklet included the use of flow charts, graphics and colour-coded information supported by infographics, and a training package.</p>
                <p>Therefore, we propose undertaking a feasibility cluster controlled randomised trial in a nursing care home context between 1 January 2018 to 31 March 2019.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>The randomisation of participating nursing care homes to either the intervention arm or the control arm will be undertaken by statisticians from the Clinical Trials Research Centre (CTRC) at the University of Liverpool randomisation team who will not be involved in the study. Due to the clustered randomisation approach of this study, all study participants will be assigned to the same study arm as the nursing care home they are associated with. The nature of the intervention and its delivery means that it will not be possible to blind nursing homes or staff to the allocation status. If possible, to minimise potential for bias, staff involved in the delivery of the Namaste Care intervention will not be involved in the completion of outcome measures. It will not be possible to blind researchers to the allocation of nursing homes as the intervention requires changes to the nursing home environment which may be visible to any researcher visiting the facility.</p>
