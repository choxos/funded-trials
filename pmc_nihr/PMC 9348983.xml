                <title>ABSTRACT</title>
                <sec id="abs1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Self-reported meat consumption is associated with disease risk but objective assessment of different dimensions of this heterogeneous dietary exposure in observational and interventional studies remains challenging.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs2">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We aimed to derive and validate scores based on plasma metabolites for types of meat consumption. For the most predictive score, we aimed to test whether the included metabolites varied with change in meat consumption, and whether the score was associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other noncommunicable diseases.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We derived scores based on 781 plasma metabolites for red meat, processed meat, and poultry consumption assessed with 7-d food records among 11,432 participants in the EPIC-Norfolk (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk) cohort. The scores were then tested for internal validity in an independent subset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 853) of the same cohort. In focused analysis on the red meat metabolite score, we examined whether the metabolites constituting the score were also associated with meat intake in a randomized crossover dietary intervention trial of meat (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12, Lyon, France). In the EPIC-Norfolk study, we assessed the association of the red meat metabolite score with T2D incidence (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1478) and other health endpoints.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The best-performing score was for red meat, comprising 139 metabolites which accounted for 17% of the explained variance of red meat consumption in the validation set. In the intervention, 11 top-ranked metabolites in the red meat metabolite score increased significantly after red meat consumption. In the EPIC-Norfolk study, the red meat metabolite score was associated with T2D incidence (adjusted HR per SD: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.24).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs5">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The red meat metabolite score derived and validated in this study contains metabolites directly derived from meat consumption and is associated with T2D risk. These findings suggest the potential for objective assessment of dietary components and their application for understanding diet–disease associations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Meat is an important component of the human diet and high consumption is a risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref>). However, meat consumption is a heterogeneous exposure and assessing total meat intake and specific subtypes such as red meat, processed meat, and poultry in epidemiologic studies that evaluate its influence on health outcomes remains challenging.</p>
              <p>Metabolite profiling is a promising approach for quantifying habitual meat intake and can be a complementary approach to self-reported dietary assessment methods (e.g., FFQs or dietary records) (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Diet is an important determinant of the plasma metabolome and a previous study estimated that it accounts for 50% of the explainable variance, compared with 2% of the variance explained by lifestyle factors, including smoking status, exercise time, etc. (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Measurement of metabolites as a complement to self-reported assessment methods has other theoretical advantages, including diminishing social desirability bias and recall bias, and greater comparability across populations (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>Several individual metabolites have previously been reported to be significantly associated with different types of meat consumption (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref>). However, few studies have examined how combinations of metabolites can predict meat consumption. Cuparencu et al. (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) reported that a combination of 6 metabolite biomarkers were able to assign people to a binary classification of red meat consumption in a 2-d feeding trial. However, the study was small and the result may be liable to overfitting.</p>
              <p>In the current study, we aimed to develop and test metabolite scores for different types of meat consumption by combining 781 blood metabolites in the EPIC-Norfolk (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk) cohort and then to take forward the red meat metabolite score to potential replication in a short-term randomized controlled trial (RCT) that measured metabolites after a red meat and a nonmeat diet. Finally, we tested whether the meat metabolite score was associated with the risk of incident T2D and other noncommunicable diseases to explore the potential utility of the score in understanding disease risk.</p>

                <title>Observational data for the derivation and validation of the metabolite scores: the EPIC-Norfolk study</title>
                <p>We developed and validated the metabolite scores for 3 types of meat consumption (red meat, processed meat, and poultry) using baseline data from the EPIC-Norfolk study, which originally recruited 25,639 males and females aged 40–79 y between 1993 and 1998 in the United Kingdom. Details of the recruitment procedures and data collection have been described previously (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Briefly, baseline characteristics for all participants were collected, including sociodemographic factors (age, sex, and education level), health behaviors (smoking status, alcohol drinking, and physical activity), and dietary measures. Blood samples were collected at baseline and stored in liquid nitrogen at −175°C. The EPIC-Norfolk study was approved by the Norwich Local Ethics Committee (REC Ref: 98CN01); all participants gave their informed written consent before entering the study.</p>
                <p>We developed metabolite scores for different types of meat consumption in an exploratory set which included 11,432 participants who had both untargeted metabolomics and dietary data. We excluded from this exploratory data set individuals who were part of a nested case-cohort study for incident T2D; those with extreme energy intake measures (&lt;500 and &gt;3500 kcal/d for females, &lt;800 and &gt;4200 kcal/d for males); or those with prevalent diabetes at baseline.</p>
                <p>Participants from the subcohort of an independent nested T2D case-cohort study (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) were used as a validation set, which included 853 participants after exclusions.</p>

                <title>Metabolomics measurement and data processing in the EPIC-Norfolk study</title>
                <p>We measured untargeted metabolomics using ultra-performance LC–tandem MS on the Metabolon DiscoveryHD4® platform from plasma samples collected at baseline. The measurement of metabolites was performed in 3 subsets in March 2015, January 2016, and March 2017 successively. The data quality control and processing methods have been described previously (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and are summarized in the <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref></bold>. After data quality control and data management, the 3 subsets included 1503, 5992, and 5980 individuals, in which 944, 1168, and 1219 metabolites were measured, respectively, and 781 metabolites were identical across all subsets.</p>
                <p>Before analysis, we undertook the following steps for each metabolite within each subset: log-transformation, replacement of outliers with 5 SDs from the mean (Winsorization), and standardization to a mean of 0 and SD of 1. For metabolite concentrations below the limit of detection, we imputed them with the lowest measured value of that metabolite (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The different subsets in the exploratory data set were measured at different time points, and we adjusted for measurement time period in the regression analysis.</p>

                <title>Assessment of meat consumption in the EPIC-Norfolk study</title>
                <p>Meat consumption and other dietary exposures were assessed with a 7-d diet diary (7dDD) as documented previously (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, on the day of a baseline assessment that included blood sampling, participants were asked to record everything they ate (food types, amounts, brands, recipes, and cooking methods) prospectively for the following 7 consecutive days. The dietary information was then processed into food and nutrient data by programs and databases (DINER and DINERMO) using standard protocols (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The meat-related categories were all disaggregated from composite dishes including red meat (unprocessed beef, lamb, pork, veal, rabbit, venison, etc.), processed meat (bacon, ham, sausages, etc., smoked, cured, salted, or chemically preserved), and poultry (chicken, turkey, goose, duck, guinea fowl, pheasant, etc.) in the unit of grams per day. Participants were also asked whether they followed a special diet (vegetarian, other diet, or no special diet).</p>

                <p>In the EPIC-Norfolk study, 781 metabolites were evaluated simultaneously for the prediction of red meat consumption. In the exploratory set, we applied elastic net regression (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) with a bootstrap approach (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) to select a combination of metabolites for prediction of red meat consumption; and ridge regression (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to estimate penalized weights of these candidate metabolites (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref>). We applied the weights of all candidate metabolites and constructed a metabolite score for each individual in both of the derivation and validation data sets. The score was standardized to a mean of 0 and SD of 1 for further analysis. The metabolite scores for processed meat and poultry were derived and tested using the same process.</p>

                <p>Given the availability of trial-based data for meat consumption, we further investigated associations of metabolites in the score from the observational EPIC-Norfolk study with red meat consumption in an RCT previously conducted in Lyon, France in 2018 (NCT03354130). The details of this RCT have been reported previously (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In brief, 12 healthy adults consumed in random order 5 different foods (fried pork, hot dogs, bacon, salami, and tofu) as part of a controlled diet. For this analysis, we examined the differences in metabolite concentrations between the fried pork (unprocessed red meat) and tofu control arms. In this trial, fasting plasma samples were collected during the morning after the last meal of each test period. Participants provided informed consent and procedures were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Ethics Committee (IEC Project 17-12).</p>

                <p>We assessed whether metabolites that were part of the metabolite score for red meat intake were increased after intake of fried pork (red meat) compared with tofu in the RCT. <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref></bold> shows the process of identification of metabolites that make up the red meat metabolite score in the RCT. First, we focused on metabolites that had been annotated successfully in the IARC laboratory and had a positive coefficient in the metabolite score. Corresponding signal intensities were extracted with Agilent Profinder 10.0 (Agilent Technologies) using the find-by-formula method [(M + H)<sup>+</sup> and (M − H)<sup>−</sup> ions only; exact mass: ± 8 ppm; retention time: ± 0.05 min). Metabolites were carried forward for statistical analysis if they were detected in &gt;75% of the samples collected after pork intake. Then we used paired Welch's <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> tests to assess whether metabolites were significantly (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) elevated in plasma samples collected after pork intake compared with tofu intake. Second, for metabolites not previously identified in the IARC laboratory, we extracted only those with a coefficient &gt; 1.0 in the meat intake score from the raw data by formula only to test for their increase in plasma samples after pork intake. Compounds were confirmed by comparison of MS/MS spectra to those in the literature (annotation confidence level 2 or 3) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>

                <title>Development and validation of metabolite scores for meat consumption</title>
                <p>In the exploratory set in the EPIC-Norfolk study, 139 metabolites were identified to be associated with red meat consumption, and they were assembled into a composite red meat metabolite score. This score was made up of 49 (19.3%) lipids and 30 (22.2%) amino acids, other metabolite classes such as xenobiotics (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14, 12.5%), and 36 (18.4%) unknown metabolites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>, <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 2</xref></bold>). The top 5 metabolites with positive coefficients were 1-(1-enyl-stearoyl)-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) (P-18:0/20:4), 1-(1-enyl-stearoyl)-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine (GPC) (P-18:0/20:4), 1-margaroyl-2-oleoyl-GPC (17:0/18:1), trans-4-hydroxyproline, and Verapamil. The derived metabolite score for red meat consumption achieved an explained variance of 24% and 17% in the exploratory and validation sets, respectively. The metabolite score for red meat intake was associated with quintiles of self-reported meat intake (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). It was also significantly higher in the subgroups of self-reported red meat consumers and nonvegetarians than in nonconsumers of red meat and vegetarians, respectively.</p>

                <p>The metabolite scores for processed meat consumption and poultry consumption consisted of 82 and 49 predictive metabolites, respectively, and were made up predominantly of lipids and amino acids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">4</xref></bold>). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the overlapping and distinct sets of metabolites that were associated with red meat, processed meat, and poultry consumption.

Overall, the 7dDD meat intake variance explained by the corresponding metabolite scores in the validation set was 15% for processed meat and 13% for poultry (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2</xref></bold>). <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Tables 5–7</xref></bold> show the details of parameter optimization and metabolite selection in the bootstrapping process. In additional analyses, we calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an indicator of renal function and assessed the associations between red meat intake and each of the 781 common metabolites after statistical adjustment for eGFR, showing that the coefficients were unchanged from the analysis that was not adjusted for eGFR.</p>

              <p>In this article we report the development and validation of metabolite scores for 3 different types of meat consumption—red meat, processed meat, and poultry—based on untargeted plasma metabolomics data and 7dDD data in a large British cohort with comprehensive phenotypes. In focused analysis on the red meat metabolite score, we found that 11 top-ranked metabolites in the score were associated with red meat intake in an RCT, suggesting a causal link between red meat intake and change of these metabolites. Finally, we found that the red meat metabolite score was associated with T2D incidence and potentially also associated with other cardiometabolic diseases.</p>
              <sec id="sec4-1">
                <title>Metabolite scores of meat consumption</title>
                <p>Previous evidence on combining biomarkers into scores to measure meat intake is limited. A trial in Denmark indicated that combinations of several metabolic biomarkers of red meat intake were more efficient than a single biomarker in classifying red meat consumers compared with other participants (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, previous studies had not evaluated a dose–response association between meat intake and a combination of biomarkers. In this large population-based study, we estimated the absolute amounts of meat intake with 7dDDs, which provides more accurate estimates than a FFQ in ranking consumption amounts (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our results indicate the utility of untargeted metabolomics to generate an overall score to predict the amount of meat intake rather than only being able to discriminate between consumers and nonconsumers.</p>
                <p>The metabolite scores of meat consumption were characterized by a wide range of metabolites, including lipids, amino acids, and xenobiotics. Several metabolites that constitute the derived scores have been identified by previous studies, such as TMAO, trans-4-hydroxyproline, creatine, and stearoylcarnitine (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Specifically, an RCT in the United States (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 113) reported that TMAO in plasma significantly increased after red meat consumption compared with consumption of poultry or nonmeat products. Positive associations of plasma TMAO concentrations with risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and all-cause mortality have been reported in several meta-analyses of clinical studies (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>). These results suggest that TMAO might be involved as part of underlying mechanisms between red meat intake and the development of chronic disease. In addition to metabolites in the score of red meat intake, several metabolites specific to processed meat (e.g., o-cresol sulphate) (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) or poultry consumption (e.g., 3-methylhistidine) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) in our study were also reported by previous intervention studies.</p>
                <p>We also identified several yet-unreported metabolites that were associated with red meat consumption in both the observational study and the RCT, in particular several plasmalogens, such as 1-(1-enyl-stearoyl)-2-arachidonoyl-GPE (P-18:0/20:4), 1-margaroyl-2-oleoyl-GPC (17:0/18:1), and 1-palmityl-GPC (O-16:0). Plasmalogens, a subclass of membrane glycerophospholipids, contain a vinyl-ether bond at the sn-1 position and are enriched in PUFAs at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Mazzilli et al. (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) found several plasmalogens were correlated with self-reported red meat consumption. However, most of the plasmalogens identified in our study were not reported in that previous study, partly due to different platforms being used to measure and annotate metabolites in the different studies. These compounds present a very promising group of potential new biomarkers for meat intake. Their role in meat metabolism and disease development is largely unknown and warrants additional investigation. Some drug metabolites were also identified in the red meat metabolite score, such as Verapamil and Ranitidine. These metabolites were detected in only a small number of participants (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 9</xref></bold>), so are likely to represent a subgroup of patients who have chronic disease and are taking these drugs (Verapamil for cardiac illness and Ranitidine for gastrointestinal illness). Because these conditions could themselves be linked to red meat consumption, it is likely that the association between these drug metabolites and dietary behavior is confounded by indication.</p>
                <p>One group of metabolites which make major contributions to the red meat metabolite score are small meat-derived molecules with short half-lives (e.g., TMAO, trans-4 hydroxyproline, or creatine) (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These compounds are unlikely to be good long-term markers of meat intake in people who consume meat occasionally because the metabolites would be cleared from the body relatively quickly. By contrast, these biomarkers may reflect regular red meat intake well. The second group of metabolites that rank highest in the score are lipophilic compounds (e.g., plasmalogens). These compounds have half-lives of days or even weeks and are likely to be good markers of long-term dietary habits (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and useful for identification of foods that are consumed rarely. These 2 groups of metabolites in the meat metabolite score ensure that the score reflects not only recent food intake but also dietary intake over a longer time frame. The focus on longer-term habitual intake as well as short-term intake is a strength of this study in respect of not only the biomarkers, but also the 7dDDs which have previously been shown to capture short-term and habitual dietary intakes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>

                <title>Associations with T2D risk</title>
                <p>The red meat metabolite score, as a proxy for red meat intake, showed a positive association with T2D risk consistent with results from several large cohort studies that have reported associations of T2D risk with self-reported intake as dietary exposures (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The score-derived association appeared to be comparable in magnitude with that using 7dDD-measured meat intake. Similar results were reported in a study on a metabolomics signature of the Mediterranean diet and its association with cardiovascular disease risk (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Future evaluations of the additional complementary information that can be obtained by measurement of metabolites over and above traditional dietary assessment methods should include investigation of cost-effectiveness and predictive utility for disease outcomes.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this study was the first of this kind to develop and validate a metabolite score for red meat intake in a large population study which has comprehensive dietary measurements and metabolomics data. Metabolite profiling provided a complementary approach to assess types of meat consumption objectively. The application of metabolomics to a meat intervention trial provided additional evidence on biological plausibility and reproducibility of the red meat metabolite score. In addition, in the EPIC-Norfolk study, a long follow-up with detailed information on multiple incident diseases enabled us to examine associations between the meat metabolite score and multiple health outcomes simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Several limitations warrant discussion. Firstly, the study was based on a British population so generalizability is limited for other populations and further validation studies should be considered. Secondly, although we have adjusted for a comprehensive set of confounders to examine the association between the red meat metabolite score and risks of noncommunicable diseases, the results may be affected by residual confounding. Thirdly, although we have tested the change of metabolites after meat intervention in a trial, the limited number of red meat products and the limited size of the trial hindered a comprehensive validation analysis. The potential causal links between meat intake and most of the candidate metabolites are largely unknown. Many metabolites in the score are probably not directly influenced by meat intake, but are affected by factors that are correlated with meat intake, such as BMI, or derived from metabolic or physiologic processes. Also, we might be unable to validate metabolites that reflect long-term diets because the feeding study tested short-term exposures. However, the most important metabolites were validated in the RCT and the score correlated well with meat intake in the validation set. Further validation studies with a wider range of confirmed metabolites in other populations are needed.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>This study suggests that a metabolite score derived from untargeted metabolomics profiles in plasma has the potential to reflect red meat consumption and inform the study of the association of red meat consumption, assessed objectively, with clinical outcomes.</p>
