              <p>In the era of an ageing population, where the prevalence of obesity is increasing, chronic venous disease (CVD) is an increasing burden.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> CVD can be divided into three main sub-types â superficial venous insufficiency (SVI - commonly known as varicose veins), deep venous insufficiency (DVI) and deep venous obstruction (DVO). SVI affects up to 80% of the population in its mildest form as graded by the CEAP clinical staging system (C1 - dilated cutaneous spider veins), up to 40% of the populationwith superficial varicose vein incompetence (C2) and up to 1% of individuals in its most severe form (C6 - venous ulceration).<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr4-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> DVI and DVO can be a primary or secondary condition with significant associations with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). DVT can be a manifestation of DVO and can lead to DVI. DVT leads to the development of the post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in up to 50% of patients, which can be extremely challenging to treat.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Modern treatment methods for DVO include endovenous stenting and open venous reconstruction, though these both require significant interventions, medication regimes and surveillance post-operatively.</p>
              <p>Untreated, varicose veins progress to more severe forms of CVD in 32% of patients over 6 years,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> while the incidence of DVI or DVO is expected to increase by 33% over 5 years,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> highlighting the potential future burden of venous disease. CVD yields important negative effects on quality of life and result in a significant expenditure of the national healthcare budget,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> particularly if it progresses to ulcerative disease. As such, interventions to help manage these conditions and their symptoms, are required.</p>
              <p>The progression of venous disease is thought to be due to persistently high ambulatory venous pressures, which can be offloaded by treating superficial venous incompetence.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Activating the calf muscle pump with activities such as walking, wearing compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression are thought to be beneficial in reducing this chronic venous hypertension, even in deep venous obstruction.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr15-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Assessment of venous haemodynamics has been carefully investigated over the past few decades with ultrasound derived measurements, with the effects of different neuromuscular stimulation devices, intermittent pneumatic compression devices and graduated compression stockings (GCS).<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr22-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The main haemodynamic parameters investigated include Time Averaged Mean Velocity (TAMV), Venous Volume Flow (VF) and Peak Venous Velocity (PV), which have been reported in previous venous flow studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="bibr24-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr26-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr27-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>TAMV is the venous flow equivalent to mean arterial blood pressure and is an attempt to provide a steady state estimation of a sinusoidal flow pattern over multiple cycles.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The femoral vein is the main exit conduit for venous blood in the leg, and therefore, an increase in average flow in this conduit should correspond to improved venous reservoir emptying and reduced venous pressure.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>

              <p>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) refers to the use of electrical impulses to elicit muscle contraction.

It has been shown to increase venous blood flow parameters by artificially activating the muscle pumps of the lower limb in healthy individuals<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and patients with CEAP C2-4 CVD.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> It has also been shown to prevent orthostatic oedema during use and improve disease specific quality of life (QoL) outcome measures in the pilot trial on patients with CVD.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Recent publications have asessed its use in claudicants.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Despite limitations of the pilot data, mainly pertaining the small sample size, the positive results compared to a sham device were encouraging. Previous work has suggested that graduated compression stockings (GCS) worn for 6 hours have a significantly larger effect on limb volume compared to this NMES device (a single session of 30 minutes of treatment).<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Recent work by Gianesini etÂ al. in healthy subjects found that sitting comfortably for 30 minutes leads to no significant increase in limb volume.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Additionally, recent work indicates that heel-rise test repetition may have a significant effect on clinical stage of venous disease and this is the exact movement elicited by the NMES in this device.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>

All patients had normal arterial exams and an ankle brachial pressure index of greater than 0.8. Patients with a target for superficial venous treatment were not included, so as not to delay interventional treatment, unless they had declined that intervention. Patients with a target for deep venous obstruction treatment were not included, so as to not delay interventional treatment, unless they had declined that intervention. The study recruitment team were separate to the clinical treating team to prevent conflict of interest.</p>
                <p>Patients with varicose veins only (CEAP C2 disease) were excluded as the pilot trial had demonstrated minimal effect in this patient cohort. Patients with C6 disease were excluded as their normal clinical management would include multilayer bandaging for treating ulceration, which is precluded in the use of this NMES device which requires skin to device contact. Patients were screened according to <italic>a priori</italic> agreed criteria (Supplementary Appendix 2). Medical history, medications and anthropometric measurements were recorded at baseline. A urine test was performed to exclude pregnancy in patients of reproductive age.

                  <title>The neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device: REVITIVEÂ® IX</title>
                  <p>The device investigated (REVITIVE<bold>Â®</bold>, Actegy Ltd) is a class IIa medical device, CE marked for treating disorders of the lower limb. The device is used in the seated position, with the usersâ bare feet placed on a pair of conductive footplate electrodes. Electrical impulses are delivered to the muscles and nerves of the feet, which cause foot and calf muscle contraction at a sufficient intensity. Direct contact between skin and electrodes is required for stimulation, precluding the use of compression stockings. Both feet have to be placed on the conductive footplates for the device to work.</p>
                  <p>The device runs a 30-minute programme of NMES consisting of 15 different waveform patterns, each with varying electrical output characteristics. The intensity of stimulation ranges from 1â99 units, delivering a maximum current of 15mA (r.m.s., root mean square) at 500Î© resistance. Stimulation intensity is increased by the subject until visible contraction is seen. The minimum threshold intensity level that should be used is double the stimulation intensity. Patients were advised to use the highest intensity that was comfortable for them. The intensity of stimulation varies for each individual, and is affected by oedema and moisture. The additional IsoRocker feature involves a fulcrum across the middle of the device over which the device can pivot to an angle of up to 15Â°. This allows the foot to remain in contact with the conductive footplate electrodes during ankle flexion and dorsiflexion. Patients were taught to use the device and instructed to utilise the both the electrical stimulation and the IsoRocker feature. The stimulation can be uncomfortable initially, however during the teaching phase patients were reassured that acclimatisation and tolerance develops.</p>

The full breakdown of duplex results is in <xref rid="table2-0268355520968640" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Analysis of the duplex data, including number of trunks involved indicates no difference between groups except for a higher incidence of iliac vein reflux and obstruction in Groups B and Group C (p=0.006). This suggests worsened anatomical venous disease in Group B and Group C compared to Group A despite randomisation. A full breakdown is in Supplementary Appendix 7.</p>

                <p>The immediate effect of NMES on limb volumes was assessed by comparing the pre- and post-treatment (or quiet sitting in group A) limb volumes. At week 0, group A demonstrated a significant median increase in limb volume of 73ml, (p&lt;0.001). Patients in group B had a median significant reduction in limb volume of 18ml, (p=0.046). Patients in group C demonstrated a significant increase in limb volume 11ml, (p=0.0451).</p>
                <p>At week 6, limb volume increased significantly post-treatment in group A by 46ml (+1%, p&lt;0.001), but remained static in groups B (p=0.726) and group C (p=0.681).</p>
                <p>There was no significant difference in limb volume over the 6 weeks, comparing pre-stimulation limb volumes between week 0 and week 6.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial demonstrates that the use of the REVITIVE IX device significantly increases venous flow parameters during device usage. No difference was seen between Groups B and C, indicating that maximum benefit was achieved during each intervention session, which is understandable from a mechanistic viewpoint. The effect of NMES on venous flow parameters is akin to the effect of exercise of moderate intensity. Although not measured directly, an increase in venous flow parameters would reduce ambulatory venous pressure, as is seen in deep venous stenting for outflow obstruction.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A significant improvement was also demonstrated in the lower limb microcirculatory blood flux whilst using the device. Poor microcirculatory flow is thought to be connected to venous ulceration.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the trial showed a significant difference in pre and post NMES limb volume in all three groups in week 0, at week 6, the change in limb volume was only significant in group A, suggesting that device usage prevents oedema associated with sitting still (orthostatic oedema), however there was no change in resting limb volume over the 6-week trial period, this requires further investigation to assess whether this is secondary to the short timescale of the study, or actually a peak improvement.</p>
              <p>There was a significant improvement in disease severity as measured by the VCSS in patients using the device for two 30-minute sessions a day (Group C), compared to a significant worsening in the VCSS score in patients in the control group (Group A). The VCSS is a clinician-completed questionnaire, scoring 10 hallmarks of venous disease in order of severity from 0 to 3 with a maximum score of 30, and is recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum as a clinical outcome measure. This study demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant 4-point reduction in VCSS score in the group receiving 60 minutes of treatment a day, suggesting an improvement in clinical severity of CVD following treatment with NMES, in line with that seen in randomised clinical trials after surgical intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><xref rid="bibr45-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr"/>â<xref rid="bibr46-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There was also a significant 6.29 point improvement in the disease specific AVVQ score in group C, which is above the accepted minimum important difference of 5 points in AVVQ. The control group demonstrated a non-significant worsening of their AVVQ score. The AVVQ is a validated patient completed QoL assessment tool comprising of 13 questions with domains including physical symptoms, social effects and cosmesis. Each question is graded in terms of severity or presence of symptoms, with a higher the score indicative of worse symptoms. In the multi-centre CLASS interventional study assessing surgical treatments of varicose veins, the improvement in AVVQ after invasive treatment at 6-weeks was greater than 5 points,<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> and the results from this study appear to offer a reasonable treatment pathway for those for whom interventions such as in CLASS are not available.</p>
              <p>The VDS results show an overall improvement, however, the study was not powered to show a significant difference between groups.</p>
              <p>The findings of this study with respect to clinical severity and disease specific quality of life suggests that twice daily usage of the NMES device may produce similar benefits to surgical intervention.</p>
              <p>There was no significant improvement in the generic quality of life outcome measures, which may be explained by the duration of the study. Generic quality of life measures may be relatively insensitive to short term change in symptomatology, and longer-term intervention duration may have led to produced similar findings as seen in the disease specific scores.</p>
              <p>The increase in microcirculatory flow indicated by increase in laser Doppler fluxmetre is to be expected with the increase in venous flow seen in groups B and C, and is in agreement with previous studies<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr48-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bibr49-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> as is the large confidence intervals due to the inevitable structural heterogeneity of the microvasculature.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Self-reported patient compliance with the NMES device appears extremely robust, which when coupled to the beneficial effects suggest that patients find the device feasible and satisfactory to use, with disease benefit.</p>
              <p>There were no adverse events reported in patients undergoing this trial.</p>
              <p>The results of this trial support the pilot trial findings, which were limited by the small sample population, leading to a biased difference in patient demographics in favour of the test group.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0268355520968640" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This dose finding study suggests that 2 sessions of treatment per day (1 hour in total) is needed to achieve the maximal improvements in QoL and clinical severity seen.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this trial include a short trial duration of 6 weeks. It is possible that the changes seen at 6 weeks may or may not persist over longer follow-up, and it is unknown whether changes persist after cessation of therapy. Indeed, it may be that the changes seen by 6 weeks are in fact only early changes and that a longer study would provide greater changes. This study did not fully recruit the target patient number, however, 84% of target were recruited (76 of 90), with 92% of those recruited returning for 6-week follow-up. The attrition rate was therefore below the planned 15%, providing appropriate statistical power.</p>
              <p>This study did not specifically assess lifestyle or working habits, which may lead to confounding variable. However, randomisation will have minimised the effect as much as possible.</p>
              <p>No formal venoactive drugs are licensed in the United Kingdom or available on the NHS, and they were not utilised in this study. It may be their usage alters the outcome of this study.</p>
              <p>The intensity of electrical stimulation deemed acceptable by each patient may have been an uncontrolled confounder, however initial training with the device highlighted the target intensity for use, and this was gauged as double the sensation threshold level.</p>
              <p>The study utilised optoelectronic limb volumetry rather than the gold standard of water plethysmography, and this may have slightly reduced the limb volume accuracy.</p>
              <p>The timing of the two sessions each day was at the discretion of the participant, with the options of two sessions in a row or two separate sessions, for pragmatic reasons as it was felt few study participants would comply with routine 1-hour sessions of NMES. This may have been a further confounder, but a further dedicated study would be required to investigate timings of sessions.</p>
              <p>Venous flow parameters were selected as a key primary outcome measure as they demonstrate an improvement in circulation. The variability in venous flow parameters can be attributed to a combination of factors. The varying electrical waveform patterns, which change every minute, result in different maximum strength of muscle contraction as well as duration of contraction and relaxation phases. Hence, certain rapid contractions may not be beneficial as it is akin to trying to pump water from an empty well. In addition, operator reliability, pressure by the ultrasound probe or operatorsâ hand on vein diameter, breathing and movement influence venous flow parameters.</p>
              <p>Movement caused by the powerful muscle contractions results in a reduction of vein diameter during the contraction phase as well as movement artefact. Due to these limitations, repeat venous haemodynamic measurements were taken at the same five-minute intervals to minimise device related variations.</p>
              <p>NMES has a variable effect on patients due to several factors. Pain thresholds affects the intensity tolerated by patients. Oedema and dry skin are a barrier to stimulation. Patients were advised to apply moisturiser if the effect of NMES was diminished. Patients with asymmetric disease (e.g. post-thrombotic syndrome) receive a lower intensity of stimulation on the affected limb, which reduces both the strength of muscle contraction and the improvement in venous flow parameters in the affected side. The intensity of stimulation is often limited by pain due to the stronger muscle contractions on the unaffected limb. However, tolerance for the treatment develops and so users also have to adjust the intensity to continue effective interventions.</p>
              <p>A larger study with a primary endpoint of AVVQ or VCSS improvement at 6 months would be beneficial to support this studyâs short-term findings of benefit from NMES. This would potentially place NMES as an additional conservative management for CVD, to be used in conjunction with other measures such as compression hosiery. Compression hosiery can be difficult to apply, can be poorly tolerate and requires quarterly replacement, whereas in principle the NMES device should have a significantly longer lifespan. In those unable to wear compression stockings NMES may offer a long-term option.</p>
