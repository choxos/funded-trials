                  <p>Young people aged 16 to 24 have the highest prevalence of genital chlamydia and gonorrhoea compared with other age groups and re-infection rates following treatment are high. Long-term adverse health effects include subfertility and ectopic pregnancy, particularly among those with repeated infections. We developed the safetxt intervention delivered by text message to reduce sexually transmitted infection (STI) by increasing partner notification, condom use and (STI) testing among young people in the UK.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A single-blind randomised trial to reliably establish the effect of the safetxt intervention on chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection at 1 year. We will recruit 6250 people aged 16 to 24 years who have recently been diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhoea or non-specific urethritis from health services in the UK. Participants will be allocated to receive the safetxt intervention (text messages designed to promote safer sexual health behaviours) or to receive the control text messages (monthly messages asking participants about changes in contact details) by an automated remote online randomisation system. The primary outcome will be the cumulative incidence of chlamydia and gonorrhoea infection at 1 year assessed by nucleic acid amplification tests. Secondary outcomes include partner notification, correct treatment of infection, condom use and STI testing prior to sex with new partners.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Younger people aged 16 to 24 bear the heaviest burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and their long-term adverse health effects including ectopic pregnancy and subfertility.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The risk of adverse health effects increases with repeated infections, and re-infection rates following treatment are high: up to 30% for chlamydia and 12% for gonorrhoea at 1 year.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Those with an STI are more likely to acquire further STIs and HIV, if exposed. There are marked inequalities in sexual health; STIs are positively associated with lower educational level<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and living in more deprived areas.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5 6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Partner notification, condom use and STI testing can reduce infection and re-infection. There is some evidence that existing interventions delivered face-to-face that target condom use and/or STI testing may be effective, but they are limited in their reach or too costly for widespread application.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Existing interventions delivered via the media have high reach but their effects have yet to be established.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Effective ways to increase partner notification in specialist and primary care settings are needed.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Mobile phones have the potential to provide effective, low cost health behaviour support.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> However, evidence for the effect of mobile phone support for safer sex behaviours such as condom use, partner notification and STI testing is equivocal.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> Interventions have targeted testing for STI,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–21</xref> delaying resumption of sexual activity until 42 days after circumcision<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and condom use,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 23 24</xref> but none have aimed to increase partner notification. The effect of mobile phone based interventions on STI is not known.</p>
              <p>In the UK, 99% of 16 to 24 year olds are mobile phone users (ONS, 2012) and mobile phone ownership is high across all socioeconomic groups. In research leading to this trial, it was demonstrated that interactive support via text message is particularly acceptable in the area of sexual health intervention.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 25 26</xref>
</p>
              <p>The safetxt trial builds on the successful intervention development work and pilot trial.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 26 27</xref> To develop the intervention, we convened a working group including experts in health psychology, contraception research, contraception service provision, information technology and the development of interventions delivered by mobile phone. The intervention messages were developed based on: behaviour change theory, evidence-based behaviour change techniques, the content of effective face-to-face safer sex interventions, the factors known to influence safer sex behaviours, the views of 82 young people collected in focus groups and a questionnaire completed by 100 people aged 16 to 24.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The theory and evidence-based intervention is designed to reduce STIs in young people by supporting them in telling a partner about an infection, using condoms and obtaining testing before unprotected sex with a new partner. In a qualitative study with young people, recipients reported that the tone, language, content and frequency of messages was appropriate.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Messages reportedly increased knowledge and confidence in how to use condoms and reduced stigma enabling them to tell a partner about an STI. Sharing messages with their partner enabled participants to negotiate condom use.</p>
              <p>The pilot trial demonstrated that methods of recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery and follow-up were successful and that a full-scale randomised controlled trial of the safetxt intervention is feasible.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this trial is to quantify the effects of the safetxt intervention compared with a control group receiving usual care and messages about trial participation on chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection at 1 year. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of safetxt on partner notification and condom use at 4 weeks and on condom use and STI testing at 1 year. Which intervention components are effective will be explored by collecting data on the theoretical constructs on the pathway to behaviour change influenced by the intervention components. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be established.</p>

                  <title>Safetxt intervention group</title>
                  <p>The intervention aims to increase safer sex in three ways: (i) encouraging participants to correctly follow STI treatment instructions including informing partner(s) about infection, (ii) promoting condom use with new or casual partners and (iii) encouraging participants to obtain testing for STI prior to unprotected sex. Participants in the intervention group will receive regular messages delivered by text message in community settings according to a predetermined schedule. The intervention was informed by the capability, opportunity and motivation model of behaviour.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It aims to influence the knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, skills, social and interpersonal influences that have important effects on motivation, capability and opportunity to reduce sexual risk behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Over the first 10 days participants are sent messages targeting engagement with the intervention, taking treatment, avoiding sex for 7 days after treatment and telling partner(s) about an infection. These messages provide non-judgemental, non-stigmatising information about STI. They provide suggestions about when, where and how to tell partner(s) about an infection and examples of how others told partners covering a range of different types of relationship (eg, casual, long-term).</p>
                  <p>Messages then target condom use and testing for STIs before having sex without a condom with a new partner. Topics cover risk assessment, instructions on how to use condoms, positive aspects of condom use, tips on preventing condom problems and examples of how others resolved condom use problems. Participants are prompted to think about their own success in achieving safer sex strategies, risks they had taken and what they could do differently in the future. Messages included advice regarding testing before unprotected sex with a new partner. Participants are sent links to: services, support for those concerned about partner violence, and web-based information regarding contraception, alcohol and sexual risk, how to use a condom and general communication about sex. The messages provide social support for safer sex behaviours and acknowledge participants experiences.</p>
                  <p>The intervention employs educational, enabling and incentivising behaviour change functions and 12 behaviour change techniques: information about health consequences of behaviour, instruction on how to carry out the behaviour, demonstrations of risk reduction behaviour, social support, emotional support, social rewards, non-specific incentives, encouragement to add objects to the environment, anticipated regret, problem solving, action planning techniques and reframing.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The information on safer sexual practices is in accordance with existing guidelines.</p>
                  <p>The messages are tailored according to gender and sexual orientation. Women who have sex with men only (WSM), men who have sex with men only (MSM), men who have sex with men and women (MSMW), women who have sex with men and women (WSMW) are sent messages about how others had negotiated condom use. WSM and men who have sex with women only (MSW) are sent messages about emergency contraception. MSM and MSMW are sent messages about post exposure prophylaxis. Women who have sex with women only (WSW) are not sent messages about condom use. The information provided is specific to the STI diagnosed. This tailoring results in different numbers of messages being sent to those of different gender and sexual orientation.</p>
                  <p>The core message sets include: 74 messages for WSM and WSMW, 42 messages for WSW, 69 messages for MSW and 79 messages for MSMW and 76 messages for MSM. Recipients can request additional messages on specific topics. Participants are sent: four messages per day for days 1 to 3, then one to two messages per day for days 4 to 28, then two to three messages per week for month 2 and two to five messages per month for months 3 to 12.</p>

                  <title>Control group</title>
                  <p>Participants in the control group will receive a monthly untailored text message asking for information about changes in postal or email addresses. Example control group message: ‘Thank you for taking part in the texting study. Remember to let us know if your contact details have changed by replying to this text or emailing safetxt@lshtm.ac.uk’.</p>
                  <p>All participants will receive usual care and will be free to seek any other existing service or support they wish. The control group is not attention matched as during the pilot work young people reported that it was irritating to receive the same number of messages as the intervention group about another health topic, when they had just been diagnosed with an STI. If the trial shows a benefit it is possible that this could be due to simply receiving the number of messages involved in the intervention, rather than the message content. However, given the lack of effect of some mobile phone message based interventions in sexual health this seems unlikely.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
                  <p>All messages are sent automatically from a large database to an aggregator, which conveys messages to each participant in the community via their network. The success of delivery of messages at each step is monitored by the aggregator and computer system that generates the messages. A member of the trial team will automatically be notified if there is any failure in the delivery of messages. All participants will be able to set embargoed times when they do not want to receive messages. Participants will be able to stop text messages, but continue with the trial follow-up, by texting ‘stop’ to the short code number.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>The primary outcome will be assessed using chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests collected by post at 1 year and clinic records of completed tests. STI test kits for chlamydia and gonorrhoea will be posted (in P650 standard packaging) to respondents. Directions in the pack will ask participants to provide a vaginal swab (women), a urine sample (men) and additional anal and pharyngeal samples (men who have sex with men) and post it in the prepaid and addressed envelope to the laboratory. Test kits will be identified by lab number only, rendering the laboratory staff blind to the participant’s allocation. The accredited laboratory will destroy samples after testing is completed.</p>
                <p>Results of the STI testing will be reported on the secure trial lab site by lab code only. Clinical records will be checked to identify participants who have had a positive STI diagnosis since joining the study, confirm self-reported STI testing and partner attendance for treatment.</p>
                <p>At 4 weeks and at 1 year, postal questionnaires will be sent to all participants to collect self-reported data. Non-responders will be contacted by any method the participant agrees to at enrolment (post, email, text message, telephone call). Participants can directly enter self-reported outcome data via a web-based data entry form. Paper based self-reported outcome data or self-reported data collected by telephone will be directly entered into the web-based data entry form by a trial assistant blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
                <p>Participants will be sent a £5 unconditional incentive with each postal request, that is, when sending the 4 weeks questionnaire and 1 year test and questionnaire. Participants who return the test sample will be sent £20. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref> for the Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments. All outcome data will be collected on participants who choose to stop messages unless they withdraw from the trial.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The study is powered for the primary outcome measure of cumulative incidence of chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea infection at 1 year. Two main factors determine the number of participants needed for this trial: the estimated event rate, and the size of the treatment effect. Our estimates are based on the following data:</p>
                <sec id="s2-10-1">
                  <title>Estimated event rate</title>
                  <p>The estimated event rate for the cumulative incidence of STI at 1 year is 20%, based on the event rate in cohort studies and the pilot trial.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

                  <title>Size of treatment effect</title>
                  <p>Because the intervention can be administered to large populations at low cost, even a modest reduction in treatable STIs would be worthwhile. The trial has therefore been designed to detect a reduction in chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection of 20% versus 16% (relative risk 0.8), which is similar to the effects of face-to-face safer sex interventions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

                  <p>In the pilot trial 2% of the control group viewed messages delivered to intervention participants. If the real difference in STI infection at 1 year follow-up is 20% versus 16% then with contamination of 2% the trial would detect a difference of 19.9% versus 16%. (Calculated based on 2% of the control group having an infection rate the same as the intervention group = (98% x 20%) + (2% x 16%) = 19.9%).</p>
                  <p>Five thousand participants would provide 90% power to detect this difference, allowing for 20% losses to follow-up.</p>
                  <p>The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) reviewed the blinded event rate after 546 patients had completed 12 months follow-up and recommended an increase in the sample size to 6250 due to a lower than expected event rate of 15.6%.</p>

For the primary outcome and other binary outcomes, we will estimate any differences between the groups using logistic regression and we will report ORs with 95% CIs and p values, adjusting for key baseline predictors of outcome. These will be specified in advance in the SAP. For continuous outcomes, we will use linear regression to test for a difference in mean scores between the arms.

                  <p>Before fitting our primary analysis model, we need to identify appropriate auxiliary variables to include in the imputation model. Such auxiliary variables should have information about the missing outcome. Specifically, an independent statistician will use a data set without the treatment variable and perform regression analyses to identify key predictors of outcomes and which combination of baseline variables and time to negative STI test in clinic should be included as auxiliary variables in the imputation model. We will supplement this by performing and reporting a complete case analysis (where any participants with missing information on any covariate or outcome shall be excluded).</p>

At 4 weeks, each of the five process outcomes were measured using the candidate questionnaire items (three to five items per process outcome). Based on these items, we will carry out confirmatory factor analysis to refine and identify a valid measurement model. For the main trial analyses, the final measurement model will be combined with the intervention group allocation, along with key baseline predictors, extending the measurement model to a Multiple Causes Multiple Indicators model. This model will be used to estimate the effects of the intervention on the five hypothesised process outcomes.</p>

                <p>The safetxt trial will not have a separate Data Monitoring Committee. No interim analyses of intervention effects will be conducted since the trial is of a behavioural support intervention unlikely to cause harm, and therefore, there are no stopping rules. Analysis of intervention effects will be conducted once at the end of the trial. The sponsor may audit the trial per their own risk assessment and schedule.</p>
                <p>Harms will be assessed by self-reported data. Car accidents are the only demonstrated harm resulting from text messaging, hence the intention to collect data regarding involvement in road traffic accidents. The safetxt intervention aims to increase partner notification of STI status. Fear of partner violence has been reported to be a barrier to partner notification and partner notification has been identified as a factor which may trigger partner violence. However, no randomised controlled trials targeting increased partner notification detected a difference in partner violence between the control intervention groups. Data will be collected regarding the experience of partner violence at 12 months.</p>
                <p>In addition, participants will be asked an open-ended question in the 12-month questionnaire: ‘Did anything good or bad happen as a result of being involved in the study or receiving the text messages? Please describe.’ The Clinical Trials Unit will keep detailed records of all adverse events reported. Reports will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the TSC to consider intensity, causality and expectedness. As appropriate, these will be reported to the sponsor and the Ethics Committee.</p>

              <p>STIs such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea confer a heavy burden of disease among young people with long-term sequelae such as infertility. Safer sex behaviours such as condom use, notifying partner(s) about an existing STI and STI testing reduce the risk of STI, but young people may lack the knowledge, confidence and skills needed to adopt these behaviours. Safer sex interventions delivered by mobile phone are acceptable to young people and show promise in increasing safer sex behaviours, but to date their effects on STI are not reliably known.</p>
              <p>If it proves to be effective, this low-cost intervention could have an important impact in improving sexual health and reducing inequalities among young people in the UK. There is likely to be international interest in the impact of the intervention as short written messages delivered via mobile phones are increasingly used for behavioural support worldwide and sexually transmitted infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality.</p>
