                  <p id="Par1">Falls are a public health issue for the older adult population and more so for people with dementia (PWD). Compared with their cognitively intact peers, PWD are at higher risk of falls and injurious falls. This randomised controlled trial aims to test the clinical and cost effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve postural balance among community-dwelling PWD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger definitive trial to reduce the incidence of falls among PWD.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A 3-centre parallel group randomised controlled trial with embedded process evaluation. One hundred and fifty community-dwelling dyads of a person with dementia and their informal carer will be recruited and assessed at baseline and at six-month follow-up. Dyads will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either usual care or usual care plus a Tai Chi intervention for 20 weeks. The Tai Chi intervention will consist of weekly classes (45 min’ Tai Chi plus up to 45 min for informal discussion, with up to 10 dyads per class) and home-based exercises (20 min per day to be facilitated by the carer). Home practice of Tai Chi will be supported by the use of behaviour change techniques with the Tai Chi instructor at a home visit in week 3–4 of the intervention (action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring, and alarm clock reminder) and at the end of each class (feedback on home practice). The primary outcome is dynamic balance measured using the Timed Up and Go test, coinciding with the end of the 20-week intervention phase for participants in the Tai Chi arm. Secondary outcomes for PWD include functional balance, static balance, fear of falling, global cognitive functioning, visual-spatial cognitive functioning, quality of life, and falls. Secondary outcomes for carers include dynamic balance, static balance, quality of life, costs, and carer burden.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Falls are the leading cause for emergency department (ED) presentation in adults aged 65 and above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A significant proportion of these patients have dementia - around 25–34% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] - because people with dementia (PWD) are more than twice as likely to fall and twice as likely to experience injurious falls compared to their cognitively intact peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The consequences are long-term and far-reaching; PWD are more likely to experience adverse health outcomes during their hospital stay and after discharge such as hospital readmission, institutionalisation, and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, there is a pressing need to prevent falls among PWD.</p>
              <p id="Par19">There is robust evidence for interventions to prevent falls and fall-related injuries among community-dwelling people without dementia and, in particular, exercise-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, research is required into the best ways to provide exercise-based interventions. For example, a recent large UK exercise trial found that home-based exercise did not increase activity or prevent falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For people with dementia, meta-analyses have found that strength and balance training interventions significantly prevent falls among older people with cognitive impairment in the community (pooled risk ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.55–0.85) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and across settings (pooled rate ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.51–0.91) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, few studies were included in the meta-analyses (3 community-dwelling; 7 across-settings) and some trials recruited small samples (as few as 11 participants in the intervention group). Further research is critical to determine which type of physical activity best prevents falls among PWD. Tai Chi may well be an effective way of promoting exercise for falls prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Tai Chi is an ancient form of Chinese mind-body exercise, where participants carry out smooth and continuous body movements along with deep breathing and mental concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; equivalent to moderate-intensity exercise and quiet meditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This form of exercise is particularly suited for PWD with the use of slow and repetitive movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that aims to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve postural balance among community-dwelling PWD and to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial to reduce falls. We hypothesise that Tai Chi will help prevent falls by improving dynamic balance. Dynamic balance is highly predictive of rate of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and so it will be used as a surrogate outcome in this trial. This research programme is the first in the UK to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi to improve balance among PWD (current study) and the first in the world to use Tai Chi in a randomised controlled trial to prevent falls among PWD (future study). The trial is registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (ID no: NCT02864056, first posted August 11th, 2016) and this paper is a summary of the protocol version 4.3, dated 23/05/2018. To test if the new intervention can provide patient benefit in addition to usual care, no alternative intervention or waiting list control group will be offered.</p>

In the UK, those who are concerned about their memory or are suspected to have dementia by their GP are referred to a memory assessment service. The memory assessment service will diagnose a person with dementia, and depending on the type and severity of dementia, may prescribe medication. Otherwise, no further treatments are offered for the PWD, and in particular, no Tai Chi or other physical activity is prescribed. Patients under the care of one of the NHS Trusts that are recruiting to the trial are provided with an educational course to provide information, support, and advice to PWD and a similar course is provided separately for informal carers. In addition, for those living in some areas, a referral is made to a memory advisor who provides telephone contact to check on the wellbeing of the PWD and their informal carer. Under the two other trusts, there is support from the voluntary sector in the form of memory advisors for every patient and informal carer before and after diagnosis, in the form of advice, information, guidance, and signposting to local services.</p>

                    <p id="Par29">Each session will last for 90 min, with 45 min instructor-led group Tai Chi followed by up to 45 min informal discussion. Dyads will be encouraged to participate in the informal discussions each week to foster mutual peer support, and provide opportunity for ongoing advice from the Tai Chi instructor in relation to the home-based exercise component. Up to 10 dyads may attend per class. Teaching is based on implicit learning techniques, drawing on the Positive Emotion-Motivated Tai Chi (PEM-TC) approach developed in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Through repetition of movements and positive reinforcement, this approach capitalises on PWDs’ capacity to continue to learn motor tasks with the use of muscle or kinaesthetic memory, i.e., unconsciously through making behaviours automatic, despite impaired ability to explicitly recollect such memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

Dyads will be given a pack containing a colourful home exercise booklet and weekly homework sheets, to serve as a reminder of what has been covered in the classes each week and to prompt practice of Tai Chi at home. The carers will be asked to facilitate the PWD to carry out Tai Chi for 20 min each day, at a convenient time and location. For safety reasons, dyads are asked not to practise Tai Chi at home until the Tai Chi instructor has made the home visit.</p>

The Tai Chi instructor will re-affirm to dyads the benefits of doing Tai Chi and the central role of the home-based exercises to obtain these benefits, as recommended in NICE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To enhance uptake and adherence to the home-based Tai Chi exercises, the instructor will then facilitate the dyad to make joint action and coping plans, which are based on self-regulation theory that has robust empirical support for increasing physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For action planning, dyads will decide together when and where they will do their Tai Chi exercises at home. For coping planning, the PWD and their carer will anticipate any personal barriers that may arise for them whilst carrying out the Tai Chi exercises at home and what they can plan to do to overcome them. The use of these behaviour change techniques has been recommended in NICE guidelines for physical activity promotion and behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Other techniques recommended by these guidelines already embedded within the design of the intervention include self-monitoring (dyads will record their weekly completion of Tai Chi exercises), feedback on performance and adherence (from the instructor each week), and social support (from the instructor and peers in the class) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                    <p id="Par32">In addition, the dyads will receive two forms of reminders that may help with their adherence to the TACIT Tai Chi intervention. First, they will be provided with a small branded alarm clock that they can set as a prompt to do their daily Tai Chi. Second, if dyads do not attend a Tai Chi class for two consecutive weeks for an unknown reason, at the next scheduled weekly telephone call with the PWD, the researcher will take the opportunity to remind the dyad of their Tai Chi class and encourage them to continue attending the class.</p>

                  <p id="Par37">Falls measurements will be collected prospectively from baseline until six months post-baseline. These include the number of falls by PWD (count data), the proportion of PWD who have fallen (binary outcome measure), and number of injurious falls (count data). The collection of falls data is in accordance with recommendations made by the Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In our trial, the definition of a fall is, “an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Falls will be recorded by dyads daily using prospective monthly calendars and returned on a monthly basis by post for data entry. Where falls are reported by dyads or calendars are not returned, a researcher will conduct a telephone interview to collect further information about the fall/clarify missing data. Telephone calls will be conducted weekly with the PWD as recommended for falls data collection with PWD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, to ascertain the accuracy of different recall periods, telephone calls about fall incidents by the PWD will be made monthly with the PWD and every 3 months with the carer. Fall injury will be recorded by telephone interview when recording falls as described above, using an existing set of definitions for severity of injury ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], p.).</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par39">A formal sample size calculation was undertaken based on detecting a difference in mean timed up and go (TUG) test scores between the intervention and control arms of the study. We found no studies looking at minimum clinically important difference, but did find two studies that had estimated smallest detectable change (i.e. the smallest change that we can be reasonably sure is not measurement error). The two values were 4.09 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and 5.88 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and we used a conservative value of 4. To find an estimate of standard deviation (SD) for TUG, we found several relevant papers but the values were sensitive to the mix of age and severity of dementia, with one study that seemed to most closely match our population and be based on a reasonable sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 58) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. SDs from two different time points were presented (9.74 and 9.01) and we used the average of these (9.38) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In our analysis we will enter baseline TUG as a covariate and assume a correlation of 0.7; test-retest reliability of TUG is excellent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] but we acknowledge the duration between time points in our study will be longer than prior studies and so we have used a more modest correlation.</p>
                  <p id="Par40">Therefore, using a mean difference in TUG of 4, an SD of 9.38, a correlation of 0.7 and a 2-sided 5% significance level, the study will have 90% power when the sample size is 120 (60 per group). Allowing for up to 20% withdrawal / non-completion of outcome measures, we will recruit 150 dyads into the trial (75 per group). These calculations were conducted using nQuery Advisor 7.0. The intervention partly takes place in classes, and there is a possibility of clustering effects. However for the purposes of the sample size calculation we have assumed that these will be negligible, because (a) much of the intervention occurs outside the class environment, and (b) interaction between PWD is not a specific purpose of the intervention’s effect on the primary outcome (only to enhance adherence to the intervention). Clustering effects will be considered in the statistical analysis.</p>

The researcher will wait a minimum of 48 h before contacting potential participants to ensure they have had sufficient time to consider the information in the Participant Information Sheet. Both PWD and carer must be present at the initial visit and both must provide written informed consent.

                <title>Assignment of interventions</title>
                <p id="Par49">In this trial we will aim to achieve equal balance of recruitment of participants between treatment conditions according to the following key prognostic variables: dementia type (due to eligibility criteria, this will be relatively homogenous in this study), age, fall history, and dementia severity. These are important variables because impairment in postural stability will be elevated among those who are older, have fallen in the past 12 months, and present with more severe dementia symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Given that these key prognostic variables are positively correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], only one variable - fall history at baseline: has / has not fallen within the previous 12 months – was selected for a parsimonious and achievable strategy for balancing prognostic factors. The method of allocation needed to accommodate a trial design that allowed for variability in Tai Chi class size according to a dynamic recruitment process. Therefore, to ensure balance within each of the three treatment sites (and across the entire trial), minimisation will be used within each site to achieve a balance in fall history.</p>
                <p id="Par50">For each of the 11–15 classes, once a minimum of 4 dyads in total have been recruited, the dyads will be randomised to the intervention or control group. Random allocation will be achieved using a centralised automatic web-based randomisation system designed and maintained by the UKCRC-registered Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). Once a minimum batch of 4 dyads has been recruited within a treatment site, the first dyad will be allocated using simple randomisation and the remaining dyads allocated using minimisation. Afterward, any further dyads recruited into the study before the fifth class has taken place will be randomised individually by minimisation and join the class if so allocated.</p>

After the home visit, dyads will be informed in writing of their treatment arm allocation by staff at the CTU. Given the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to keep PWD, carers or Tai Chi instructors blind to treatment arm allocation. The researcher who collects baseline data will be kept blind to treatment arm and, in particular, when they conduct the six-month post-baseline follow-up home visit. Participants will be asked at the time of arranging the follow-up visit and at the beginning of the follow-up home visit not to disclose their treatment condition, and to conceal any evidence of participating in class or home-based Tai Chi. After data collection is completed for each follow-up visit, the researcher will make a note of their guess of the treatment arm for the dyad and if dyads accidentally disclose their treatment condition.</p>

Participants will be analysed in the group they are randomised to, and (with the consent of participants) we will attempt to collect complete data on everyone and use those data in the analyses. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all baseline outcome data for each trial arm separately. Descriptive statistics will be presented on the following for the PWD and their carer: gender, age, relationship status, current living arrangements, education level, ethnicity, previous experience of Tai Chi and treatment site. Additional descriptive statistics will be presented in relation to PWD: type of dementia, time since diagnosis, other long term conditions, existing injuries, use of a walking aid, number of medications currently taken, falls history (in past 12 months and past month), and current level of physical activity (moderate and vigorous).</p>
                  <p id="Par55">Mean TUG scores at 6 months, the primary outcome, will be compared between the two trial arms using a mixed (multi-level) model approach to take into account clustering resulting from the group-based nature of the Tai Chi intervention. Baseline TUG, treatment site, and falls history in the past 12 months (Y/N) will also be included in the model. We will assume that the missing data mechanism is “Missing at Random” (MAR). No imputation methods will be used for the main analysis but will be explored in additional analyses. The method of analysis will be similar for other secondary outcomes for the PWD and carer. In addition, falls count data and the proportion of participants who fell will be analysed using negative binomial and logistic models respectively, taking into account falls history and treatment site. We will also conduct a per protocol analysis that will exclude participants from the Tai Chi group if they received fewer than 50 h (the intended minimum dose of the intervention).</p>
                  <p id="Par56">One subgroup analysis is pre-planned for the primary outcome variable (TUG). Fall history at baseline (had a fall or not in the past 12 months), which is also the variable used for minimization in addition to treatment condition, will be entered as an interaction term in a statistical model (intervention effect x effect modifier). Departures from the proposed analysis, for example due to poor recruitment, will be explained and justified in the main trial paper. Feasibility objectives will be addressed by estimating recruitment and attrition rates (with 95% confidence intervals) and falls data parameters (falls rate, proportion of fallers, and completeness of falls data) for a future sample size calculation. In addition, we will compare the frequency of falls reported by each of the individual methods of data collection and their combination to determine if the increased resource in collecting falls data weekly provides more accurate data.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">Descriptive data from the structured exit interviews will be presented on hypothetical willingness to pay for the intervention and perceived changes to health (PWD and carer). Data on number of Tai Chi classes attended and adherence to home practice will be presented. To assess adherence to the intervention in the Tai Chi arm we will calculate: adherence to classes (i.e. x attended out of y possible) and adherence to home exercise (i.e. x minutes exercise out of y recommended). The following data will not be reported in the main trial outcome paper but will be included in further secondary analyses in relation to visual spatial cognitive functioning (statue task); comparison of the different methods of data collection on incidence of falls; qualitative data; and uptake and adherence to the intervention (whether the PWD or carer had done Tai Chi before, mean (SD) intention and perceived behavioural control to do Tai Chi, and intervention group responses to the questionnaire delivered half way through the intervention).</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Given the short-term (6-month) follow-up, low-risk intervention being tested, and no planned interim analyses, there will be no data monitoring committee for the trial.

Health service use on falls will be calculated in relation to presentation to the GP, out of hours, or ED. We will also explore cost effectiveness results for PWD and their carers between arms in terms of incremental cost per change in quality of life. All health economic analyses will be presented descriptively in terms of completion (missing data) and outcomes (e.g. mean and SD in relation to baseline and follow-up), as the study has not been powered to conduct a full health economic analysis, which is reserved for the subsequent definitive trial.</p>

The idea of doing a Tai Chi intervention was presented to the group, with an explanation of Tai Chi provided by a qualified instructor. The group found the idea of a Tai Chi intervention appealing, and influenced the application in four ways: The inclusion of informal carers in dyads beyond partners / spouses; the provision of weekly classes for the whole 20-week course; the importance of ease of transport to each venue; and asking dyads about hypothetical willingness to pay for the intervention at the exit interview. Since the project began, a PPI advisory group of ten people (4 PWD, 5 spouses of PWD, and a daughter of a PWD) have inputted into the development of this trial protocol and continue to provide PPI input throughout the trial at regular intervals.</p>

              <p>The authors acknowledge senior instructor Robert Joyce, Elemental Tai Chi, who designed the 20-week Tai Chi course for this study. The authors thank senior instructor Robert Joyce and instructor Vicki Fludgate for delivering the Tai Chi intervention under the company Elemental Tai Chi. The authors acknowledge the advice received from Dr. Shanti Shanker in regard to cognitive testing, Dr. Jonathan Williams in regard to objective measurement of static and dynamic balance, and our public and patient involvement group on our approach to recruitment and data collection. The authors thank the Alzheimer’s Society for their assistance with publicising the study, and the support of the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN). The authors thank the General Practice surgeries in Wessex that assisted with recruitment, and the three main recruitment sites: Memory Assessment Research Centre, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust (Principal Investigator: Brady McFarlane), Memory Assessment Service, Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust (Principal Investigator: Kathy Sheret), and Research and Improvement Team and Older People’s Mental Health Service, Solent NHS Trust (Principal Investigator: Sharon Simpson). We also thank the Trial Steering Committee for their expert input (Independent Chair: Frances Healey, NHS Improvement).</p>
              <p>The authors acknowledge Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust for sponsorship of the trial (for contact details, please see ClinicalTrials.Gov registration). The sponsor’s responsibilities are as defined in the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care (second edition, 2005). However, funding from the NIHR is managed by the Chief Investigator, at Bournemouth University. Also, tasks associated with various sponsorship responsibilities have been delegated to the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (UKCRC registration no. 31) and are described in a formal agreement between the sponsor, CI, and Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). The CTU is responsible for controlling trial-related documentation and for communicating changes to relevant stakeholders (Research Ethics Committee, Health Research Authority, trial registries, etc.). The sponsor will work closely with the trial management group and will have influence on the design of the trial protocol and will support the conduct of the trial and the dissemination of its results. Therefore, the sponsor will have influence on trial design, conduct, and dissemination of results, but not on data analysis and interpretation or manuscript writing.</p>

                <title>Funding</title>
                <p id="Par66">SRN (chief investigator) is funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Career Development Fellowship Award. This paper presents independent research funded by the NIHR’s Career Development Fellowship Programme. The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health. During the peer-review and interview process the chief investigator received critical comment on the proposal. However, the funder will have no influence on the trial, including: trial design, conduct, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results. The chief investigator will have final decision on these matters.</p>

                <p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Colleagues involved in the trial management group and the trial steering committee also declare that they have no competing interests. The Tai Chi instructors who are delivering the intervention are working under the private company of Elemental Tai Chi. This company already provides Tai Chi classes and private tuition in the areas where participants will be recruited. Therefore, this company may be impacted by the dissemination of its results. However, Elemental Tai Chi will not be involved in the collection of outcome data, analysis of the trial outcomes, or dissemination of results (they will only be allowed to circulate any dissemination activity from the trial).</p>
