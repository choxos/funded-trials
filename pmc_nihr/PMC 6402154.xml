                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Assisted vaginal birth is a vital health intervention that can result in better outcomes for mothers and their babies when complications arise in the second stage of labour. Unfortunately, instruments for assisted vaginal birth (forceps and ventouse) are often not utilised in settings where there is most clinical need, resulting in maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality which could have been prevented. The BD Odon Device is a new device for assisted vaginal birth that may be able to address this unmet need. However, before dissemination, the device requires evaluation in robust clinical trials. A feasibility study to investigate the clinical impact, safety, and acceptability of the BD Odon Device for assisted vaginal birth is therefore planned. This will provide further information on acceptability, recruitment, and the outcome data required to design a future randomised controlled trial of the BD Odon Device versus Kiwi ventouse.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Forty women who require an assisted vaginal birth for a recognised clinical indication will have the birth assisted with the BD Odon Device. The primary outcome is successful vaginal birth completed with the BD Odon Device. Secondary clinical outcomes include maternal and neonatal outcomes, and maternal and practitioner satisfaction. Safety data will be reviewed following every birth.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">Complications of the second stage of labour (fetal compromise, obstructed labour, maternal exhaustion, or maternal medical conditions exacerbated by the act of pushing) remain a major cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity across the world. Such complications are responsible for 4% to 13% of maternal deaths in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in 2013 obstructed labour alone accounted for four deaths per million women worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This burden of adverse outcomes may be reduced by an appropriately timed and safely performed assisted vaginal birth (AVB). An AVB is performed with either obstetric forceps or ventouse, and reduces adverse outcomes for women and their babies relative to caesarean section performed in the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, AVB rates are minimal in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where it is likely that there is the greatest need for AVB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Percentage of births as AVBs in selected countries, 2008 to 2015. Data adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3249_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par21">In addition to widespread low levels of utilisation, earlier surveys report significant regions where AVB was not used at all—in 2006 this was the case in 74% of Latin American and Caribbean countries, as well as 30% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and 40% of countries in Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to a lack of trained accouchers in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the maintenance and sterilisation requirements of both forceps and ventouse may limit their utilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is a significant unmet need for AVB in all maternity settings, but particularly in LMICs.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Forceps are less likely to fail in achieving an AVB when compared to a ventouse; however, they are associated with increased maternal perineal and vaginal trauma. The ventouse is less likely to achieve a vaginal birth and its use is associated with an increased risk of neonatal cephalohaematoma and retinal haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Both devices are efficient but do have caveats for their use. It is possible that a new device may be able to address some of the adverse events associated with the current devices used to assist birth.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The BD Odon Device is a new device for AVB (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The use of an air chamber to act as the traction point on the fetal head (rather than the thin metal blades of the forceps) is hypothecated to reduce adverse events associated with the greater pressures applied to the fetal head during the use of forceps. The lack of negative pressure on the fetal head, the mechanism of action of the ventouse, obviates the risk of haematoma and haemorrhage associated with ventouse. Both of these contentions have been supported in pre-clinical simulation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A first-in-human pilot study of an earlier version of the device in healthy volunteers has been completed and demonstrated that assisting birth using the device is feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Following the completion of extensive simulation studies which included human factor engineering validation testing, it has been deemed appropriate to evaluate the BD Odon Device in the intended target user population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To date, the effectiveness and safety of the Odon device compared with other devices remains untested. It is now time to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of the BD Odon Device in its intended clinical setting, using an appropriately powered and robust randomised controlled trial (RCT). To inform the design of this study we plan to conduct a safety and feasibility study exploring the clinical impact that the BD Odon device may have on current clinical practice, as well as the safety and acceptability of the device to women, midwives, obstetricians, and neonatologists.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The BD Odon Device component parts</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3249_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

Recruitment is projected to continue for 8 months (due to the AVB rate within the department) after which time it is estimated that 40 sets of primary outcome data will have been recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par28">Prospective participants will receive information on the study in early pregnancy (12 to 28 weeks) via the NBT Maternity ‘App’ (this ‘App’ is provided to all pregnant women at NBT and provides information on all aspects of their maternity care) and paper information leaflets given to women at any hospital admission. Members of the study team will then approach women after 28 completed weeks of pregnancy during antenatal appointments or antenatal admissions to discuss the study and offer women the opportunity to watch a video explaining the study. Women who are willing to take part (should they require an AVB) will then be invited to provide informed written consent.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par100">An appropriately conducted AVB, performed when clinically indicated, is associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes when compared with caesarean section in the second stage of labour or compared with no action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. AVB is currently not performed in many low- and middle-income settings where it may be of significant benefit to individual woman and their babies in reducing birth-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Current efforts to promote the use of AVB in these settings have been insufficiently effective which may be due to the inherent limitations of the existing instruments. Therefore, the development of a new device for AVB is both justified and required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par101">The BD Odon Device is the first new device for AVB since the introduction of ventouse into clinical practice in the 1950s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Extensive pre-clinical simulation testing has suggested that it is not likely to generate additional pressure over the fetal head compared with current instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], is not likely to generate clinically significant levels of neonatal hypoxia if misplaced over the fetal carotid arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and is not likely to be associated with unsafe patterns of use by the target user population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We believe that it is therefore reasonable to proceed to a clinical feasibility study of the device, and, if positive, a randomised controlled trial.</p>
              <p id="Par102">If found safe by the TSC, IDMC, and Sponsor, findings from this feasibility study will inform the design of a randomised controlled trial that may produce evidence that supports the introduction into clinical practice of a new device for AVB. If this were able to address the unmet need for AVB around the world it would have a major impact on the management of complications in the second stage of labour and maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide.</p>
