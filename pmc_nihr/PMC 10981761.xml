                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The evidence for whether ivermectin impacts recovery, hospital admissions, and longer-term outcomes in COVID-19 is contested. The WHO recommends its use only in the context of clinical trials.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised controlled trial, we included participants aged ≥18 years in the community, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and symptoms lasting ≤14 days. Participants were randomised to usual care, usual care plus ivermectin tablets (target 300–400 μg/kg per dose, once daily for 3 days), or usual care plus other interventions. Co-primary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and COVID-19 related hospitalisation/death within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. Recovery at 6 months was the primary, longer term outcome.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>The primary analysis included 8811 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants (median symptom duration 5 days), randomised to ivermectin (n = 2157), usual care (n = 3256), and other treatments (n = 3398) from June 23, 2021 to July 1, 2022. Time to self-reported recovery was shorter in the ivermectin group compared with usual care (hazard ratio 1·15 [95% Bayesian credible interval, 1·07 to 1·23], median decrease 2.06 days [1·00 to 3·06]), probability of meaningful effect (pre-specified hazard ratio ≥1.2) 0·192). COVID-19-related hospitalisations/deaths (odds ratio 1·02 [0·63 to 1·62]; estimated percentage difference 0% [−1% to 0·6%]), serious adverse events (three and five respectively), and the proportion feeling fully recovered were similar in both groups at 6 months (74·3% and 71·2% respectively (RR = 1·05, [1·02 to 1·08]) and also at 3 and 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Ivermectin for COVID-19 is unlikely to provide clinically meaningful improvement in recovery, hospital admissions, or longer-term outcomes. Further trials of ivermectin for SARS-Cov-2 infection in vaccinated community populations appear unwarranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">Ivermectin is a safe, cheap, well tolerated and widely used anti-parasitic drug that has been widely promoted and trialled as a treatment for COVID-19. There are various mechanisms by which ivermectin could have activity against SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin may inhibit the binding and within-cell transport to the nucleus of viral proteins that normally suppress the cell’s anti-viral response, enhancing the host cell’s ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In-vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that ivermectin significantly reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, Interleukin–1 beta and Interleukin 6<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>; and could therefore reduce the cytokine storm and ensuing cellular damage that occurs in some individuals with COVID-19. However, in-vitro studies have used concentrations of drug which are substantially higher than may be achievable in plasma using clinical dosing.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In a molecular modelling study, ivermectin appeared to bind with high stability to RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), suggesting that ivermectin may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 activity through RdRp inhibition.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0010">Some early trials found that ivermectin reduced hospital admissions and death from COVID-19, but several of these trials were found to be flawed, for example due to inadequate or lack of description of randomisation, lack of allocation concealment, or evidence of differences between arms at baseline, requiring meta-analyses to be updated.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Despite the controversial evidence base, prescriptions for the drug increased dramatically in the USA and many other parts of the world.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p id="p0015">Recent systematic reviews have found insufficient evidence of benefit from ivermectin on recovery outcomes,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> hospital admission,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> ventilation,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> or mortality,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> while one concluded there was insufficient evidence to make a firm recommendation.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Shaifee and colleagues included 17 trials in a meta-analysis and concluded ivermectin should not be used outside of clinical trials for COVID-19,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> or should be used with caution.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A Cochrane review found that ivermectin in addition to usual care versus usual care alone or placebo probably has little or no effect on outcomes including admission to hospital or death within 28 days, but that the certainty of these conclusions was very low for many outcomes including hospital admission and clinical improvement.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Furthermore, none of the trials reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for meta-analysis.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Some of the benefits from ivermectin treatment may be related to its antiparasitic effect in areas of high prevalence of parasite infection.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0020">The largest of the RCTs in outpatients, the TOGETHER trial, conducted in a largely unvaccinated Brazilian population, could not fully rule out potential for a modest benefit on the requirement for treatment escalation to secondary care.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The ACTIV-6 and COVID-OUT placebo controlled trials of ivermectin at 400 ug/kg for 3 days<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and 600 ug/kg for 6 days<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> in largely vaccinated Americans, regardless of risk factors, found no clinically significant benefit in sustained recovery, hospital admissions or incidence of long COVID over 10 months,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> but were arguably underpowered to detect a difference in hospital admissions. Pragmatic trial evidence from high-income countries among a largely vaccinated population remains an important evidence gap, as does an understanding of whether ivermectin can reduce persistent symptoms or improve function in the longer term.</p>
              <p id="p0025">We aimed to determine whether ivermectin speeds recovery and reduces COVID-19 related hospital admission or death in people in the community, and in addition evaluated whether there was a longer-term effect on symptoms and function at 3, 6 and 12 months.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="p0030">We assessed the effectiveness of ivermectin in the UK national, multi-centre, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, prospective adaptive Platform Randomised trial of Treatments in the Community for Pandemic and Epidemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE), which opened on April 2, 2020, and closed to recruitment on July 1, 2022. The protocol is available in the appendix (pp 6–103) and at the trial website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.principletrial.org" id="ir0005">www.principletrial.org</ext-link>. A “platform trial” allows multiple interventions for the same disease to be tested simultaneously. A master protocol defines prospective decision criteria for dropping interventions for futility, declaring interventions superior, or adding new interventions.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This allows interventions with little evidence of meaningful benefit to be rapidly dropped for futility and replaced by new interventions, thereby directing resources towards identifying community-based treatments for COVID-19. Interventions evaluated in PRINCIPLE include hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> doxycycline,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> inhaled budesonide,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> colchicine,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> favipiravir (active arm from April 9 2021), and, reported here, ivermectin. The open trial design was chosen due to the urgency to determine whether prescribing repurposed medicines had an important beneficial impact, <italic>compared to not prescribing the drugs</italic>, meaning that the appropriate comparator condition was treatment without the study drug. Procuring matched placebo would also have delayed the opening of the study. Participants receiving a study intervention, regardless of whether it is active treatment or placebo, are likely to alter their health-seeking behaviour in response to this uncertainty,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and effect sizes from open trials do not differ meaningfully from placebo controlled trials.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0035">The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the South Central-Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 20/SC/0158) approved the trial protocol. Online consent was obtained from all participants after person-to-person discussion and explanation. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for fidelity to the protocol. An independent Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring and Safety Committee provided trial oversight.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="p0040">When the ivermectin arm opened, people in the community were eligible if they were aged ≥65 years, or ≥18 years or above with co-morbidities, or breathlessness as part of their COVID-19 illness. They either had suspected COVID-19 using the syndromic definition available at the time or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms must have started within the previous 14 days and be ongoing. From 29th July 2021 onwards, amended eligibility criteria required all participants to have a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and allowed recruitment of all adults regardless of co-morbidities (appendix pp16). People were ineligible to be randomised to ivermectin if they were already taking ivermectin or if ivermectin was contraindicated according to the British National Formulary. Additional exclusion criteria were: allergy to ivermectin/excipients; known or suspected pregnancy; breastfeeding; women of childbearing potential not prepared to use highly effective contraception for 28 days post enrolment; ever having travelled to countries endemic for <italic>Loa loa</italic>; bleeding diatheses; severe liver disease; and, grapefruit consumption. Initially, eligible people were recruited, screened and enrolled through participating general medical practices, but from May 17, 2020, people across the UK could also enrol online or by telephone. After patients completed a baseline and screening questionnaire, a clinician or trained research nurse confirmed eligibility using the patient’s primary care medical record or summary care record, accessed remotely where necessary, before randomisation. We implemented several community outreach strategies aiming to increase recruitment of people from ethnically diverse communities and socioeconomically deprived backgrounds, who have been disproportionally affected by COVID-19.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="p0045">Eligible, consenting participants were randomised using a secure, in-house, web-based randomisation system (Sortition version 2.3). Randomisation was stratified by age (&lt; 65 years/≥ 65 years), and presence of comorbidity (yes/no) and probabilities were determined using response adaptive randomisation via regular interim analyses, which allows allocation of more participants to interventions with better observed time to recovery outcomes, enabling the trial to demonstrate benefit sooner, or rapidly remove poorly performing intervention arms (appendix pp 160–163). The allocation probability for the Usual Care arm remained fixed at 1/<italic>Z</italic> throughout the trial, where <italic>Z</italic> is the number of active interventions studies in the platform. The trial team was blinded to randomisation probabilities.</p>

                <p id="p0050">Participants were followed up through an online, daily symptom diary for 28 days after randomisation, supplemented with telephone calls to non-responders on days 7, 14 and 28. The diary included questions about illness recovery (ascertained by answering the question, “Do you feel recovered today? (i.e. symptoms associated with illness are no longer a problem) Yes/No”), overall illness severity (a rating of how well they are feeling on a scale of 1–10 [1 being the worst and 10 being the best]), individual symptom severity on a four-point scale (0 = no problem to 3 = major problem), and healthcare service utilisation. Participants could nominate a trial partner to help provide follow-up data. We obtained consent to ascertain healthcare use outcome data from general practice and hospital records.</p>

                <p id="p0060">Participants received usual care plus ivermectin according to weight bands to target 300–400 μg/kg, taken as one dose daily for 3 days [18 mg daily (6 ×3 mg tablets) for weight 45–64 kg, 24 mg daily (8 ×3 mg tablets) for weight 65–84 kg, and 30 mg daily (10 ×3 mg tablets) for weight ≥84 kg]. Participants were advised not to eat two hours before or after taking ivermectin. Medication and study packs were delivered to the participant by urgent courier. Usual care in the UK National Health Service (NHS) for suspected COVID-19 in the community is largely conservative and focused on symptom management.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> From 16 December 2021, a minority of extremely clinically vulnerable patients, could also access antiviral treatment or a monoclonal antibody infusion.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>

                <p id="p0065">The trial commenced with the primary outcome of suspected COVID-19 related hospitalisation or death within 28 days. However, hospitalisation rates in the UK were lower than initially expected.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Therefore, the Trial Management Group and Trial Steering Committee recommended amending the primary outcome to also include illness duration,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which is an important outcome for patients and has substantial economic and social impacts. This received ethical approval on September 16, 2020, and was implemented before performing any interim analyses. Thus, the trial has two co-primary endpoints measured within 28 days of randomisation: 1) time to first reported recovery defined as the first instance that a participant reports feeling recovered; and 2) hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19. Decisions about COVID-19 relatedness were made after independent review of available data by two clinicians blinded to treatment allocation and study identifiers.</p>

                <p id="p0075">To assess the impact of ivermectin in reducing the risk of long terms effects of COVID-19 we collected data at 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. This was assessed by the patient reported primary outcome of feeling fully recovered at 6 months, with full recovery at 3 and 12 months follow up as a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes collected at 3, 6 and 12 months included: number of unwell days (in the past 2 weeks) if participant reported partial or no recovery from their original COVID-19 illness (range from 0 to 14 days), rating from 1–10 of how well participants felt on the day of questionnaire completion, WHO-5 Well-Being Index,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> ongoing persistent COVID-19 pre-specified symptoms (feverish, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of smell, loss of taste, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, muscle ache, generally unwell, fatigue) defined as participants reporting the same symptoms and severity repeatedly at 3, 6 and 12 months and relatedness reported as yes or unsure. Impact of COVID-19 on work/studies at any point during follow-up was assessed at 12 months, and participant reported contacts with healthcare services from 28 days after randomisation up until 12 months.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="p0080">Sample size calculation and statistical analysis are detailed in the Adaptive Design Report (appendix pp 158–329), the Master Statistical Analysis Plan (appendix pp 103–157), and Statistical Analysis Plan for Long Term Follow-up (appendix pp 330–344). In the Adaptive Design Report we justify sample sizes by simulating the operating characteristics of the adaptive design in multiple scenarios, which explicitly account for response adaptive randomisation, early stopping for futility/success and multiple interventions. In brief, for the primary outcome analyses, assuming a hazard ratio of 1.3 (median time to recovery of nine days in the usual care group and seven for ivermectin), approximately 400 participants per group would provide 90% power to demonstrate superiority of ivermectin versus usual care. Assuming 5% hospitalisation in the usual care group at the time of designing the study, approximately 1500 participants per group would provide 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation/death for ivermectin versus usual care.</p>
                <p id="p0085">The first co-primary outcome, time to first self-reported recovery, was analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential model. The second co-primary outcome, hospitalisation/death, was analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Both models were regressed on treatment group and stratification covariates (age &lt; 65 years /≥ 65 years and comorbidity yes/no), and vaccination status. These primary outcomes were evaluated using a “gatekeeping” strategy to preserve the overall Type I error without additional adjustments for multiple hypotheses. The hypothesis for the time-to-first-recovery endpoint was evaluated first, and if the null hypothesis was rejected, the hypothesis for the second co-primary endpoint of hospitalisation/death was evaluated. In the context of multiple interim analyses, the master protocol specifies that each null hypothesis is rejected if the Bayesian posterior probability of superiority exceeded 0·99 for the time to recovery endpoint and 0·975 (via gatekeeping) for the hospitalisation/death endpoint. For the purposes of defining futility rules, we pre-specified a clinically meaningful hazard ratio for time to first reported recovery as 1·2 or larger (equating to approximately 1·5 days difference in median time to recovery, assuming 9 days recovery in the usual care arm), and a clinically meaningful odds ratio as 0·80 or smaller for hospitalisations/deaths (equating to approximately a 1% decrease in the hospitalisation rate, assuming a rate of 5% in the usual care arm). However, due to larger sample size as the trial continued, it became apparent that the futility rule for hospitalisation/death was too conservative. With the approval of the Trial Steering Committee, the futility rule was made more aggressive by increasing the futility threshold for the probability of meaningful benefit on hospitalisation from 0.01 to 0.25, a change dated June 1, 2022 and described in detail in Section 4.1.2 of the Adaptive Design Report version 5.0 (appendix, pp 168).</p>
                <p id="p0090">If there was insufficient evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit in time to recovery, futility was declared and randomisation to that intervention would be stopped, meaning other interventions could be evaluated more rapidly in the trial. For each primary outcome endpoint (time to recovery and hospitalisation/death), a pre-specified model-based estimate of absolute benefit (days and percent, respectively) was obtained by applying the model-based estimate of treatment benefit (hazard ratio or odds ratio, respectively) to a bootstrap sample of the concurrent and eligible usual care population.</p>
                <p id="p0095">At the beginning of the trial, due to initial difficulties with community SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the UK, participants with suspected COVID-19 were included in the primary analysis population, irrespective of confirmatory testing. When testing became more accessible, the Trial Steering Committee recommended restricting the primary analysis population to those with confirmed COVID-19. This change was included in protocol version 7·1 on February 22, 2021 and approved on March 15, 2021, before the introduction of ivermectin to the trial platform. Therefore, the pre-specified primary analysis population includes all eligible SARS-CoV-2 positive participants randomised to ivermectin, usual care, and other interventions, from the start of the platform trial until the ivermectin arm was closed, on 1 July, 2022. This population includes participants randomised to usual care before the ivermectin group opened. The primary analysis models include parameters to adjust for potential temporal drift in the trial population, by estimating the primary endpoint in the usual care group across time via Bayesian hierarchical modelling.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>

                <p id="p0125">The first participant was randomised into PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. Enrolment into the ivermectin group started on June 23, 2021. On July 1, 2022, the Trial Steering Committee advised the Trial Management Group to stop randomisation to ivermectin because the update, pre-specified futility criterion had been met on hospitalisation/death. All participants were followed up for the full 28 days. Participants taking ivermectin were asked to stop taking treatment as futility had been demonstrated.</p>
                <p id="p0130">11768 participants had been randomised of whom 2439 were allocated to ivermectin, 4359 to usual care alone, and 4970 to other treatments (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="sec0135" ref-type="fn">S1</xref>). The Bayesian primary analysis model includes data from 8811 of 9577 (92%) SARS-CoV-2 positive participants who provided follow up data and were randomised to ivermectin (n = 2157), usual care alone (n = 3256), and other treatment groups (n = 3398). To protect the integrity of the platform trial and other interventions, we only provide descriptive summaries of participants randomised to ivermectin and usual care. The average age (range) of participants was 53·8 (18–100) years, 5331 (95%) were White and 3391 (71%) had comorbidities. At randomisation, median time from symptom onset was 5 (interquartile range 3–7) days. Baseline characteristics were similar between the comparison groups (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, <xref rid="sec0140" ref-type="sec">S1</xref> and <xref rid="sec0140" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>). Data regarding inhaled corticosteroid was not consistently recorded early in the trial, but in the concurrent randomisation analysis population, 399/2157 (19%) of the ivermectin arm and 338/1806 (19%)

                <p id="p0140">In the SARS-CoV-2 positive primary analysis population, the observed median time to first recovery was 14 days in the ivermectin group compared to 15 in the usual care group (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the concurrent randomisation analysis population, (excluding participants randomised to usual care before the ivermectin arm opened) the observed median time to first recovery was 14 in the ivermectin group and 16 in the usual care group. Based on the Bayesian primary analysis model which adjusts for temporal drift, there was evidence of a benefit in time-to-first-recovery in the ivermectin group versus usual care (hazard ratio 1·145, 95% Bayesian credible interval [1·066 to 1·231]. Based on a bootstrap estimated median time to recovery of 16 days in the concurrent and eligible usual care SARS-CoV-2 positive population, the model-based estimated hazards ratio corresponds to an estimated 2·055 (0·999 to 3·06) fewer days in median time to first reported recovery for ivermectin relative to usual care. The probability that time to recovery was shorter in the ivermectin group versus usual care (i.e. probability of superiority) was &gt;0·9999, which met the pre-specified superiority threshold of 0.99. The probability of meaningful effect (pre-specified as a hazard ratio ≥1.2 for the purpose of evaluating futility) was 0·192 (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

                <p id="p0145">In the SARS-CoV-2 positive primary analysis population, there were 34/2157 (1.6%) COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths in the ivermectin group (33 hospitalisations, of whom 2 died, 1 death without hospitalisation), and 144/3256 (4.4%) in the usual care group (143 hospitalisations, of whom 11 died, 1 death without hospitalisation). The high levels of hospitalisations/deaths in the usual care group in the primary analysis population were driven by the higher event rate before the ivermectin arm opened. In the usual care group in concurrent randomisation analysis population, which excluded participants randomised to usual care before the ivermectin arm opened, there were 27/1806 (1.5%) COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths. In the Bayesian primary analysis model, which takes into account the temporal change in event rates, COVID-19 related hospitalisation/deaths in the ivermectin group compared to usual care were similar, with an estimated odds ratio of 1·017 (95% credible interval 0·633 to 1·622). Based on a bootstrap estimated hospitalisation rate of 1·5% in the concurrent and eligible usual care population, the model-based estimated odds ratio corresponds to an estimated difference in the hospitalisation rate of 0% [−1·0% to 0·6%]) (<xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The probability that COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were lower in the ivermectin arm versus usual care (i.e. probability of superiority) was 0·472. The probability that there was a meaningful reduction in COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths (predefined as an odds ratio of 0·80 or smaller) was 0·223 which is below the 0·25 threshold indicating enrolment should stop for futility.</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p id="p0165">This analysis from an open-label platform, randomised controlled trial of ivermectin for COVID-19 in the community suggests clinically meaningful improvements in recovery time are unlikely, with no reduction in hospital admissions, little difference in symptoms and no difference in days unwell, or impact on work and studies, at one, three, six and 12 months.</p>
                <p id="p0170">Ivermectin reduced the time to first reported recovery by about two days from the median of 16 days in the usual care group. This result was statistically significant (HR = 1·14, 95% Interval= 1·07 – 1·23), but the estimated hazard ratio was less than the pre-specified meaningful effect of 1·2. Given that the proportion of illness duration reduced is the most meaningful assessment of benefit, rather than the absolute number of days with illness saved, and that mean illness duration varies over time with COVID-19, our blind prior was that a benefit with an HR of less than 1·2 (approximately 1·5 days difference in median time to recovery, assuming 9 days to recovery in the usual care arm) would not be considered clinically meaningful. There was no evidence that ivermectin reduced the need for hospital admission. Findings were similar in the primary analysis population, which included all SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, and in the sensitivity analyses that include only those controls randomised concurrently with ivermectin. We found a small benefit of ivermectin in terms of the proportion of participants feeling fully recovered at 3, 6 and 12 months, on a range of measures of recovery and time to recovery, and on ratings of wellbeing. There were no differences in number of days participants felt unwell in the previous 2 weeks, or impact on work or studies and healthcare usage at 3, 6 and 12 months. Overall, these findings, while evidencing a small benefit in symptom duration, do not support the use of ivermectin as treatment for COVID-19 in the community among a largely vaccinated population at the dose and duration we used, which is in keeping with current NICE guidance.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="p0195">The PRINCIPLE trial adopted a pragmatic, adaptive platform design, which allowed for efficient evaluation of the effectiveness of ivermectin as an early, standalone intervention as it might be used in the community. The use of a shared control group added to the efficiency of the trial, reducing the overall number of participants required to determine ivermectin’s effectiveness, compared with traditional trial designs. Although concerns have been raised that use of a common control group in platform trials may lead to an inflation of type I error, the overall type I error rate has been shown to be smaller in platform trials with a common control compared to a trial with individual controls. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Furthermore, the Bayesian primary analysis model leveraged previous enrolments in the usual care arm to increase the precision of estimates while also adjusting for potential temporal change in previous usual care enrolments. Interim analyses allowed ivermectin to be discontinued (due to futility on the hospitalisation/ death outcome). We focused on patients at increased risk of complications and used routine electronic health records to confirm hospitalisation/death, obtaining primary outcome data on over 92% of participants. The median time from symptom onset to stating treatment was five days. We are unique in evaluating a number of long-term follow-up outcomes including symptoms and healthcare usage.</p>
                <p id="p0200">We used time to first-reported recovery as a primary outcome as it was of greatest interest to our patient and public involvement (PPI) contributors and is best ascertained by direct patient report, rather than by the use of surrogate measures.</p>
                <p id="p0205">We used an open label design, similar to other large COVID-19 platform trials,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> with the aim of rapidly assessing clinically meaningful benefit of ivermectin in addition to usual care. This is in keeping with pragmatic trial design, which is more closely reflective of usual clinical practice, and consequently the results are more likely to reflect real-world outcomes.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Whilst we are unable to estimate the effect of placebo on our findings, we found no evidence of a benefit in time to recovery for other open evaluations of interventions in the PRINCIPLE trial.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The findings of small differences in self-reported recovery outcomes may have been influenced by high expectations of benefit from ivermectin treatment as the drug had been prominently featured in the media. The direction of any bias from a placebo effect is likely to favour a drug rather than usual care alone, hence we pre-specified a threshold for clinically meaningful benefit in our patient-reported recovery outcome. We did not consider that hospital admission, decided upon by independent clinicians according to clinical criteria, could be meaningfully influenced by the open-label design. Our findings for ivermectin are broadly in keeping with conclusions from three, large placebo-controlled trials.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p id="p0210">PCR testing as well as lateral flow testing was accepted as confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accepting positive lateral flow tests is, again, in keeping with pragmatic trial design and reflective of current clinical practice in many countries. Furthermore, lateral flow tests have been found to be an accurate alternative to PCR tests when used in symptomatic patients in primary care, with a positive predictive value of over 97% <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref>.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0215">The most recent Cochrane review on ivermectin for COVID-19 identified low certainty evidence that ivermectin treatment for outpatients does not reduce death or hospital admission over 28 days, and low certainty evidence of no improvement on symptom resolution up to 14 days. The results from our trial add to the certainty to findings on these outcomes and support the position that ivermectin should not be used to treat SARS-Cov-2 infection in the community in high-income countries with a largely vaccinated population. Furthermore, given our findings in an open label trial of no differences in hospital admission, a modest reduction in first-reported time to recovery, and no impact work or studies at three, six and 12 months, we consider that additional studies of ivermectin in this population should not be a priority for research.</p>
