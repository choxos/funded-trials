                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>South Asia is home to more than 300 million smokeless tobacco (ST) users. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan as signatories to the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) have developed policies aimed at curbing the use of tobacco. The objective of this study is to assess the compliance of ST point-of-sale (POS) vendors and the supply chain with the articles of the FCTC and specifically with national tobacco control laws. We also aim to assess disparities in compliance with tobacco control laws between ST and smoked tobacco products.</p>

                  <p>The study will be carried out at two sites each in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. We will conduct a sequential mixed-methods study with five components: (1) mapping of ST POS, (2) analyses of ST samples packaging, (3) observation, (4) survey interviews of POS and (5) in-depth interviews with wholesale dealers/suppliers/manufacturers of ST. We aim to conduct at least 300 POS survey interviews and observations, and 6–10 in-depth interviews in each of the three countries. Data collection will be done by trained data collectors. The main statistical analysis will report the frequencies and proportions of shops that comply with the FCTC and local tobacco control policies, and provide a 95% CI of these estimates. The qualitative in-depth interview data will be analysed using the framework approach. The findings will be connected, each component informing the focus and/or design of the next component.</p>

              <p>Smokeless tobacco (ST) refers to all tobacco products that are used without burning the product.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates that ST contains more than 30 carcinogens.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The use of ST is associated with an increased incidence of head, neck and gastrointestinal cancers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Additionally, ST use is associated with oral potentially malignant disorders<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and a variety of other oral and systemic diseases.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>An estimated 300 million people around the globe use ST products in some form, and the majority (≥85%) of these ST users live in South Asia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 9</xref> The use of ST products is particularly common in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, where it is considered an acceptable social norm.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This situation is further complicated by the presence of high amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines, the main cancer-causing agents in tobacco, in the products available in South Asia, compared with the rest of the world.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>The Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) is a global treaty that aims to enhance tobacco control measures and incorporate the provisions of the framework into their national tobacco control laws.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>Although the FCTC is aimed at curbing all types of tobacco use, the focus of tobacco control in most countries has been on controlling smoking, with control of the non-smoking forms of tobacco often neglected.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> The 2016 Global Progress Report on the implementation of FCTC highlighted gaps in the formulation and implementation of ST control policies in most parties to the FCTC.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are signatories to the FCTC and have made variable progress in implementing the articles of the framework by developing national tobacco control policies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>The tightening up of smoking regulations has been associated with a reported shift from smoking to ST use in some South Asian countries.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 17</xref> The increase in ST use can be attributed to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, cultural acceptance, perceived safety of ST products compared with smoking, harm reduction, low prices and lax or absent ST control laws.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>A 2018 report from the Global Knowledge Hub on Smokeless Tobacco indicated progress being made with regards to ST control policies and regulations in South Asia.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Many of these regulations and laws are aimed at demand reduction via various interventions at the tobacco points of sale (POS), for example, removal of tobacco products’ displays, and restrictions and bans on the advertisement of tobacco products at the POS.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> The success of these regulations and laws in curbing the tobacco epidemic in South Asia largely depends on the degree of compliance with the implementation of these laws and regulations.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> However, the evidence on the implementation of the ST control laws and regulations at the POS in the context of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is scarce. Most of the previous work carried out in these countries focused on tobacco advertisement and promotion at the POS and health warnings on ST packaging,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–26</xref> with little emphasis on the other provisions of the FCTC, such as sale to/by minors, price and taxation, and provision of viable alternatives. As such, there is a need for a comprehensive assessment of the compliance of POS in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh with the local ST control policies and the specific articles of the FCTC.</p>
              <p>This multicountry sequential mixed-methods study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of compliance of ST POS and products with the tobacco control laws in our three target countries. Furthermore, we aim to elicit information on any disparities between the implementation of FCTC/local laws for ST and smoking. We will also develop a country-specific inventory of tobacco products, to gain insight into the diversity of the products available in the local market, as well as identifying illicit products. Additionally, we will assess the barriers and facilitators to compliance of the ST wholesale dealers and suppliers with the different provisions of the FCTC/local laws.</p>

                <p>We will conduct a sequential mixed-methods study, incorporating quantitative work (geomapping of ST POS, in-house analyses of ST products, POS survey interviews and observations) and qualitative work (in-depth-interviews with supply chain actors, eg, wholesale dealers and suppliers). The findings from each component will be connected and used to inform the focus and/or the design of the next component, that is, mapping of the POS will allow us to build a sampling frame from which we will randomly choose survey interview respondents. The ST pack analyses will provide us an insight into manufacturing and sale practices that can be incorporated into the POS survey interview tool and the topic guide for in-depth interviews. The findings from the survey interviews and observations of the POS will guide the development of country-specific topic guides for the in-depth interviews.</p>

                <p>We will conduct this study in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. In each country, we have purposively selected two sites based on the use and diversity of the available ST products. In India, the study will be conducted in the North-East and North-West districts of Delhi. In Bangladesh, the study will be conducted in the districts of Dhaka and Rangpur. In Pakistan, the study will be conducted in the districts of Karachi and Peshawar. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the selected sites are the hubs of ST use and manufacture; for India, our rationale for choosing the sites was based on Delhi being a metropolitan city with a diverse population and products and also the logistics available to study team.</p>

                  <p>All brands of ST products available in the markets at the study sites will be procured. For a product to be eligible, it must contain tobacco. The collection of the ST products will be based on the brand names and not the generic product, for example, all brands of Gutkha available in the local market will be collected. Loose products that are not sold in packaging will be eligible, but only one generic sample of the product will be procured. The most commonly sold brand/make of cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and beedi, according to the selected vendor, will be procured.</p>

                  <p>All ST sale shops/vendors identified in the selected SSU by the geomapping exercise will be approached to procure the ST products that are available in the local markets. We will employ an adapted form of the unique packs sampling technique used for the “Tobacco Packs Surveillance System (TPackSS)” samples collection.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> One of every unique pack of ST (any pack with at least one difference in an exterior feature of the pack including size, brand name, presentation, colours, cellophane, packaging material (ie, hard or soft tin) and the inclusion of a promotional item) available in the store will be purchased. This sampling will begin at a randomly selected eligible vendor. After the purchase at the initial vendor, at each of the remaining eligible vendors, one of every ST pack that was not already purchased at a previous outlet will be purchased. If the selected vendor does not have any new packs (packs that were not purchased at another outlet), the sample collection team will move onto the next eligible vendor. The sample collection will continue until the team has approached the last eligible vendor. The sample collection team will ascertain the retail price of each procured pack from the vendor. They will also ascertain if the prices are inclusive of tax or not. The sample collection team will neither request nor accept a reduced price, in case the vendor offers a discount due to the large quantity being purchased, other than in those cases where discounted products are already being offered to all customers as a part of a promotion. All such general promotions, and individual ‘reduced price’ offers, will be recorded on a field notes sheet provided to each data collector.</p>

                  <title>Product analyses</title>
                  <p>All the procured samples will be sorted by product type, and each sample will be allotted a unique identification number marked on the Ziploc bag with indelible ink. The study team at each participating institution will analyse one sample at a time, carefully locking it back in the bag before moving onto the next sample. A physical inventory of all the products will be developed at each site and the data related to the products, for example, unique identification number, product family, purchase price and date of purchase, will be fed into a digital inventory form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 2</xref>) adapted from the TPackSS inventory data entry form.</p>
                  <p>The in-house assessment of the ST products will involve assessment and recording of their size, price, tax disclosure, ingredient lists, health warnings, manufacturer details, etc. Our study tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 3</xref>) has been adapted from the Tobacco Advertisement and Promotion Surveys (TAPS) standard tools. We will collect the samples by brand names and assess whether disparities exist between ST product categories and/or different manufacturers. We will also collect data on the country of manufacture and analyse if differences in compliance with the relevant laws can be explained by differences in the country of manufacture and/or ‘smuggled/illicit’ designation of the product. The definition of illicit products for each participating site will be developed after consulting local stakeholders. We will also analyse the collected cigarette packs, to assess their compliance with the local laws/FCTC. This will also help us in the identification of any disparity in the local laws for ST and those for cigarettes.</p>

                  <p>For the POS observation and interviews, we calculated sample sizes for the individual countries based on the prevalence of non-compliance with specific provisions of the local tobacco control laws in the three countries. The point estimates were derived from the published literature, that is, 20% of shops selling tobacco to minors in Pakistan,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> 19.4% POS non-compliant with Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) regulations regarding sizing of the advertisements in India<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and 20% POS non-compliant with tobacco advertisement and promotion laws in Bangladesh.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

After accounting for a 15% non-response (based on our ST supply chain study in Pakistan and Bangladesh),<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> the sample size was rounded up to 290 per country.

The tool consists of data fields on health warnings inside and outside the shop, product advertisement, promotions, display shelves, dummy packs, product placement, products sold as confectioneries and cross-promotion. We will also collect similar data for cigarettes and other smoking products, for comparison.</p>
                  <p>Our interview tool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 5</xref>) has been adapted from a survey instrument that has already been field-tested in the UK, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The tool will be translated into local languages at each study site. In addition to a series of close-ended questions on ST products regarding their supply, sale, popularity, prices, profits and taxes, the tool also includes similar questions for cigarettes, to allow for comparative analysis. We will collect data on mediating/moderating variables that could act as barriers/facilitators to the increased implementation of the FCTC/local laws. These variables are awareness of local tobacco control legislation, standards and obligations, awareness of adverse health effects of ST, the effect of health warnings on sales, market share of ST products, overall sales related to the availability of tobacco products for non-exclusive vendors, incentives by manufacturers/suppliers, profit margins, regular inspections, penalties for non-compliance and availability of viable alternatives.</p>

We will further expand these regression models to explore the association of compliance with multiple explanatory variables adjusting for the study design. Where possible, figures related to ST sales will be compared with those of cigarette sales, using similar approaches to the above. We will consider a p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed before the main analysis, which will include any a priori subgroup analyses and strategies for handling missing data. We will use STATA V.15 for analysis.</p>

Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of York ‘Health Sciences Research Governance Committee’. This work is being carried out by the ASTRA Global Health Research Group (Addressing Smokeless Tobacco use and building Research capacity in south Asia). Each participating South Asian institution in ASTRA has obtained ethical approvals from their institutional/national ethics bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 6</xref>). All potential participants will be provided with information regarding the project and written/verbal consent will be taken from each participant before recruitment. Consent forms will contain personal details, including name, date of birth and address.</p>
              <p>All information collected during the study will be kept strictly confidential. There will be restricted access and disposal arrangements for the participants’ details. Information will be held securely on paper/electronically at the University of York. The data (other than consent forms) transferred to or from the University of York will be coded with a study enrolment number and will not have participants’ identifiers. We have studied the conditions under which disclosures to law enforcement agencies are required and are satisfied that the chances of these occurring (criminal activities) are highly unlikely.</p>
              <p>To engage our academic audience and the research fraternity, we will publish the results of the study in peer-reviewed journals. We will also present our findings at an international public health conference and an international tobacco control conference. We will also publish an abstract of our findings on the websites of all the partner institutions. We will also present our work to regional research meetings. Additionally, we will incorporate the learning from this project into academic lectures for master’s students of public health. We have already established national stakeholder groups in all three target countries, who will guide the study conduct and help us in the dissemination of our findings.</p>
