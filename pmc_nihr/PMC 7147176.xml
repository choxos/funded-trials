                  <title>Background/Aims</title>
                  <p>Prospective data on switching anti-vascular endothelial growth factors in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) who have previously shown no/partial response are limited. This prospective study assessed the effect of switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab on anatomical and functional outcomes in patients with persistent/recurrent disease activity.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>SAFARI (NCT02161575) was a 6-month, prospective, single-arm study conducted in the UK and Germany. Patients, meeting strict eligibility criteria for one of two subgroups (primary treatment failure or suboptimal treatment response), received 3 monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg). Thereafter, ranibizumab was administered pro re nata at monthly visits. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CfB) to day 90 in central subfield retinal thickness (CSRT). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal morphology parameters were assessed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>One hundred patients were enrolled (primary treatment failure, 1; suboptimal treatment response, 99). In the overall population, there was a significant CfB in median CSRT of −30.75 µm (95% CI −59.50,–20.50; p&lt;0.0001) to day 90. Improvements were also observed in other quantitative and qualitative optical coherence tomography parameters. In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters assessed by category, 55% and 59% of patients gained 0–≥15 letters versus baseline at day 90 and day 180, respectively. However, mean improvements in BCVA (CfB) to each time point were small (≤2 letters). No new safety signals were identified.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab led to a significant improvement in CSRT, with ~60% experiencing stabilised/improved BCVA. Therefore, patients with nAMD who have shown a suboptimal response to aflibercept may benefit from switching to ranibizumab.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people aged ≥50 years in the UK and other European countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> In both the developed and developing world, the burden of this disease is projected to increase due to ageing populations and rising life expectancies, respectively.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> The wet or neovascular form of AMD (nAMD) accounts for most cases associated with severe visual impairment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Intravitreal (IVT) vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitors (anti-VEGFs), such as ranibizumab and aflibercept, are now the standard of care.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Ranibizumab has demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in visual acuity (VA) and quality of life for patients with nAMD.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Aflibercept was subsequently demonstrated to be clinically equivalent to ranibizumab with respect to improvement in VA at 52 weeks.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite anti-VEGF therapy, a minority of patients still experience rapid, progressive deterioration in clinical status, with no demonstration of an adequate clinical response (primary treatment failure). This group contains patients who will not respond to continued therapy with the same anti-VEGF, termed ‘non-responders’. A further subgroup experience persistent or recurrent disease activity following an initial response to therapy (suboptimal treatment response).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> While anti-VEGF resistance is a well-established phenomenon, its causes remain poorly understood.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> An occasionally accompanying mechanism is tachyphylaxis, describing a reduction in response to a drug, often occurring following repeat administration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>
</p>
              <p>In the clinical setting, if an inadequate or diminishing response is observed, increasing dosing frequency to monthly injections until visual and anatomical stability is achieved, or switching to an alternative anti-VEGF may be considered. However, limited prospective data exist on retinal morphology and other potential benefits and risks associated with switching between anti-VEGFs in nAMD. Data on switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab are particularly sparse, with the majority being derived from ‘switch-back’ studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>
</p>
              <p>This study determined whether switching treatment to ranibizumab reduces disease activity in patients with nAMD treated with aflibercept and in whom there was evidence of persistent or recurrent disease activity. Furthermore, this study evaluated retinal morphology to identify potential predictors of response to ranibizumab.</p>

                <p>The secondary efficacy variables are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>. BCVA was assessed with refraction on ETDRS charts. Colour fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence imaging were conducted at screening and at the EOS. SD-OCT was acquired at each visit, including at screening. Indocyanine green angiography was performed at screening only. All imaging data were independently reviewed by a central reading centre (CRC, GRADE Reading Centre, Bonn, Germany) to ensure standardised evaluation.</p>
                <p>The safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), ophthalmic examinations and vital signs. AEs were coded using MedDRA, V.20.1.</p>

A sensitivity analysis verified the use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test; a transformation of ln((−1*CSRT change)+100) was applied to transform the data to a normal distribution, and a paired t-test was carried out on the transformed data. Where CSRT data were missing for day 90, the analysis was performed using a last-observation-carried-forward approach.</p>

The case of TIA, which occurred on day 150 and was mild, was the only SAE considered to be related to the study drug treatment by the investigator. Concomitant medication/therapy was administered, and the event resolved on the same day. No patients had a TEAE leading to death.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The SAFARI study assessed the anatomical and visual outcomes of switching from aflibercept to ranibizumab following persistent or recurrent disease activity in patients with nAMD. The primary endpoint showed a statistically significant median CfB of −30.75 µm in CSRT to 3 months, following monthly IVT injections with ranibizumab. There was also evidence of improvement after switching in both quantitative and qualitative OCT parameters, and ETDRS letters assessed by category. While the changes observed were relatively small, the results demonstrated OCT stability following the switch to ranibizumab, with stabilised or improved BCVA for ~60% of this challenging-to-treat patient population. No new safety findings were identified.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p>Collectively, anti-VEGF switching studies have suggested clinical benefit following switching for poor responders with nAMD, typically reporting a small gain in ETDRS letters.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19</xref> However, these findings are largely derived from retrospective and uncontrolled studies with heterogeneous criteria for ‘poor responders’. The SAFARI study is the first prospective study to have examined the potential benefits and risks associated with anti-VEGF switching in patients with nAMD with a poor response to aflibercept treatment meeting strict criteria.</p>
              <p>The putative mechanisms underlying anti-VEGF resistance and considerations regarding classification of ‘responder status’ have been discussed elsewhere.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15 17</xref> There is no consensus on the classification of ‘non-responders’ or ‘poor responders’, and the defining criteria employed in the literature vary.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In this study, patients were eligible for inclusion in the suboptimal response group if they had worsened disease activity at screening (increasing retinal or subretinal fluid, or new or increasing in size PED in the study eye compared with prior visits).</p>
              <p>In this 6-month study, 59% of patients switching to ranibizumab following a suboptimal response with aflibercept experienced stabilised or improved BCVA to day 180, although this was counterbalanced by a large minority (38%) who lost ≥1 letter. The lack of a substantial improvement in mean VA requires further investigation, but it may be due, in part, to the relatively long duration of disease activity prior to the switch (mean±SD total duration of prior aflibercept treatment: 325.5 days±160 (min: 63; max: 933 days)), which could have resulted in some of the structural changes becoming permanent. Switching early on may be helpful in elucidating the most appropriate drug and regimen for individual patients to preserve vision in the long term. However, this study did not ultimately assess the impact of switching early, as only one patient was recruited to the primary treatment failure group, and further research on this is required.</p>
              <p>The largest improvements in clinical outcomes in the SAFARI study were observed during the initial monthly treatment period. This finding was anticipated given that these patients were experiencing persistent or recurrent disease activity with aflibercept before being switched to a monthly treatment regimen with ranibizumab. In the PRN phase, there was some evidence of the CSRT response diminishing; however, the difference between the median CfB at day 90 and day 180 was only 1.25 µm, which is likely to be of minimal clinical significance. While the clinical significance of this statistically significant reduction in CSRT to day 90 is unclear, it is supported by a trend towards improved BCVA. Regression analyses demonstrated that baseline parameters such as greater area of leakage and FCP thickness, and higher maximum PED diameter and BCVA, were associated with reduced or increased CSRT to day 90, respectively. The value of these parameters as potential predictors of response to ranibizumab merits further investigation.</p>
              <p>In addition to switching anti-VEGFs, the importance of regular dosing cannot be understated. The lack of a tightly controlled monthly treatment regimen is thought to account for the poor translatability of VA gains associated with clinical trials in the real-world setting.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> It is also possible for patients to experience similar clinical improvements to those achieved by switching anti-VEGF by simply reverting to fixed dosing with their current anti-VEGF treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In line with this, in patients with nAMD who required monthly treatment following a 2-year trial, no significant difference in clinical outcomes was reported between continuing on ranibizumab and switching to aflibercept.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This is also reflected in clinical practice, where if the treatment response achieved is inadequate or diminishes, the strategy is often to increase the dosing frequency of the current anti-VEGF to monthly injections. Thus, prior underdosing with the first anti-VEGF therapy, by transitioning from a ‘real life’ paradigm to a prospective study protocol, can be a confounding factor. However, a key strength of the SAFARI study was that patients had to meet strict inclusion criteria with respect to prior aflibercept treatment, including the number and timeframe of injections.</p>
              <p>At the time of study in the UK, licensed treatment with aflibercept in year 1 consisted of 3 monthly IVT injections followed by one injection every 2 months. The results of this study suggest that switching to ranibizumab for patients who do not achieve a dry retina while on aflibercept therapy may be beneficial. The use of a fixed monthly regimen rather than PRN, even after switching anti-VEGFs, or a treat and extend regimen, could also be considered. Further studies are warranted to evaluate longer term anti-VEGF switching outcomes.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>As only one patient was recruited to the primary treatment failure group, the findings of the SAFARI study largely represent patients who achieved a suboptimal treatment response with aflibercept; comparison across subgroups was not possible. Furthermore, it is difficult to discern if the effect of the switch was solely due to the drug or also the posology. Due to the relatively small number of patients included, the findings of the secondary efficacy and exploratory assessments should be interpreted with caution.</p>

                <title>Main conclusion</title>
                <p>The SAFARI study demonstrated that switching to ranibizumab following an inadequate response or loss of efficacy with aflibercept led to a significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint of CSRT with ~60% achieving stabilised or improved VA. No new safety signals were identified. Therefore, patients with nAMD who have shown a suboptimal response to aflibercept may benefit from switching to ranibizumab.</p>
