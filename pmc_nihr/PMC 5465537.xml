                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Influenza challenge trials are important for vaccine efficacy testing. Currently, disease severity is determined by self-reported scores to a list of symptoms which can be highly subjective. A more objective measure would allow for improved data analysis.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Twenty-one volunteers participated in an influenza challenge trial. We calculated the daily sum of scores (DSS) for a list of 16 influenza symptoms. Whole blood collected at baseline and 24, 48, 72 and 96Â h post challenge was profiled on Illumina HT12v4 microarrays. Changes in gene expression most strongly correlated with DSS were selected to train a Random Forest model and tested on two independent test sets consisting of 41 individuals profiled on a different microarray platform and 33 volunteers assayed by qRT-PCR.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>1456 probes are significantly associated with DSS at 1% false discovery rate. We selected 19 genes with the largest fold change to train a random forest model. We observed good concordance between predicted and actual scores in the first test set (rÂ =Â 0.57; RMSEÂ =Â â16.1%) with the greatest agreement achieved on samples collected approximately 72Â h post challenge. Therefore, we assayed samples collected at baseline and 72Â h post challenge in the second test set by qRT-PCR and observed good concordance (rÂ =Â 0.81; RMSEÂ =Â â36.1%).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We developed a 19-gene qRT-PCR panel to predict DSS, validated on two independent datasets. A transcriptomics based panel could provide a more objective measure of symptom scoring in future influenza challenge studies.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Seasonal influenza vaccination is widely used but has low effectiveness despite annual revaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. When the main circulating influenza strains have drifted away from those included in that seasonâs vaccine, effectiveness can be very low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines have become the preferred vaccine for use in children due to the ability to induce T cell responses to the influenza virus as well as humoral responses to the external glycoproteins, but recent findings of low vaccine effectiveness in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] have resulted in the recommendation to use inactivated vaccines only in the US this season. Seasonal influenza vaccines cannot provide protection against influenza pandemics caused by novel subtypes, and much research effort has been directed towards producing a âuniversalâ influenza A vaccine that will protect against any subtype of influenza A. This has resulted in a number of different approaches to vaccination against influenza which have entered early phase clinical development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Seasonal influenza vaccines are licensed based on their ability to induce a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre of 1:40, but for novel vaccines that are designed to act through alternative immune mechanisms it will be necessary to demonstrate efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease caused by influenza viruses, in humans.</p>
              <p>Influenza challenge trials provide one means of testing vaccine efficacy, and whilst they are not inexpensive to conduct, are considerably less costly than phase III clinical trials involving many tens of thousands of subjects, and may be conducted more rapidly to give a preliminary assessment of the protective efficacy of a novel vaccine against seasonal influenza viruses. However, conducting efficacy studies in a cohort of humans in a quarantine unit presents challenges in the collection of sufficient objective data points for analysis. Shedding of virus collected in nasal swabs or washes can only be measured once per day, up to 7Â days after influenza challenge. Temperature measurements are taken at least twice per day but fevers are rare in healthy young subjects after influenza virus challenge. The majority of the data that is collected to determine the severity of illness consists of self-reported symptom scores. Subjects record whether each of a list of possible influenza symptoms is absent, mild, moderate or severe in a twice daily questionnaire. Symptom scoring may be influenced by many factors such as the mood of the volunteer, the time elapsed since waking, or drinking, or the perception that the volunteer should be feeling better in the later part of the quarantine period.</p>
              <p>Earlier time course transcriptomics analysis of data from human influenza challenge trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have primarily focused on identifying genes and transcriptional dynamics that are different between clinically symptomatic from asymptomatic individuals at various time points post challenge. The definition for symptomatic and asymptomatic varies between studies but is typically based on total symptom score in the first few days and may include a secondary restriction on virus shedding status.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, no studies have attempted to predict the per individual symptom score using gene expression data using a minimal set of biomarkers. Such a panel would be a more objective measure of symptom scoring in future influenza challenge trials and thus improve comparability between challenge studies, especially those testing different candidate vaccines.</p>

Each patient was quarantined for 9Â days after challenge and reported twice daily on 16 signs and symptoms of influenza. Symptoms were recorded on a 0â3 scale and peak symptoms occurred at 72â96Â h post challenge (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1A, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Heatmap of summed symptom scores, live viral shedding assay, RT-PCR Influenza A and RT-PCR H1N1.

                <p>Volunteers self-reported their symptoms twice daily on a list of 16 conditions using the modified Jackson scoring on a scale of 0â3 per condition. We calculated the daily sum of scores (DSS) using only the morning report, which coincided very closely with phlebotomy time for samples taken for microarray, by summing up the scores over the 16 conditions. The DSS values ranged between 0 and 23. We identified 1456 probes significantly associated with DSS at FDR &lt;1%. To investigate the consistency of the panel of symptoms, we correlated changes in expression of all genes for each individual symptom to the changes in expression to DSS (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1B). The correlation was high and ranged from 0.72 to 0.96 and fever, fatigue and nasal congestion were the highest correlated symptoms.

                <title>DSS biomarker selection and validation</title>
                <p>In order to identify the most predictive genes for DSS, we selected a stringent cut off of 1% FDR and at least 15% unit increase in DSS per log2 unit increase in expression. This resulted in a list of 21 probes mapping to 19 candidate biomarkers (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3). Eleven of the 19 markers are associated to the GO category âresponse to virusâ (CCL8, HERC5, IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG15, OAS3, OASL, RSAD2, CXCL10, IFI44 and IFI44L), 5 of the remaining 8 are associated to the GO category âinnate immune systemâ (CCL2, IFI27, IFI6, SERPING1 and USP18) and LAMP3 is associated to the GO category âadaptive immune responseâ. Also, 14 of the 19 genes were previously included in a panviral gene signature predicting viral shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The gene with the highest predictive importance, CCL2, was ranked as the most predictive gene for laboratory confirmed influenza in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and in the same study OTOF and SPATS2L have been among the 100 most upregulated genes.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Volcano plot showing all 21 probes (19 genes) associated to significant changes in DSS.

                <p>We next sought to test the predictive performance of this signature using an independent dataset. First we trained a random forest model using expression levels of the 19 genes in our dataset and predicted DSS in the first independent dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite differences in microarray platforms, challenge virus strains and list of reported symptoms, we observed a reduction of 15.7% in root mean squared error (RMSE) using predicted DSS compared to a best guess prediction assuming overall mean DSS. Predicted values correlated positively and significant with observed DSS (rÂ =Â 0.57; pÂ &lt;Â 7eâ57) and prediction accuracies were consistently high between day 1.5 until day 4.5 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption><p>Intensities from Illumina ht-12 arrays of the 19 gene signature were used to train a random forest model.

                <p>To further elucidate which time point in the discovery cohort is most predictive, we partitioned the expression of both, training and test data, into the individual time points and predicted DSS across all partitions (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S4). The most increase in accuracy was clearly observed, when training on samples from day 2 to day 4 and predicting on testing samples from day 1.5 to day 4.2 with an average decrease of 16% in RMSE (range â4 to â30%).</p>

</p>
                <p>To evaluate whether the set of 19 genes can be further reduced to an even smaller set of biomarkers, we applied the feature selection method VSURV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This method eliminates redundant and less informative features recursively using a set of three rules with increasing stringency. After the third selection step only two genes, ISG15 and CXCL10, were left. Intriguingly, the RMSE reduction was still substantial with 26% and correlation between predicted and observed scores was strong and significant (rÂ =Â 0.73, pÂ &lt;Â 7eâ11; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S6A).</p>
                <p>Conversely, we tried to improve the model fit by adding more features. Since viral shedding and reported symptom scores are highly correlated, we added an additional set of ten genes highly correlated with the live viral shedding assay to our set of 19 biomarkers and trained a random forest model. Predictive performance did not improve significantly but remained high, comparable to the original signature (RMSEÂ =Â â34.9%, rÂ =Â 0.8, pÂ &lt;Â 2eâ14; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S7).</p>
                <p>To test whether our signature can be used to accurately predict categorized symptom scores and to compare prediction performance to previous studies, we categorized patients into symptomatic and asymptomatic depending on presence of any DSS at each time point. Prediction accuracy was very high (AUC 0.95; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Figure S8) and 3/13 symptomatic samples were misclassified as asymptomatic and conversely 1/47 asymptomatic was misclassified as symptomatic.</p>
                <p>We also tested the reduced signature of the two genes ISG15 and CXCL10 using the linear regression method Partial Least Squares to define easier to interpret decision boundaries (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Figure S6B).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study was designed to develop a precise, objective and cost effective small scale assay to act as a surrogate for symptom scoring in influenza challenge trials. We challenged 21 volunteers with wild-type A/California/2009 H1N1 virus and 15 out of 21 volunteers or 71% reported at least one mild symptom. This is consistent with the previously reported proportion of H1N1 infected volunteers who develop clinical illness after experimental influenza virus infection of 69% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We generated a whole transcriptome dataset on all 21 volunteers and correlated the longitudinal transcriptomics data with the self-reported symptoms. The most significant differentially expressed genes to DSS were then used to establish a qRT-PCR based Fludigm assay using commercially available primers.</p>
              <p>In contrast to previous studies which try to distinguish symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we established a set of biomarkers optimised to detect and differentiate between different levels of symptoms. We showed that the continuous range of predicted symptom scores can be optionally categorized. Importantly, no baseline sample was misclassified when samples were categorized into symptomatic and asymptomatic in our qRT-PCR training and test sets. This suggests that the misclassified samples collected at 72Â h post challenge might suffer from the subjective nature of self-symptom reporting rather than inaccurate prediction.</p>
              <p>The 19 biomarker panel was identified using whole blood samples from H1N1 infected adult volunteers which raises the question of generalizability to other influenza strains and cohorts. Zaas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] developed a 48-gene marker panel to classify H1N1 and H3N2 infected patients as either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Apart from 5 genes (CCL8, CD36, CXCL10, USP18 and SPATS2L), all 14 genes of the 19 gene signature were also found in their panel indicating the potential use of our panel across different strains. Similarly, 12 of our genes also appear in a published signature to detect respiratory infections such as RSV and rhinovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Herberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compared whole blood samples from 19 children hospitalized due to H1N1 infection (age 1.6â7.5Â years) with 33 control children. Interestingly, 12 genes in their top 15 were also present in our panel. These overlaps strongly suggest that our panel can also be used to predict symptom scores across different influenza strains and age groups as well as for binary classification of volunteers into asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals.</p>
              <p>There is also evidence that our set of biomarkers could have potential cross species application once the primers have been adopted for species differences. For example, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] identified ISG15, our most influential predictor, as highly up-regulated in the lung samples from H1N1 infected swine using microarrays and qRT-PCR validation. Another highly influential gene from our panel CXCL10 was shown to be consistently upregulated in H1N1 infected mice, macaques and in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we observed a significant further 18% reduction in RMSE, when we predicted scores based on qRT-PCR trained data compared to microarray data. One reason might be the well-known underestimation of expression changes measured by microarrays compared to qRT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] which we also clearly observed in our screen (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S5) or the higher sensitivity of qRT-PCR. However, we cannot directly compare both results due to the different cohorts which were used for testing.</p>
              <p>Although a 34% reduction in prediction error compared to the mean we observed for our qRT-PCR based assay is a good result, we observed four samples with discordant prediction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The inaccuracies observed, seem to be more pronounced when recorded DSS were low in the range of one to three. This result is not surprising, since minor symptoms are expected to be more subjective compared to strong or multiple symptoms.</p>
              <p>Selecting a very stringent threshold at the microarray level was a design choice deliberately made at a very early stage of the study for two reasons. At first, we aimed at a cost effective and small set of PCR primers. Secondly, we sought to restrict the primers to genes which were highly and significantly correlated to our phenotype after adjusting for differences in variables such as age, gender and batch. Alternatively, the choice of the genes included in the final signature can be left to a feature selection method or a regression algorithm penalizing and removing less informative features. This however potentially leads to removal of biologically relevant genes and to overfitting to the training data at hand. When we applied a feature selection method to our dataset, we found good predictive ability with even two genes (ISG15 and CXCL10). This would enable a very cost effective approach to symptom scoring. However it requires further testing using a larger cohort, if such a small set of predictors can be a robust marker for symptom scoring.</p>

All primers described here to test expression levels of these genes are commercially available and can be readily used to replace or refine self-symptom reporting in influenza challenge trials. Therefore, these markers can in future challenge studies and possibly refine the panel once tested on larger cohorts.</p>
