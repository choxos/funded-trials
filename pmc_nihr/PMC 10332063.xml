                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is prescribed to almost half of all men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although ADT is effective treatment, with virtually all men with advanced disease showing initial clinical response, it is associated with troublesome side effects including hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). HFNS can be both frequent and severe and can have a significant impact on quality of life (QoL). They can occasionally be so debilitating that patients stop ADT altogether, despite the increased risk of disease relapse or death. Previous research has found that guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing HFNS due to ADT when delivered by a clinical psychologist. MANCAN2 aims test whether we can train the existing NHS Prostate Cancer Nurse Specialist (CNS) team to deliver guided self-help CBT and whether it is effective in reducing the impact of HFNS in men undergoing ADT.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">MANCAN2 is a phase III multicentre randomised controlled trial and process evaluation. Between 144 and 196 men with prostate cancer who are currently receiving ADT and are experiencing problematic HFNS will be individually randomised in a 1:1 ratio in groups of 6–8 participants to either treatment as usual (TAU) or participation in the guided self-help CBT intervention plus TAU. A process evaluation using the normalisation process theory (NPT) framework will be conducted, to understand the CNS team’s experiences of delivering the intervention and to establish the key influencers to its implementation as a routine practice service. Fidelity of implementation of the intervention will be conducted by expert assessment. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention and participant adherence to the trial intervention will also be assessed.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">MANCAN2 will advance the program of work already conducted in development of management strategies for HFNS. This research will determine whether the severity of ADT-induced HFNS in men with prostate cancer can be reduced by a guided self-help CBT intervention, delivered by the existing NHS prostate cancer CNS team, within a multicentre study. The emphasis on this existing team, if successful, should facilitate translation through to implementation in routine practice.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in UK men, with a rising incidence now reaching around 52,000 per year (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer">https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/prostate-cancer</ext-link>). Survival rates are improving with 85% now living at least 5 years from diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is therefore critical to address the impact of cancer treatment on the increasing numbers who will live with, and beyond, a prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is prescribed to almost half of all men that have been diagnosed with prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ADT is a hormonal treatment used to inhibit prostate cancer through the reduction of systemic levels of male androgenic hormones, including testosterone. ADT is used in two main contexts: firstly to reduce relapse rates after a course of radical (curative) radiotherapy when it is typically given as an adjuvant treatment for around 2 years and secondly as palliative life-extending treatment for advanced metastatic disease when it is typically used permanently until the end of life and where the median duration of therapy is 4–6 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the UK, ADT is usually administered by a community-based nurse, and through monthly, 3-monthly, or 6-monthly injections of an LHRH analogue. A minority of patients receive LHRH antagonists or undergo surgical castration, as alternative approaches.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Although ADT is an effective treatment, with virtually all men with advanced disease showing an initial clinical response, it is associated with troublesome side effects. Up to 80% of men undergoing ADT suffer from HFNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Even if discontinued, nearly half of patients experience HFNS for up to 5 years following ADT. HFNS can be both frequent and severe and lead to a significant decrease in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They may also cause anxiety, low mood and sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HFNS can occasionally be so severe and debilitating that patients become prepared to stop ADT altogether despite the increased risk of disease relapse (for adjuvant treatment) or reduced survival (for palliative treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Current UK practice for management of ADT induced HFNS is rather inconsistent, reflecting the lack of positive and methodologically sound data on which to make recommendations.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Currently, there are few validated safe and effective treatments for men with HFNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">A recent systematic review to determine best practice for managing ADT induced HFNS identified fifteen studies. Eight were of pharmacologic interventions and the remainder for complementary and alternative medicine. It concluded that evidence is insufficient to support even the limited current intervention options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Steroidal progestins (e.g. medroxyprogesterone, cyproterone) showed some benefit at reducing HFNS but were associated with side-effects that were not well tolerated including nausea, weight gain, muscle spasms, depression, insomnia and headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Anticonvulsants (gabapentin) and an alpha-agonist antihypertensive (clonidine) did not appear to improve HFNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Acupuncture demonstrated potential benefit in reducing HFNS and did so without side effects. This was, however, based on data from a handful of small studies limiting interpretation. Acupuncture is not currently routinely available within the NHS for this indication further limiting the practical utility for most patients.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Cognitive behavioural therapy has been found effective in the management of HFNS. Our previous study (MENOS4) in women with breast cancer demonstrated that breast cancer nurse delivered group CBT was both an effective and safe intervention for reducing HFNS symptoms. This multicentre RCT of 130 patients compared group CBT to TAU. The study showed a 46% (6.9–3.7) reduction in the primary endpoint of mean HFNS problem rating score at 26 weeks post randomisation in the CBT arm compared to a 15% (6.5–5.5) reduction in the TAU arm (adjusted mean difference − 1.96, 95% CI − 3.68 to − 0.23, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There were also improvements in secondary outcomes including HFNS frequency, sleep quality, anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Breast cancer nurses from 6 NHS centres were trained to deliver the manualised CBT intervention, delivered in weekly group CBT sessions of 90 min for 6 weeks. Rating for manual adherence, by an independent psychologist from session recordings, showed that a high degree of fidelity was maintained.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We have also adapted our approach to CBT intervention for men undergoing prostate cancer hormonal therapy. MANCAN was a single centre RCT of 68 patients which compared guided self-help CBT to TAU which showed that self-help CBT, delivered by a clinical psychologist, significantly reduced the impact of HFNS at 6 weeks post-randomisation (primary endpoint, adjusted mean difference: − 1.33, 95% CI − 2.07 to − 0.58; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A trend to improvement was maintained at 32 weeks (a secondary endpoint) although at this later time point group differences did not retain statistical significance. There were also significant reductions in negative HFNS beliefs and behaviours, but not in mood or quality of life. A qualitative study with men who participated in the intervention found that the self-help format was acceptable and that the intervention helped them to undertake positive lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We have also developed and validated the HFNS Beliefs and Behaviour Scale for Men assessing men’s beliefs and behaviours in relation to their HFNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">MANCAN2 will advance this program of work by determining whether ADT-induced HFNS in men with prostate cancer can be impacted by a guided self-help CBT intervention (delivered virtually, face to face or hybrid). Critically, this will be undertaken by the existing prostate cancer CNS team within a multicentre study. The emphasis on this existing team, compared to a requirement for clinical psychology involvement, if successful, should facilitate translation through to implementation in routine practice.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par27">The primary objective is to determine whether the addition to treatment as usual (TAU) of virtual self-help CBT, delivered by a patient’s existing prostate cancer CNS team, reduces the impact of HFNS at 6 months post-randomisation in men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. Secondary objectives will determine the effect of the intervention on the severity of HFNS at 6 weeks post-randomisation and, additionally, the effect of the intervention on HFNS frequency; HFNS beliefs and behaviours and QoL. Other symptoms including anxiety, depression, mood and sleep and men’s compliance with ADT will be examined.</p>
                <p id="Par28">A process evaluation will run parallel to the RCT. The purpose of the process evaluation is to explore the possible barriers and facilitators to implementing the intervention into routine practice, the prostate cancer CNS team’s experiences of introducing the intervention as a new treatment and participant acceptability of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par29">The health economics of the intervention, the fidelity of the intervention delivery by the CNS team and the participant adherence to the trial intervention will be examined also.</p>

TAU will be defined as care consistent with NICE guideline NG131, Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng131">https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng131</ext-link>). This includes access to a specialist prostate cancer urologist or oncologist and a named prostate cancer CNS team member, as well as locally and nationally available cancer information. It also allows for options for pharmacotherapy for HFNS which may include, but are not restricted to, those recommended in NG131. At the end of the study, all participants that are randomised into the TAU alone arm will be offered a copy of the CBT Booklet and CD/Audio files (demonstrating the breathing and relaxation exercises).</p>

                  <p id="Par32">The MANCAN2 intervention consists of a 4-week self-help CBT intervention with virtual, face-to-face or hybrid (a mix of virtual and face-to-face delivery) pre- and post-intervention workshops (in groups of 6 to 8 men) delivered by the prostate cancer CNS team in addition to TAU. The intervention for this trial was developed and written by the trial management group (TMG): professor Myra Hunter and Dr. Evgenia Stefanopoulou, with contributions from professor Simon Crabb and Mr. Roger Bacon. The intervention content comprises an instructional booklet (electronic and paper copies available) and guided paced breathing and relaxation exercises audio (downloadable MP3/and CD). The approach is psycho-educational with individual treatment goals and an active focus upon cognitive and behavioural changes.

The CNS will provide a brief overview of the workshop content. Where CNS teams are unable to offer the 1-to-1 telephone call, or where participants do not respond to the 1-to-1 telephone call, the site research team will send a motivational (missed workshop 1) or maintenance (missed workshop 2) text message to the participant.</p>

                  <p id="Par41">In parallel to the RCT, a theory-informed process evaluation will be conducted to evaluate the implementation of the MANCAN2 trial and the possibility of embedding the service as part of routine care thereafter. NPT is a middle-range sociological theory that conceptualises the implementation and integration of innovation in healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews have supported the use of NPT to explain implementation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], supporting the use of NPT as an appropriate conceptual framework.</p>

Up to two staff delivering the intervention at each site will be invited to take part in the interview and questionnaire. The semi-structured interviews will be informed by the four NPT constructs and will include questions to help understand site team attitudes, dynamics, perception of the intervention and influencers that help or hinder its implementation into current work.</p>

                  <p id="Par50">We regard a ≥ 1.5 point difference in HFNS problem rating as clinically relevant; based on similar interventions, this effect size is also considered realistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To detect a ≥ 1.5 point difference in mean HFNS problem rating between CBT + TAU versus TAU alone at 6 months post-randomisation, with a standard deviation of 2.21 (32), 90% power and 5% type 1 error rate, requires a sample size of 94. The sample must also account for clustering introduced by the intervention (those attending the same CBT workshop may have more similar outcomes than those outside the group). Assuming 8 participants per group in the intervention, and intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.01, requires 111 participants. An ICC of 0.01 is thought appropriate given the intervention is largely self-management and smaller ICCs have been observed in similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The sample size increases to 150 (75/arm) allowing for 26% loss to follow-up (as per MENOS4). To recruit 150 patients, a minimum of 6 participating NHS sites were to be involved with flexibility to increase up to 9 sites. Each site was planned to potentially run four groups (2 per randomised arm) consisting of 6 to 8 men, ensuring that a comprehensive process evaluation can be conducted. Across 6 sites this leads to between 144 and 196 participants.</p>

                  <p id="Par56">Participants are individually randomised (1:1), within groups, to receive TAU plus a guided self-help cognitive behavioural intervention (CBT) or TAU alone. Patients will be randomised by a trial statistician at Southampton Clinical Trials Unit using a pre-generated permuted block method which is stratified by cohort and treatment (curative or palliative). Treatment allocation is unblinded. Sites are informed of the randomisation results via email within 1 day of randomisation, who then contact the patients to discuss study procedures.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">Men randomised to the TAU plus guided self-help CBT arm receive a 4-week self-help treatment schedule. The intervention content comprises an instructional self-help booklet (electronic and paper copies available) including information and exercises addressing stress management, paced breathing cognitive and behavioural strategies to improve wellbeing, managing their hot flushes, night sweats and sleep, and a downloadable MP3 audio (and a CD) demonstrating breathing and relaxation exercises. Additionally, participants are invited to participate in two group workshops that are delivered by trained members of the existing prostate CNS team. Sites can deliver workshops in a face-to-face group setting, virtually, or a hybrid approach. The choice of workshop delivery method is at the local CNS team discretion. Workshop 1 takes place during week 1 of the intervention (day 0) and offers practical help on how to use the self-help CBT guide (booklet) appropriately and provide participants with an opportunity to meet other men experiencing similar symptoms. Workshop 2 takes place during week 4 of the intervention with focus on practical tips and strategies to help participants maintain their practice in the future.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Day 0 is defined as the date of workshop 1 for all randomised participants in that cohort. Follow-up questionnaires are posted, from SCTU, to all participants for completion at 6 weeks and 6 months. Where questionnaires have not been returned within 10 days, participants are contacted by telephone and primary outcome data may be collected by telephone. A 1:1 randomised study within a trial (SWAT) is included to explore whether a theory-based cover letter improves the 6-month paper questionnaire return rate. Men randomised to the intervention arm complete a patient evaluation questionnaire following workshop 2.</p>

Secondary outcomes including the frequency of HFNS, the HFNS Beliefs and Behaviour Scale, summary scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30, GAD7, PHQ9, WSAS and PSQI questionnaires at 6 weeks and 6 months post-randomisation will be analysed similarly, accounting for stratification factors and clustering.</p>

                  <p id="Par65">The economic analysis will take an NHS perspective to estimate both cost effectiveness (£ per change in HFRS) and cost utility (Incremental £/QALY) as well as a budget impact. QALYs will be estimated from EORTC using the SCHARR algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]).</p>
                  <p id="Par66">Costs will include that of the intervention and on any changes in use of NHS services. As the intervention cost might differ between that in the trial and in routine practice, we will take two approaches, one detailing changes in CNS team total time allocations in each arm during the trial and another collecting data on views of both the CNS team and managers on the extent to which the intervention could be incorporated into standard practice (and under what circumstances such as being included in training and in guidelines). While both these costs will be reported, the latter would be more relevant in estimating budget impact if implemented in routine practice. The cost of changes in service use will be based on a customised resource use patient questionnaire at 6 weeks and 6 months.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">Estimates of both cost and QALY increments will be estimated for each patient and incorporated into the planned statistical analyses described above. If a clinically relevant gain in the primary outcome is found to be statistically significant, more detailed economic modelling will be carried out, to explore uncertainty and to extend the time frame beyond that of the trial. This will build on the recent cost effectiveness modelling for similar interventions for hot flushes in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par68">All relevant resource items identified will be costed using published national cost data (British National Formulary and Personal Social Services Research Unit, and NHS reference cost). Accumulated costs and QALYs per patient will be estimated by means of area under the curve. Where appropriate, we will estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We will estimate mean values and 95% percentiles using nonparametric bootstrapping. We will produce cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) to illustrate the uncertainty of such estimates. Major assumptions made in the costing and QALYs will be tested by means of sensitivity analyses.</p>

This will be done to test the robustness of the NPT constructs against emergent themes and to facilitate a clear and thorough data-driven analysis. Analysis will be an iterative process between coding, emergent themes and NPT mapping and will involve interrogating the data for disconfirming evidence that does not fit inside the NPT framework, increasing the rigour and validity of the analysis process. Members of the research team will hold coding and analysis meetings to discuss coding strategy, proposed themes and NPT mapping and subsequently tested in the data.

                <p id="Par79">At the end of the study, once the analysis has taken place and results become available, a summary of research findings will be sent to all participants who request to receive these (there is an item on the ICF where participants can consent to receive the trial results). Results will be disseminated through the scientific community by peer-reviewed publications and conference presentation. We will keep the patient community up to date and involved throughout the entire process through the Prostate Cancer Support Organisation (PCaSO) and other patient support groups and social media.</p>
                <p id="Par80">The TMG will form the basis of the Writing Committee and advise on the nature of publications. All publications shall include a list of investigators, and if there are named authors, these should include the chief investigator, co-investigators, trial management team, and statistician(s) involved in the trial. Named authors will be agreed by the CI and director of SCTU. If there are no named authors, then a ‘writing committee’ will be identified.</p>
