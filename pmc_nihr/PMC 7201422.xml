                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Combination antiretroviral therapy results in metabolic abnormalities which increase cardiovascular disease risk. We evaluated whether telmisartan reduces insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–positive individuals on antiretrovirals.</p>

                <sec id="s0101">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label, dose-ranging controlled trial of telmisartan. Participants with HIV infection receiving combination antiretroviral therapy were randomized equally to either no intervention (control) or 20, 40, or 80 mg telmisartan once daily. The adaptive design allowed testing of all dose(s) of telmisartan in stage I, with the promising dose(s) being taken into stage II. The primary outcome measure was reduction in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 24 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 377 patients were recruited. In stage I, 48, 49, 47, and 45 patients were randomized to control and 20, 40, and 80 mg telmisartan, respectively (total n = 189). At the interim analysis, 80 mg telmisartan was taken forward into stage II. At the end of stage II (n = 105, control; 106, 80-mg arm), there were no differences in HOMA-IR (estimated effect, 0.007; SE, 0.106) at 24 weeks between the telmisartan (80 mg) and nonintervention arms. Longitudinal analysis over 48 weeks showed no change in HOMA-IR, lipid or adipokine levels. There were significant (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .05), but marginal, improvements in revised Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) (0.004) and plasma hs-CRP (−0.222 mg/L) and reduction in liver fat content (1.714 mean reduction; <italic>P</italic> = .005).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>No significant effect of telmisartan was demonstrated on the primary outcome (HOMA-IR), but there were marginal improvements with some secondary outcome measures. Further studies in this population are warranted to identify novel strategies for preventing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</p>

            <p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) increases the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), predisposing factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–positive individuals [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 65 studies (n = 55 094) found the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in HIV-infected individuals to be between 16.7% and 18% [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The HIV D:A:D (Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs) cohort (n = 33 347) [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has shown that the prevalence of MS increases from 19.4% to 41.6% over a 6-year period, with a 4-fold increase in the incidence of T2D and a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of CVD [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The increase in CVD risk is seen with both individual antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, including protease inhibitors (PIs) [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and ARV drug combinations [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
            <p>Insulin resistance is central to the development of cardiometabolic disease [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In vitro studies [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and single-drug studies in healthy individuals [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and HIV-positive patients [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have shown that both PIs and NRTIs cause insulin resistance. The prevalence of insulin resistance in HIV is ~21% [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and is seen even with some of the newer ARV drugs [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The change in insulin resistance, assessed using the validated surrogate marker, the HOMA-IR, has been shown to occur within 4 weeks of starting therapy [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Clinical intervention to arrest or reverse cART-associated insulin resistance may be a strategy to reduce the incidence of T2D and CVD in HIV-positive individuals. To this end, insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones and metformin have been trialed. However, the results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in HIV-positive individuals have been mixed [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and there are concerns about the safety profiles of these agents [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
            <p>Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), reduces insulin resistance in non-HIV patients with T2D or MS [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (120 000 patient-years of follow-up), it also reduced cardiovascular events in a broad group of at-risk patients and conferred cardiovascular protection similar to ramipril but was better tolerated [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 33 RCTs where telmisartan was compared against other antihypertensive drugs found telmisartan to significantly reduce insulin resistance [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, this was not a universal finding with some trials of telmisartan showing a reduction in insulin resistance [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
            <p>Adipose tissue, a major mediator of glucose and lipid homeostasis, accumulates ARVs [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and others [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have shown that telmisartan partially reversed ARV-induced adipocyte toxicity in vitro. This was hypothesized to be due to telmisartan acting as a partial agonist at the adipocyte nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ) [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A pilot study in 35 HIV-positive individuals showed that telmisartan led to a small but significant loss in adipose tissue after 24 weeks [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, RCT evidence to show telmisartan has a beneficial effect on insulin resistance in HIV-positive individuals is lacking. In order to fill this evidence gap, we conducted a novel, adaptive-design, phase 2 RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in reducing insulin resistance in cART-treated patients with HIV, as well as identifying the optimal telmisartan dose.</p>

                <p>The adaptive design consisted of 2 stages. Briefly, eligible patients were randomized equally to either no intervention (control, arm A) or 20 mg (arm B), 40 mg (arm C), or 80 mg (arm D) of telmisartan once daily in stage I. This was followed by an interim analysis when half of the planned maximum number of patients had been followed up for at least 24 weeks. Based on the results of interim analysis, there were 3 different possibilities for stage II: (1) if 1 active-dose group was substantially more effective than the control, then the study would have been immediately stopped and the corresponding dose would be taken directly into phase 3; (2) if any active-dose groups showed insufficient promise at the interim analysis, they would be dropped and the study continued with the remaining doses and control for a further 24 weeks; or (3) if no dose showed sufficient promise at the interim analysis, the study would be stopped altogether. The duration of study treatment was a maximum of 48 weeks and follow-up visits were at 12, 24, and 48 weeks.</p>

Briefly, we evaluated 3 different doses of telmisartan against the control in stage I of the study and conducted an interim analysis that allowed ineffective doses to be eliminated quickly while a dose showing a reduction in HOMA-IR was taken forward. At the interim analysis, the sample standard deviation pooled across all 4 arms was determined and used to construct test statistics expressing the advantage of each of the 3 active treatments over control. The critical values for recommending that a treatment was taken to further testing at the interim and final analyses (−2.782 and −2.086, respectively) were chosen based on a method described by Magirr and Whitehead [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], generalizing the approach of Whitehead and Jaki [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

A: Patient moved to London—no forwarding address so unable to transfer patient; does not wish to continue the study due to organizational reasons; advice from study team following MRI incidental finding; to enter another clinical trial; eGFR less than 60 at screening; on nevirapine. B1: Concerned about leg swelling (not seen as an AE, saw GP, decided to stop drug). B2: Medication ran out 2 days before final visit; appointment missed—participant thought he should stop treatment before reschedule as canceled date 48 week; patient lost pills and failed to tell the research team until week 48 visit. C1: Patient has left the country; patient preference. C2: patients ran out of medication. D1: Patient developed a cough, wanted to discontinue study medication; Taking rampiril (GP’s orders); switch in ARV drug; not able to commit to study; eGFR low at baseline, did not meet eligibility criteria; did not return for appointment, did not respond to contacts; decided to become pregnant. D2: Patient ran out of medications and was due for his week 48 visit only a few days later; low eGFR; patient ran out of medication—new stock not collected; forgot to take them when on holiday abroad; ran out of medication; did not have enough telmisartan—could not come to pick up extra medication; patient usually takes telmisartan at nighttime—so did not take today before visit. <sup>a</sup>One patient was randomized in arm B. The usual nurse is on extended leave and before leaving had asked for a number of patients to be randomized in her absence. Unfortunately, the cover nurse incorrectly assumed that she just randomize the patient immediately.

              <p>In stage I, 48, 49, 47, and 45 patients were randomized to arms A, B, C, and D, respectively (total n = 189); however, only the 154 patients who had a complete set of baseline and 24-week HOMA-IR data were included in the interim analysis. The t-statistic for arms B and C showed a positive value (ie, higher than 0), suggesting that there was no reduction in the HOMA-IR over control (arm A). These active-dose arms were thus dropped from stage II. As some improvement over control was detected for arm D (ie, the t-statistic was between 0 and −2.782), this arm was progressed to stage II of the trial and the patients were thereafter randomized between arm D (telmisartan, 80 mg) and arm A (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) (details of summary statistics are given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary data</xref>).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RCT to assess the effect of telmisartan on insulin resistance in HIV-infected individuals. We show that telmisartan (80 mg) did not reduce HOMA-IR, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance (primary outcome measure) over 24 weeks when compared with the control arm. Telmisartan also did not improve the insulin sensitivity indices QUICKI and revised QUICKI over 24 weeks. Longitudinal outcome analysis over 48 weeks also did not show any improvement in HOMA-IR and QUICKI, but there was a significant, but marginal, improvement in revised QUICKI (<italic>P</italic> = .05), serum hs-CRP, and urinary ACR (<italic>P</italic> = .04) in patients with microalbuminuria (ACR &gt;3 mg/mmol). Telmisartan also significantly reduced liver fat over a period of 24 weeks but had no effect on total body or limb fat.</p>
              <p>Only 3 studies evaluating telmisartan have been reported in patients with HIV. Two observational studies showed a reduction in insulin resistance with telmisartan [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in a limited number of patients (n = 18 and 13, respectively); the third was a single-arm open-label trial in 35 HIV-positive individuals [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which failed to find a significant change in HOMA-IR at 24 weeks. In non–HIV-positive individuals, there have been a greater number of telmisartan studies. A meta-analysis comprising 2033 patients found telmisartan significantly reduced insulin resistance compared with other antihypertensives [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some of these RCTs were conducted in patients with preexisting T2D or MS and were therefore naturally enriched with individuals who were highly insulin resistant at baseline [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, some trials have shown no beneficial effect of telmisartan even when the baseline HOMA-IR was high [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our trial had a median baseline HOMA-IR of 1.6 in the 80-mg telmisartan arm. A post hoc analysis of arm A versus arm D at 24 or 48 weeks showed that a higher baseline HOMA-IR did not lead to a greater decline with telmisartan. It should be noted that there is no universal threshold for defining insulin resistance and HOMA-IR varies between different ethnicities [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but a threshold of HOMA-IR greater than 2.8 has been used to signify high insulin resistance. Approximately 25% of individuals in each arm of our trial had a HOMA-IR greater than 2.8; again, a stratified analysis in this group failed to show any reduction in HOMA-IR in the telmisartan arm in comparison to the control arm, but the sample size was small (arm A, n = 22; arm D, n = 14).</p>
              <p>Although telmisartan did not result in a statistically significant reduction in HOMA-IR, it did result in a marginal beneficial effect on the revised QUICKI (<italic>P</italic> = .05), a surrogate index of insulin sensitivity that has recently been shown to be a better marker than HOMA-IR [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The revised QUICKI takes into account fasting serum nonesterified fatty acid levels, in addition to plasma glucose and serum insulin, and has better discriminatory power, particularly in nonobese individuals who present with mild insulin resistance [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given that the TAILoR cohort had a median baseline BMI of 26.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the revised QUICKI may have been a more sensitive indicator to measure the effect of telmisartan than HOMA-IR.</p>
              <p>Telmisartan did not reduce visceral fat, consistent with a previous study in HIV-positive individuals [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but did reduce liver fat in the 80-mg arm over a period of 24 weeks. However, given the small numbers, the findings have to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, intrahepatic fat has been suggested to be a better marker of metabolic disease than visceral fat [<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and may provide a better estimate of ectopic fatty acid deposition, which is one of the main reasons for the development of insulin resistance.</p>
              <p>Telmisartan reduced hs-CRP, consistent with data from non-HIV clinical studies [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and meta-analysis [<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This anti-inflammatory effect may be important given that hs-CRP is an independent predictor of CVD in HIV [<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our trial was not designed to investigate renal outcomes, but telmisartan (80 mg) reduced (<italic>P</italic> = .04) ACR over 48 weeks in patients with microalbuminuria (defined by ACR &gt;3 mg/mmol) when compared with the control arm. This is in line with previous evidence of the renoprotective effect of telmisartan in patients with HIV [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>There were no safety concerns with any of the doses of telmisartan, and the SAEs were similarly distributed between the treatment arms and the control arm. Our finding of no decrease in blood pressure even in normotensive patients was reassuring.</p>
              <p>A major strength of the trial was the adaptive design utilised; this allowed testing of 3 different doses of telmisartan simultaneously and to drop 2 different “loser doses” so that a potential “winner dose” could be taken into the second stage of the study. It allowed us to take into account that the purpose of our study (reduction in insulin resistance) may have a different dose-response profile compared with hypertension, which is what telmisartan is licensed for. Additionally, this design also provided an opportunity to stop the study at the interim analysis stage if the required benefit was not identified with any of the doses. We used HOMA-IR as our primary outcome measure; ideally, we should have used the euglycemic-hyperglycemic clamp for ascertaining insulin resistance, but the invasiveness and complexity of undertaking this in a large-scale trial ruled it out. A 24-week time point was selected for the primary outcome and 48 weeks for the total duration of drug treatment based on data on non–HIV-positive patients. A longer duration of treatment may have been more ideal, but previous studies have shown that HOMA-IR changes within 4 weeks of starting ARV drugs [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this trial, which used a novel adaptive design, did not find a significant effect of telmisartan on reduction in HOMA-IR, the primary outcome measure, after 24 weeks of treatment. A longitudinal analysis over 48 weeks showed that telmisartan improved the revised QUICKI, hs-CRP, hepatic fat accumulation, and microalbuminuria. Although these changes were marginal, they are biologically plausible. Given the contradictory findings with telmisartan in populations with or without HIV, stratifying treatment with telmisartan using biomarkers may be a fruitful area for further research. To this end, the biological archive created as a result of the trial will serve as a valuable source for the identification and validation of novel biomarkers.</p>
