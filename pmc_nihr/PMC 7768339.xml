                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Many patients with HR+, HER2− early breast cancer (EBC) will not experience recurrence or have distant recurrence with currently available standard therapies. However, up to 30% of patients with high-risk clinical and/or pathologic features may experience distant recurrence, many in the first few years. Superior treatment options are needed to prevent early recurrence and development of metastases for this group of patients. Abemaciclib is an oral, continuously dosed, CDK4/6 inhibitor approved for HR+, HER2− advanced breast cancer (ABC). Efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in ABC supported evaluation in the adjuvant setting.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>This open-label, phase III study included patients with HR+, HER2−, high-risk EBC, who had surgery and, as indicated, radiotherapy and/or adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with four or more positive nodes, or one to three nodes and either tumor size ≥ 5 cm, histologic grade 3, or central Ki-67 ≥ 20%, were eligible and randomly assigned (1:1) to standard-of-care adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) with or without abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily for 2 years). The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and secondary end points included distant relapse–free survival, overall survival, and safety.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>At a preplanned efficacy interim analysis, among 5,637 randomly assigned patients, 323 IDFS events were observed in the intent-to-treat population. Abemaciclib plus ET demonstrated superior IDFS versus ET alone (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .01; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.93), with 2-year IDFS rates of 92.2% versus 88.7%, respectively. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of abemaciclib.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Abemaciclib when combined with ET is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a significant improvement in IDFS in patients with HR+, HER2− node-positive EBC at high risk of early recurrence.</p>

                <p>This study was funded by the sponsor (Eli Lilly) and designed together with members of the study Executive Committee. The study was performed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and all amendments received approval from ethical/institutional review boards before implementation, and all patients gave written informed consent. All authors contributed to the writing and review of the manuscript and were involved in the interpretation of the data. Executive and Global Steering Committees provided oversight of the conduct of the trial, and an independent data monitoring committee reviewed the safety data approximately every 6 months and efficacy data at prespecified interim analyses. Although this was an open-label study, the sponsor and all investigative sites remained blinded to treatment group assignments for aggregate data until the study was confirmed as positive. A complete list of all committee members and investigators is available in the Data Supplement (online only).</p>

                <p>Female (any menopausal status) and male patients ≥ 18 years of age with HR+<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and HER2−<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> disease were eligible. High risk was defined as patients with four or more positive pathologic axillary lymph nodes or one to three positive axillary lymph nodes and at least one of the following: tumor size ≥ 5 cm, histologic grade 3, or centrally assessed Ki-67 ≥ 20% (please refer to the Data Supplement, online only, for details on Ki-67 methodology).</p>
                <p>Patients may have received up to 12 weeks of ET after the last non-ET before randomization and must have been randomly assigned within 16 months of definitive breast cancer surgery.</p>
                <p>Radiotherapy and both adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were allowed, but not required. Patients with occult breast cancer, metastatic disease, or node-negative breast cancer, and, after a protocol amendment, patients with inflammatory breast cancer, were excluded. Patients who had received treatment with ET for breast cancer prevention, raloxifene, and/or a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and those with a history of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were also excluded.</p>
                <p>An interactive Web response system was used to randomly assign patients (1:1) to receive either abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily on a continuous dosing schedule) plus ET or ET alone. Stratification factors included previous chemotherapy (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or none), menopausal status (as determined at the time of breast cancer diagnosis), and region (North America/Europe, Asia, or other). Patients were treated for 2 years (treatment period) or until meeting criteria for discontinuation. After the treatment period, all patients continued ET for 5 to 10 years, as clinically indicated (Data Supplement). The 2-year treatment duration was chosen based on historical studies indicating recurrence events first peaked at 2 years for patients with EBC.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Post-discontinuation treatment was at the discretion of the investigator.

                <p>The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) per the Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points in Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trials (STEEP) criteria<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and was measured from the date of randomization to the date of first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, local/regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, death attributable to any cause, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or second primary nonbreast invasive cancer. Confirmation by biopsy or imaging was required, when possible. All patients who experienced local recurrence continued to be followed for distant recurrence. Distant relapse–free survival (DRFS), a secondary end point, was defined as the time from randomization to distant recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients for whom no event was observed were censored on the day of their last assessment for recurrence or date of randomization if no post-baseline assessment for recurrence occurred. Other secondary end points included OS, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PK and PRO data will be reported separately.</p>
                <p>The study was powered at approximately 85% to detect the superiority of abemaciclib plus ET versus ET in terms of IDFS, assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.73 at a cumulative two-sided α level of .05, with a 5-year IDFS rate of 82.5% in the control arm for this high-risk population.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This required approximately 390 IDFS events in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population at the time of the primary analysis. There were two planned efficacy interim analyses at approximately 50% and 75% of the total required events. The overall type I error for the preplanned interim analyses and primary analysis was maintained using the Lan-DeMets method with an O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary.</p>
                <p>Efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population. The primary objective was to test the superiority of abemaciclib plus ET versus ET on IDFS using a log-rank test stratified by randomization factors. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with treatment arm as a variable was used to estimate the HR and the corresponding 95% CI. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the 2-year IDFS rates in each treatment arm. Similar analyses were performed on DRFS, but there was no α control for statistical significance on this end point. All reported <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values are two-sided.</p>
                <p>Subgroup analyses of IDFS in the ITT population were performed for potential prognostic subgroup variables prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, including stratification factors and some clinicopathological features. HR estimates were reported within each subgroup, with <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values for interaction tests across subgroups.</p>
                <p>Safety was analyzed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (defined as either abemaciclib or ET after randomization). Investigator-reported terms were mapped to MedDRA terms, and AEs were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this global, open-label, randomized phase III trial in patients with HR+, HER2−, node-positive, high-risk EBC, the addition of abemaciclib to standard adjuvant ET resulted in a statistically significant improvement in IDFS. All patients had primary breast surgery, and despite &gt; 95% of patients having received prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the estimated 2-year IDFS rate in the monarchE control arm indicates that 11.3% of patients with high-risk clinicopathological features will develop an invasive disease event within 2 years. The addition of abemaciclib resulted in a 25% reduction in the risk of developing an IDFS event relative to ET alone and an absolute improvement of 3.5% in 2-year IDFS rates. This is a clinically meaningful result, and the treatment effect was observed in all prespecified subgroups. Of note, among the 43.5% of patients who were premenopausal at diagnosis, there was a significant 37% reduction in the risk of recurrence relative to ET alone. This is relevant because there have been very few treatment advances in adjuvant therapy for HR+, HER2− EBC for nearly 20 years.</p>
              <p>Early recurrence within the first 2 years of adjuvant ET in HR+ breast cancer is known to represent primary endocrine resistance.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> More than 75% of the early recurrences seen in the control arm were distant recurrence. Overcoming endocrine resistance and reducing the risk of distant metastasis is an essential objective for any novel therapy in HR+ EBC. Abemaciclib is an approved CDK4/6 inhibitor in HR+, HER2− ABC, with clinical efficacy both as monotherapy in pretreated ABC<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and in combination with ET.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Significant improvement in OS was reported in patients with endocrine-resistant disease, including patients with visceral metastases.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The effect now seen in the EBC adjuvant setting in monarchE indicates a similar impact on preventing early primary endocrine resistant recurrences and on reducing the risk of metastatic recurrence by a clinically meaningful 28% relative to ET alone, especially in bone and liver metastases (Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of note, the Kaplan-Meier curves for both IDFS and DRFS separate at 9-12 months (Figs <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which may indicate the need for early treatment of very-high-risk patients who may have subclinical micrometastatic disease at diagnosis.</p>
              <p>The ability to conclude the statistically significant benefit of adding abemaciclib to ET is dependent on the number of IDFS events observed. By enrolling patients whose cancer is at high risk of early recurrence, monarchE reached the target number of events for the efficacy assessment faster relative to a patient population at a lower risk of recurrence. At this preplanned interim analysis, 323 events were observed, corresponding to &gt; 80% of the total planned number of events (390). Overall type I error was robustly controlled using an O’Brien-Fleming spending function, ensuring highly statistically significant and definitive results. Although the median follow-up of 15 months at this time is short for an EBC adjuvant study, the positive outcome demonstrated the effectiveness of abemaciclib in reducing the risk of invasive disease within 2 years—a critical outcome for this high-risk population. Additional follow-up in monarchE will determine the persistence of this benefit on later recurrences and overall survival in node-positive, high-risk HR+ HER2− EBC, which is unknown at present.</p>
              <p>Understanding the subgroups of patients with HR+, HER2− breast cancer for whom the addition of a targeted therapy is most beneficial is an important goal. In monarchE, a population with increased risk of recurrence on the basis of disease characteristics such as axillary lymph node involvement, tumor size, and biology was selected, and a clear efficacy benefit for the addition of abemaciclib was demonstrated. Whether benefit of a CDK4/6 inhibitor can be demonstrated in patients at lower risk is unclear, especially given that many of these patients experience recurrence late (&gt; 10 years after diagnosis), and extended adjuvant ET is increasingly used and may benefit these patients. There are additional ongoing clinical trials evaluating CDK4/6 inhibitors in EBC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03701334" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03701334</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02513394" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02513394</ext-link>). Results from these trials using different compounds in different populations will further determine the role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in EBC. The definitive results from monarchE have identified a specific high-risk patient population for whom the addition of abemaciclib prevents early disease recurrences and reduces the risk of distant metastases. In addition, understanding the tumor biology of patients who benefit most from adjuvant abemaciclib is important, and parallel translational research to investigate tissue and plasma samples from patients in monarchE is underway.</p>
              <p>Adherence to therapy is a challenge in the adjuvant setting, and a manageable toxicity profile for any novel therapy is crucial. The safety profile of abemaciclib in this adjuvant study was consistent with the known adverse effect profile of abemaciclib previously reported in the ABC setting. Of interest, arthralgia and hot flush are known frequent and often troublesome AEs related to ET. Both were significantly reduced in those treated with abemaciclib plus ET compared with ET alone (arthralgia, 20.5% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 31.3%; hot flush, 14.1% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 21.0%). This intriguing observation has been reported previously in a randomized study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus ET.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The most frequently reported AE in the abemaciclib arm was diarrhea. Diarrhea occurred early (median time to onset for any grade of 8 days), was short-lived (median duration for grades 2 and 3 of 5 to 6 days), and was managed with antidiarrheal medication and dose adjustments per protocol. The frequency of diarrhea grade ≥ 3 was 7.6%; however, a very low number of patients (4.8%) discontinued abemaciclib because of diarrhea. Neutropenia grade ≥ 3 occurred in &lt; 20% of abemaciclib-treated patients (0.3% febrile neutropenia, any grade). VTE and ILD were reported more often in the abemaciclib arm, and although SAEs were uncommon, signs and symptoms should be closely monitored for patients on abemaciclib.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, monarchE has demonstrated that abemaciclib added to standard adjuvant ET significantly improves IDFS in women and men with HR+, HER2−, node-positive EBC at high risk of early recurrence.</p>
