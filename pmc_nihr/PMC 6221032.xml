                  <p>This extension study provided continued treatment to subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis who had participated for ≥16 weeks in a pharmacokinetic similarity study of <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586 (potential rituximab biosimilar). Objectives were to evaluate overall pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586 after transition from rituximab reference products to <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586, and follow‐up of biomarker and efficacy assessments.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Subjects were offered ≤3 additional courses of treatment of <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586, with or without a single transition from rituximab in Europe (rituximab‐<styled-content style="fixed-case">EU</styled-content>; MabThera) or the <styled-content style="fixed-case">US</styled-content> (rituximab‐<styled-content style="fixed-case">US</styled-content>; Rituxan) to <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586.

                  <p>Of 220 subjects in the parent study, 185 were randomized and included in this study. There were no notable differences in drug concentrations between groups or across courses, with little variation in depletion of <styled-content style="fixed-case">CD</styled-content>19+ B cells between groups, and no apparent relationship between infusion‐related reactions and antidrug antibodies with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586. Long‐term safety and tolerability of <styled-content style="fixed-case">PF</styled-content>‐05280586 was acceptable in all groups for up to 96 weeks, with a low incidence of treatment‐emergent adverse events independent of single drug transition. The percentage of subjects with a low disease activity score and disease activity score remission was similar across groups for all time points, and responses were sustained until end of study.</p>

              <p>Biologics are products of genetically engineered living cells and cannot be identical to one another <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>.

              <p>PF‐05280586 is under development as a potential biosimilar of rituximab, with an identical primary amino acid sequence to rituximab; it was demonstrated to be highly similar based on comparison of physicochemical critical attributes, and nonclinical and in vitro functional characteristics <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. In a randomized 3‐way pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity study in subjects with active RA, PK equivalence was demonstrated between PF‐05280586 and rituximab‐EU, PF‐05280586 and rituximab‐US, and rituximab‐EU and rituximab‐US. This study also demonstrated comparable CD19+ B cell depletion, pharmacodynamic (PD) responses, safety, and immunogenicity profiles for all treatments <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p>
              <p>This extension study was designed to provide continued access up to an additional 3 courses of treatment with PF‐05280586, with or without a single transition (either at course 1 or course 2) from rituximab‐EU or rituximab‐US to PF‐05280586 in subjects with active RA who fulfilled entry criteria. This article reports the PK, PD, immunogenicity, safety, and clinical data of the extension study, which include blinded randomization with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586, for this cohort of subjects with active RA. Since the study was not designed for a formal statistical analysis of PK, PD, immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy end points, the data are presented with descriptive statistics.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This study was an extension offered to subjects with active RA who had participated in the randomized, parallel‐group, 3‐arm clinical PK study for at least 16 weeks, up to 2 months after completion of the parent study and who had not received intervening treatment with investigational agents or other biologics (including rituximab‐EU or rituximab‐US). The parent study included subjects with active RA who were randomized (1:1:1) to receive PF‐05280586, rituximab‐EU, or rituximab‐US, each administered as 2 intravenous (IV) 1,000‐mg doses on study days 1 and 15, and has been previously published <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p>
                <p>This extension study was conducted at 48 centers in 10 countries in compliance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with international standards of good clinical practice. All subjects provided informed consent prior to undergoing any screening procedures. The final protocol, amendments, and informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each of the participating investigational sites. The study was supported by Pfizer and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01643928).</p>

                <p>This study was conducted in subjects with active RA who received background therapy with methotrexate, and had an inadequate response to at least 1 tumor necrosis factor antagonist therapy when they entered the parent study. In addition to the criteria related to their participation in the parent study, subjects were excluded from the extension study if they required treatment with prohibited concomitant medications during the study, including live attenuated vaccines, cytotoxic drugs, prednisone &gt;10 mg/day or equivalent, disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (other than stable dose of methotrexate up to 25 mg weekly), plasma exchange therapy, or immunoglobulin. Subjects were also excluded from the study if they had a severe reaction to rituximab reference products or PF‐05280586, or a serious adverse event (SAE) that was deemed to be related to the study drug in the parent study. Subjects with an absolute neutrophil count ≤1,500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or immunoglobulin G levels &lt;300 mg/dl were also excluded from the study.</p>

                <title>Treatments</title>
                <p>All subjects were offered up to 3 courses of study treatment. Each course was divided into 2 IV infusions of 1,000 mg of study treatment administered on days 1 and 15, and separated from the next course by 24 weeks (± 8 weeks). The first course of this extension study randomized subjects as follows: those who received rituximab‐EU in the parent study were blindly randomized (1:1) to either continue on rituximab‐EU (E‐E) or receive PF‐05280586 (E‐P), and subjects who received rituximab‐US were blindly randomized (1:1) to either continue rituximab‐US (U‐U) or receive PF‐05280586 (U‐P). All subjects who continued after the end of course 1 received PF‐05280586 for courses 2 and 3 in this study (E‐EPP and E‐PPP, or U‐UPP and U‐PPP, respectively). Subjects who received PF‐05280586 in the parent study continued blind randomization to receive PF‐05280586 for courses 1, 2, and 3 (P‐P, P‐PP, P‐PPP, respectively) (Figure <xref rid="acr23586-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Study treatments were administered in accordance with health authority–approved product labels for RA.</p>

                <p>This study was designed to provide continued treatment access to subjects with active RA who had participated for at least 16 weeks in the parent study. In addition, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the overall PK, PD, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of PF‐05280586 after transition from a rituximab reference product to PF‐05280586, and to continue follow‐up of biomarker and efficacy end points of interest in the parent study.</p>

                <p>Serum samples for the determination of antidrug antibodies (ADA) were collected concurrently with PK samples and tested using 2 validated assays. Serum samples from subjects who received PF‐05280586 in the parent study were screened for ADA using the assay specific to PF‐05280586, and if confirmed positive, samples were also analyzed using the assay specific for the rituximab reference products to assess cross‐reactivity of the ADA. Serum samples from subjects who received rituximab reference products in the parent study were screened for ADA using both assays (PF‐05280586 and rituximab reference products) to assess any product‐specific ADA and/or cross‐reactivity, since these subjects were exposed to the rituximab reference products followed by PF‐05280586.</p>
                <p>Blood samples that were confirmed positive for ADA were further titered and tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Samples that were confirmed positive for nAbs were also titered. An electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was used for detection of ADAs, while nAbs were detected using a cell‐based assay, in accordance with relevant regulatory guidance <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>.</p>

                <p>During course 1, the geometric mean (coefficient of variation) concentrations of study drug increased from 10.9 ng/ml (232.5%) at week 1 to a maximum of 97,537.6 ng/ml (30.5%) at week 3. This was followed by a slow decline to 594.7 ng/ml (162.6%) at week 25. Similar trends were noted during courses 2 and 3. There were no notable differences in drug concentrations between treatment groups or across treatment courses.</p>
                <p>In general, the appearance of ADA resulted in a slight decrease in drug concentrations; however, this observation should be interpreted with caution given the relatively small numbers of subjects who were ADA+. None of the samples that tested positive for ADAs tested positive for neutralizing activity in this study.</p>

                <p>ADA samples were available from 181 subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The incidence of ADA response observed in this study during the combined courses 1–3 was 13.3% with the anti‐rituximab antibody assay and 10.0% with the anti–PF‐05280586 antibody assay.</p>
                <p>There were 173 samples with baseline ADA test results available. Of the 27 subjects who were ADA+ at baseline in this study, 19 (70%) were also ADA+ in the parent study, 20 (74%) had cross‐reactive ADA with similar titers, and 23 (85%) reverted to ADA– by their last visit. The remaining 4 subjects were ADA+ at their last visit. Of these, 1 subject (randomized to the P‐PPP group) had stable titers of treatment‐emergent, cross‐reactive ADA+ without infusion‐related reactions (IRRs) throughout the parent study, and entered this extension study with similar ADA titers, reporting an IRR during course 1 that led to withdrawal from the study. Another subject (E‐PPP) had cross‐reactive ADA titers of &lt;1.88/2.64 at entry into the extension study and 4.87/4.58 at the follow‐up visit, with no IRR. The last 2 subjects had stable titers and no IRR (E‐PPP and U‐UPP).</p>
                <p>Of the 146 subjects who were ADA– at pre‐dose, 1 (&lt;1%) had tested positive in the parent study but remained ADA– throughout this study, despite testing positive in the parent study. Additionally, 17 of 146 subjects (12%) became ADA+ during this study, of which 15 of 17 (88%) were ADA– in the parent study. Finally, 5 of 146 subjects (3.4%) remained ADA+ at the last visit and did not report an IRR. In total, 11 of 17 subjects (65%) who were ADA+ had cross‐reactive ADAs with similar titers.</p>

                <p>Overall, 6 subjects reported an IRR during the study that was deemed to be related to study treatment (Table <xref rid="acr23586-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of these, 2 of 6 subjects (33.3%; 1 each in the P‐PPP and U‐PPP groups) were ADA–. The remaining 4 of 6 subjects (66.7%) were ADA+, of whom 1 subject in the P‐P group experienced grade 3 IRR (rash papular) and was ADA+ at the same time point. This subject was permanently discontinued from the study. Two subjects (1 each in the U‐UPP and E‐PPP groups) were ADA+ after reporting their IRRs and 1 in the P‐PPP group was ADA+ before reporting an IRR (Table <xref rid="acr23586-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). All IRRs occurred at course 1 or 2, and none were reported at the final drug exposure on course 3. None of the IRRs were serious in nature and all were resolved.</p>

                <p>By the end of course 3, 46 of 164 subjects (28.0%) reported treatment‐related AEs: 12 of 48 (25.0%), 5 of 30 (16.7%), 11 of 30 (36.7%), 11 of 27 (40.7%), and 7 of 29 subjects (24.1%) in the P‐PPP, E‐EPP, E‐PPP, U‐UPP, and U‐PPP groups, respectively. The most frequent treatment‐related AEs across all treatment groups were infections, reported as sinusitis in 7, bronchitis in 6, upper respiratory tract infection in 5, and oral herpes in 3 subjects. In addition, cough was reported in 4 subjects, and decreased white blood cell count and headache in 3 subjects each.</p>
                <p>SAEs were reported in 11 of 183 subjects (6.0%) during course 1, 14 of 173 (8.1%) by the end of course 2, and in 11 of 164 subjects (6.7%) by the end of course 3. There were no observed clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of SAEs across treatment groups. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported SAE in 3 of 164 subjects (1.8%; 1 of 48 [1.4%] in the P‐PPP group and 2 of 30 subjects [4.5%] in the E‐PPP group). Three subjects reported 3 SAEs (pericarditis [E‐PPP], infectious arthritis [P‐PPP], and wound staphylococcal infection [E‐PPP]) that were deemed to be treatment related. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (an event of special interest) were reported during the study.</p>
                <p>There were no deaths in this study. There were no observed clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs, and no observed clinically meaningful differences among the treatment groups.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>As patent protection and data exclusivity for rituximab expire, potential rituximab biosimilars are in development. Indeed, CT‐P10, a biosimilar version of rituximab, is approved in South Korea <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> and Europe <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> for the treatment of RA, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Another rituximab biosimilar, L01XC02, is approved in Europe for the treatment of NHL, CLL, RA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis (also approved under a duplicate marketing authorization for the treatment of NHL, RA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis) <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. The availability of rituximab biosimilars may increase patient access to safe and efficacious medicines <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>.</p>
              <p>This study provided continued treatment access to a small cohort of subjects with active RA who had participated in the parent study of a rituximab biosimilar <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. In this extension study, subjects were offered up to 3 additional courses of treatment, with or without a single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586. Although the number of subjects who discontinued treatment in the P‐PPP arm was numerically higher than in the other treatment groups, this was not considered clinically relevant. Similar drug concentrations were observed across treatment groups in this study. All treatment groups showed complete and sustained depletion of CD19+ B cells.</p>
              <p>The incidence of ADA response observed in this study during the combined courses 1–3 was consistent with the published incidence of ADA: 11% in subjects with RA treated with rituximab in long‐term studies <xref rid="acr23586-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. There was no apparent time relationship between IRR reports and ADA+ with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586 in this study. In total, 6 subjects experienced an IRR during this study that was deemed to be related to study treatment. However, no consistent trends were observed between IRRs after single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586. Moreover, IRRs occurred at courses 1 or 2, and none were noted at course 3 during the last drug re‐challenge.</p>
              <p>The long‐term safety and tolerability of PF‐05280586 was acceptable in all groups up to 96 weeks in this extension study, with a low incidence of TEAEs or discontinuations due to AEs, independent of single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586. The pattern and frequency of SAEs, incidence of IRRs, grade ≥3 TEAEs, and withdrawal of subjects due to AEs were similar across the treatment groups. The percentage of subjects with low DAS and DAS remission were similar across the treatment groups for all time points, and the responses were sustained until the end of the study.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated tolerability and acceptable safety with or without single transition from rituximab reference products to PF‐05280586, and did not demonstrate increased immunogenicity on re‐challenge or single transition based on either ADA or IRR reports. These data support the continued development of PF‐05280586 as a potential biosimilar to rituximab. A randomized comparative clinical study evaluating efficacy, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of PF‐05280586 and rituximab‐EU monotherapy in treatment‐naive subjects with CD20+ low tumor burden follicular lymphoma is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02213263).</p>
