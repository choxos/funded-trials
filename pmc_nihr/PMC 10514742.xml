                  <p>Of the 7250 participants included, the mean (SD) age was 13.7 (0.6) years, 3947 (55.4%) identified as female, and 5378 (73.1%) self-reported their race as White. Twelve schools and 769 of the 864 students (89.0%) in cohort 1 and 54 schools and 2958 of the 6386 students (46.3%) in cohort 2 provided data and were analyzed. Mental health difficulties increased in both cohorts but to a greater extent among students exposed to the pandemic, including for risk of depression (adjusted mean difference [AMD], 1.91; 95% CI, 1.07-2.76); social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (AMD, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.33-1.18); and mental well-being (AMD, −2.08; 95% CI, −2.80 to −1.36). Positive school climate, high home connectedness, and having a friend during lockdown were protective factors during the pandemic. Female gender and initial low risk for mental health difficulties were associated with greater mental health deteriorations. Partial school attendance during lockdown was associated with better adjustment than no attendance when returning to school.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is growing evidence that the prevalence of mental health conditions in young people, particularly girls,<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> is increasing in the UK.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> From the start of 2020, young people’s lives were disrupted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Observational studies have reported mixed findings but have mostly suggested that young people’s mental health deteriorated.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This was possibly related to disruptions to school and social interactions, COVID-19–related anxieties, family illness, grief from possible loss of relatives, economic effects, ongoing uncertainty, and reduced access to mental health services and other support.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> However, the lack of a suitable comparison group means that the specific role of COVID-19 and underpinning risk and resilience factors remains unclear.</p>
              <p>To advise immediate and future policy decisions, better understanding is needed on what factors affect young people’s mental health, particularly during challenging circumstances.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Informed by theoretical models and previous research,<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> we explored the associations of individual, home, friendship, and school (eg, school community, operational features of the school, the broader school context) factors with mental health difficulties and mental well-being for secondary school students (hereafter, students) before and during the pandemic. Students in the UK aged 11 to 13 years were recruited in 2 cohorts (enrolled in 2016 and 2017, respectively). Participants were followed up over a 3-year period, which included the COVID-19 pandemic for the second cohort only.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This created a natural experiment ideally suited to evaluate the association of the pandemic with students’ mental health difficulties and mental well-being.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We aimed to disentangle known difficulties in students’ mental health and mental well-being from changes specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also secondarily explored which individual, home, friendship, and school factors were associated with changes in students’ mental health difficulties and mental well-being during the pandemic and with adjustment to lockdown and return to school.</p>

                <p><xref rid="zoi231007f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the study design. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic after cohort 1 (n = 12 schools) had completed the data collection for all follow-up time points (time point 3 [T3], autumn 2018; time point 4 [T4], autumn 2019). For cohort 2 (n = 72 schools), COVID-19 was declared a pandemic between the 1- and 2-year follow-up time points (T3, autumn 2019; T4, winter 2020/spring 2021), creating optimal conditions for a natural experiment. We collected T4 measures for cohort 2 during the third UK lockdown, when adults were encouraged to work from home, social activities were restricted, and schools were mostly open, although classes and sometimes entire year groups were asked to work remotely when high numbers of students tested positive for COVID-19. Schools reopened after the first lockdown in the summer and autumn of 2020. Hence, all students in cohort 2 had the experience of returning to school after a national lockdown prior to T4. The pandemic timeline and lockdown restrictions are described in eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>.</p>

The UK government announced on March 23, 2020, that residents must stay at home and some businesses had to close. This lockdown was gradually eased until July 4, 2020, when most businesses were allowed to open. From late July 2020 onward, a series of limited and local restrictions were put in place. From November 5, 2020, the UK went into a second, 4-week lockdown, which differed from the first in that schools and universities remained open, and from December 2020 onward returned to a system of local restrictions. From December 26, 2020, the UK went into a third lockdown with a gradual end: in March 2021, schools reopened; in April 2021, individuals in groups of up to 6 were allowed to meet again outdoors, and outdoor pubs, restaurants, and nonessential shops reopened in the UK; in mid-May 2021, outdoor social contact became unregulated again, individuals in groups of up to 6 were allowed to meet indoors, and restaurants and hotels could reopen.

                  <p>All models were adjusted for design variables (country, school size, and coeducation)<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and time (days) between T3 and T4. Owing to the lack of intervention effects in the trial,<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> we analyzed both trial arms together but adjusted for allocation. We used 2-sided tests with a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and controlled for the false discovery rate in all multivariable models.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Analyses were performed using Stata, version 17.0 (StataCorp).</p>

                <p>Of the 7250 participants included, the mean (SD) age was 13.7 (0.6) years, 3947 (55.4%) identified as female, and 5378 (73.1%) self-reported their race as White. <xref rid="zoi231007t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the study sample at T3 (cohort 1: 864 students across 12 schools; cohort 2: 6386 students across 72 schools). Students in cohort 1 initially had lower mental health difficulties and higher mental well-being than students in cohort 2. Twelve schools and 769 students (89.0%) in cohort 1 (prepandemic) and 54 schools and 2958 students (46.3%) in cohort 2 (midpandemic) were retained until T4 and provided data on at least 1 outcome. Compared with students lost to follow-up, those retained reported slightly lower mental health difficulties and higher mental well-being at T3, and this was more pronounced for students in cohort 1 vs cohort 2 (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>, which also describes missing data and how this affected statistical power). Both cohorts were comparable and representative of the UK general population in terms of school and student characteristics (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). eFigure 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> shows the number of students in cohort 2 responding at T4 in the context of the pandemic restrictions. eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> summarizes students’ adjustment, home environment, and friendships during lockdown in cohort 2, as measured at T4. eFigure 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> shows student transitions from T3 to T4 by cohort, using validated cutoffs for the main outcomes.

                <p>In the pandemic-exposed cohort 2, students with a low and high initial risk for mental health difficulties showed deteriorations in the main outcomes. Deteriorations were greater in students with low (vs high) initial risk for mental health difficulties for risk for depression (B, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.82-3.32) and social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (B, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.41-1.57) (<xref rid="zoi231007t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref><sup><xref rid="zoi231007r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and eTable 7 and eFigure 5 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Over time, female (vs male) students were at an increased risk for depression (B, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.54-2.73) and social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (B, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17), as well as poorer mental well-being (B, −1.42; 95% CI, −2.41 to −0.43) (eFigure 6 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, over time, stronger home connectedness was associated with a decreasing risk for depression (B, −8.95; 95% CI, −11.40 to −6.51) and social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (B, −3.66; 95% CI, −4.72 to −2.60), as well as increased well-being (B, 6.24; 95% CI, 4.21-8.27) (eFigure 7 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). A more positive student-rated school climate at T3 was also associated with a decreasing risk for depression (B, −4.47; 95% CI, −5.17 to −3.78) and social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (B, −2.76; 95% CI, −3.12 to −2.40), as well as increased well-being (B, 3.90; 95% CI, 3.35-4.46), but the association between school climate and outcomes weakened over time (risk for depression: B, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91-3.44; social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties: B, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19-1.89; and well-being: B, −2.55; 95% CI, −3.19 to −1.91) (eFigure 8 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Uncertainty around having a friend during lockdown was associated with an increased risk for depression (B, 2.88; 95% CI, 0.63-5.14) and social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties (B, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.21-2.28) (eFigure 9 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231007-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Household assets, studying conditions, home conflicts, and how much time students were in school during lockdown were not significantly associated with changes in mental health.</p>

              <p>During normal times, secondary school students have to navigate a period of growing and complex demands.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Over the past decade, anxiety, depression, and self-harm have increased among this population, especially among girls.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These difficulties in young peoples’ mental health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Consistent with earlier studies, the present study demonstrates small but relevant deteriorations in secondary students’ mental health difficulties and mental well-being over time. Herein, we show, to our knowledge, for the first time in a natural experiment from a single study that these deteriorations were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The consistency of these results across different measures suggests that effects are real and meaningful. Previous research has shown that social isolation during the pandemic negatively influenced students’ mental health.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We identified key individual (eg, gender), home (eg, connectedness), friendship (eg, friendships during lockdown), and school (eg, climate) factors that were associated with changes in students’ mental health.</p>
              <p>Among those exposed to the pandemic, not only girls,<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but also students without perceived friendships during lockdown and those with a low initial risk for mental health difficulties were more likely to experience deteriorating mental health. Higher levels of student-rated school climate were associated with protection against such deteriorating mental health. A 2018 systematic review suggested that positive school climate is associated with better student mental health, but most studies were cross sectional.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Although losing a supportive school environment amid the pandemic restrictions may have heightened home or community challenges, the association between school climate and mental health also weakened over time in students not exposed to the pandemic. This implies that the protective effect of a good school climate observed cross sectionally might decrease over time for all, perhaps due to academic pressures and uncertainties regarding their future, as the time to leave school draws closer. The effect of school-based interventions that promote a positive school climate on students’ mental health and mental well-being warrants further research.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The present findings suggest that positive home connectedness protected against deteriorating mental health during the pandemic. Previous research observed that conflict with parents was associated with worse mental health during the pandemic,<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> which we did not replicate here. A more complex picture emerged in terms of risk for depression. For students who had a poor school climate prepandemic and then spent time in a highly connected home environment, the pandemic was associated with improved outcomes for them. However, for students who had a more positive prepandemic school climate but were forced to stay at home in a poorly connected environment, the pandemic was associated with worsened outcomes. The combination of both positive environments (school climate and home connectedness) might contribute to maintaining a stable low risk for depression. These findings suggest that positive home and school environments could work additively and should be targeted together by policies and interventions.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Only high home connectedness was significantly associated with greater adjustment to lockdown, consistent with previous research.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Interestingly, higher student-rated school climate, positive home connectedness, and having been in school some of the time during lockdown were all associated with better adjustment when returning to school. Girls were more likely than boys to report challenges with returning to school. These findings suggest that schools should be kept open whenever possible. If reduced interaction is required, it is important to encourage children to attend school for some of the time. Attendance for students facing challenges, such as social isolation, needs to be prioritized. Future research should explore why girls were more likely to struggle when schools reopened. In summary, these findings extend earlier work by demonstrating the importance of supportive relationships and underscore the potential for family, peer, and school interventions to support the mental health of students.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Previous research used cohorts from different studies, including distinct interventions and a limited number of factors.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We analyzed data from a large cluster randomized clinical trial focusing on a representative sample of UK secondary schools and students. Participants were recruited in 2 cohorts from the same study, providing a unique opportunity to test risk and resilience factors underpinning changes in students’ mental health during a critical developmental stage and a challenging period. While data were collected using mostly validated measures, some of them had not been used before (eg, the adjustment to lockdown and return to school variables), given the lack of existing measures. We conducted rigorous data analyses to explore a range of theory-driven characteristics across multiple levels of analysis.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231007r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> School-level characteristics were measured prepandemic as preexisting conditions to explore longitudinal associations with students’ mental health difficulties and mental well-being during the pandemic. However, some of these school-level features could have changed because of the pandemic (eg, the percentage of students eligible for free school meals in England for year 10 increased 12% between 2019-2020 and 2020-2021),<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> which await further scrutiny. The present sample was majority White, and subgroup analyses for other racial and ethnic minority groups were impossible due to small numbers. While we did not have information on the socioeconomic status of each student, we used characteristics of the home environment during lockdown, such as household assets and studying conditions, as a proxy. Other possible influences on students’ adaptation (eg, trauma) await future research. No clinical indicators of mental health diagnoses were available; hence, we relied on student self-report. The home environment and friendship measures were added at the final follow-up to collect information retrospectively, risking recall bias.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Although students with and without follow-up data were similar, the attrition rate was high in cohort 2 owing to the challenges of engaging schools and students during partial lockdown.<sup><xref rid="zoi231007r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this cohort study, across the broader context of deteriorating mental health in UK students, we observed that the COVID-19 pandemic considerably exacerbated this trend. We also identified individual, home, friendship, and school characteristics that were associated with changes in mental health difficulties and mental well-being. These findings have policy implications, suggesting that students’ risk and resilience should be conceptualized as multidimensional, including individual, family, friendship, and school factors. Future interventions need to consider all of these levels to effectively address the increasing mental health challenges faced by secondary school students.</p>
