                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Direct ophthalmoscopy (DO) is an essential skill for medical graduates but there are multiple barriers to learning this. Medical students and junior doctors typically lack confidence in DO. Most students do not own an ophthalmoscope and learn via ward devices that vary in design and usability. The Arclight ophthalmoscope (AO) is an easy to use, low-cost and portable device that could help address device access. This study aimed to assess the impact of personal ownership of an AO on DO skill acquisition and competency amongst medical students in the clinical environment.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Method comparison study with 42 medical students randomised to either traditional device ophthalmoscope (TDO) control or AO intervention group during an 18-week medical placement. Three objective assessments of DO competency were performed at the beginning and end of the placement: vertical cup to disc ratio (VCDR) measurement, fundus photo multiple-choice questions (F-MCQ) and model slide examination (MSE). DO examinations performed during the placement were recorded via an electronic logbook.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Students in both groups recorded a median number of six examinations each during an eighteen-week placement. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in any of the objective assessment measures (VCDR <italic>p</italic>â=â0.561, MCQ <italic>p</italic>â=â0.872, Model <italic>p</italic>â=â0.772). Both groups demonstrated a minor improvement in VCDR measurement but a negative performance change in F-MCQ and MSE assessments.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Students do not practice ophthalmoscopy often, even with constant access to their own portable device. The lack of significant difference between the groups suggests that device access alone is not the major factor affecting frequency of DO performance and consequent skill acquisition. Improving student engagement with ophthalmoscopy will require a more wide-ranging approach.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">Direct ophthalmoscopy is an essential skill for medical graduates as outlined by the General Medical Council (GMC) and supported by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Specific ophthalmic problems are estimated to make up approximately 1.46â6% of UK Emergency Department attendances and 1.5% of GP consultations. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] Timely and accurate DO can be life-saving in some patients, for example in recognising papilloedema. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] DO is also required in the management of chronic multi-system diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Despite the importance of and frequent need to perform DO, there are multiple barriers to learning this skill at an undergraduate level. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Ophthalmology is not a compulsory clinical attachment for all UK medical schools and consequently some students graduate without any ophthalmoscopy exposure. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Limited dedicated ophthalmic curricula time is a common finding globally affecting medical schools in both high and low resource countries. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] Perhaps unsurprisingly, cross-sectional studies highlight that medical studentsâ self-reported confidence in DO can be low. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] These findings are continued after graduation, with UK studies of Foundation Year and ED doctors highlighting that the majority lack confidence using an ophthalmoscope correctly and in identifying pathology. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par16">Another barrier to students to learning DO is limited assessments. Objective assessment of DO is difficult due to the inherent challenge that examiners cannot easily determine how well students can view a subjectâs fundus. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] Assessment drives learning behaviour and time-pressured medical students will inevitably prioritise knowledge and skills that they will be assessed on. A 2011 survey of UK medical schools highlighted that only 38% undertook formal assessment of studentsâ ophthalmoscopy skills. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Assessments and simulation models used may lack both objectivity and validity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par17">Device access may be a major barrier to improving frequency of DO performance and associated skill acquisition. Most UK medical students do not own a direct ophthalmoscope or have easy access to a functioning device on hospital placements. Ownership of ophthalmoscopes amongst students fell dramatically following removal of equipment grants in 1986. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] Subsequent students have therefore entered a learning environment where the norm is not to have their own device. The cost of a traditional direct ophthalmoscope (TDO) such as a Keeler standard model is around Â£220 and considered prohibitively expensive to most undergraduates. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] Availability of ophthalmoscopes in hospital attachments is recognised to be limited. This is multi-factorial: NHS procurement can lack consistency in which models are purchased and ward staff may not provide ongoing maintenance leading to non-functioning devices due to burst bulbs or flat batteries. These issues present further challenges to skill mastery. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]</p>
              <p id="Par18">The Arclight (AO) is a device that offers promise in overcoming these barriers. It is a highly portable (11âcm long and weighing 18âg) solar powered, LED illuminated ophthalmoscope. In the UK it costs approximately Â£50, a significant reduction compared to TDOs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Despite its low cost, previous studies have shown it to be as good as TDOs with the majority of users finding it easier to use. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Arclight Ophthalmoscope</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12909_2019_1644_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par19">Consequently, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of personal ownership of a portable ophthalmoscope (AO) on DO skill acquisition and competency amongst medical students in the clinical environment compared to a control group with typical access to TDOs.</p>

                <p id="Par21">The study was performed amongst fourth year MBChB medical students at the University of Birmingham during the period November 2016 to April 2017. Participants were all undertaking their 18-week Specialty Medicine (SPM) hospital placement. SPM is a mandatory clinical attachment which involves rotation through different specialities including one to two weeks of ophthalmology. Students are randomly allocated between eight different hospitals across the West Midlands.</p>

                <p id="Par22">All 178 4th year medical students undertaking the SPM placement at the time of study recruitment were invited to participate via email. Students were offered a free AO for taking part in the study. The only additional eligibility criterion applied was that students were required to have a refractive error between -6D andâ+â4D to participate. This was to match the capacity of the AO to correct refractive error and is in keeping with previous studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p>
                <p id="Par23">A total 42 students (24% response rate) were successfully recruited and individually randomised by the primary investigator (PI) using computerised random numbers to either the control or intervention arms. Three objective DO competency assessments were planned before the students started their 18-week SPM placement and were to be repeated at the end. The students in the intervention arm were given an AO to use throughout the study period and keep afterwards. Students in the control arm received their AO at the end of the study. All participants also then received individualised feedback in the form of their raw assessment scores. These were not graded or linked with any assessments within the MBChB programme.</p>

                <title>Assessments</title>
                <p id="Par26">Three primary assessments of DO competency were performed on all participants at the study beginning and end: judgement of vertical cup disc ratio (VCDR), fundus multiple choice questions (F-MCQs) and model slide regional examination (MSE). VCDR, F-MCQ and EOU all necessitated performing ophthalmoscopy on other study participants, while MSE consisted of examining pre-generated fundal images on 35âmm slides in eye models. Students were all emailed information about the DO devices they would be using and the different assessments 2âweeks before the baseline assessment. No information was given on how to perform DO and no teaching was delivered on the day of assessments. Students were given ten minutes to familiarise themselves with their allocated device prior to the baseline assessments.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Students also self-assessed their examination competence for each ophthalmoscopy examination carried out on another study participant. This was via an âEase of Useâ (EOU) scale used in a previous study, which ranged from 1 (âCouldnât use this ophthalmoscopeâ) to 8 (âDetermined a cup: disc ratio with a low level of difficulty).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par37">The key finding from our study was the low numbers of DO examinations performed by both groups; median of sixÂ during the 18-week clinical attachment which included 1 to 2âweeks of ophthalmology. The low number of examinations is particularly striking given that participants self-selected for study involvement, knew they were being observed and the intervention group were given free portable ophthalmoscopes. Students may have simply failed to record examinations, although this seems unlikely given the potentially positive effect of observer bias and easy access to the smartphone-based e-logbook.</p>
              <p id="Par38">A limitation of studies in this field of research is a lack of a validated objective measure of ophthalmoscopy skills at an undergraduate level. We chose a range of assessments to provide an overview of student performance in an attempt to overcome this. VCDR and EOU scoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], F-MCQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and MSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have all been used in similar studies before but not directly compared or formally validated for assessing competence.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Similar competency results were observed between intervention and control groups across all three assessments. Both groups demonstrated a minor improvement in VCDR judgement but a reduction in F-MCQ and MSE performance. Students generally found VCDR assessment challenging, which is not surprising given the significant assessment variation even amongst ophthalmic specialists. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] Given the lack of correlation with number of examinations, the minor improvement seen in VCDR judgement was likely due to general ophthalmology placement experiences or personal study rather than DO practice. (Appendix 3) Our results suggest F-MCQs may show promise going forwards as they were the only assessment modality to positively correlate with the number of examinations performed. (Appendix 3).</p>
              <p id="Par40">Anecdotally, students reported finding the second set of MSE slides harder to visualise. This was confirmed by the PI and was likely due to variation in the print quality or letter type. The reduction in performance scores in the final MSE assessments may have been in part due to this. This was not the case for F-MCQs as the same questions were used at both baseline and final assessment. MSE has inherent limited construct validity and in our study appeared to be affected by variances in difficulty. There was also a significant correlation with refractive error i.e. students with greater refractive error performed worse in MSE assessments than their peers, which suggests this is a source of performance bias for MSE.</p>
              <p id="Par41">VCDR, F-MCQ and MSE appeared to be testing different aspects of DO competency. This is supported by a lack of significant intra class coefficient (ICC) between any of the assessments. Further research is required to develop a fit for purpose objective measure for DO competency at the undergraduate level.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The AO may provide some performance advantage over traditional models. Despite the lack of impact of the AO on number of examinations and DO skill acquisition, our study confirmed non-inferior performance of the AO versus TDO in 2 of the 3 objectively assessed modalities and higher F-MCQs scores at both the baseline (58.3% vs 42.9%) and final assessments (45.8% vs 35.7%). Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase in self-assessed EOU score for students using the AO.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Further research should aim to explore studentsâ attitudes towards and experience of practising ophthalmoscopy to help identify what barriers to DO skill acquisition are present at an undergraduate level and how to address these. One factor not addressed by this study is clinical supervision and availability of experienced supervisors. Junior doctors often provide frontline clinical teaching but if they lack confidence in their own ophthalmoscopy skills this may lead to a reluctance to support and guide students.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">In our study, personal ownership of a portable ophthalmoscope offered limited advantage over traditional models. Students did not practice DO frequently, even with access to their own portable device. This was reflected in a lack of any meaningful improvement in DO skill over the study period. The AO represents a suitable alternative to more expensive traditional devices, but our results suggest changing student engagement with ophthalmoscopy will require a more wide-ranging approach than improving device access alone.</p>

              <title>Funding</title>
              <p>AB is seconded to the University of St Andrews from NHS Fife. The University owns a social enterprise subsidiary company, for which AB acts as an unpaid adviser. The social enterprise business sells the Arclight to users in high resource countries with all profits being used to fund distribution and education exercises in low-income countries.</p>
              <p>This company provided Arclight devices for use in the study at production cost value. The University of Birmingham then funded acquisition of the devices and provided all other practical resources necessary for the study.</p>
