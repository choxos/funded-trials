                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Dysregulated inflammation is associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. We aimed to assess the efficacy of namilumab (a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor inhibitor) and infliximab (a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, to prioritise agents for phase 3 trials.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this randomised, multicentre, multi-arm, multistage, parallel-group, open-label, adaptive, phase 2, proof-of-concept trial (CATALYST), we recruited patients (aged ≥16 years) admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations of 40 mg/L or greater, at nine hospitals in the UK. Participants were randomly assigned with equal probability to usual care or usual care plus a single intravenous dose of namilumab (150 mg) or infliximab (5 mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified by care location within the hospital (ward <italic>vs</italic> intensive care unit [ICU]). Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was improvement in inflammation, measured by CRP concentration over time, analysed using Bayesian multilevel models. This trial is now complete and is registered with ISRCTN, 40580903.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between June 15, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021, we screened 299 patients and 146 were enrolled and randomly assigned to usual care (n=54), namilumab (n=57), or infliximab (n=35). For the primary outcome, 45 patients in the usual care group were compared with 52 in the namilumab group, and 29 in the usual care group were compared with 28 in the infliximab group. The probabilities that the interventions were superior to usual care alone in reducing CRP concentration over time were 97% for namilumab and 15% for infliximab; the point estimates for treatment–time interactions were –0·09 (95% CI –0·19 to 0·00) for namilumab and 0·06 (–0·05 to 0·17) for infliximab. 134 adverse events occurred in 30 (55%) of 55 patients in the namilumab group compared with 145 in 29 (54%) of 54 in the usual care group. 102 adverse events occurred in 20 (69%) of 29 patients in the infliximab group compared with 112 in 17 (50%) of 34 in the usual care group. Death occurred in six (11%) patients in the namilumab group compared with ten (19%) in the usual care group, and in four (14%) in the infliximab group compared with five (15%) in the usual care group.</p>

                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed and medRxiv on May 10, 2021, from database inception, with no language restrictions, using the terms “(“randomised” OR “trial”)” AND “(“anti-GM-CSF” OR “namilumab” OR “mavrilimumab” OR “otilimab” OR “lenzilumab” OR “gimsilumab” OR “TJ003234” OR “anti-TNF” OR “infliximab” OR “adalimumab” OR “etanercept” OR “golimumab” OR “certolizumab”)” AND “(“COVID*” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “SARS-CoV”)”. Two small non-randomised studies with drugs targeting granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or its receptor (lenzilumab and mavrilimumab) and one study with a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (infliximab) have suggested potential efficacy of these drugs but have had substantial limitations, such as small sample size, use of historical controls, and being conducted before the routine use of corticosteroids. One randomised controlled trial with mavrilimumab was small and inconclusive. Two larger trials with other GM-CSF inhibitors have also been published. Otilimab showed a benefit compared with usual care for the primary endpoint of respiratory failure-free survival at day 28 in a predefined subgroup of patients aged 70 years or older. Lenzilumab, given as a course of three doses, in non-ventilated hospitalised patients showed a benefit over standard care in the primary outcome of survival without ventilation, an effect that seemed more pronounced in patients aged 85 years or younger and with C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration of less than 150 mg/L. We identified no published randomised trials of TNF inhibitors in COVID-19.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>

                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial of namilumab and infliximab in COVID-19. We found that both drugs were safe and that namilumab, but not infliximab, showed proof-of-concept evidence of reduction in inflammation—as measured by CRP concentration—in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary clinical outcomes were concordant with the primary outcome, with trends to improvement in patients recruited from both wards and intensive care units, although the study was not formally powered to assess these outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="para90">Consistent with emerging evidence implicating GM-CSF and inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, namilumab improved inflammation as measured by CRP in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

              </p>
              <p id="para100">Inflammatory monocytes and macrophages or their activity can be targeted therapeutically in several different ways. Given that trials with clinical outcomes require large numbers of patients to show effects, we designed a multi-arm proof-of-concept trial with a biomarker primary outcome to expedite decision making on potentially effective therapeutic options for COVID-19. The aim was to provide early biological signals of efficacy to efficiently prioritise agents with the highest likelihood of success for study in established phase 3 platform trials.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The first two agents studied were namilumab and infliximab.</p>
              <p id="para110">Namilumab is an anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody with a good safety profile up to phase 2 that has been studied in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. GM-CSF is a multifunctional cytokine that is a growth factor for granulocytes and monocytes and has an important role in immune responses. In particular, it drives the activation, maturation, survival, and trafficking of monocyte-derived macrophages, and their polarisation towards a more inflammatory phenotype. Increased GM-CSF levels are closely associated with disease severity in COVID-19,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and GM-CSF-expressing T cells are clonally expanded in the lungs in severe disease.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Notably, GM-CSF might also enhance the procoagulant activities of macrophages,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and blood clots are a recognised side-effect of recombinant GM-CSF (sargramostim), which suggests that dysregulated GM-CSF expression might predispose to the microvascular thrombosis characteristic of COVID-19.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para120">Infliximab is a widely used anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody. TNF is an important proinflammatory cytokine and its inhibition has shown efficacy in many chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

                <p id="para170">Randomisation was performed by an automated minimisation procedure that attempted to allocate participants in a balanced manner between treatment groups available at the site, allowing for the sole stratification variable (care location within the hospital; ward or intensive care unit [ICU]) and with a 20% random component (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). At one site (Royal Bolton Hospital), infliximab was unavailable as an intervention. Patients were not masked to treatment allocation.

                <p id="para180">Participants assigned to namilumab received a single intravenous dose of 150 mg given over 1 h on day 1. Participants assigned to infliximab received a single intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg given over 2 h on day 1. Participants were followed-up for 28 days. Blood tests for the primary and secondary outcomes and safety were taken on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14, or until truncated by discharge or death. Physiological measures were collected until day 14, discharge, or death, and included the ratio of the oxygen saturation to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (SpO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub>). Most measures were taken daily, but the oxygen concentration measures were taken twice daily.</p>
                <p id="para190">The WHO clinical progression scale was assessed daily for 28 days, which provided a score on a scale of 1–10 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>), where 1 is asymptomatic, 4 is hospitalised without oxygen, 6 is hospitalised with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen, 7 is hospitalised with mechanical ventilation, and 10 is death; data for level 0 (no viral load detected) were not collected.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> If a patient was discharged earlier than day 28, this outcome was collected by means of a diary and scheduled telephone calls.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The primary outcome measure was CRP concentration, collected over time (on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 14 at a minimum) until day 14. Published data indicate that CRP concentrations and trajectory in COVID-19 pneumonia are strongly associated with clinical outcomes, including respiratory failure and death, as well as with lung changes observed on CT.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> As our objective was to have a rapid, biologically driven efficacy signal using continuous, readily available data and a small sample size, we had initially chosen SpO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio as the primary outcome. However, subsequent modelling of data from a large cohort of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the first wave indicated that the SpO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio might not be a viable outcome measure of sickness. This finding led to an early change in the primary outcome to CRP concentration, before any analysis of trial data, as previously described.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p id="para210">Clinical secondary outcomes were the WHO clinical progression scale as a principal clinical efficacy measure, as well as hospital survival status and hospital-free days, all assessed up to day 28. Hospital-free days were defined as the number of days between date of hospital discharge and day 28, with patients who died or who were alive and in hospital on day 28 being counted as having 0 hospital-free days. Other secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, proportion of patients discharged at day 28, and destination of discharge. Physiological outcomes measured up to day 14 or hospital discharge or death, if earlier, were the SpO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratios, and ferritin, d-dimers, and lactate dehydrogenase were also measured; these outcomes will be presented alongside exploratory biological outcomes in a future publication.</p>
                <p id="para220">Safety outcome measures were survival status and adverse events defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, which fulfilled one of the following criteria: grade 3 or worse, secondary infection, or allergic reaction. Data on harms were collected until day 28, utilising telephone follow-up if participants were discharged earlier, and were submitted on case report forms by site investigators. Attribution for serious adverse events was made by site investigators and reviewed by namilumab or infliximab group leads or the chief investigator. Given the known safety profile of infliximab, infection and allergic reaction were anticipated adverse events. Low neutrophil count was an anticipated adverse event with namilumab.</p>

Each intervention group was compared with the control group independently, including only control patients for whom that intervention was a randomisation option; ie, patients in the usual care group who were randomly assigned after the infliximab group closed or at the single study site where infliximab was not a randomisation option were not included in the infliximab comparison. For the primary endpoint of CRP concentration, Bayesian multilevel regression models<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> were used, allowing for nesting of the repeated measures data within patient and non-linear responses, implemented within Stan using the Bayesian regression models (brms) package.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Default priors as chosen by brms were utilised in all models and updated at any analysis point; these are chosen to be very weakly informative, the default covariance structure was implemented.

                <p id="para240">Posterior probabilities for the treatment–time interaction covariates were used to conduct decision making at interim analyses, specifically the probability that the covariate was less than 0, which indicates a positive treatment effect in the direction of the intervention as per the model formulation. The fitted models incorporated population-level effects for both the intercept and time, random effects for the intercept and time for patient, and fixed effects for age, care location (ward or ICU), a main treatment effect, a treatment–time interaction, a treatment–location interaction, and a higher-order time term.</p>

For consistency with other trials, time to a 2-point improvement for this outcome was also calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves were produced for time to improvement and the Greenwood method was utilised in calculating CIs.

No form of bias adjustment was applied.</p>
                <p id="para290">Success was defined as a 90% probability of an intervention treatment being better than usual care in reducing CRP concentration as per the posterior probability for the treatment–time interaction covariate, whereas futility was defined as a probability of less than 50%.

              <p id="para350">Between June 15, 2020, and Feb 18, 2021, 299 patients were screened for eligibility and 146 were enrolled and randomly assigned to usual care (n=54), namilumab (n=57), or infliximab (n=35; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>
). Data from the COVID-19 genomics UK consortium have shown that the main circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK within this time period were the original B lineage, the B.1.177 lineage, and the B.1.1.7 lineage (alpha variant). Following a data monitoring committee review on Jan 21, 2021, where recommendations on both groups were made on the basis of the primary outcome analysis, the trial steering committee advised to stop the infliximab group for futility (probability of benefit 21%) but to continue to recruit to usual care and namilumab, which met the criteria for success (probability of benefit 99%), to collect further secondary outcome clinical data. A subsequent data monitoring committee meeting on Feb 23, 2021, advised closing the remaining groups as the trial was close to maximal recruitment and recent changes to standard of care with routine use of tocilizumab would affect the conduct of the trial. In total, nine patients withdrew after randomisation but before receiving treatment and were not included in the analysis: five at their own or a relative's request (one in the namilumab group and four in the infliximab group), one at the request of the treating physician in the usual care group, one who was reassessed as not having COVID-19 in the infliximab group, one due to initial non-disclosure of information that met an exclusion criterion in the namilumab group, and one who was withdrawn before treatment when the data monitoring committee recommended to stop enrolment in the infliximab group.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>CRP=C-reactive protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
              <p id="para360">Overall, groups were evenly matched for baseline characteristics, although fewer patients in the infliximab group had remdesivir at enrolment than in the namilumab or usual care groups. Most participants had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>
). Overall, 53 (98%) of 54 patients in the usual care group, 55 (97%) of 57 in the namilumab group, and 33 (94%) of 35 in the infliximab group received oxygen at baseline. For the usual care and namilumab comparison, 16 (30%) of 54 in the usual care group and 21 (37%) of 57 in the namilumab group received high-flow nasal oxygen or continuous positive airway pressure, and 11 (20%) and 11 (19%), respectively, were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Almost all patients received dexamethasone as part of usual care at enrolment, and around half received remdesivir.

For the infliximab versus usual care comparison, all patients received dexamethasone, 26 (79%) of 33 in the usual care group and 16 (53%) of 30 in the infliximab group received remdesivir before or

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para450">Our trial showed that the addition of namilumab, but not infliximab, to usual care reduced inflammation as measured by CRP concentration in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, compared with usual care alone. The secondary clinical outcomes were consistent and shared the same directionality as the primary outcome for both interventions, despite not being formally powered to assess for such differences. Our proof-of-concept findings with GM-CSF inhibition are consistent with our hypothesis that recruitment and activation of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. These findings are also consistent with published findings from small, non-randomised trials,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and large, randomised trials of other GM-CSF inhibitors in COVID-19; otilimab showed a benefit for the primary endpoint of being alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28 in a predefined subgroup of patients aged 70 years or older.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Lenzilumab, given as a three-dose course in non-ventilated hospitalised patients, showed a benefit over standard care in the primary outcome of survival without ventilation, an effect that seemed more pronounced in patients aged 85 years or younger and with CRP concentration of less than 150 mg/L.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Our data suggest the effect of a single dose of namilumab on CRP concentration and WHO clinical progression score is independent of age, although this requires confirmation in larger studies. Although it is not possible to directly compare these studies given the differences in sample sizes, inclusion criteria, and study designs, the overall randomised controlled trial data suggest a benefit of GM-CSF inhibition in COVID-19. For example, we observed mortality in the namilumab group of 11% compared with 19% in the usual care alone group. In the lenzilumab and otilimab phase 3 trials, mortality was 10% in the intervention group versus 14% in the standard care group (day 28), and 23% versus 24% (day 60), respectively. In two phase 2 mavrilimumab trials, mortality was 8% in the intervention group versus 21% in the usual care group (day 29),<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and 5% versus 16% (day 28).<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Benefit has also been observed with IL-6 inhibition, with a meta-analysis showing a day 28 mortality of 22% in the intervention groups compared with 25% in the usual care or placebo groups.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para460">In the absence of large treatment effects, small trials using traditional clinical outcomes might give inconclusive or contrary findings in COVID-19, as exemplified by earlier studies of tocilizumab. The CATALYST trial was designed to use a repeatedly collected continuous measure of CRP concentration with a Bayesian adaptive approach that we predicted would require a smaller sample size to show evidence of efficacy or futility. CRP concentrations, including the rate of decline, have been associated with clinical outcome in COVID-19,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and we hypothesised that an immunomodulatory agent unable to alter CRP concentration would be a less promising candidate to take forward into phase 3 trials. With many options for repurposing immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19, we contend that such a prioritisation approach will make the most efficient use of phase 3 resources and accelerate development of effective treatments.</p>
              <p id="para470">By contrast with the observed effect of namilumab, we did not find a similar benefit on CRP concentration with infliximab, and the group was stopped for futility. TNF is an important proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages as well as other cell types, with context-dependent pleiotropic effects including further activation of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and upregulation of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6. A previous non-randomised study of infliximab suggested potential efficacy, albeit with substantial limitations including small sample size, use of historical controls, and being conducted before the routine use of corticosteroids.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This previous finding, together with circumstantial data, justified our inclusion of infliximab.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, although TNF inhibitors are widely used in inflammatory diseases, not all immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are responsive, and TNF itself might suppress specific proinflammatory factors that might be relevant to COVID-19, such as type 1 interferon expression and Th17 cell differentiation.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Inhibition of such cross-regulatory effects might underlie our negative findings, or simply indicate that TNF is not on an essential path to driving inflammatory responses as measured by CRP in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. GM-CSF inhibition might also have an additional benefit in retarding neutrophil recruitment and activation that could be of importance in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Our safety data suggest that the absence of an effect with infliximab is not due to an increase in secondary infections. We cannot exclude the possibility of benefit with infliximab being seen in a specific subgroup of patients, in larger studies, or with a dose higher than the standard dose we employed (although this dose was in large molar excess relative to published concentrations of circulating TNF in COVID-19). It should also be noted that remdesivir use at baseline was lower in the infliximab group than in the usual care group, although the negative SOLIDARITY trial for remdesivir suggests this difference might not have unduly influenced our results,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and results of our post-hoc sensitivity analyses were consistent. The clear divergence in primary outcome is broadly reflected in the secondary clinical findings and justifies the prioritisation of GM-CSF inhibition over TNF inhibition at this dose for further study in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para480">GM-CSF has an important role in the differentiation of alveolar macrophages, and consequently in surfactant clearance, as well as being an important survival factor for lung epithelial cells. Absence of GM-CSF signalling, through genetic defect in the receptor or very high levels of polyclonal autoantibodies to GM-CSF, has been associated with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). PAP has been an adverse event of special interest in previous clinical trials of GM-CSF inhibitors but, to our knowledge, has never been observed. It is important to note that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies will not completely inhibit GM-CSF signalling, which appears to be a requirement for PAP,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> but rather will downregulate excessive pathway activation; absence of GM-CSF does not prevent macrophage uptake of surfactant as much as its catabolism, therefore the effect of short-term inhibition is likely to be less pronounced on surfactant clearance when compared with long-term inhibition; and downregulation of monocyte activation, which is the aim of GM-CSF inhibition, should itself lead to a reduction in alveolar epithelial cell damage in COVID-19. However, it is also important to note an opposing view that administration of GM-CSF might have therapeutic benefits, and the results of clinical trials of inhaled and intravenous sargramostim are awaited.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para490">Our study has some limitations. Like many other trials in COVID-19, we did not use a placebo control. However, the discordant results of the two intervention groups compared with usual care alone, as well as the objective nature of CRP data, suggest this absence of a placebo does not explain the positive findings we observed with namilumab. Our sample size was too small for a definitive assessment of clinical outcomes and further studies are required for this, as well as to better understand the population that might benefit most. Our results might not generalise to hospitalised patients without evidence of pneumonia or raised CRP, or patients not requiring hospitalisation. Harms data are difficult to interpret given the small number of participants, absence of masking, the severity of the background illness, and that data were being collected during a pandemic. Overall, the number of total adverse events did not differ between namilumab and usual care groups. However, our data do highlight the need to monitor secondary infections in future COVID-19 trials, particularly given the use of combination immune-modulating treatments.</p>
              <p id="para500">Despite the advances of dexamethasone and tocilizumab in COVID-19, mortality among patients with severe disease remains high.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Therefore, considerable unmet medical need remains, and data pointing to the role of both inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and GM-CSF in severe COVID-19, together with our findings reported here, strongly suggest that targeted GM-CSF inhibitors such as namilumab should be further investigated in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.</p>
