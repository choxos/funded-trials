                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Typhoid conjugate vaccines are being introduced in low-income and middle-income countries to prevent typhoid illness in children. Vaccine effectiveness studies assess vaccine performance after introduction. The test-negative design is a commonly used method to estimate vaccine effectiveness that has not been applied to typhoid vaccines because of concerns over blood culture insensitivity. The overall aim of the study was to evaluate the appropriateness of using a test-negative design to assess typhoid Vi polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Vi-TT) effectiveness using a gold standard randomised controlled trial database.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Using blood culture data from a randomised controlled trial of Vi-TT in Malawi, we simulated a test-negative design to derive vaccine effectiveness estimates using three different approaches and compared these to randomised trial efficacy results. In the randomised trial, 27 882 children aged 9 months to 12 years were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single dose of Vi-TT or meningococcal capsular group A conjugate vaccine between Feb 21 and Sept 27, 2018, and were followed up for blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever until Sept 30, 2021.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>For all three test-negative design approaches, vaccine effectiveness estimates (test-negative design A, 80·3% [95% CI 66·2 to 88·5] <italic>vs</italic> test-negative design B, 80·5% [66·5 to 88·6] <italic>vs</italic> test-negative design C, 80·4% [66·9 to 88·4]) were almost identical to the randomised trial results (80·4% [95% CI 66·4 to 88·5]). Receipt of Vi-TT did not affect the risk of non-typhoid fever (vaccine efficacy against non-typhoid fever –0·4% [95% CI –4·9 to 3·9] <italic>vs</italic> –1% [–5·6 to 3·3] <italic>vs</italic> –2·5% [–6·4 to 1·3] for test-negative design A, test-negative design B, and test-negative design C, respectively).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This study validates the test-negative design core assumption for typhoid vaccine effectiveness estimation and shows the accuracy and precision of the estimates compared with the randomised controlled trial. These results show that the test-negative design is suitable for assessing typhoid conjugate vaccine effectiveness in post-introduction studies using blood culture surveillance.</p>

              <p id="para10">Typhoid fever, a systemic infection caused by <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<italic>S</italic> Typhi), is transmitted through contaminated food and water. In 2019, there were an estimated 9·24 million cases of typhoid fever globally and 110 000 deaths, with the greatest burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Increasing antimicrobial resistance, including the emergence of extensively drug resistant isolates, limits treatment options in many settings and has created an urgency to adopt effective preventive measures.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In 2017, WHO recommended routine use of typhoid conjugate vaccine in children aged 6 months and older in endemic settings.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Since then, excellent typhoid conjugate vaccine efficacy has been shown in randomised controlled trials in LMICs.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> With the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, typhoid conjugate vaccine has been introduced into routine immunisation programmes in Pakistan, Liberia, Zimbabwe, and Nepal, with more countries expected to introduce it soon.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In 2022, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization reviewed newly available data from surveillance studies, efficacy trials, and early country introductions and reaffirmed the typhoid conjugate vaccine recommendations.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Post-introduction vaccine evaluations are necessary to understand vaccine performance under real-world conditions and to provide information to sustain vaccination programmes and support decision making. Case-control studies offer an efficient approach to estimate vaccine effectiveness, because cases are identified based on disease status (ie, the outcome of interest), and sample size requirements tend to be smaller than for other study designs, especially for diseases with low prevalence.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> However, identification of appropriate controls can be challenging.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> For example, controls recruited from the community might be less likely to access health care when they are ill and less likely to be immunised, compared with cases recruited at health facilities. This confounding can lead to biased estimates of vaccine effectiveness. A design that reduces potential bias due to differential health-care-seeking behaviours is the test-negative design.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The test-negative design is a variation of the case-control study in which participants who present with illness are classified as cases or controls on the basis of diagnostic testing for the pathogen in question.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>

                  <p id="para50">As typhoid conjugate vaccines are introduced into national immunisation programmes, post-introduction monitoring of vaccine performance is important to understand how vaccines work under real-world conditions. The test-negative design has previously been efficiently used to evaluate post-introduction vaccine effectiveness for other vaccines. We aimed to validate the usefulness of the test-negative design for typhoid conjugate vaccines using a gold-standard randomised controlled trial database. We searched PubMed on Oct 17, 2022, with no date or language restrictions, using the terms (typhoid conjugate vaccine) AND (randomised controlled trial). Our search identified 47 papers, including four randomised controlled trials investigating typhoid conjugate vaccines, and no studies reporting the use of the randomised trials for test-negative design validation in relation to typhoid conjugate vaccines. We did a second search of PubMed on Oct 17, 2022, with no date or language restrictions, using the terms (typhoid conjugate vaccine) AND (case control study or test negative design). This second search identified 20 papers, and did not find any studies reporting the use of the randomised trials for test-negative design validation in relation to typhoid conjugate vaccines.</p>

                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, this is the first study to rigorously evaluate the use of a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness. This study validated the test-negative design core assumption that typhoid conjugate vaccine has no effect on febrile illnesses that are not caused by typhoid. Furthermore, this study showed the accuracy and precision of vaccine effectiveness estimates derived using the test-negative design compared with gold-standard randomised controlled trial vaccine efficacy results in a Malawian paediatric population. Importantly, the effect of blood culture sensitivity was minimal for vaccine effectiveness estimation accuracy, especially when typhoid-positive cultures comprised fewer than 10% of all blood cultures.</p>

                  <p id="para90">The effectiveness of new vaccines should be evaluated after their introduction by use of the most rigorous approach possible. In the absence of randomised trials, epidemiological designs can be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness. Our study provides evidence to support the use of the test-negative design to measure post-introduction vaccine effectiveness of typhoid conjugate vaccines in Malawi and other similar settings. This efficient method to evaluate the performance of newly introduced typhoid conjugate vaccines could be a potential tool to generate crucial evidence for the continued support of existing vaccination programmes and to support decisions on whether to introduce typhoid conjugate vaccines in other countries. As in all observational study designs, the test-negative design remains susceptible to selection bias, confounding, and misclassification of vaccine and outcome status. The test-negative design should be considered only when a case-control study design is appropriate.</p>

                <p id="para130">Briefly, in the randomised trial per-protocol sample, 27 882 Malawian children in Blantyre aged 9 months to 12 years were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single dose of Vi-TT or meningococcal capsular group A conjugate vaccine (MenA) from Feb 21 to Sept 27, 2018. Participants (13 945 in the Vi-TT group and 13 937 in the MenA group; median age at vaccination 6 years; 14 198 [51%] of 27 882 participants were female) were followed up for blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever with passive surveillance. Participants who presented with febrile illness at outpatient health centres and tertiary facilities in two urban townships (Ndirande and Zingwangwa) in Blantyre, Malawi had a blood culture sample collected if they met one of the following protocol-defined specimen collection criteria: subjective fever for at least 72 h, measured fever of at least 38°C, or hospitalisation with history of fever of any duration. Blood culture results were classified as follows: positive for typhoid, negative for typhoid but positive for a non-typhoid pathogen, or negative for any pathogen or positive for contaminants. All facilities within the study area with blood culture capacity were included in the randomised trial. Vaccine efficacy results for participants followed up until April 3, 2020 (ie, 18–24 months after vaccination), have been reported previously.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> This evaluation used efficacy data from participants followed up until Sept 30, 2021. The test-negative design sample included all participants in the randomised trial who had a blood culture sample collected at least 14 days after vaccination with a reported blood culture result. Blood cultures that grew <italic>S</italic> Typhi were classified as test-positive. Negative blood cultures, and those that grew a non-typhoid pathogen or a contaminant, were considered test-negative.</p>
                <p id="para140">In the test-negative design, only participants with at least one blood culture specimen collected were considered for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. Because some participants had more than one episode with a blood culture specimen collected, three test-negative design samples were selected, corresponding to three different analysis approaches to estimate the vaccine effectiveness, as described previously, as follows: participant-based analysis sample without censoring for typhoid (test-negative design A); participant-based analysis sample with censoring for typhoid (test-negative design B); and specimen-based analysis sample (test-negative design C).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Both test-negative design A and test-negative design B are participant-based analysis samples where cases were participants who had ever had a typhoid-positive blood culture test during the study period.

In test-negative design B, controls included only participants with an episode of non-typhoid illness, who never had a positive test for typhoid at any time during the study period. In test-negative design C, the units of analysis were specimens rather than individuals, and cases were typhoid-positive specimens and controls were typhoid-negative specimens.</p>

                <p id="para150">In the randomised controlled trial per-protocol analysis, vaccine efficacy against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever up to Sept 30, 2021, was calculated as (1 – incidence rate ratio [IRR]) × 100%, where IRR is the ratio of the incidence rate in the Vi-TT group to that in the MenA group, as described in the study protocol and the published 18–24-month analysis.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In a sensitivity analysis, vaccine efficacy was also calculated as (1– relative risk [RR]) × 100%, where RR is the relative risk of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever in the Vi-TT group compared with the MenA group.</p>
                <p id="para160">In each of the three test-negative design samples, vaccine effectiveness against typhoid fever was calculated as (1 – odds ratio [OR]) × 100%, where OR is the relative odds of Vi-TT vaccination in cases compared with controls. The Woolf approximation method was used to compute 95% CIs for the ORs. All randomised trial participants were used to test the core assumption of the test-negative design, that Vi-TT has no effect on non-typhoid fever. Vaccine efficacy against non-typhoid illness was calculated as (1 – RR) × 100%, where RR is the relative risk of participants or specimens testing negative for typhoid in the Vi-TT group compared with the MenA group. Three methods were used (participant-based with or without censoring and specimen-based analysis).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The exact method was used to compute 95% CIs for the RRs. All vaccine effectiveness analyses described against typhoid and non-typhoid fever were repeated for each of the following prespecified subgroups: age (&lt;5 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥5 years), sex (male <italic>vs</italic> female), and study site.</p>
                <p id="para170">Instead of using all available controls, a matched test-negative design was simulated to examine the effect of matching key study variables on vaccine efficacy estimates. A matched test-negative design is preferable because it improves the comparability between cases and controls and requires data collection on fewer individuals. Mahalanobis multivariate-distance nearest-neighbour matching without replacement was used to match each typhoid-positive specimen with three typhoid-negative specimens (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 1–2</xref>). Cases and controls were matched exactly on age categories (&lt;2 years <italic>vs</italic> 2 years to &lt;5 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥5 years) and study site. To reduce potential bias due to typhoid seasonality, blood culture dates were matched within 20 days for each case-control pair (295 [97%] of 303 specimens were matched within 7 days). Vaccine effectiveness against typhoid fever was calculated as (1 – OR) × 100%, where OR was estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression to account for the potential correlations among matched cases and controls introduced by the study design.</p>
                <p id="para180">To examine the effect of vaccine misclassification on test-negative design vaccine effectiveness estimation, we assumed that poor vaccination records affected both cases and controls equally.

Various blood culture positivity rates (ie, the proportion of blood culture specimens that were typhoid-positive) were also used to examine the effect of typhoid prevalence on vaccine effectiveness estimation using a test-negative design (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>).</p>

However, when the overall misclassification rate was 10% or higher, the lowest possible vaccine effectiveness and the highest possible vaccine effectiveness were significantly different from the gold standard vaccine effectiveness estimate, suggesting the estimates under these scenarios were no longer reliable or consistent given the accurate vaccination status (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Effect of overall vaccine misclassification rate (p<sub>1</sub> + p<sub>2</sub>) on vaccine effectiveness estimation by test-negative design specimen-based analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>Cases vaccinated by Vi-TT</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Controls vaccinated by Vi-TT</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>VE against typhoid</bold><xref rid="tbl3fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref><bold>(95% CI)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">0% vaccine misclassification—gold standard</td><td align="left">17/101 (16·8%)</td><td align="left">4092/8060 (50·8%)</td><td align="left">80·4% (66·9 to 88·4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">5% vaccine misclassification</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Misclassifying vaccinated as unvaccinated, both groups<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td><td align="left">12/101 (11·9%)</td><td align="left">3689/8060 (45·8%)</td><td align="left">84·0% (70·8 to 91·3)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, lowest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn3" ref-type="table-fn">‡</xref></td><td align="left">22/101 (21·8%)</td><td align="left">3689/8060 (45·8%)</td><td align="left">67·0% (47·0 to 79·5)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, highest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn4" ref-type="table-fn">§</xref></td><td align="left">12/101 (11·9%)</td><td align="left">4495/8060 (55·8%)</td><td align="left">89·3% (80·4 to 94·2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">10% vaccine misclassification</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Misclassifying vaccinated as unvaccinated, both groups<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td><td align="left">7/101 (6·9%)</td><td align="left">3286/8060 (40·8%)</td><td align="left">89·2% (76·7 to 95·0)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, lowest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn3" ref-type="table-fn">‡</xref></td><td align="left">27/101 (26·7%)</td><td align="left">3286/8060 (40·8%)</td><td align="left">47·0% (17·5 to 66·0)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, highest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn4" ref-type="table-fn">§</xref></td><td align="left">7/101 (6·9%)</td><td align="left">4898/8060 (60·8%)</td><td align="left">95·2% (89·6 to 97·8)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">15% vaccine misclassification</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Misclassifying vaccinated as unvaccinated, both groups<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td><td align="left">2/101 (2·0%)</td><td align="left">2883/8060 (35·8%)</td><td align="left">96·4% (85·3 to 99·1)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, lowest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn3" ref-type="table-fn">‡</xref></td><td align="left">32/101 (31·7%)</td><td align="left">2883/8060 (35·8%)</td><td align="left">16·9% (−27·0 to 45·4)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, highest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn4" ref-type="table-fn">§</xref></td><td align="left">2/101 (2·0%)</td><td align="left">5301/8060 (65·8%)</td><td align="left">98·9% (95·7 to 99·7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">20% vaccine misclassification</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Misclassifying vaccinated as unvaccinated, both groups<xref rid="tbl3fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">2480/8060 (30·8%)</td><td align="left">100% (91·4 to 100)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, lowest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn3" ref-type="table-fn">‡</xref></td><td align="left">37/101 (36·6%)</td><td align="left">2480/8060 (30·8%)</td><td align="left">−30·1% (−95·5 to 13·5)</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Differential misclassification, highest possible VE<xref rid="tbl3fn4" ref-type="table-fn">§</xref></td><td align="left">0</td><td align="left">5704/8060 (70·8%)</td><td align="left">100% (98·4 to 100%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are n/N (%), unless otherwise indicated.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para290">In a paediatric population in Malawi, estimates of Vi-TT effectiveness against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever derived by the simulated test-negative design were almost identical to the gold standard randomised controlled trial vaccine efficacy results. Vi-TT had no effect on non-typhoid fever, further validating a core assumption of the test-negative design. In subgroup analyses by age, sex, and study site, the results remained highly consistent with the randomised trial vaccine efficacy estimates, and Vi-TT similarly had no effect on non-typhoid fever. Further evidence of test-negative design accuracy was shown in a simulated 1:3 case-control matched test-negative design analysis, which produced almost identical results to test-negative design analyses that used all controls, and to the original randomised trial. The finding that case-control matching made little difference to efficacy estimates is consistent with work by Dean and colleagues.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Our results support use of a matched test-negative design study as a suitable method to estimate typhoid conjugate vaccine effectiveness in preventing blood culture-confirmed <italic>S</italic> Typhi as these vaccines are introduced in low-resource settings.</p>
              <p id="para300">Although the test-negative design offers strong advantages and is commonly used to measure the effectiveness of influenza, rotavirus, COVID-19, and other vaccines,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> this study design remains susceptible to the biases present in all observational studies. These biases include selection bias, confounding, and misclassification of vaccine and outcome status. A concern specific to the test-negative design is that because cases and test-negative controls are selected among only those who present to health facilities with illness, there is a potential for the study sample to misrepresent the broader population.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> This concern could be mitigated when the outcome is severe illness that is more likely to result in care-seeking. Knowledge of the care-seeking behaviours of the population of interest is important when interpreting vaccine effectiveness estimates derived by the test-negative design and when considering the appropriateness of this design for a specific setting. A strength of our study is the use of data from a randomised controlled trial of Vi-TT in Malawi.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Unlike many clinical trials that restrict eligibility for enrolment and hence might not be representative of the broader population, this randomised trial had few exclusion criteria and was designed to characterise the general population of Malawian children aged 9 months to 12 years in the Blantyre area.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Additionally, although the test-negative design sample was significantly younger and more likely to be enrolled from the Zingwangwa site than the non-test-negative design sample, the accuracy and precision of the vaccine effectiveness estimates were nearly identical to the classic randomised trial vaccine efficacy results. Therefore, the issues of both observable and unobservable confounding were less of a concern in this study.</p>
              <p id="para310">Outcome misclassification due to imperfect accuracy of the diagnostic test has been identified as a concern for the test-negative design, with low test specificity posing a greater threat to validity than low test sensitivity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although blood cultures are highly specific, the diagnostic sensitivity of blood culture for <italic>S</italic> Typhi is estimated to be 50–75% across various settings and might be reduced by suboptimal blood volumes and previous antimicrobial use.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> In our sensitivity analyses, the effect of blood culture sensitivity was trivial for vaccine effectiveness estimation accuracy (ie, point estimation), when <italic>S</italic> Typhi-positive cultures comprised less than 10% of all blood cultures. In scenarios where <italic>S</italic> Typhi-positive cultures made up 10% or more of all blood cultures, vaccine effectiveness was underestimated if no adjustments were made for low blood culture sensitivity. In a multisite surveillance study done between November, 2016, and December, 2018, the proportion of <italic>S</italic> Typhi-positive blood cultures ranged from 3% in Malawi to 6% in Nepal and Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In these settings, our results indicate that vaccine effectiveness estimation by test-negative design would remain accurate. However, during an outbreak in Pakistan, 775 (31%) of 2469 blood culture specimens collected from children in a cohort study grew <italic>S</italic> Typhi.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In this scenario, the test-negative design might not be an appropriate choice for vaccine effectiveness estimation and was not the method used in the study in Pakistan. Additionally, blood culture sensitivity significantly affected the precision of vaccine effectiveness estimation (ie, the width of the 95% CIs). Therefore, more participants are required to achieve the same power due to false negatives (ie, cases misclassified as controls) and larger variance. A limitation of our study is that the results were based on the fixed blood culture sensitivity assumption. However, blood culture sensitivity might vary with time since infection or other factors, such as blood collection volume or previous antibiotic use. Additional data and methodologies are needed to adjust for time-dependent and subject-dependent blood culture sensitivity.</p>
              <p id="para320">Unlike randomised trials, in which vaccination history is known for each participant, misclassification of vaccination status is a concern for any observational study design, especially in settings where vaccine records are not electronic or centralised. In our sensitivity analysis, if the overall misclassification of vaccination status was 10% or higher, the vaccine effectiveness estimate was no longer reliable; this confirms that the accuracy of vaccination status is crucial in a test-negative design and supports efforts to improve the recording and retention of vaccination data at the individual level, in national programmes and campaigns. The greatest bias occurred in the scenario in which the direction of misclassification differed by case or control status. The smallest vaccine effectiveness estimates were observed when unvaccinated cases were misclassified as vaccinated, and vaccinated controls were misclassified as unvaccinated. Conversely, the largest vaccine effectiveness estimates occurred when vaccinated cases were misclassified as unvaccinated and unvaccinated controls were misclassified as vaccinated. An advantage with the test-negative design compared with other observational studies is that vaccination status is ascertained at the same timepoint (when health care is sought) for both cases and controls, ideally before their test status is known. This strategy reduces the potential for differential misclassification compared with a design in which cases and controls are recruited from separate locations with differential access to vaccination records.</p>
              <p id="para330">Randomised controlled trials have previously been used to evaluate the test-negative design for influenza vaccines, rotavirus, and enterovirus-71 vaccines, and for respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We did not identify any published evaluations of the test-negative design for typhoid vaccines in endemic countries, although one study used a modified test-negative design to evaluate effectiveness of a Vi<italic>-</italic>polysaccharide vaccine in travellers. In that study, participants with blood cultures positive for <italic>S enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi were used as controls and the core assumption of the test-negative design was not examined.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Our analyses support that Vi-TT has no effect on non-typhoid fever and show that the test-negative design is a robust method to efficiently estimate vaccine effectiveness in settings where 10% or fewer blood culture specimens are positive for <italic>S</italic> Typhi, and where vaccination status can be reliably ascertained. These are important findings as more LMICs prepare to introduce typhoid conjugate vaccine, and as new typhoid conjugate vaccines for which efficacy estimates from randomised trials are not available become approved for use. Furthermore, vaccine effectiveness estimated by the test-negative design can be used to build upon randomised trial-established vaccine efficacy estimates by measuring longer-term effectiveness of the recommended single-dose typhoid conjugate vaccine over time, as current trials were limited to a maximum of 4 years of follow-up.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Strategies to accurately document past vaccination exposure are particularly crucial as the time interval between vaccination and outcome ascertainment increases.</p>
              <p id="para340">In conclusion, post-introduction vaccine evaluations are a crucial component of programme monitoring. Such evaluations can affect other countries’ decisions to introduce vaccines and can play a part in maintaining continued support in the countries of introduction. The test-negative design expands the options for post-introduction typhoid conjugate vaccine evaluation and is well-suited for low-income settings due to its efficiency, convenience, and low cost. To our knowledge, this study is the first to rigorously evaluate the utility of the test-negative design to estimate typhoid conjugate vaccine effectiveness using a large randomised trial in Malawian children. Future evaluations of the test-negative design with different typhoid conjugate vaccines, vaccination coverage rates, or follow-up periods in different countries are needed to confirm the study findings in different populations and settings.</p>
