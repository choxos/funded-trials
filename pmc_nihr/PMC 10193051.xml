                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Brain injury is common following open heart valve surgery. Carbon dioxide insufflation (CDI) has been proposed to reduce the incidence of brain injury by reducing the number of air microemboli entering the bloodstream in surgery. The CO2 Study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of CDI in patients undergoing planned left-sided open heart valve surgery.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The CO2 Study is a multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial. Seven-hundred and four patients aged 50 years and over undergoing planned left-sided heart valve surgery will be recruited to the study, from at least eight UK National Health Service hospitals, and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive CDI or medical air insufflation (placebo) in addition to standard de-airing. Insufflation will be delivered at a flow rate of 5 L/min from before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass until 10 min after cardiopulmonary bypass weaning. Participants will be followed up until 3 months post-surgery. The primary outcome is acute ischaemic brain injury within 10 days post-surgery based on new brain lesions identified with diffusion-weighted MRI or clinical evidence of permanent brain injury according to the current definition of stroke.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study was approved by the East Midlands–Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee in June 2020 and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in May 2020. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to undertaking any study assessments. Consent will be obtained by the principal investigator or a delegated member of the research team who has been trained in the study and undergone Good Clinical Practice training. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international meetings. Study participants will be informed of results through study notifications and patient organisations.</p>

              <p>Around 12 000 people undergo open heart surgery to repair or replace a heart valve every year in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Brain injury or dysfunction following open heart surgery is common, with severity varying from mild confusion and memory problems<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> to perioperative stroke.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although the risk of major stroke in major cardiac surgery is 1%–2%,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the rate of so-called ‘silent’ neurological dysfunction identified on MRI is up to 50%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Neurological complications are associated with longer hospital stays, slower recovery, poor quality of life, increased hospital resource use and reduced long-term survival.</p>
              <p>One of the major causes of brain injury and dysfunction at the time of cardiac surgery is thought to be microemboli travelling to the brain causing ischaemia and infarction. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound has demonstrated around 80% of these emboli are air.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The putative mechanism is that air bubbles enter the blood during opening of the heart chambers.</p>
              <p>Carbon dioxide insufflation (CDI) into the surgical field before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may reduce the formation of air microemboli.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Carbon dioxide is more dense than air and therefore, displaces air from the wound. It is also more water soluble than air leading to fewer microemboli entering the blood, and those that form will be of shorter duration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>A meta-analysis of eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that CDI during open heart valve surgery was associated with fewer air microemboli in the heart when the cross-clamp was removed. However, no significant influence on the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive decline was identified.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The findings of this meta-analysis are limited due to the small number of RCTs included, the timing and selection of postoperative psychometric tests, and the method of CDI delivery used in the RCTs. Therefore, a well-designed RCT to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CDI during open heart valve surgery is required.</p>
              <p>Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW MRI) is regarded as the ‘gold standard’ for identifying perioperative brain injury in RCTs of neuroprotective interventions in cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 10–12</xref> Unlike conventional MRI and CT imaging, DW MRI can detect very small lesions within minutes of occurring that are not seen with other imaging modalities. It has been reported that DW MRI lesions are present in around 50% of patients following heart valve surgery.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> However, only around 9% of patients with such lesions displayed any clinical signs of brain dysfunction or injury.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The clinical impact of these brain lesions in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is currently unclear, and neurocognitive and functional assessments are necessary to evaluate CDI effectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 11</xref></p>
              <p>There is no robust evidence to suggest CDI reduces brain injury. A short survey of all cardiothoracic units in the UK, for this funding application, found clinical equipoise for using the intervention because of this lack of evidence.</p>
              <p>The CO2 Study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CDI in patients undergoing planned left-sided open heart valve surgery. It also aims to characterise the mechanism of brain injury after open heart valve surgery.</p>

                <p>The CO2 Study is a multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled RCT. Seven-hundred and four participants will be recruited to the study, from at least eight UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, by their clinical care teams, and will provide written informed consent before undertaking any study procedures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>An internal pilot phase will determine the feasibility of recruitment and adherence to the protocol and will be reviewed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and funder (National Institute for Health and Care Research Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) 17/145/40) after 6 months of recruitment. Progression from the pilot phase will be determined if at least 69 participants are recruited in the first 6 months of recruitment, or a feasible plan to satisfy any recruitment shortfall is in place.</p>
                <p>In addition to the internal pilot, the TSC will review the following outcomes throughout the study and may recommend early termination if, in a number of participants, there is:</p>

                <p>Patients eligible for the study are those aged 50 years or over and undergoing planned left-sided valve (aortic or mitral) surgical repair or replacement (with or without another procedure, for example, coronary artery bypass graft) via a partial or full sternotomy or thoracotomy using central (ie, aortic) or peripheral (ie, femoral) perfusion cannulae.</p>
                <p>Patients will be ineligible if they have any of the following: contraindication to medical carbon dioxide; acquired or genetic acidosis; contraindication to MRI; history of clinical stroke within 3 months prior to randomisation; cardiac catheterisation within 3 days of the planned surgery; cerebral and/or aortic arch arteriography or interventions within 3 days of the planned surgery; active endocarditis at time of randomisation; planned concomitant aortic procedure such as root replacement; clinical signs of cardiogenic shock or treatment with intravenous inotropic therapy prior to randomisation; previous cardiac surgery or participation in an interventional (drug or device) trial; unable to provide written informed consent or are a prisoner.</p>
                <p>Participants have the right to withdraw at any time. If they withdraw, data collected up until the time of withdrawal will be included in the analyses.

                <p>Eligibility will be confirmed by the principal investigator, delegated medically qualified doctor or advanced nurse practitioner at the research site. Participants will be randomised as close to surgery as possible, to receive either medical CDI (Investigational Medicinal Product, IMP) or medical air insufflation (placebo) in a 1:1 ratio, following written informed consent and completion of baseline assessments. Randomisation will be performed using a secure internet-based randomisation system ensuring allocation concealment by a member of the research team not involved in data collection or participant follow-up (eg, the perfusionist). Allocation will be stratified by centre, type of surgery (valve or valve and another procedure, ie, coronary artery bypass graft), and if the planned surgery is minimally invasive or not.</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p>The perfusionist will be unblinded to the treatment allocation in order to deliver the intervention and monitor the participant throughout surgery. An unblinded member of the research team may also be used to carry out randomisation if the perfusionist is unable to do so. They will provide the perfusionist with the paper case report form (CRF) stating the allocated intervention assigned at randomisation, in a sealed envelope. The perfusionist will complete details of the insufflation delivery, CPB and any evidence of hypercapnia (increased carbon dioxide in the bloodstream) on the CRF and return it to the unblinded member of the research team, who will be responsible for entering the data and addressing any queries on the database. The completed CRF will be stored in a folder separate from the rest of the CRFs to ensure blinding of the rest of the team is maintained.</p>
                <p>Cylinders of medical carbon dioxide and medical air are both grey in colour and can be purchased in the same size. Only the collar of the cylinders differs in colour. Cylinders of the allocated intervention will be brought into the operating theatre covered with surgical drapes to ensure blinding of the surgical team. There are no obvious external clinical cues as to which intervention is being used. The mode of delivery has been standardised for both interventions.</p>
                <p>Blinding of the research nurse responsible for data collection and the imaging reviewer will be assessed using the Bang Blinding Index.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>

                <title>Unblinding</title>
                <p>Participants will be made aware before entering the study that they will not be told which intervention they receive until after the study has finished. Requests to unblind during surgery on clinical grounds (eg, treating a complication) are not anticipated. However, if unblinding is requested, this will be facilitated by the perfusionist. Requests to unblind after leaving the operating theatre should not occur given the effect of insufflation is limited to the period of delivery. Therefore, management of subsequent clinical events would not be altered by knowledge of the allocation. All incidences of unblinding will be fully documented on the CRF including the person requesting the unblinding and the reason, and will be monitored by the Trial Management Group (TMG).</p>

                <title>Trial intervention</title>
                <p>Both the study IMP and placebo are licensed and commercially available in the UK. In this trial, medical carbon dioxide (IMP) and medical air (placebo) will be used ‘off label’. Cylinders will be labelled by the trial’s pharmacist with Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)-approved Annex 13-compliant labels in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and local pharmacy standard operating procedures.</p>
                <p>The allocated intervention will be insufflated into the cardiotomy wound at a flow rate of 5 L/min through a gas diffuser that provides an almost 100% atmosphere of the allocated gas in the cardiotomy wound. Insufflation will start before cannulation for CPB and continue until 10 min after discontinuation of CPB. Cardiotomy suction will be limited to a maximum of 1.5 L/min and the additional suction set to 10 L/min to avoid affecting gas concentrations in the surgical field.</p>
                <p>Withdrawals during treatment should not occur due to the nature and duration of the intervention; the duration of intervention is from before cannulation for CPB, until 10 min after CPB has stopped. Problems with adherence (eg, failure to follow the randomisation allocation) are also expected to be low. The perfusionist will document whether the allocated treatment was given, if there were any deviations from the allocated intervention and the reason. Deviations will be monitored by the TMG and Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC).</p>

                <title>Changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
                <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic affected the start of the study and posed serious logistical issues. Significant delays were experienced starting recruitment due to COVID-19, which led to the redeployment of local research teams to clinical areas, prioritisation of COVID-19 research and the reduction in elective cardiac surgery. Initially, due to start in June 2020, recruitment opened on 6 October 2021, 17 months behind target. Capacity issues within local research teams and MRI departments have limited the number of sites we have been able to open. To mitigate the slow start, more sites have been approached to take part in the study. The study was also adapted to introduce remote consent, allowing more time for in-person baseline assessments to be completed prior to surgery, and remote follow-up, to reduce research-specific hospital visits, and it is intended that these changes remain in place for the remainder of the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The CO2 Study is the largest RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of CDI in patients undergoing open heart valve surgery. With the addition of the mechanistic substudy, it will determine the relationship between intraoperative air microemboli and ischaemic brain injury detected on DW MRI.</p>
              <p>The study was designed to complement the surgical pathway to ensure participants did not have to attend additional research-specific visits. Changes to the pathway due to COVID-19 replaced the only in-person trial specific visit at 3 months with a remote call, which allows flexibility in the time and location where the call can be carried out making it easier for participants to attend. Inclusion of patients aged over 50 years and undergoing open heart valve surgery, by any access, allows a large population of participants to be included in the study.</p>
              <p>The large battery of assessments to assess the neurocognitive and functional ability of participants has the potential to deter patients from taking part in the study or result in missing data. Originally, 12 assessments, taking 2 hours to complete, were proposed. Following concerns from research nurses, this was reduced to five, taking 1 hour to complete, while maintaining the same number of domains assessed. This ensured assessments would be less of a barrier to recruitment. We further updated the protocol in December 2022 to remove the NIHSS and CAM from the 3-month follow-up as they offered little value at this time point. Stroke would be detected via the NIHSS at 3 days post-surgery and delirium only occurs up to 7 days post-surgery, following which persisting symptoms would be considered ‘postoperative cognitive dysfunction’, which would be identified using the ACEIII and oTMT at 3 months. This further streamlined the study and reduced the research burden at this time point for both sites and participants.</p>
              <p>By assessing the neuroprotective effect of CDI, we aim to provide an answer to a question for which there is surgical clinical equipoise. More importantly, with more elderly and high-risk patients being offered cardiac surgery, it is critical to identify ways to reduce the impact of heart valve surgery-related neurological complications, that is, longer hospital stays, slower recovery, poor quality of life, increased healthcare use and reduced long-term survival.</p>
              <p>The study was designed to complement the surgical pathway, completing the primary outcome while the participant is still in hospital post-surgery, making it feasible for local research teams to conduct and less burdensome for the participant.</p>
