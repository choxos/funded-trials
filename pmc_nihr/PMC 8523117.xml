                  <p>Colchicine has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 based on its anti-inflammatory actions. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this streamlined, randomised, controlled, open-label trial, underway at 177 hospitals in the UK, two hospitals in Indonesia, and two hospitals in Nepal, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were admitted to hospital with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had no medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to participate in the trial. Eligible and consenting adults were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual standard of care plus colchicine (colchicine group) using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment. Participants received colchicine 1 mg after randomisation followed by 500 μg 12 h later and then 500 μg twice a day by mouth or nasogastric tube for 10 days in total or until discharge. Dose frequency was halved for patients receiving a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, diltiazem), patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min per 1·73m<sup>2</sup>, and those with an estimated bodyweight of less than 70 kg. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, secondary endpoints included time to discharge, the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days, and, in patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, a composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. All analyses were by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04381936" id="interrefs20">NCT04381936</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 27, 2020, and March 4, 2021, 11 340 (58%) of 19 423 patients enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were eligible to receive colchicine; 5610 (49%) patients were randomly assigned to the colchicine group and 5730 (51%) to the usual care group. Overall, 1173 (21%) patients in the colchicine group and 1190 (21%) patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·93 to 1·10]; p=0·77). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. Median time to discharge alive (10 days [IQR 5 to &gt;28]) was the same in both groups, and there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (3901 [70%] patients in the colchicine group and 4032 [70%] usual care group; rate ratio 0·98 [95% CI 0·94 to 1·03]; p=0·44). In those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1344 [25%] in the colchicine group <italic>vs</italic> 1343 [25%] patients in the usual care group; risk ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·96 to 1·09]; p=0·47).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In adults hospitalised with COVID-19, colchicine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death.</p>

              <p id="para10">Inflammation is a key feature of severe COVID-19. Markedly raised concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and other cytokines, are observed in severe cases and are associated with poor outcomes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Inflammation is particularly prominent in the lung and vascular endothelium, and is commonly associated with extensive alveolar damage and thrombosis of large and small pulmonary vessels.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors have both been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19; Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors accelerate improvement in clinical status.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Together these results show that inflammation is modifiable and anti-inflammatory regimens can improve clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="para20">Inflammasomes are a key part of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These cytosolic pattern recognition receptor systems are activated in response to detection of pathogens in the cytosol and stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In COVID-19, the degree of inflammasome activation, particularly the nucleotide binding domain (NOD)-like pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, correlates with disease severity.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Colchicine, a readily available, safe, and inexpensive drug, has a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects, including inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In addition to its role in treating acute gout and pericarditis, evidence is emerging that colchicine might inhibit endovascular inflammation and provide clinical benefits in patients with coronary artery disease.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Given the activation of NLRP3 in COVID-19 and the presence of vascular endothelial inflammation, colchicine has been proposed as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 associated inflammatory disease. However, only three small randomised trials have assessed the effects of colchicine in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a total of only seven deaths across these studies combined; none of the studies were adequately powered to identify any effect of the drug on mortality.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Here we report the results of a large randomised controlled trial that aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>

                  <p id="para50">We searched medRxiv, bioRxiv, Medline, Embase, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from Sept 1, 2019, to April 1, 2021, for clinical trials evaluating the effect of colchicine treatment in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, using the search terms (“SARS-CoV-2.mp” OR “COVID.mp” OR “COVID-19.mp” OR “2019-nCoV.mp” OR “Coronavirus.mp” OR “Coronavirinae/”) AND (“colchicine.mp” OR “colchicine/”), using validated filters to select for randomised controlled trials. No language restrictions were applied.</p>
                  <p id="para60">We identified three relevant randomised trials that compared colchicine with usual care or placebo in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 (two at low risk of bias and one with some concerns because of limited information on randomisation process and poor clarity regarding the blinding in the study). Each trial suggested a potential favourable effect of colchicine on outcome measures of clinical improvement or duration of hospitalisation. The three trials combined included a total of 285 patients and seven deaths; even combined, these trials were not adequately powered to detect an effect on mortality.</p>

                  <p id="para80">The RECOVERY trial is the first large, randomised trial to report results of the effect of colchicine in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We found no significant effect of colchicine compared with usual care alone on 28-day mortality, the probability of discharge alive within 28 days, or the probability of progressing to the composite outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients who were not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation. We saw no evidence of benefit of colchicine in any patient subgroup.</p>

The trial is underway at 177 hospitals in the UK, two hospitals in Indonesia, and two hospitals in Nepal (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 3–25</xref>). The trial is supported by the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network, and is coordinated by the Nuffield Department of Population Health (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK), the trial sponsor. The trial was done in accordance with the principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (20/EE/0101). The protocol, statistical analysis plan, and additional information are available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.recoverytrial.net" id="interrefs30">online</ext-link>.</p>
                <p id="para120">Patients admitted to hospital were eligible for the study if they had clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical history that might, in the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to participate in the trial. Children and pregnant women were not eligible to receive colchicine. Patients with severe liver impairment, significant cytopaenia, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 (eg, clarithromycin, erythromycin, systemic azole antifungal, and HIV protease inhibitor) or P-glycoprotein inhibitors (eg, ciclosporin, verapamil, and quinidine), or hypersensitivity to lactose were excluded from the colchicine comparison (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 81</xref>). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or a legal representative if patients were too unwell or unable to provide consent.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para130">Baseline data were collected using a web-based case report form that included demographics, level of respiratory support, major comorbidities, suitability of the study treatment for a particular patient, and treatment availability at the study site (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 32–34</xref>). Eligible and consenting, non-pregnant adult patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either usual standard of care (usual care group) or usual standard of care plus colchicine (colchicine group), or one of the other available RECOVERY treatment groups, using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealed until after randomisation (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 30–31</xref>). For some patients, colchicine was unavailable at the hospital at the time of enrolment or was considered by the managing physician to be either definitely indicated or definitely contraindicated. These patients were excluded from the randomised comparison between colchicine and usual care. Patients received colchicine 1 mg after randomisation followed by 500 μg 12 h later and then 500 μg twice a day orally or by nasogastric tube for 10 days in total or until discharge, whichever occurred first. Dose frequency was halved for patients receiving a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg, diltiazem), those who had renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min per 1·73 m<sup>2</sup>), and patients with an estimated bodyweight of less than 70 kg (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 81</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para140">As a platform trial, and in a factorial design, patients could be simultaneously randomly assigned to other treatment groups: 1) convalescent plasma versus casirivimab and imdevimab versus usual care, 2) aspirin versus usual care, and 3) baricitinib versus usual care (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 31</xref>). Until Jan 24, 2021, the trial also allowed a subsequent randomisation for patients with progressive COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia and a hyperinflammatory state) to receive usual care plus tocilizumab or usual care alone. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment. The trial steering committee, investigators, and all other individuals involved in the trial were masked to outcome data during the trial.</p>

Information was recorded on adherence to allocated study treatment, receipt of other COVID-19 treatments, duration of admission, receipt of respiratory or renal support, and vital status (including cause of death).

Secondary outcomes were time to discharge from hospital alive within 28 days and, in patients not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (including extracorporal membrane oxygenation) or death. Prespecified subsidiary clinical outcomes were use of non-invasive respiratory support, time to successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation (defined as cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation within, and survival to, 28 days), use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, cause-specific mortality, bleeding events, thrombotic events, and major cardiac arrhythmias. Information on suspected serious adverse reactions was collected in an expedited fashion to comply with regulatory requirements.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para170">The primary analysis for all outcomes was assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle by comparing patients randomly assigned to the colchicine group with those who were randomly assigned to the usual care group, but for whom colchicine was both available and a suitable treatment. For the primary outcome, all-cause 28-day mortality, the log-rank observed minus expected statistic and its variance were used to test both the null hypothesis of equal survival curves (ie, the log-rank test) and to calculate the one-step estimate of the average mortality rate ratio. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves to display cumulative mortality over the 28-day period. We used the same method to analyse time to hospital discharge and successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation, with patients who died in hospital right-censored on day 29. Median time to discharge was derived from Kaplan-Meier estimates. For the prespecified composite secondary outcome of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death within 28 days in those not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, and the subsidiary clinical outcomes of receipt of ventilation and use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, the precise dates were not available and so the risk ratio was estimated.</p>
                <p id="para180">Prespecified analyses were done for the primary outcome using the statistical test of interaction (test for heterogeneity or trend), in accordance with the prespecified analysis plan, defined by characteristics at randomisation: age, sex, ethnicity, level of respiratory support, days since symptom onset, and use of corticosteroids (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 115</xref>). An exploratory analysis of the primary outcome by CRP concentration at randomisation was done using a similar approach.</p>

As the trial progressed, the trial steering committee, whose members were unaware of the results of the trial comparisons, determined that sufficient patients should be enrolled to provide at least 90% power at a two-sided significance level of 0·01 to detect a clinically relevant proportional reduction in 28-day mortality of 12·5% between the two groups.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para290">In this large, randomised trial involving more than 11 000 patients from three countries and more than 2000 deaths, use of colchicine was not associated with a reduction in mortality, duration of hospitalisation, or the risk of being ventilated or dying for those not on ventilation at baseline. These results were consistent across the prespecified subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, duration of symptoms before randomisation, level of respiratory support at randomisation, and use of corticosteroids.</p>
              <p id="para300">The benefit of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support shows the importance of inflammation in this patient group and colchicine was proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 based on its anti-inflammatory activity.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, in this large, well powered trial, we found no evidence of a benefit from colchicine, which suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine are either insufficient to produce a meaningful reduction in mortality risk or are not affecting the relevant inflammatory pathways in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The protocol included a maximum of 10 days of treatment with colchicine. It is possible that a longer duration of therapy might have provided benefit, but most participants had stopped colchicine before 10 days either because of death, discharge from hospital, or at the discretion of the treating clinician. Although, most patients in this study received concomitant corticosteroid therapy, we saw no evidence that colchicine was beneficial in those patients not receiving a corticosteroid.</p>
              <p id="para310">Strengths of this trial included that it was randomised, had a large sample size, broad eligibility criteria, was international, and more than 99% of patients were followed up for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. However, there are some limitations. Detailed information on laboratory markers of inflammation and immune response and information on radiological features was not collected; therefore, it is not possible to assess if the effect of treatment varied between such subgroups of patients. Although this randomised trial is open-label, the outcomes are unambiguous and were ascertained without bias through linkage to routine health records.</p>
              <p id="para320">Three other randomised controlled trials have assessed the efficacy of colchicine for the treatment of patients hospitalised with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A two day shorter duration of hospitalisation was reported in a trial of 100 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and pulmonary involvement—confirmed by CT—who were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxychloroquine plus colchicine or hydroxychloroquine plus placebo.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> A second trial reported a reduced duration of hospitalisation and oxygen therapy in 36 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 allocated colchicine compared with 36 patients allocated usual care, which included hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Finally, the GRECCO-19 trial<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> reported a lower rate of clinical deterioration in 55 patients randomly assigned to receive colchicine compared with 50 patients randomly assigned to receive usual care, which did not include corticosteroids.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The total number of patients in all three of these trials combined was 285, with seven deaths during the follow-up period, meaning that, even combined, these three studies are not able to reliably assess the effects of colchicine on mortality. By contrast, the RECOVERY trial, with more than 11 000 participants and more than 2000 deaths, had excellent power to detect modest treatment benefits; none were observed.</p>
              <p id="para330">The RECOVERY trial only studied patients who had been hospitalised with COVID-19; therefore, we are not able to provide any evidence on the safety and efficacy of colchicine used in other patient groups. In the COLCORONA trial<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> of 4488 non-hospitalised patients with laboratory confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19, fewer patients in the colchicine group died or were hospitalised within 30 days of randomisation than in the placebo group. However, the trial was stopped before the scheduled sample size had been fully enrolled due to logistical reasons, and the result was not statistically significant (odds ratio 0·79 [95% CI 0·61–1·03]; p=0·081).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Thus, the role of colchicine in treatment of COVID-19 in patients not requiring hospitalisation remains uncertain. Future trials in this setting are ongoing.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para340">In summary, the results of this large, randomised trial do not support the use of colchicine in adults hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>
