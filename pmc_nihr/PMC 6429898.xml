                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Low quality of life is common in cancer survivors. Increasing physical activity, improving diet, supporting psychological well-being and weight loss can improve quality of life in several cancers and may limit relapse. The aim of the randomised controlled trial outlined in this protocol is to examine whether a digital intervention (Renewed), with or without human support, can improve quality of life in cancer survivors. Renewed provides support for increasing physical activity, managing difficult emotions, eating a healthier diet and weight management.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A randomised controlled trial is being conducted comparing usual care, access to Renewed or access to Renewed with brief human support. Cancer survivors who have had colorectal, breast or prostate cancer will be identified and invited through general practice searches and mail-outs. Participants are asked to complete baseline measures immediately after screening and will then be randomised to a study group; this is all completed on the Renewed website. The primary outcome is quality of life measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-c30. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and depression, fear of cancer recurrence, general well-being, enablement and items relating to costs for a health economics analysis. Process measures include perceptions of human support, intervention usage and satisfaction, and adherence to behavioural changes. Qualitative process evaluations will be conducted with patients and healthcare staff providing support.</p>

                <p>The Renewed study is a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial comparing usual care, the Renewed intervention and Renewed accompanied by brief human support. The long-term aim of the intervention is to potentially help cancer survivors with other forms of cancer. At this stage, we have chosen three contrasting common survivor groups, who have no metastatic disease, to deal with the likely varying issues in needs and preferences across gender and age spectrums: breast cancer survivors (younger and older women); prostate cancer survivors and those on active surveillance/watchful waiting for prostate cancer (predominantly older men); and colorectal cancer (a range of age and gender). By working with these groups, we will explore to what extent the intervention is likely to be generalisable to other survivor groups. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for an outline of the flow of the study.</p>

                <p>When first designing the study, the research team received input from six patient representatives who had experienced breast, prostate or colorectal cancer, in addition to members of Macmillan Cancer Support, Prostate Cancer UK, Breast Cancer Care, Bowel Cancer UK, Cancer Research UK and the National Cancer Research Institute. All parties had input into the original grant proposal and played a part in developing and agreeing the research questions, study procedures (eg, inclusion criteria) and choice of primary outcome.</p>
                <p>After securing funding, an additional two patient representatives were recruited to replace two patient representatives who were unable to continue their involvement due to ill health. Our panel of six patient representatives and representatives from Prostate Cancer UK, Breast Cancer Care and Bowel Cancer UK are part of the study management team and attend regular meetings to contribute to the development of the Renewed intervention and the study protocol and procedures for the randomised controlled trial. They assisted in refining the study design, for example, making suggestions for the frequency and mode of support delivery for patients randomised to the support arm, which were implemented. The patient representatives also took part in qualitative interviews and provided detailed comments on draft intervention materials (in addition to feedback obtained by qualitative interviews with 33 research participants recruited from primary care (see Bradbury et al, in prep). This feedback was used to inform modifications to the intervention to maximise engagement and minimise any burden posed by the intervention.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome is QoL as measured by the total EORTC score at 6 months. The study is powered to detect a standardised effect size of 0.3, consistent with our previous internet-based behavioural interventions.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The key pairwise comparison is each of the two intervention groups versus controls. To detect a difference of 0.3 standard mean difference in any pairwise comparison between intervention and control for 80% power and alpha=0.05 requires 176 intervention participants in each intervention group and 176 controls, giving a total of 528 participants per cancer type. In order to explore the difference in the key subgroups (breast, colon and prostate cancers), this requires that we include 528 participants in each of the three clinical groups. This gives a total of 1584 participants, or 1980 allowing for 20% loss to follow-up. Even though this is an individually randomised design cluster effects are possible: if we assume eight patients per intervention group per practice then to allow for clustering at a practice level and assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 then the inflation factor is 1.21 (1+ (8–1*0.03)), which will require 2396 participants. Allowing for some leeway in our assumptions, we will aim to recruit approximately 835 patients per cancer type (total n=2500).</p>

                <p>See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref> for a detailed diagram showing the flow of participants through the intervention, incorporating Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TiDIER) guidelines.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> There are four interventions within Renewed that participants can choose to view: Getting Active for increasing physical activity, Healthy Paths for stress reduction, Eat for Health for diet improvement and POWeR+<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> for weight loss. In the introductory pages, Renewed provides participants with tailored suggestions of the aspects of the website which might be most helpful to them, based on their answers to the baseline QoL measure (EORTC). There is also advice and information about active surveillance/watchful waiting for prostate cancer for men being monitored. After the introduction, participants are presented with their homepage containing buttons to the separate interventions with some brief information about what to expect from each; POWeR+ is only presented to participants who have a BMI of over 25.</p>

                <p>Participants are able to come back to the intervention and view which content they prefer as often as they choose. If a participant accesses one of these interventions they will be sent brief automated emails as reminders and for motivation with tips, interesting facts and brief information and advice. Content is tailored throughout Renewed, where appropriate, to present information most relevant to specific cancer types (eg, concerns about exercising with a colostomy bag) and the developers of the interventions worked together to ensure that conflicting advice is not given. Where appropriate, Renewed links to existing helpful websites rather than duplicating information: links to external resources are provided throughout the Renewed intervention, some of which are tailored by cancer type. For example, these include information about returning to work and connecting with other survivors of cancer (from the homepage) and links to websites providing further emotional support on Healthy Paths and websites about group exercise on Getting Active.</p>

If, after 6 weeks, participants have not completed the 6 month follow-up questionnaires online, paper-based questionnaires will be sent with a £10 gift voucher for high-street stores (regardless of paper-based questionnaire completion). If paper-based questionnaires are not returned after 2 weeks of being sent, research staff (blind to group allocation) will phone participants to request limited responses over the phone (the EORTC); a maximum of two phone contacts per participant will be made. The procedure will be the same for 12 month follow-ups but with no further vouchers given. If at any stage the participant indicates that they would not be willing to complete any further measures, no further contact will be made regarding the follow-ups. At study completion, the usual care (wait list) group will be given access to the Renewed website.

                <p>The primary outcome of QoL will be measured using the total score on the EORTC QLQ-c30.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The EORTC has 30 items and contains five functioning subscales: physical, emotional, social, role and cognitive and eight symptom subscales: pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, sleep problems, loss of appetite, constipation and diarrhoea, financial impact and overall quality of life. Each item has a four-point response scale from ‘not at all’ to ‘very much’ and scores are calculated using a linear conversion to create a score from 0 to 100. It is one of the most widely used measures for health-related QoL in cancer research.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p>
                <p>The Fear of Relapse/Recurrence Scale<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> has been modified to three items so that ‘I will probably have a relapse in the next 5 years’ and ‘I am certain that I have been cured of cancer’ are omitted as they do not apply to those on Active Surveillance. The Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) was modified so that it asks about confidence and understanding relating to health as a result of using the website as opposed to receiving support from a doctor (PEI<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54 55</xref>). Data regarding website and/or app usage (eg, pages accessed, time spent on each page) will be downloaded using LifeGuide software. A medical record notes review will be conducted after 12 month follow-up to extract NHS and Personal Social Service use. This will enable collection of data pertaining to clinical status including cancer recurrence. Online questions will be used to collect patients’ personal costs. The EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56 57</xref> which measures medical QoL (QALY) will be collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. We will apply the UK tariff to translate the EQ-5D-5L to utility scores.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>SPSS, Stata and Excel software will be used to evaluate outcomes. All participant data will be analysed, including those who have withdrawn, unless participant/s specifically request that their data be removed from the data set. All participants will be analysed on an intention to treat basis, that is, as randomised with any missing data imputed using a chained equations multiple imputation model. Complete cases analysis will be undertaken as a sensitivity analysis.</p>
                <p>Linear regression models will be used for the analysis of continuous variables, controlling for baseline values, stratification variables, practice as a cluster variable, and also controlling for potential confounding variables as appropriate, both for the overall trial sample and for each clinical subgroup (breast, prostate, colon). Results will be produced for the trial overall and within each cancer type. We will undertake pre-specified subgroup analyses, including exploring possible mediators and moderators in the context of the process analysis. These analyses will be set out in full in the Statistical Analysis Plan prior to the final follow-ups.</p>
                <p>To examine how the design and presentation of questionnaires affects response rates and response quality, we will compare the initial completion rate for the control outcome measures versus the enhanced outcome measures using a factorial design where participants will be allocated to see the normal or enhanced questionnaires. A ratio of 1:2 (normal:enhanced) will be used when allocating participants to get a feel for how the enhanced questionnaire presentation might impact on study completion, given that unenhanced questions are already presented at baseline and 6 months.</p>

                  <p>Published unit costs (Personal Social Services Research Unit, British National Formulary and national reference costs) will be applied to itemised resource usage in calculating total cost per person. The health economic analysis will include cost effectiveness (£/unit of primary outcome) and cost utility (£/EQ-5D-5L QALY) analysis. The costs of the study will be from an NHS perspective with exploration of a quasi-social perspective including the time required by patients interacting with the intervention. The study will identify and quantify the resources required to deliver the intervention, and any impact on NHS service usage and personal costs. We will explore the potential change in NHS service use and change in the pattern of use of such services, such as whether the new intervention will reduce medication (eg, depression related drugs), GP consultations and community nurse and special service usage. The key resource usage of the intervention covers nursing support time, software. Personal costs will be collected on time off work (both patients/carers), cost of use of internet (personal time) and costs of over-the-counter medications. The economic analyses of both costs, QoL (EORTC and QALY), provided minimally worthwhile improvements are shown, will be summarised in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost effectiveness acceptability curves.</p>

                <title>Qualitative process studies</title>
                <p>There will be two qualitative process studies. One will examine participants’ experiences of using the intervention and participating in the trial. Participants will be emailed the information sheet with an invitation to take part in this additional study. Eight to ten participants per cancer type (n=24–30) will be purposively sampled until saturation (by cancer type, age and gender). Participants will be invited to take part after they have taken part in the trial for at least 1–2 months. Additional consent will be sought for these studies. Interviews (face-to-face or by phone) will consist of open-ended questions to elicit detailed responses. Each interview will last approximately 60 min. These interviews will enable the research team to further assess the acceptability and helpfulness of the intervention and any barriers to engagement. Control participants will also be invited in the same way to participate in brief interviews to elicit qualitative feedback about the brief advice link they were given at baseline (the NHS LiveWell website) and the study.</p>
                <p>The second qualitative process study will be conducted with Supporters, to explore their views of supporting patients in using Renewed online. This study will elicit perceptions of the initial training website, providing support to patients and the general study procedures. After at least 1–2 months of participation, support providers, GPs and any other primary care staff significantly involved in trial procedures or intervention delivery (n=20, or until saturation) will be invited to take part in this additional study. Focus groups, interviews or phone interviews will be held, depending on availability or else electronic (written) feedback will be requested.</p>
                <p>In both process studies interviews will be recorded and fully transcribed. Transcriptions will be anonymised. To ensure that we remain open to, and grounded in, interviewee perspectives we will carry out inductive thematic analysis of all textual data,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> triangulated where appropriate with other trial data (eg, web usage), and with discussion among team members (including our PPI representatives) to elaborate our interpretations.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p>

                <title>Handling of adverse events</title>
                <p>It is very unlikely that there will be any adverse events during screening and questionnaire completion, given that screening online consists of answering questions; however, participants are repeatedly told that they can contact the research team who can signpost them to other support services as appropriate. Participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. If a participant withdraws having completed questionnaires, their data will be retained to evaluate potential differences and reasons for attrition, unless they ask us not to use their data. Should a participant be ineligible for the study for any reason, they are presented with a page of alternative support services.</p>
                <p>Any serious adverse event (SAE) occurring to a research participant will be reported to the Ethics Committee where, in the opinion of the Chief Investigator, the event was related to administration of any of the research procedures, and was an unexpected occurrence. Non-serious AEs will not be collected. Pre-planned hospitalisation for example, for pre-existing conditions which have not worsened or elective procedures for a pre-existing condition will not be classed as an SAE. GP surgeries will inform the research team and/or the clinical trials unit of any SAEs within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event occurring. GP surgeries will be provided with a standard operating procedure and a form for SAE reporting. Reports of SAEs will be provided to the Committee within 15 days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event. All SAEs will also be sent to the Trial Steering Committee.</p>

                <title>Dissemination</title>
                <p>The results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals and through conference presentations. Press releases will be utilised to disseminate the findings to the general public and the findings will also be sent to the GP surgeries who participate and to those participants who request them. Social media networks connected to the research group (eg, Twitter) will be used to disseminate published research. If proven effective, Renewed will be developed with service providers and charities to explore mechanisms through which it can be made available to patients.</p>
