                  <p id="Par1">Nail bed trauma is one of the most common surgically treated paediatric hand injuries in the UK. Despite surgeons generally expressing a preference to replace the nail plate after repairing the nail bed, there is limited evidence to support this practice. We describe a statistical and health economic analysis plan (SHEAP) for the Nail bed INJury Analysis (NINJA) randomised controlled trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">NINJA is a multicentre, pragmatic, superiority, parallel group randomised controlled trial of the treatment of nail bed injury in participants 16 years old or younger. The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of replacing the nail plate compared to discarding it following the repair of a nail bed injury. Surgical site infection at 7–10 days post-randomisation and cosmetic appearance of the nail are the co-primary outcomes for NINJA. Surgical site infection at 7–10 days post-randomisation will be evaluated using a logistic regression model adjusting for site as the sole stratification factor and allowing for intra-site correlation. Cosmetic appearance will be assessed via the newly developed Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score and will be evaluated by use of a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. An ordinal logistic regression model will also be used to assess the Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score, adjusting for site and allowing for intra-site correlation. Secondary outcomes are measured at 7–10 days and 4 months and include the EQ-5D-Y questionnaire, pain at first dressing change, cost-effectiveness, late surgical site infection, and participant/parent satisfaction with nail healing. Missing primary outcome data will be summarised by treatment arm and investigated through a sensitivity analysis. Full details of the planned methods of analysis and descriptive statistics are described in this paper. The NINJA study protocol has been published previously.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Nail bed injuries are one of the most common forms of paediatric hand trauma, with approximately 10,000 cases treated annually in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the frequency of these injuries, controversy remains around the appropriate treatment of nail bed injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Surgical treatment of these injuries involves removing the nail plate and repairing the underlying nail bed laceration with sutures. Once the nail bed has been repaired, 96% of surgeons in the UK will replace the nail plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The rationale behind replacing the nail is that it protects the nail bed repair site and acts as a splint by holding open the nail fold, which prevents scar adhesions (synechiae) between the nail fold and nail bed.</p>
              <p id="Par25">A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] has suggested that replacement of the nail plate is associated with an increase in complications, in particular the development of post-operative infections. The reason behind this apparent increase in infective and wound healing complications is thought to be that the nail plate acts as a foreign body, trapping bacteria and making infection more likely. If this is the case, discarding the nail plate could result in a reduction in incidence of infection and would also reduce the burden on the NHS in terms of follow-up visits, antibiotic courses, and hospital readmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. No randomised controlled trials have yet been conducted to compare different methods of surgical management following nail bed repairs. The British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) and the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) supported a national survey of clinicians and parents/patients and audit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This led to the NINJA-P pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] being carried out, which formed the basis for the full NINJA trial.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The aim of the Nail bed INJury Analysis (NINJA) study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to compare replacing the nail plate and discarding the nail plate following the repair of a nail bed injury in children aged 16 or under, in terms of both post-operative surgical site infection and the cosmetic appearance of the nail.</p>
              <p id="Par27">This paper describes the methods set out in the trial’s statistical and health economic analysis plan (SHEAP) and has been prepared in accordance with the published guidelines on the content of statistical analysis plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The aim of this paper is to provide transparency on the planned analysis strategies assessing both the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of replacing the nail versus discarding the nail, in order to reduce the likelihood of reporting bias and data-driven results. The NINJA trial is registered in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials database, registration number ISRCTN44551796.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par28">NINJA is a multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, superiority, pragmatic randomised controlled trial. A total of 416 patients will be recruited from 20 centres across the UK over a period of 20 months. Participants will be randomised to either have the fingernail replaced or discarded following repair of the nail bed injury. Patients eligible for the trial will be randomised to the treatments in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by study site using blocks of size 2 and 4 in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be performed using a secure online randomisation system when the participant is in the anaesthetic room prior to surgery, or as close to the time of surgery as possible. Participants will be followed up by their local clinics at the first routine clinic appointment at around 7–10 days post-surgery, and additionally via postal questionnaire at 4–12 months. The trial will run for 3 years. Details of the trial design and procedures have been published in full in the NINJA study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study has been conducted as part of the portfolio of trials in the registered UKCRC Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU) at the University of Oxford. It has followed their Standard Operating Procedures ensuring compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and any applicable regulatory requirements.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par30">The primary objective of the NINJA trial is to assess the effects of replacing or discarding the fingernail following a nail bed repair by comparing both the risk of surgical site infection and cosmetic appearance. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessing differences in participants’ health-related quality of life, pain at first dressing change, late infection, and satisfaction with nail healing. A within-trial economic analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of replacing versus discarding the nail plate is also a secondary objective of the study.</p>

                    <p id="Par32">Data on incidence of surgical site infection at 7–10 days post-surgery will be collected. The process for the collection of early infection data, which has been designed to maximise data retention, is as defined below.

                    <title>Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score</title>
                    <p id="Par41">The cosmetic appearance of the injured nail will be assessed by independent reviewers at 4 months post-randomisation. The reviewers will consist of trainee plastic surgeons, specialist registrars, and hand therapists. Reviewers will assess photographs taken at 4 months post-randomisation showing both the injured finger and the contralateral finger and complete the Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score (based on the Zook classification scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) giving a measure of the overall appearance of the nail. Reviewers will be informed which of the fingers is the injured finger, but will be blinded to the intervention received.</p>
                    <p id="Par42">The Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score is made up of five scoring components. These components assess the nail shape, the eponychium, the adherence of the nail plate to the nail bed, the nail surface, and the presence of a split in the nail. The score has been modified for the purpose of this study to contain only two scoring dimensions for each component. Nail shape, eponychium, and surface will be scored as either identical or not identical to the contralateral finger; nail adherence will be scored as either complete or incomplete; and nail split will be scored as either present or absent. If reviewers believe the nail differed in shape, eponychium, or surface in comparison to the contralateral nail, they will also be asked specifically why they thought this (e.g. “The injured nail appears narrower to the contralateral nail”). Reviewers will also be asked if, in their opinion, enough of the nail has grown back in order to make a valid assessment of the nail.</p>
                    <p id="Par43">Each component will be scored as a 1 if it is deemed to be the same as opposite finger or not having the defect, and zero if the fingernail is deemed to be worse than the opposite finger or if the defect is present. The component scores will then be totalled, and each nail will receive a score between 0 (worst possible cosmetic score) and 5 (best possible cosmetic score). As five assessors will be scoring each photograph, the median of these values will be taken as the outcome for each nail.</p>

                    <title>Health-related quality of life</title>
                    <p id="Par44">The EQ-5D-Y is a validated, child-friendly, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire consisting of five domains related to daily activities (mobility, looking after myself, usual activity, pain or discomfort, and feeling worried, sad, or unhappy) with 3-level answer possibilities (no problems, some problems, and a lot of problems). This will be completed by the patient if they are 7 years old and above or via parent/guardian proxy if the patient is between 2 and 6 years old, at baseline, 7–10 days, and 4–12 months post-randomisation.</p>
                    <p id="Par45">In line with the age-centric languages of the NINJA trial’s patient information sheets, EQ-5D-Y (proxy) will be used for children aged 2–6 years while EQ-5D-Y will be used for children aged 7 years and above. For participants aged 2–4 years, the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Scale, a non-preference-based HRQoL instrument that has been designed to provide a modular approach to measure HRQoL among children and adolescents aged 2–18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], was used during the early stages of the trial but was replaced by EQ-5D-Y (proxy). This is because the mapping algorithm used to estimate the health utilities from PedsQL is age group specific and there are currently no mapping algorithms available for children aged seven and under. Although EQ-5D-Y has not been validated for children under four and the proxy version is recommended only for ages 4–6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], given that there are currently no guidelines to collect HRQoL data from children under four and no valid algorithm to map PedsQL to health utilities, EQ-5D-Y (proxy) will be used for children aged 2–4 years. There will not be any measurement of HRQoL for children below 2 years old after reviewing the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and consulting the experts (EuroQoL advisors and experts in paediatrics health) as there is currently no validated measure of HRQoL for these ages.</p>

The base case analysis will take a NHS and Personal Social Service perspective, following best UK practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The base case analysis will use the intention-to-treat (“as-randomised”) dataset. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated as the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in numbers of surgical site infections between the interventions. To facilitate clear reporting to different audiences, we will conduct two analyses. CEA1 will comprise a complete case analysis taking a 7–10-day time horizon and focusing on the additional cost of the intervention itself and the cost of subsequent healthcare consultations. Analysis CEA2 will include multiple imputation of missing data and all NHS/Personal Social Service resource use collected in the trial and will take a 4–12-month time horizon for costs, with a sensitivity analysis at 7–10 days.</p>

If the child cannot complete this score, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in the form of a measured line with a continuous scale (from 0 to 100) anchored by two verbal descriptors for each extreme symptom will be completed by a parent/guardian and used as a patient proxy for measuring satisfaction with nail healing.</p>

                <p id="Par50">Sample size calculations are based on the co-primary outcomes of surgical site infection and cosmetic appearance at a minimum of 4 months, measured via the Oxford Finger Nail Appearance Score, the development of which was informed by the Zook nail classification scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]—a 0–5 ordinal summary score reflecting optimal or suboptimal appearance across the five classification domains. Pilot data from our NINJA-P trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed a substantial proportion of participants did not have nails with optimal appearance (approximately 35% had two or more suboptimal aspects of appearance, i.e. score of three or less). Based upon a clinically relevant difference of 15% more achieving the optimal appearance score of 5 (from 35 to 50% with a corresponding shift in the other score values) and using a two-sided significance level of 0.05, 332 (166 per group) are required to obtain 90% power based upon a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. After allowance for 20% missing data, a total of 416 participants (208 in each group) are required. This calculation was carried out using an extended version of the Excel spreadsheet provided by Walters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to allow for a 6-point ordinal outcome. Based upon a lower overall level and a smaller difference in the proportion with a surgical site infection than the one observed in the Miranda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] observational study (8% vs 1%), this sample size is also sufficient for 90% power at the two-sided 5% significance level. This latter calculation was carried out in Stata 14 using the power twoprop command. The sample size was not adjusted for the use of co-primary outcomes as each outcome is seen as clinically important in its own right and will be evaluated independently.</p>

A two-sided 5% significance level will be adopted with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible using appropriate summary measures (e.g. number of events and percentage for binary measures). The principal analyses will also be carried out on a complete case basis, with sensitivity to missing data explored for the primary outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par52">Only a single main analysis is planned once the study data collection is complete. No formal stopping rules are accounted for in the sample size, and accordingly, no formal interim analyses are planned. Correspondingly, no adjustment for multiplicity will be undertaken.

The base currency of all costs will be the year in which the costing analysis was performed and in UK pounds.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">Intra-operative resource use between the treatment arms is expected to be the same except for the extra suture needed to secure the nail plate. The unit cost of suture will be sourced from the latest NHS Supply Chain Catalogue and will be based on the type of suture recorded on the operation form. Since both types of surgery are day cases, the cost of hospitalisation will not be collected as the HRG code is expected to be the same. Unit costs for labour will also not be collected as the number and type of staff (surgeons, anaesthetists, technicians/operating department personnel, nurses, and radiographers) as well as the length of operation are expected to be almost the same in both trial arms.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">Unit cost of direct medical costs that are not collected in the trial, such as inpatient care, outpatient care, and community care, will be sourced from the latest available NHS Reference Cost and Personal Social Service Research Unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The unit cost of medication related to nail injury will be sourced using the latest available British National Formulary (BNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and NHS Electronic Drug Tariff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The base case analysis (taking an NHS perspective) will exclude medications that are recorded on the questionnaire as having been bought without prescription. All medications are assumed to be in oral solution (regardless of the patient’s age) unless stated otherwise. The medication cost taken over the study period will be computed using the cost per dose for each product and the mean quantity taken per day during the reported number of days. If less than one bottle will be used to treat the nail bed injury, the costing analysis will include the entire cost of the whole bottle prescribed. As the participant’s parent/guardian is not required to indicate the dose of the medication, the defined daily dose for each medication will be taken from the BNF website after consulting expert opinion. Cost of healthcare resource use per patient will be computed by multiplying the frequency of health resource utilisation rate reported by the parent/guardian with the unit cost of each resource item.
