                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has massively reduced HIV mortality. However, long-term cART increases the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which can lead to higher morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs for people living with HIV (PLHIV).</p>
                  <p>Pharmacovigilance—monitoring the effects of medicines—is essential for understanding real-world drug safety. In Uganda, pharmacovigilance systems have only recently been developed, and rates of ADR reporting for cART are very low. Thus, the safety profile of medicines currently used to treat HIV and tuberculosis in our population is poorly understood.</p>
                  <p>The Med Safety mobile application has been developed through the European Union’s Innovative Medicines Initiative WEB-Recognising Adverse Drug Reactions project to promote digital pharmacovigilance. This mobile application has been approved for ADR-reporting by Uganda’s National Drug Authority. However, the barriers and facilitators to Med Safety uptake, and its effectiveness in improving pharmacovigilance, are as yet unknown.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial will be implemented over 30 months at 191 intervention and 191 comparison cART sites to evaluate Med Safety. Using a randomisation sequence generated by the sealed envelope software, we shall randomly assign the 382 prescreened cART sites to the intervention and comparison arms. Each cART site is a cluster that consists of healthcare professionals and PLHIV receiving dolutegravir-based cART and/or isoniazid preventive therapy. Healthcare professionals enrolled in the intervention arm will be trained in the use of mobile-based, paper-based and web-based reporting, while those in the comparison arm will be trained in paper-based and web-based reporting only.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval was given by the School of Biomedical Sciences Research and Ethics Committee at Makerere University (SBS-REC-720), and administrative clearance was obtained from Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (HS1366ES). Study results will be shared with healthcare professionals, policymakers, the public and academia.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting is the backbone of pharmacovigilance (PV) globally but is plagued by under-reporting.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Only 3% of Ugandan healthcare professionals (HCPs) reported a suspected ADR to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC) in 2014.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> These HCPs cited lack of conventional paper-based ADR forms (paper forms), limited access to web-based forms (web forms) due to the scarcity of internet-wired computers and the lack of feedback to ADR reporters as common barriers to PV. Also, logistical challenges lurk in the countrywide distribution and collection of paper forms by Uganda’s NPC, which hinders timely data collation and analysis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Ultimately, the implementation of requisite policy actions to safeguard the public from medication-related harm has been delayed.</p>
              <p>Innovative interventions are needed to improve ADR reporting, such as the use of mobile applications (mobile apps or apps) to support traditional PV.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Mobile apps have had variable success in PV worldwide. A 10-fold increase in the rate of ADR reporting was seen for a medical device with social media engagement in the USA. In contrast, uptake of mobile app reporting has been poor in Europe: studies in the UK, the Netherlands and Croatia showed 1.7, 1.1 and 6.5 app ADR reports per completed month per 1000 app downloads, respectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Uptake was also poor in India: 4.0 app ADR reports per completed month per 1000 app downloads.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Efforts to strengthen PV in Uganda are timely due to the recent rollout of dolutegravir (DTG) as the preferred drug for first-line and second-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). DTG is more effective and tolerable and has a higher genetic barrier to developing drug resistance than other antiretrovirals.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Rollout began in October 2018 and, by August 2019, over 347 888 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were receiving DTG-based cART.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In addition, Uganda is rapidly scaling up isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB) in PLHIV. Only 16% of PLHIV had been reached with life-saving IPT by June 2019<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>: an extra 135 711 PLHIV were initiated on IPT by September 2019 after a 100-day scale-up campaign.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> IPT significantly reduces the incidence of active TB, curbing TB-related mortality among PLHIV.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Although DTG is generally well tolerated, it is associated with serious ADRs including hyperglycaemia,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref> neuropsychiatric effects (1.7%)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and hepatotoxicity (0.1%).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> DTG is also associated with more common, but less serious, ADRs such as headache, abnormal dreams and abdominal pain, but the impact of these has not been evaluated in real-world settings in developing countries. The rapid rollout of DTG and scale up of IPT will increase the number of PLHIV exposed to these therapies, potentially increasing the incidence of ADRs, including serious ADRs, associated with these medicines. Discontinuation of DTG and/or IPT is recommended if serious ADRs such as jaundice, blurred vision or hyperglycaemia occur.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Four in 100 000 PLHIV who receive IPT die due to an IPT-related adverse event.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>ADRs can reduce quality of life for PLHIV and increase morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> In 2016, prior to DTG rollout, the NPC attempted to improve spontaneous ADR reporting via a web form. However, they received only 92 online reports versus 290 paper-based ADR reports linked to cART from October 2018 to September 2019. More recently, a PV task force composed of the NPC, the AIDS Control Program and Ministry of Health was set up. The task force established an active drug safety monitoring and management programme to complement the spontaneous ADR reporting system. The NPC received 109 DTG-linked ADR reports from October 2018 to September 2019 from ~348 000 PLHIV. Only 18 IPT-linked ADR reports were received from January 2019 to June 2019 from ~300 000 PLHIV: 2.6 DTG-linked ADR reports per month per 100 000 treated PLHIV and 1.0 IPT-linked ADR report per month per 100 000 treated PLHIV. These rates are barely 5% the known incidence of the ADRs in PLHIV elsewhere.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref></p>
              <p>The Med Safety mobile application was developed by the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative: WEB-Recognising Adverse Drug Reactions. The same technology that produced the Med Safety App was also adopted by European countries including UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in July 2015, Netherlands’ Lareb in January 2016 and Croatia’s HALMED in May 2016. In 2017, the Med Safety App was introduced in Africa (Burkina Faso and Zambia) in partnership with WHO. MHRA adapted Med Safety for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Uganda with approval from Uganda’s National Drug Authority (NDA) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Med Safety was launched in limited settings in Uganda in February 2020.</p>

              <p>Med Safety’s platform facilitates easy adoption and low-cost maintenance in LMICs. It is available at no cost for mobile phones and tablets, for Android and iOS, in English. Within the app, ADR reports can be completed offline and transmitted to NPC when internet connectivity is established. The ADR reporting form has a clear and simple format. App users can browse and view ADR data and may create a ‘watch-list’ of <italic toggle="yes">medicines</italic> of their own interest to receive personalised news and alerts. Med Safety provides for two-way exchange of medication safety information between NPC and HCPs. This enhanced interaction promotes the involvement of HCPs in PV activities. The anticipated increase in volume of ADR reports in the national PV database could enhance its signal detection potential<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and contribute to remedial efforts to improve patient safety. The app is also integrated into the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring – Uppsala Monitoring Centre application programme interfaces (including Vigiflow, VigiAccess and WHODrug).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This study seeks to understand whether Med Safety is effective in improving ADR reporting by HCPs if used together with traditional PV methods versus if traditional PV methods are used alone.</p>

                <p>Our aim is to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness of implementing Med Safety for HCP-driven reporting of ADRs associated with DTG containing cART and IPT for TB prevention in PLHIV in Uganda. Our hypothesis is that the use of Med Safety for ADR reporting by HCPs attending to PLHIV on DTG-based cART and/or IPT will increase the ADR reporting rate<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> by at least 25% versus use of existing PV methods alone in 30 months of follow-up at selected cART sites in Uganda. We will test our hypothesis in a pragmatic multicentre open-label cluster-randomised controlled trial whose specific objectives are to:</p>

                  <p>HCPs at intervention cART-sites will be introduced to the Med Safety mobile app whether they own a smartphone or not. Mobile app, paper form and web form awareness campaigns including initial face-to-face training, posters/brochures and monthly reminder WhatsApp and mobile phone short messages (SMS) for up to 6 months will be undertaken. Training will be conducted by pharmacists from NPC and Makerere University with expertise in PV. The training teams have harmonised the training schedule to ensure uniform training. Interested HCPs with personal smartphones will be invited and assisted to install the mobile app and trained to use it to report suspected ADRs, with emphasis on DTG-linked and IPT-linked ADRs. HCPs will also be trained and encouraged to use traditional PV methods (paper form and web form).</p>

                  <p>There are 15 regional referral hospitals each with a catchment of ~25 cART sites. Each team of three research assistants requires 4 weeks to enrol HCPs in one regional catchment.

A minimum of 189 cART sites per arm or 378 in both study arms (66% increment) will be required to cater for the following limitations: (1) the large proportion of HCPs who do not own smartphones of ~50%–60% as previously estimated<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> – and is 26% (95% CI of 23% to 30%) from limited rollout of RCT; (2) refusal to participate by eligible HCPs of ~5% as previously estimated<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> – and is 0% (95% CI of 0% to 2%) from limited rollout of RCT; (3) loss to follow-up due to the relatively long follow-up period of 30 months (~10%); and (4) contamination due to information sharing between study arms through social media (~30%).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We shall enrol 382 cART sites (191 per study arm) to cater for other unforeseen limitations; thus, recruiting up to 3820 HCPs (1910 HCPs per trial arm). Limited rollout of the RCT suggests a cluster size of 7.2 (629/87) HCPs. We shall retain the average cluster size of 10 HCPs because the RCT has not yet enrolled from the central region of Uganda (with the country’s capital city) where cART sites tend to be much larger with more HCPs per site than the more rural eastern, western and northern regions.</p>

Video conferencing is preferred to minimise the spread of COVID-19. If virtual meetings are not feasible, then face-to-face meetings will be held in full observance of the Ministry of Health’s guidelines for limiting the spread of COVID-19: social distancing, use of face masks and handwashing, especially for regional trainings of HCPs in remote areas where the internet might not be accessible and during the enrolment of study sites. The NPC in concert with Ministry of Health developed PV training materials for active drug safety monitoring and management of ADRs to DTG/IPT. We shall adapt and update these materials with the results of our study for academic training and also tailor them for healthcare service delivery trainings to be conducted nationwide in partnership with NPC and Ministry of Health.</p>

                  <p>This work underpins the wider rollout of Med Safety to improve PV across Uganda and beyond. This study is being implemented in direct partnership with cART sites, Uganda’s NDA, which is the PV coordinating body in Uganda, UK’s MHRA and WHO. Therefore, the study results will be readily available for immediate use to inform policy and practice by these key stakeholders. The NDA and MHRA (the software developers) will identify the barriers to the app’s implementation and mitigate them as well as the facilitators and exploit them. Uganda’s experience could be exploited to scale up the app in other low-income and middle-income countries.</p>

                <p>Improving the reporting of suspected ADRs via digital PV is the first step towards boosting the volume of safety data available for robust signal detection analyses, improving understanding of the risk profiles of medicines and preventing future occurrence of avoidable ADRs. Improved PV translates into better recognition of serious ADRs and, ultimately, safer patient care. This work underpins future proposals to understand the risk factors for ADRs in PLHIV.</p>
