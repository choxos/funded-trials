                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>105 men were recruited, 60% from more disadvantaged areas (SIMD quintiles 1 or 2). Retention at 12 months was 74%. Fewer SMS+I participants (64%) completed 12-month assessments compared with SMS only (79%) and control (83%). Narrative texts were acceptable to many men, but some reported negative reactions. No evidence emerged that level of disadvantage was related to acceptability of narrative texts. Eleven SMS+I participants (31%) successfully met or partially met weight loss targets. The cost of the incentive per participant was £81.94 (95% CI £34.59 to £129.30). Incentives were acceptable, but improving health was reported as the key motivator for weight loss. All groups lost weight (SMS+I: −2.51 kg (SD=4.94); SMS only: −1.29 kg (SD=5.03); control: −0.86 kg (SD=5.64) at 12 months).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of serious health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2016, 26% of men in the UK were classified as obese, and men were less likely to be a healthy weight than women (31% of men compared with 35% of women).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite the growing prevalence of obesity, men contribute a disproportionately low number of participants to evidence-based weight management programmes.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Most interventions are designed for mixed sex populations, but systematic review evidence suggests that, compared with women, men often benefit from different ways of providing interventions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Text message interventions</title>
                <p>The evidence for text message interventions supporting changes in lifestyle behaviours, including behaviour change for weight loss, is promising.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> However, systematic reviews<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> report no text message delivered trials that target weight loss designed for men only. Text-based interventions can reach large numbers of people, including men from disadvantaged backgrounds,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and mobile technologies such as standard mobile phones allow delivery of evidence-based strategies anywhere and anytime.</p>
                <p>Narrative approaches to promoting behaviour change have been suggested as a tool for communication-based interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Narrative SMS can be broadly defined as interactive life stories, which are based around a group of characters with whom recipients can identify.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Text message-based interventions using narratives have been used to engage hard to reach men in moderating their alcohol consumption and were found to be acceptable.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> Narrative approaches to weight management in men may be a promising tool to support behaviour and weight change.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Financial incentive interventions</title>
                <p>Systematic review evidence of financial incentives for behaviour change highlights the potential for incentives to change behaviours in low-income adults<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and help reduce health inequalities.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, little evidence exists that focuses on using financial incentives to support weight management in individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> particularly for men.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A discrete choice experiment found that paying people (£10–£30/week varying by age and weight) to take part in diet and physical activity (PA) interventions is likely to improve uptake, adherence and maintenance of behaviour change.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Moreover, the evidence for financial incentives for weight loss is growing.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> In particular, deposit contracts, where participants deposit their own money and are reimbursed only if they achieve the target weight loss, are effective while the incentives are in place.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 23</xref> Deposit contracts draw on loss aversion where people are more motivated to avoid losses than they are to achieve similarly sized gains.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> However, deposit contracts may not be not equitable, as committing one’s own money up front may not be possible, particularly for individuals with lower income.</p>
                <p>Endowment incentive contracts may overcome limitations of deposit contracts. Endowment incentive contracts are financial incentives where a person is endowed with an (hypothetical) amount of money that they either ‘secure’ or ‘lose’ depending on achieving certain targets. A trial that framed financial incentives in this way found these incentives were effective for achieving PA goals in the short term.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

Narrative texts were written to appeal to men from disadvantaged backgrounds. All participants in the SMS+I and SMS only groups received automated texts according to a predetermined schedule. Participants could reply to texts but did not receive a response. Texts were sent between 08:00 and 22:00 and ranged from 0 to 5 texts per day depending on the requirements of the narrative approach used. All participants were scheduled to receive the same number of text messages. Some texts were personalised including participants’ names and men could select whether weight information should be presented in kilograms or stones and pounds. No further personalisation and tailoring options were offered.

Weight loss was verified at all face-to-face appointments. At 6 and 12 months, men lost a proportion of the money for each % weight loss not attained between 5% and 10%. Weight at 12 months had to be less than at baseline to receive any money, regardless of whether interim weight loss targets had been met. Men received the money by direct bank transfer after the 12-month assessment. Feedback on meeting incentive targets was sent by automated text message and displayed on the personalised SMS+I webpage.</p>

                <title>Outcome assessment</title>
                <p>Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for intervention participants (SMS+I and SMS only) and at baseline and 12 months for control participants. Individual appointments were at community centres, universities, NHS clinical research facilities, voluntary sector organisations, GP practice premises or the participant’s home if no suitable alternative venue could be found. At the 12-month appointment, all participants received a £20 voucher as reimbursement for their time. No travel expenses were provided.</p>
                <p>The text message delivery system automatically recorded the frequency of responses received to the texts. The website automatically recorded engagement with self-monitoring tools.</p>
                <p>Self-report questionnaires were completed during appointments and measured sociodemographics, comorbidities, disability, ethnicity and perceptions on intervention acceptability. Overall satisfaction with the intervention was assessed with the item: ‘<italic>On a scale from 0 (not satisfied at all) to 100 (completely satisfied). How satisfied are you with the Game of Stones programme?</italic>’. Acceptability of the intervention was assessed with the stem ‘<italic>Overall the Game of Stones programme has been…</italic>’ followed by options ‘<italic>understandable</italic>’, ‘<italic>useful</italic>’, ‘<italic>helpful</italic>’, ‘<italic>interesting</italic>’ and ‘<italic>relevant</italic>’, with responses captured on a five-point scale ranging from ‘<italic>totally disagree</italic>’ to ‘<italic>totally agree</italic>’. Helpfulness of the intervention was assessed with the item ‘<italic>How helpful have you found the following in helping you lose weight?</italic>’ followed by options ‘<italic>text messages</italic>’, ‘<italic>website</italic>’ and ‘<italic>pedometer</italic>’, with responses captured on a five-point scale ranging from ‘<italic>totally unhelpful</italic>’ to ‘<italic>totally helpful</italic>’. Measures of overall satisfaction, acceptability and helpfulness were adapted from Dombrowski <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
</p>
                <p>Height was measured at baseline using a portable standing stadiometer (Seca 217, Birmingham, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm. Prior to weight measurements, participants removed shoes and bulky clothing and items from their pockets. Weight was recorded using portable calibrated electronic scales (Marsden M420, Rotherham, UK) to the nearest 0.01 kg and waist circumference using a tape measure (Seca 203, Birmingham, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm at all assessment visits.</p>
                <p>Information on possible adverse events was recorded at assessment visits via open questions and through automatic monitoring of text message replies including words like ‘suicide’, ‘die’, and ‘death’ indicative of potential adverse events, which were notified to the research team by email.</p>
                <p>Any negative participant reactions to their randomised group were recorded in researcher field notes. Willingness to be randomised was assessed by recording the number of participants refusing randomisation.</p>
                <p>Interviews took place during 3-month and 12-month appointments and were conducted face-to-face, and detailed methods are described elsewhere.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> All audio recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. At 3 months, all SMS+I and SMS-only men were invited to participate in either a brief feedback or an in-depth interview (participant choice). The 3-month topic guide focused on the early acceptability of the intervention components in order to identify any refinements required over the remaining 9-month intervention. For the 12-month qualitative interviews, separate topic guides for the three trial groups were informed by the analysis of the 3-month interviews and researcher field notes to gain information power<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> to address the study objectives. Purposive sampling from the three trial groups was informed by the 3-month interview data and researcher field notes to provide diversity of perspectives. Researcher field notes taken at all assessments were referred to when interpreting interview data.</p>
                <p>Qualitative interviews were conducted face-to-face with 50 of 58 men who attended the 3-month assessment (7–61 min, median=23 min). At 12 months, interviews were conducted with 14 participants from SMS+I (13–65 min, median=33 min), 13 from SMS only (10–59 min, median=28 min) and 6 from the control group (7–18 min, median=11 min). Fourteen interviews at 12 months lasted &lt;20 min including control participants who had received no contact from the research team between baseline and 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Quantitative analysis</title>
                  <p>All continuous variables were summarised and tabulated using the following descriptive statistics: N (number of valid non-missing responses), mean and SD. Likert-scale variables were treated as continuous measures. The frequency and percentages (based on the non-missing sample size) of observed levels are reported for all categorical measures. The proportion of individuals contacted who were recruited and the proportions retained and withdrawn at each assessment by group was determined. Missing weight data are presented as baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) in addition to observed cases only.</p>

                  <p>Anonymised transcripts of interviews were entered into NVivo12 software for analysis guided by the framework approach together with attributes for recruitment channel, attendance at assessments, trial group and participant characteristics and weight loss outcomes.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Reference to researcher field notes contributed to interview data interpretation. Iterative data collection and analysis were driven by the key feasibility and acceptability research questions and objectives. A coding frame was developed by three researchers independently reading a diverse sample of six interviews, followed by a team discussion to finalise the coding frame and identify key themes. Independent coding was conducted by four researchers (EC, NG, MM and RS) and checked for consistency by FH. Two independent researchers (EC and NG) who were not involved in any other aspect of the study assisted with coding and analysis to enhance rigour and reliability of data analysis. Emergent themes and interpretive analysis were discussed at weekly researcher meetings and at two coinvestigator qualitative interpretation meetings.</p>
                  <p>At the final stage of mixed methods data interpretation, the quantitative attributes on NVivo were drawn on to triangulate the analysis and suggest further avenues for interrogation. Matrix coding queries in NVivo were generated to cross-reference attributes for trial group, participant SIMD and weight loss outcome at 12 months, with nodes coded for views of incentives and texts messages, respectively. Credibility and reliability of qualitative analysis was enhanced by independent coding, use of memos to ensure transparency of interpretation and interpretive charting conducted with input from the wider study team.</p>

                <p>Overall, 177 men expressed an interest in the study. Baseline appointments were attended by 111 (63%), of which 6 (5%) were ineligible. All 105 men were willing to be randomised and consented to be randomised to the SMS+I (n=36), SMS only (n=33) and control (n=36) groups.</p>
                <p>GP practice recruitment was undertaken in five GP practices (site A: n=4, site B: n=1) with 45 men recruited and randomised through GP practices. The additional 60 men were recruited through community outreach.</p>
                <p>The 12-month assessment was completed by 79/105 participants (75%). One of the 79 participants (control group) could not attend and provided self-reported information because he was out of the region due to work commitments, which means that 74% (78/105) of participants were retained for weight assessments at 12 months. Overall 12-month retention differed by group (SMS+I=23/36, 64%; SMS only=26/33, 79%; control=30/36, 83%). Fourteen participants (13%) were lost to follow-up, and 12 participants (11%) withdrew. Reasons for withdrawal were dislike of narrative texts (n=4), health (n=3), family (n=1), unknown (n=1), dissatisfaction with group allocation (n=1), appointment logistics (n=1) and multiple reasons (n=1).</p>

                  <p>Helpfulness ratings of the narrative texts, webpage and pedometer were highest for the pedometer and relatively stable throughout the measurement time points. At 12 months, helpfulness ratings (out of 5) for the pedometer were 3.9, 4.0 and 3.7 for the SMS+I, SMS only and control groups, respectively. The narrative texts (SMS+I=3.4; SMS only=3.3) and the webpage (SMS+I=3.6; SMS only=3.4; control=3.5) were perceived as somewhat helpful on average at 12 months.</p>
                  <p>Minimal contamination between intervention groups was observed, with one participant at 6 and 12 months (SMS+I group) and another at 12 months (control group) reporting meeting other men in the study.</p>

                  <title>Acceptability of narrative text messages</title>
                  <p>Some men sent spontaneous replies to the narrative texts (0–3 months n=25/69, 36%; 3–6 months n=8/69, 12%, 6–12 months n=13/69, 19%; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary 2</xref>). Most spontaneous replies were received between 0 and 3 months (n=370 replies) and decreased at 3–6 months (n=16 replies) and 6–12 months (n=39 replies).</p>
                  <p>Eleven participants (11/69, 16%) requested to no longer receive texts but asked to remain in the trial. Requests to stop narrative texts were similar in both groups (SMS+I=5/36, 14%; SMS only=6/33, 18%) and occurred throughout the study. Four participants (4/69, 6%) withdrew due to dislike of narrative texts between baseline and 3 months, two in each intervention group.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative interviews at 3 and 12 months demonstrated varied views on the narrative texts. Participants’ views ranged from positive to indifferent to negative. Those who liked the narrative texts found the storyline entertaining, engaging and some participants felt a certain camaraderie for the main character:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>You get involved in the content and you start following the script, they're very funny and me being a (from city name) you can see the funny side and you can see the wit in that, …. and that's what keeps you reading them. (210010, SMS only, 12 months)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>For other participants, the frequency of texts became a source of irritation, the storyline did not resonate with their own experience nor could they empathise with the fictional characters:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>I’m not a lover of chocolate, biscuits, cake, ice cream, I hardly ever touch them, hardly ever, so hearing about somebody eating pizza or sweets means nothing to me because I don't eat them anyway. (120002, SMS+I, 12 months)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some were uncertain of the role of the texts in helping to support weight loss. Others expressed an indifference towards the texts and a decreasing interest in the story over time leading to infrequent engagement with text content. However, the regular reminder of being a participant in a weight loss programme through receiving texts was seen as important:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>I often wonder, do they relate to myself here. And the only commonality is both trying to lose weight. So in that respect it’s just a reminder all the time, you should be reviewing your weight and watching what you’re eating, so… from that it’s a positive, yeah. (220017, SMS+I, 3 months)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>A matrix coding query and analysis of the quotations generated from the NVivo qualitative and demographic data suggested no obvious relationships between the participant SIMD level and the qualitative accounts of acceptability of the narrative texts. This is in line with quantitative data showing similar acceptability ratings for overall programme satisfaction and helpfulness ratings of the narrative texts across SIMD levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary 3</xref>). Some men would have liked more interactivity built into the texts; however, the text message system was set up for unidirectional messaging only.</p>

                  <title>Acceptability of endowment incentive</title>
                  <p>At 3 months, 31/36 SMS+I participants attended the appointment, with eight men losing 5% or more of their baseline weight and securing £50. Attendance at 6 months was lower (n=23/36), with five participants achieving the weight loss target of &gt;10% weight loss securing £150 each, and a further three participants losing between ≥5% and 10% of weight securing between £75 and £150. At 12 months, 23/36 participants attended the appointment, with three achieving &gt;10% weight loss securing £200, and a further seven losing between ≥5% and 10% of weight securing between £100 and £200.</p>
                  <p>Overall, £2955 was paid in total to the 11 participants (11/36, 31%) successfully meeting or partially meeting weight loss targets. The full £400 was secured by three participants (3/36, 8%). The cost of the incentive per participant was £81.94 (95% CI £34.59 to £129.30). All participants who completed the study and secured money at 3 or 6 months received it at the end of the study. No participant lost previously secured money due to weight regain to baseline weight at 12 months. One participant secured money at an early appointment but withdrew from the study, did not attend at 12 months and did not receive any money.</p>
                  <p>No negative views were expressed about the incentives in qualitative interviews. Only one man reported being motivated by the financial incentive, and many expressed indifference. Participants reported the weight loss and health benefits as sufficiently rewarding.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>The money’s not that much of an issue. I think the incentive for me is the health that, at the end of the day, your health improves. That’s the most important incentive. The money, it’s fine, it’s there, but it’s not the incentive. (120022, SMS+I, 3 months)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some interpreted the incentives as a final reward linked to their weight loss targets, whereas others fully understood the intended use of the loss aversion concept:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>[W]e all know how much more distress it causes you to lose money than the pleasure of finding a fiver down the back of the couch, you know, so I think if you lose something it almost has a bigger impact on you than if you gain. (220040, SMS+I, 3 months)</p>

                  <p>Some participants used the self-monitoring features on the webpage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary 2</xref>) and reported valuing the ability to visually track their weight in interviews. However, most did not access the website. The majority (77%) did not own a pedometer at baseline, and pedometers were highly acceptable to participants.</p>

Six qualitative interviews were conducted with men in the control group covering topics including acceptability of waiting 12 months for text messages, views about the study and improvement suggestions. Many reported being pleased to be involved in a research study. One participant had a strong negative reaction to being randomised to the control group and subsequently withdrew when invited to the 12-month assessment.</p>

                <title>Principal findings</title>
                <p>This study successfully recruited 105 men from across the socioeconomic spectrum to a three-armed RCT and overall achieved 74% retention at 12-months follow-up. Men living in more disadvantaged areas formed 60% of the sample. Narrative texts were broadly acceptable, but some participants disengaged or withdrew from the study due to dislike of texts. The endowment incentives were acceptable, and improving health was reported as a key motivator for weight loss. Positive indicative effects of weight loss were found in intervention and control groups.</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
                <p>This study was underpinned by the ROMEO systematic reviews and qualitative evidence synthesis of weight loss interventions for men with obesity,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> with a continuing PPI partnership with the Men’s Health Forum GB and Ireland charities. Mixed methods research combined quantitative and qualitative data which, together with patient, public and stakeholder involvement, provided a multilens perspective on this study.</p>
                <p>Most assessments were not blind to group allocation. The difference in assessment schedules for intervention and control groups meant that study staff were only partially blind. A full trial should ensure full blinding of all outcome assessments. Researchers were unable to collect data via qualitative interviews, questionnaires and anthropometric measures with men who withdrew from the study or were lost to follow-up at the 12-month appointment. Those providing a withdrawal reason may have provided socially desirable responses. Text messages were personalised by including the participant’s name and weight unit preference, but no tailoring or interactivity was possible due to technical limitations of the delivery system. This feasibility trial was not powered to detect effects on weight loss, and in line with recommendations,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> no p values are reported. Weight outcomes should be interpreted with caution.</p>

                <title>Relation to other studies</title>
                <p>The Game of Stones study adds to the evidence base demonstrating the feasibility of recruiting men for research on sensitive subjects, such as obesity, through community outreach and GP practice lists.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>
</p>
                <p>The average BMI and age of the study participants of around 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 50–55 years is similar to UK weight management trials recruiting in the community,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> primary care<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> or a combination of community and primary care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Three international text message-based weight management studies examining outcomes after 12 months recruited younger participants with lower BMI.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43–45</xref> However, three mixed sex weight management studies with financial incentives (two including text message components) reported broadly similar participant demographics to this study.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46–48</xref>
</p>
                <p>Retention levels of 74% were acceptable and are similar to systematic review evidence of men-only weight loss interventions, which found an average retention of 78%, ranging from 44% to 100%.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> International text message studies with mixed sex participants report similar retention rates at 12 months of 70.3%<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and 73%,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> with one study conducted in Latvia reporting 93% retention.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Two large UK studies recruiting mixed sex participants with obesity to weight management in primary care reported 75%<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and 81%<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> retention at 12 months.</p>
                <p>Two previous narrative text message intervention studies in men targeting alcohol reduction reported high acceptability levels and no negative reactions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> However, these studies were only 12 weeks in duration and overall contained fewer texts. The narrative texts in this study were broadly acceptable, although some negative reactions were reported. Study withdrawal due to texts and requests to stop texts suggests that the current narrative texts may not be universally acceptable to men. The text messages were designed by a professional scriptwriter/researcher with PPI input from the target population of men from disadvantaged backgrounds, but the narrative texts were similarly acceptable across the socioeconomic spectrum. Intervention fidelity was high with the majority of sent texts successfully delivered, and no adverse events were encountered, similar to previous text message-based intervention studies.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>
</p>
                <p>The use of a financial incentive strategy for weight loss in men with obesity across the socioeconomic spectrum was feasible and acceptable. Two previous incentive studies used text messages to inform participants about their incentive achievement of weight loss targets and found it acceptable.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> This extends the evidence base on the use of financial incentives as a complementary behaviour change strategy alongside other components.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 50</xref>
</p>
                <p>The financial incentive strategy was designed with future sustainability in mind and to be attractive to public sector funders. The text messages and incentive components are mostly automated, encourage self-management of weight and have a low administrative burden with one bank transfer pay out after 12 months and verification of weight loss at 3, 6 and 12 months. Yancy <italic>et al</italic> similarly provided incentives at 3 and 6 months for their 6-months incentive intervention.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> John <italic>et al</italic> asked participants to be weighed monthly, for which they received $20 per visit.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Few RCTs examine financial incentive strategies that are delivered for at least 12 months.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Two other studies providing financial incentives for 12 months provided an intensive financial incentive schedule either weekly<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> or monthly.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Previous studies typically provided participants with weekly weight loss goals such as 1 lb (0.45 kg) per week, on which financial incentives were contingent.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> While these goals are similar to the weight loss targets in the current study, there were no intermittent or weekly targets. A balance needs to be struck between having more regular weight measurements and more immediate pay-outs, costs and future sustainability.</p>

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> applied a similar framing which they called a loss incentive. University employees were allocated a monthly hypothetical incentive of $42 upfront, and $1.40 was taken away each time their daily goal of 7000 steps was not met. The current study adds to the evidence base demonstrating the acceptability and feasibility of loss framed interventions for weight loss and in settings outside workplaces.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study tests a novel combination of narrative SMS with endowment incentives that have not previously been combined in this way to address weight loss and weight loss maintenance in men with obesity. This three-arm feasibility trial recruited men from across the socioeconomic spectrum with the majority coming from disadvantaged areas, had an acceptable retention rate and was broadly acceptable to most participants, and feasible to deliver. Acceptability and feasibility progression criteria were met. A full trial is warranted to determine effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, with consideration of scalability.</p>
