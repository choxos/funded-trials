                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p>Dietary changes have led to the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A hallmark of both disorders is hepatic lipid accumulation, derived in part from increased de novo lipogenesis. Despite the popularity of high-protein diets for weight loss, the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipogenesis is poorly studied. We aimed to characterize the effect of dietary protein on de novo lipid synthesis.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>We use a 3-way crossover interventional study in healthy males to determine the effect of high-protein feeding on de novo lipogenesis, combined with in vitro models to determine the lipogenic effects of specific amino acids. The primary outcome was a change in de novo lipogenesis–associated triglycerides in response to protein feeding.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>We demonstrate that high-protein feeding, rich in glutamate, increases de novo lipogenesis–associated triglycerides in plasma (1.5-fold compared with control; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and liver-derived very low-density lipoprotein particles (1.8-fold; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in samples from human subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 9 per group). In hepatocytes, we show that glutamate-derived carbon is incorporated into triglycerides via palmitate. In addition, supplementation with glutamate, glutamine, and leucine, but not lysine, increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased glucose uptake. Glutamate, glutamine, and leucine increased activation of protein kinase B, suggesting that induction of de novo lipogenesis occurs via the insulin signaling cascade.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>These findings provide mechanistic insight into how select amino acids induce de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance, suggesting that high-protein feeding to tackle diabetes and obesity requires greater consideration.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Recent rapid changes in diet have coincided with modernization, urbanization, economic development, and increased population wealth, and have had a profound effect on body composition and health status (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The transition from traditional diets, high in cereal and fiber, to Western-style diets, high in sugars, fat, and animal-derived products, is thought to be a key contributor to the obesity epidemic and increased incidences of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Both NAFLD and T2DM (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) have been associated with increased hepatic lipid production via de novo lipogenesis (DNL). This pathway synthesizes new fat, utilizing acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) as a carbon source, derived from a number of metabolic reactions, including glycolysis or the deamination of amino acids. Fatty-acyl chains can then be incorporated into a variety of lipid species, including triacylglycerols (TAGs) and phospholipids. The pathway commences by carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl-CoA is then transferred to a complex multifunctional enzyme, fatty acid synthase (FAS). Multiple rounds of activation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, transferral to FAS, and addition to the lengthening carbon chain generate palmitate (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>DNL is regulated at a transcriptional level by both glucose and insulin. It has previously been established that hyperinsulinemia and high carbohydrate diets “prime” DNL by providing a large substrate pool (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Glucose also stimulates the expression of anabolic DNL genes, including those encoding ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), ACC, and FAS (<italic>ACLY</italic>, <italic>ACACA</italic>, and <italic>FASN</italic>, respectively) by the action of the transcription factor carbohydrate response element–binding protein (ChREBP) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In turn, insulin activates the same genes, via protein kinase B/AKT2 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), by the action of SREBP-1c, one of 2 transcripts produced from the sterol response element–binding protein gene. Once fatty acids (FAs) are synthesized, they are desaturated via the action of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and/or elongated by elongation of very long FAs protein 6 (ELOVL6). Finally, FAs may be incorporated into TAGs and packaged into VLDLs for export.</p>
              <p>Accumulation of a subset of shorter-chain TAGs (scTAGs) and VLDL-associated scTAGs in the liver and blood, respectively, has been associated with DNL and hepatic steatosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In healthy humans, the amount of de novo produced TAG incorporated in VLDL is small (below 5%) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, in hyperinsulinemic individuals with NAFLD, de novo produced TAG content increases to 26% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Furthermore, in healthy human subjects, feeding with a high-carbohydrate meal is sufficient to increase DNL-derived TAG content to 23% (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). While numerous studies have shown that high-carbohydrate feeding increases DNL (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), studies of the effect of high-protein feeding in relation to DNL in humans are limited.</p>
              <p>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine are known to correlate with insulin resistance and T2DM in humans (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that deprivation of BCAAs from the diet while maintaining levels of other amino acids is sufficient to improve glycemic control (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Increased circulating BCAAs are sensed by mTOR, a protein kinase that is a critical node of the insulin signaling cascade, and subsequently promote DNL (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by excessive amino acid concentrations leads to phosphorylation of multiple serine residues within, and subsequent inactivation of, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This results in a weakened response to insulin, progressing to persistent insulin resistance. Despite this, high-protein/low-carbohydrate diets are popular regimes for weight loss in humans, and dietary protein has been shown to decrease hepatic lipid accumulation in rodents (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). At present, the precise amino acid components that are responsible for these effects, and the extent to which amino acids are able to induce DNL and VLDL secretion, are not known.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study was to characterize the effect of dietary amino acids on DNL. We demonstrate that high-protein feeding, using a soy protein intervention rich in glutamate, results in increased levels of scTAGs and VLDL-associated scTAGs, which have been associated with DNL (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), in plasma of human male subjects. Only males were recruited due to the large difference between the lipid profiles of men and premenopausal women arising from different sex hormones, which are important regulators of lipid metabolism (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We also determine that glutamate induces DNL and is itself incorporated in FAs via the TCA cycle in hepatocytes, most likely via reductive carboxylation. In addition, supplementation with leucine and glutamine in hepatocytes resulted in a significant increase in scTAGs as well as a decrease in glucose uptake. This may provide insight into the negative effects of BCAAs on insulin sensitivity and metabolic health, and was recapitulated with both glutamine and glutamate but not lysine supplementation.</p>

                <title>scTAGs are major discriminant variables between high-protein- and control-fed healthy male subjects.</title>
                <p>Nine healthy male subjects completed the trial protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>); baseline characteristics for these volunteers are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The subjects consumed an isoenergetic (2 MJ) control (C) meal, high-protein (HP) meal, and a high-fat (HF) meal, and plasma samples were collected hourly over 6 hours. To assess changes in the plasma triglyceride profiles obtained by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS), data were processed by constructing principal components analysis (PCA) models to identify the distribution of the variables and remove any outliers detected using Hotelling’s T<sup>2</sup> test. Subsequently, orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were created to discriminate between the 3 groups. In the OPLS-DA models, the time points 3, 4, and 5 hours were utilized, as this provided sufficient time for ingested macronutrients to reach the extrahepatic blood (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). OPLS-DA readily separated the HP group from the C group (<italic>R<sup>2</sup>X</italic> = 0.84, <italic>Q<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.47; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, there was a less clear separation between the HP group and the HF group (<italic>R<sup>2</sup>X</italic> = 0.54, <italic>Q<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.32; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both models were validated using permutation tests, yielding <italic>R<sup>2</sup>X</italic> and <italic>Q<sup>2</sup></italic> values (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = [0.0, 0.56], <italic>Q<sup>2</sup></italic> = [0.0, –0.63]; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = [0.0, 0.21], <italic>Q<sup>2</sup></italic> = [0.0, –0.30], respectively) lower than the original, hence indicating stable and nonrandom models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, C and D</xref>). Cross-validation ANOVA (CV-ANOVA) also showed a significant <italic>P</italic> value for both models (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0063 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0032, respectively).</p>
                <p>The loadings plot of the C versus HP model was then used to determine the metabolite features that differ between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Variable importance in projection (VIP) was utilized to filter important metabolites in the model. The vectors in the projection are regularized such that if all variables were of equal importance, their values would be equal to 1. Therefore, any variable with a VIP value greater than 1 was considered to be a potential discriminant variable. TAGs containing shorter and more saturated FAs (red circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) were the major VIPs increased in the HP group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
                <p>The TAG profiles were further analyzed by hierarchical clustering, and heatmap representations were obtained from the Spearman’s correlation matrix among metabolites. One of the clusters contained scTAGs with more saturated FAs, indicating that changes in TAG levels were consistent within members of the cluster, with these scTAGs having been previously correlated with DNL and steatosis, as well as cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and risk of developing T2DM (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.124819DS1">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.124819DS1</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>HP feeding in healthy male subjects increases scTAGs in both plasma and the LDL/VLDL fraction.</title>
                <p>The total amount of triglycerides was not significantly different among the 3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, total scTAGs were markedly elevated in HP-fed subjects 3 hours after feeding compared with the same individuals fed the C or HF meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). After an overnight fast and subsequent feeding with the HP meal, there was an increase in scTAGs up to 4 hours compared with baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). There were no significant differences in scTAGs between the baseline and hourly samples in C- and HF-fed subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine whether these TAGs were produced by the liver and not the intestine, we extracted LDL/VLDL through a series of precipitation and low-speed centrifugation steps and analyzed their TAG profile. In line with changes in plasma, the sum of scTAGs in the LDL/VLDL fraction was higher in HP-fed than C-fed subjects after 3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). FAs from the meal as well as free FAs (FFAs) are major precursors of lipoprotein TAGs. The C and HP meals did not have any differences in FA composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>) or in plasma FFA content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that these TAGs were synthesized de novo.</p>
                <p>The plasma 16:0/18:2n-6 ratio was calculated as an index of DNL, since during DNL plasma TAGs are enriched with 16:0, the primary product of FAS, and depleted in 18:2n-6, an essential FA (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). At 4 hours, where we saw the biggest increase in scTAGs, the 16:0/18:2n-6 ratio was significantly greater after an HP meal than after the C meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Increases in DNL during high protein feeding may be explained by increases in insulin. However, the insulin peak at 30 minutes was not significantly different between the C and HP groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <title>Glutamate acts as a substrate for the synthesis of TAGs via the TCA cycle and DNL-derived palmitate in AML12 hepatocytes.</title>
                <p>Under physiological conditions, carbohydrates act as the canonical source of substrate for DNL. However, the contribution of amino acids, derived from protein-rich diets, is less well understood beyond the context of oncometabolism. To determine whether amino acids act as substrates for DNL under conditions of typical carbohydrate supply (approximately 5 mmol/l), we supplemented alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) hepatocytes with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-labeled glutamate, the most abundant amino acid in the HP meal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 2</xref>), to trace its metabolic fate. The carbon backbone of glutamate may enter the TCA cycle via deamination to α-ketoglutarate. Analysis of subsequent TCA cycle intermediates using mass spectrometry showed that, compared with unlabeled samples, the levels of labeled TCA cycle intermediate citrate [M+2]<sup>+</sup> and [M+5]<sup>+</sup> (mass of the unlabeled compound plus 2 or 5 Da for the labeled carbons) were markedly increased in labeled samples over 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the [M+4]<sup>+</sup> citrate generated by the addition of unlabeled acetyl-CoA to [M+4]<sup>+</sup> oxaloacetate cannot supply [M+2]<sup>+</sup>–labeled acetyl-CoA for the synthesis of FAs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). While citrate is chemically symmetrical, the enzymes citrate synthase (CS) and ACL are regiospecific, such that the acetyl-CoA cleaved by ACL is the same as that added by CS (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The <sup>13</sup>C label from glutamate was detected in the [M+4]<sup>+</sup> ion of palmitate, which was found to be significantly increased in labeled samples 3 hours after supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Once FAs are synthesized, they are packaged into TAGs and exported from the liver as VLDL. We further detected the label in the scTAG 48:0 both intracellularly and in the cell culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
                <p>Thus, we suggest the most likely process by which carbon from glutamate was incorporated into FAs was via reductive carboxylation in the TCA cycle. This reverse flow through the TCA cycle typically occurs during periods of decreased NAD<sup>+</sup>-to-NADH ratio, corresponding to high energy balance, which was detected in glutamate-supplemented samples compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Taken together, these data suggest that not only do amino acids provide carbon for use in DNL, the levels of incorporation of amino acid–derived carbon are appreciable even in the presence of physiological glucose concentrations.</p>

                <p>We next sought to determine whether amino acids increase DNL and chose representatives of glucogenic (glutamate and glutamine) and ketogenic (leucine and lysine) amino acids. We supplemented AML12 hepatocytes with increasing concentrations of glutamate, glutamine, leucine, and lysine. As expected, intracellular amino acid levels increased dose dependently in response to the corresponding amino acid increases in media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Total scTAG levels increased dose dependently in response to glutamate, glutamine, and leucine but not lysine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), with the greatest effect achieved by supplementation with leucine. Lysine did not increase the levels of scTAGs, and in separate experiments, label from <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-lysine was not detected in palmitate or palmitate-containing triglycerides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>).</p>

                <title>Glutamate increases the expression of DNL genes.</title>
                <p>The synthesis of VLDL particles may be separated into 3 main processes: synthesis of FAs, elongation and desaturation of FAs, and packing of FAs into TAGs and VLDL. Synthesis of FAs is initiated by ATP-citrate lyase (<italic>Acly</italic>), responsible for lysing citrate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is then carboxylated to malonyl-CoA, via ACC (<italic>Acaca</italic>), which is subsequently utilized by a multifunctional enzyme, FAS (<italic>Fasn</italic>), to synthesize FAs. Increasing levels of glutamate elevated the expression of <italic>Acly</italic> and <italic>Fasn</italic> dose dependently, with a significant increase at 10 mmol/l glutamate after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, there were no changes in the expression of <italic>Acaca</italic>. Once synthesized, palmitate may be desaturated and/or elongated to palmitoleate and stearate by <italic>Scd1</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, respectively. Glutamate increased the expression of <italic>Scd1</italic> (10 mmol/l glutamate) and <italic>Elovl6</italic> (4 and 10 mmol/l glutamate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). FAs are then sequentially esterified to glycerol to form triglycerides, with the terminal step catalyzed by diacylglycerol <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase 2 (<italic>Dgat2</italic>). Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (<italic>Mttp</italic>) is then responsible for shuttling triglycerides through membranes such that they may associate with apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein C-III (<italic>Apoc3</italic>). Glutamate at 10 mmol/l increased the expression of <italic>Dgat2</italic> and <italic>Apoc3</italic> but not <italic>Mttp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

                <title>Glutamate, glutamine, and leucine increase phosphorylation of AKT.</title>
                <p>Through a partially characterized mechanism, insulin activates the transcription factor SREBP1c to induce the expression of genes required for hepatic DNL. A key node in this signaling cascade is PKB/AKT2, a protein kinase that transduces the signal to downstream effectors, such as mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). It is known that amino acids activate mTORC1; however, it has only recently been reported that mTORC1 activation in the absence of PKB/AKT2 is not sufficient to stimulate SREBP1c and thus DNL (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We therefore investigated whether amino acids can act upstream of mTORC1 and activate PKB/AKT2 by quantifying the levels of the active kinase, as a ratio to total PKB/AKT2, via measuring phosphorylation at Ser473. In AML12 hepatocytes, intracellular pPKB/AKT2 levels increased dose dependently in response to glutamate (4 and 10 mmol/l), glutamine (10 mmol/l), and leucine (4 and 10 mmol/l) but not lysine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

This molecule is recognized by glucose transporters, phosphorylated within the cell by glucokinase, but cannot be further metabolized and is thus sequestered within the cell. Upon addition of 2-deoxyglucose, insulin-stimulated uptake was significantly lower in both glutamine- and leucine-supplemented cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10, A and B</xref>, respectively), but not with lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p>

              <p>The latest nutritional transition from traditional to Western-style diets (rich in sugar, fat, and protein from red meat) has led to a growing prevalence of NAFLD and T2DM (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Hepatic lipid accumulation, in part via upregulated levels of DNL, is mutual to the 2 disorders. While it is well established that high-carbohydrate feeding increases DNL (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), studies of the effect of high-protein feeding in relation to DNL in humans, are limited. Despite the fact that high-protein/low-carbohydrate diets are popular regimes for weight loss in humans to prevent obesity and diabetes, recent studies correlated elevated BCAA levels with insulin resistance and T2DM (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The precise dietary amino acid composition that may induce DNL is, as yet, unknown.</p>
              <p>In the present 3-way crossover study, healthy human males consumed 3 meals (C, HP, and HF) in a randomized order. Only young healthy males were included in this study, as premenopausal females have more variable lipid profiles due to the effects of estrogen; as we were limited in sample size by cost and time constraints, we chose to focus on males for this study. As the volunteers were healthy, the effects observed were a consequence of the parameters of the study, without the confounding factor of disease status or variability in lipid profile. In addition, the meals were designed such that all 3 were isocaloric. Consequently, and unavoidably, the carbohydrate content of the meals varied, which may be considered to confound the results. However, the caloric content was considered the more important determining factor in metabolic processes, including DNL, and we therefore opted to make this parameter a constant 2 MJ.</p>
              <p>Lipidomic changes were detected at hours 3, 4, and 5 postprandially, particularly in the TAG class of lipids. Using earlier time points, valid models were not generated, possibly due to the delay between intake of the meal and its subsequent effect on the blood lipidome. Based on the initial multivariate analysis, we opted to focus on a more detailed analysis in the C and HP groups.</p>
              <p>We show that dietary amino acids increase scTAGs that have been previously associated with DNL, steatosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and insulin resistance (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, it should be noted that these scTAGs are not a direct measure of DNL, and it should be considered a limitation of the study that DNL was not directly measured using stable isotope–based approaches. However, we also show that palmitate may readily be derived from glutamate via DNL, suggesting that amino acids may provide carbon as a substrate for this process under physiological substrate concentrations. We determined differential effects of amino acids on scTAGs as well as the expression of genes required for synthesis, processing, and packaging of FAs, likely involving the action of AKT2 in hepatocytes. We demonstrated that an HP meal, rich in glutamate, increased scTAGs in plasma as well as in the LDL/VLDL fraction in healthy human males. These effects occurred following a 12-hour fast, which typically suppresses DNL (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and so may underestimate the physiological consequences of an HP meal in terms of DNL. Thus, these results may have general implications for high-protein diets and T2DM. Studies have previously demonstrated that a higher-protein/lower-carbohydrate diet downregulates DNL (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), typically in longer-term dietary interventions. However, the precise amino acid composition of the high-protein diet was not determined, and as we show herein, activation of DNL is specific to certain amino acid treatments. The precise metabolic parameters and time frame of these effects on DNL remain to be fully elucidated.</p>
              <p>A master regulator of cell growth, mTORC1, is responsible for sensing nutrient signals, particularly amino acids (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The mTORC1 signaling pathway integrates insulin signals, through its phosphorylation by PI3K/AKT2 (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Activation of mTORC1 leads to the nuclear localization of liver X receptor α (LXRα), whereupon it heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to induce the expression of lipogenic genes as well as SREBP1c (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). mTORC1 also mediates the nuclear translocation of SREBP1c, whereby it induces the transcription of genes required for DNL (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). However, it has recently been reported that mTORC1 activation in the absence of AKT2 is not sufficient to stimulate SREBP1c, and thus DNL (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), suggesting that amino acids regulate an upstream node in the pathway, or act in an as-yet-undetermined manner. Our data show that select amino acids — glutamate, glutamine, and leucine but not lysine — activated AKT2. This may also indicate that specific amino acids may regulate mTORC2, responsible for the activation of AKT2 and subsequent induction in expression of genes required for DNL, in support of a signaling pathway proposed by Tato et al. (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Amino acids, branched-chain in particular, have been linked with insulin resistance. The molecular basis is the activation p70 S6k by amino acids (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), a downstream kinase of mTORC1. This in turn phosphorylates the insulin receptor substrate at multiple serine/threonine residues, thereby attenuating glucose uptake. Persistent activation of p70 S6k by excessive amino acid concentrations may therefore lead to insulin resistance (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Herein, we demonstrate that glutamine and leucine decrease glucose uptake, while lysine does not.</p>
              <p>In support of our finding that specific amino acids activate PKB/AKT2, we also demonstrate that the same amino acids increased scTAG content in hepatocytes. Leucine resulted in the greatest increase in scTAG content, followed by glutamine and, last, glutamate. Both glutamate and glutamine increased expression of genes required for the synthesis, processing, and packaging of FAs. Perhaps surprisingly, leucine and the highest concentration of glutamine decreased expression of genes required for synthesis and processing of FAs but increased expression of genes required for packaging. This suggests a possible negative feedback mechanism, whereby accumulation of high levels of scTAGs or other intermediate species (such as fatty acyl-CoAs) in the liver inhibit expression of these genes, but not expression of genes required for subsequent processing and packaging. Indeed, studies demonstrate that unsaturated FAs lower levels of mRNA for SREBP1c by accelerating its degradation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), while longer-chain polyunsaturated FAs are potent inhibitors of ACC (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Our findings also suggest that FA synthesis and processing genes are differentially regulated to packaging genes. SREBP1c induces expression of genes required for the synthesis (<italic>Acly</italic>, <italic>Acaca</italic>, and <italic>Fasn</italic>) and processing (<italic>Scd1</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>) of FAs (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). On the other hand, packaging genes (<italic>Mttp</italic> and <italic>Apoc3</italic>) have been shown to be regulated by the FoxO1 transcription factor (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). FoxO1 is responsible for expression of the gene encoding functional MTP, a protein responsible for the packaging of lipids with nascent apolipoprotein B (only present in VLDL) in the endoplasmic reticulum. The action of MTP on the growing VLDL particle is a rate-limiting step in their formation and release into the blood. Elevated levels of MTP increase the secretion of VLDL by the liver and correlate with the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and T2DM (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). FoxO1 is itself negatively regulated by insulin, which causes its phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In cases of impaired insulin regulation, this may result in uncontrollable levels of MTP (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) expression. The production of hepatic, but not intestinal, apolipoprotein CIII is also controlled by FoxO1 via the –498/–403 element in the <italic>apoC3</italic> promoter (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Two separate insulin signaling axes, PI3K/PKB/AKT2 and MAPK(erk), may be responsible for this inhibition. While there is evidence supporting a role for both axes (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), our data suggest that PI3K/PKB/AKT2 is not involved in this inhibition, as the expression of <italic>Mttp</italic> and <italic>apoC3</italic> is increased in the presence of increased PKB/AKT2. This is consistent with the work of Au et al., which demonstrated that insulin inhibits the transcription of <italic>Mttp</italic> via the MAPK(erk) signaling cascade, but not that of PI3K (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In the context of insulin resistance and the development of fatty liver via dysregulated rates of DNL, it might be considered hepatoprotective to increase the rate at which liver-derived lipoproteins are exported, at least in the shorter term. However, it is unlikely that prolonged hypertriglyceridemia, brought about by chronic insulin resistance, has equally beneficial effects on long-term metabolic health.</p>
              <p>In summary, our data indicate that high-protein feeding increases scTAG content in post-fasting, healthy human male plasma, indicative of hepatic DNL, and in liver-derived lipoproteins. We also demonstrate that specific amino acids are responsible for these effects in a cell culture system. The human study utilized only 9 male subjects; this should be expanded in a larger and more diverse cohort before generalized applicability is possible. As dietary trends have shifted toward high-carbohydrate/high-fat consumption, and high-protein diets are popularized as healthier alternatives, the data herein suggest that this is a more complex consideration. Therefore, advocating the consumption of protein in the treatment of diabetes and obesity requires a more profound understanding of the roles of amino acids in the context of hepatic DNL in larger cohort studies.</p>

                  <p>The study was divided into recruitment, prescreening questionnaire, and screening visit and 3 separate study days. Nine healthy, nonsmoking men took part in a randomized, 3-way crossover study. Twenty-four hours before each trial day, the diet and activity of each participant were monitored. On the trial day, participants attended the Medical Research Council — Elsie Widdowson Laboratory (MRC-EWL) for 7 hours and received one of the 3 isoenergetic mixed meals in a randomized order. Nine subjects were randomized into one block. Randomization was generated using a computerized program that generates random permutations. Volunteers were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio, such that each volunteer consumed all 3 meals within a period of 6 weeks. The isoenergetic meals comprised: control (C; 15% protein, 40% fat, 45% carbohydrate), high-protein (HP; 32% protein, 33% fat, 35% carbohydrate), and high-fat (HF; 14% protein, 62% fat, 24% carbohydrate).</p>

During the 6-hour period, food consumption was not allowed, and only water was permitted ad libitum after 3 hours had elapsed. Blood samples were collected at 12 time points at various intervals throughout the 6-hour period (T1–T6) to perform mass spectrometry and determine blood lipid changes after an HP meal.</p>

                <p>The organic fraction was reconstituted in 100 μl chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 10 μl added to 90 μl IPA/acetonitrile/water (2:1:1). Analysis of the fractions was performed using an LTQ Orbitrap Elite Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). In positive mode, 5 μl sample was injected onto a C18 CSH column, 1.7-μm pore size, 2.1 mm × 50 mm (catalog 186005296, Waters) which was held at 55°C in a Dionex Ultimate 3000 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific). A gradient (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min) of mobile phase A (acetonitrile/water 60:40, 10 mmol/l ammonium formate) and B (LC-MS–grade acetonitrile/isopropanol (IPA) 10:90, 10 mmol/l ammonium formate) was used. In negative ion mode, 10 μl of the sample was injected and 10 mmol/l ammonium acetate was used as the additive to aid ionization. In both positive and negative ion mode, the gradient began at 40% B; increased to 43% B at 0.8 minutes, 50% B at 0.9 minutes, 54% B at 4.8 minutes, 70% B at 4.9 minutes, and 81% B at 5.8 minutes; spiked at 99% B at 8 minutes for 0.5 minutes; and subsequently returned to the starting conditions for another 1.5 minutes to reequilibrate the column. The HPLC was coupled to an electrospray ionization (ESI) source before entering the mass spectrometer. The data were collected in both positive and negative ion mode with a mass range of 110–2000 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>. Default instrument-generated optimization parameters were used. Tandem MS was performed, using normalized collision energy, to fragment the intact lipids listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 3</xref> in order to identify the fatty acyl chains contained within.</p>

To each dried organic extract 200 μl of 10 μmol/l deuterated internal standard mix (containing FAs 13:0, 15:0, 17:0, and 20:0) were added and dried under nitrogen. Each sample was fully resuspended in 200 μl oxalyl chloride (2 mol/l in dichloromethane, catalog 310670, Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 65°C in a heating block for 10 minutes, achieving cleavage of FAs from complex lipids and activating the carboxylic group. Samples were then dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 200 μl dichloromethane (catalog 270997, Sigma-Aldrich), and dried again. Each dried residue was then resuspended in 150 μl of 1% 3-hydroxymethylpyridine (catalog P66807, Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to produce derivatized FAs. The dichloromethane resuspension was repeated to ensure unreacted 3-hydroxymethylpyridine had evaporated, dried under nitrogen, and stored at –80°C until analysis.</p>

Mobile phase A was 100% water with 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B was 50:50 acetonitrile/IPA with 0.1% formic acid. The chromatography gradient started at 30% B for 2.33 minutes, increased to 100% B over 1.34 minutes, and decreased to 30% B for 1.23 minutes (to reequilibrate the column) at a flow rate of 0.735 ml/min. Default instrument-generated optimization parameters were used. Xcalibur Software (Thermo Scientific) was used to identify peaks, process mass spectra, and normalize data to the closest-eluting internal standard.</p>

                <p>Samples obtained from human subjects were acquired in 2 analytical batches with the analytical method described above, along with a set of quality controls (QCs, obtained by pooling 15 μl of all samples). The resulting raw data files were converted into mzML format using the tool MSConvert of Proteowizard software (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), and further processed within the R environment (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) with the libraries IPO, XCMS, and CAMERA (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) to perform parameter optimization based on the QC samples, peak extraction, grouping, retention time correction, and annotation of adducts and isotopes. The output from these preprocessing steps was exported as a CSV file and imported into an adapted implementation of the KniMet (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) pipeline for postprocessing. The LOESS batch correction utility was used to normalize for differences among the 2 analytical batches (based on QCs for intra-batch correction, and on all samples for inter-batch). Features were filtered first based on their presence in the QC samples on the 2 separate batches, with the QC-based feature filtering functionality (thresholds for missing values and relative standard deviation [RSD]/coefficient of variation [CV] = 50% and 20%, respectively), while median peak area comparison, as previously described by Dunn and coworkers (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), was used on the merged dataset. A summary of the CVs for key lipids is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 3</xref>.

The models were validated by a permutation test (<italic>n</italic> = 100), and their significance (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) was assessed by submitting the scores of the models to a CV-ANOVA test. Loadings plots and the VIP were acquired for each model to determine which variables drive the separation between classes (threshold limit &gt;1.0). Once metabolites were annotated in KniMet and analyzed in SIMCA, the most discriminant variables were TAGs. Fragmentation (as described above) was performed on a group of TAGs to confirm their identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>These TAGs were subsequently visualized using univariate statistics. The extent to which the model fits and predicts the data is represented by <italic>R<sup>2</sup>X</italic> and <italic>Q<sup>2</sup>X</italic>, respectively. For univariate statistical analyses, data were visualized using GraphPad (Prism 5.2; GraphPad Software). All data are expressed as mean with SEM. In GraphPad, 1- or 2-way ANOVA was performed where appropriate to determine significant differences between experimental groups. For 1-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s post hoc multiple-comparisons test was performed, while for 2-way ANOVA, Šidák’s post hoc multiple-comparisons test was used. Differences between experimental groups were considered to be statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05.</p>
                <p>Spearman’s correlation among the metabolic features annotated as TAGs deriving from open-profiling lipidomics was calculated and visualized within R (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) using the cor function of the stat package and the heatmap.2 function of the gplots library (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), respectively.</p>

                <p>Seventeen males were screened to examine whether they met the inclusion criteria of the study. Six of them did not meet the criteria, and another 2 declined to participate. Nine volunteers participated in a randomized 3-way-crossover study. The same 9 volunteers attended the Medical Research Council – Elsie Widdowson Laboratory on 3 different occasions and received one of the 3 isoenergetic meals (control [C], high-protein [HP], and high-fat [HF]) in a randomized order each time. Blood samples were collected at different time points for lipid profile and hormonal analysis. The study was ended once all participants consumed the 3 meals.</p>
