                <p id="Par1">The SERCA-LVAD trial was a phase 2a trial assessing the safety and feasibility of delivering an adeno-associated vector 1 carrying the cardiac isoform of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (AAV1/SERCA2a) to adult chronic heart failure patients implanted with a left ventricular assist device. The SERCA-LVAD trial was one of a program of AAV1/SERCA2a cardiac gene therapy trials including CUPID1, CUPID 2 and AGENT trials. Enroled subjects were randomised to receive a single intracoronary infusion of 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>13</sup> DNase-resistant AAV1/SERCA2a particles or a placebo solution in a double-blinded design, stratified by presence of neutralising antibodies to AAV. Elective endomyocardial biopsy was performed at 6 months unless the subject had undergone cardiac transplantation, with myocardial samples assessed for the presence of exogenous viral DNA from the treatment vector. Safety assessments including ELISPOT were serially performed. Although designed as a 24 subject trial, recruitment was stopped after five subjects had been randomised and received infusion due to the neutral result from the CUPID 2 trial. Here we describe the results from the 5 patients at 3 years follow up, which confirmed that viral DNA was delivered to the failing human heart in 2 patients receiving gene therapy with vector detectable at follow up endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac transplantation. Absolute levels of detectable transgene DNA were low, and no functional benefit was observed. There were no safety concerns in this small cohort. This trial identified some of the challenges of performing gene therapy trials in this LVAD patient cohort which may help guide future trial design.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) gene therapy is being developed as a potential new treatment for chronic heart failure (HF). SERCA2a gene therapy aims to deliver effective levels of SERCA2a cDNA to the failing myocardium in order to increase production of functional SERCA2a protein and enzyme activity. Restoration of SERCA2a protein levels and activity has recovered left ventricular function in a range of preclinical small and large animal HF models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with an additional antiarrhythmic benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and also improved contractile function in isolated failing human cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">There was a program of clinical trials including CUPID 1, CUPID 2, AGENT-HF and the present trial, SERCA-LVAD, aiming to understand the safety, feasibility and then efficacy, of cardiac SERCA2a gene therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The initial CUPID1 trial delivering SERCA2a gene therapy via intracoronary infusion of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding the SERCA2a gene, under regulation of a cytomegalovirus promoter, to adult HF patients was published in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This showed the procedure safety in a dose-response study and a potential efficacy signal in the subgroup receiving 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>13</sup> DNase-resistant particles. The safety and improvements were maintained at 3 years follow up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. CUPID2, a phase 2b randomised, placebo-controlled trial, recruited 250 patients and was powered for efficacy, but showed no benefit of this dose (although made by a different manufacturing process compared with CUPID1) in patients with advanced HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The AGENT-HF and SERCA-LVAD trials were terminated prematurely when the CUPID2 trial reported neutral results. Both AGENT-HF, which was specifically investigating ventricular remodelling and recruited 9 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the SERCA-LVAD trial used the same dose and batch of AAV1/SERCA2a as CUPID2.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are a mechanical circulatory support treatment for patients with advanced HF and are typically used as a bridge-to-heart transplantation or as a destination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There has been increasing LVAD use in the last 15 years, leading to a growing population of HF patients living with LVADs. Long term LVAD treatment is associated with a number of potential complications, including infection, stroke, haemorrhage, pump thrombosis, acquired aortic valve regurgitation, right HF and (now rarely) mechanical failure. Urgent LVAD implantation for acute cardiac failure (e.g., acute myocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy) may facilitate ventricular recovery, weaning and explantation (bridge-to-recovery). Efforts to recover the function of failing myocardium in patients with chronic HF have been more challenging. There is evidence that patients who successfully recovered ventricular function during LVAD support had higher sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium stores, and faster relaxation of myocytes biopsied, compared with patients who failed to recover and myocytes from end-stage failing hearts pre-LVAD or transplant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Whether these changes were causative or associative is unknown, but these observations raise the hypothesis that improving myocardial calcium physiology via restoring SERCA2a activity and SR calcium stores could improve ventricular function and possibly recover cardiac function to a level where LVAD support could be weaned.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The SERCA-LVAD trial was designed to address the safety and feasibility of SERCA2a gene therapy delivered using an AAV vector to adult patients with chronic HF and LVAD support. The specific aims of the trial were to assess safety of SERCA2a gene therapy in this new patient population and the magnitude of viral gene transfer to the human failing myocardium in a systematic manner. It had also been intended to investigate the influence of prior circulating neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to AAV1 upon myocardial gene transfer, although the recruitment of only one NAb positive patient meant that this question went unanswered.</p>
              <p id="Par6">This trial was initiated in 2014 but following the announcement of the neutral result of CUPID2 trial in April 2015, the SERCA-LVAD trial steering committee suspended recruitment after reviewing the risk:benefit balance for study subjects. Here we present the 3 year follow up results from the 5 subjects who were enroled, randomised and received investigational medicinal product (IMP) infusion in the SERCA-LVAD trial.</p>

                <title>Study overview</title>
                <p id="Par7">The SERCA-LVAD trial was a phase 2a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial assessing the safety and feasibility of a single intracoronary infusion of AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy in adults with chronic HF supported with a LVAD. Subjects were randomised in 2:1 ratio to SERCA2a gene therapy or placebo infusion, with randomisation stratified and based on circulating anti-AAV1 NAb status (presence or absence) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients were scheduled for a left ventricular (LV) endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) at 6 months, unless they underwent cardiac transplantation in the first 6 months following trial infusion. The primary endpoint was safety at 6 months and the key secondary endpoint was presence of vector-specific transgene measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in LV myocardial samples from EMB or cardiac transplantation. Long term safety will be recorded for 10 years as part of routine clinical practice, in accordance with the requirements of the Advanced Therapies Medicinal Products Regulation. The trial was registered (EudraCT number: 2007-002809-48; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00534703), sponsored by Imperial College London. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the UK Gene Therapy Advisory Committee of the National Research Ethics Service and approval was also obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The trial was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the EU Clinical Trial Directive, and all human tissue was collected under appropriate ethical approval. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Trial oversight</title>
                <p id="Par8">We established a Trial Steering Committee (TSC) to oversee study conduct and an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee to review safety. The trial was managed by the Imperial Clinical Trials Unit. We used the InForm Integrated Trial Management system that included a web-based electronic case record form, built-in validation rules, adverse event reporting, and a complete audit trail. Participating NHS sites received initiation, routine monitoring, and closeout visits.</p>

                <title>Patient population</title>
                <p id="Par9">Eligible patients were adults (18â€“70 years) who had an LVAD implanted for chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), were clinically stable in the opinion of the clinical team looking after the patient (e.g., no chronic infection, no LVAD-associated complications) and able to provide informed consent (see detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria in Supplementary Data TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Chronic HF was defined as a diagnosis of HFrEF and treatment with guideline-based treatment for HFrEF for a minimum of 6 months prior to LVAD implantation, or if less than 6 months between diagnosis and LVAD implantation then a total of 6 months including LVAD support and without evidence of recovery.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Exclusion criteria included biventricular VAD support, acute infection within 48â€‰h prior to administration of IMP, previous LVAD-associated thrombosis with the current LVAD, a persistently raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH &gt;â€‰2.5 upper limit of normal) or patients considered at a high risk of thrombosis in the opinion of the investigator.</p>

                <p id="Par11">All patients had a detailed baseline assessment including clinical review, laboratory blood tests, blood samples for NAb and ELISPOT, resting transthoracic echocardiography with LVAD at standard settings and a reduced flow setting, cardiopulmonary exercise test and 6-min walk test.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par12">Following baseline assessment and NAb testing, patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either an intracoronary infusion of 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>13</sup> DNase resistant particles AAV1/SERCA2a or placebo (buffer solution without viral particles), stratified in a 1:1 ratio by NAb status (positive (â‰¥1:2) or negative). Randomisation was performed using an interactive web-based randomisation system linked to the InForm Trial Management system. Randomisation codes were generated by an independent statistician using blocked randomisation.</p>

                <title>SERCA2a gene therapy administration</title>
                <p id="Par13">The intracoronary infusion protocol was performed using the same technique applied in the CUPID2 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Briefly, patients were admitted and oral anticoagulation interrupted using a patient-specific bridging anticoagulation strategy (either intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin). Vascular access was obtained via the femoral artery using ultrasound guidance and coronary artery anatomy was confirmed with diagnostic coronary angiography. Femoral artery access was chosen to allow real time mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) monitoring during the GTN infusion and IMP delivery. Intravenous GTN infusion was initiated 25â€‰min prior to infusion of the investigational product as per the CUPID 2 trial protocol, starting at 5â€‰mcg/min and increasing in 5â€‰mcg/min increments every 3â€“5â€‰min until a criterion was met that defined maximum tolerated dose. These criteria were (i) LVAD flow dropping by &gt;0.5â€‰litres/min, (ii) MAP falling below 65â€‰mmHg, or (iii) MAP falling &gt;10â€‰mmHg from baseline. Once the maximum tolerated dose was reached, this was continued until the end of the IMP infusion. All patients had continuous flow LVADs and the median MAP was 79â€‰mmHg (76â€“84â€‰mmHg (IQR)). Heparin was delivered systemically to achieve a target activated coagulation time (ACT) of 200â€‰s prior to starting the intracoronary infusion.</p>
                <p id="Par14">The IMP was prepared according to trial pharmacy protocol and delivered as a 50â€‰ml intracoronary infusion to the leftâ€‰Â±â€‰right coronary arteries at 5â€‰ml/min according to the coronary anatomy to maximise delivery to the LV myocardium.</p>
                <p id="Par15">After the infusion, the ACT was rechecked. The strategy for managing the arterial access site was decided on a case by case basis, guided by the location of femoral puncture and ACT at the end of the procedure. Options included deployment of a vascular closure device, immediate removal and manual pressure, or delayed removal and manual pressure. Anticoagulation with IV heparin and oral anticoagulation was then restarted.</p>

                <p id="Par16">Patients were reviewed on a weekly basis for the first 4 weeks following IMP infusion, and then at monthly intervals for months 2â€“6. Clinical assessment, review for adverse events, laboratory blood tests including cardiac troponin, liver transaminases, C reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK) were performed at each visit. ELISPOT testing was performed at baseline, M3 and M6, and if clinically indicated, e.g., unexplained fever (see detailed ELISPOT methods in data supplementary).</p>

Resting transthoracic echocardiography was performed with LVAD at standard and reduced impeller rotation speed (see detailed Methods and TablesÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>â€“<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> in data supplementary). Exercise capacity was assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPEX) using the modified Bruce protocol and by six minute walk testing (6MWT), both with LVAD at normal speed and reduced speed (see detailed methods in data supplementary). Blood was collected for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurement.</p>

                <p id="Par18">Left ventricular EMBs were taken at 6 months post gene transfer unless a patient had undergone cardiac transplantation during the 6 month period post IMP infusion. Oral anticoagulation was interrupted with bridging using the same protocol as described above for the IMP infusion. The LV biopsy was performed using a percutaneous bioptome via the femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance. After crossing the aortic valve, 3-6 samples were taken from the LV endocardial surface. Samples were visually inspected to ensure myocardial tissue was present, and if fibrotic tissue was observed further samples could be taken. Biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at âˆ’80â€‰Â°C until analysis.</p>

              <p id="Par23">Recruitment started at Harefield Hospital in July 2014 and was stopped after the TSC reviewed the provisional results of the CUPID 2 trial in May 2015. Screening the population of adults with LVADs for chronic HF identified 21 individuals who were approached to discuss the study. At the time of stopping trial recruitment six subjects had provided informed consent, one of whom subsequently withdrew prior to IMP administration (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Papworth Hospital had not been activated at the time recruitment was halted. Five subjects were randomised and received IMP infusion. Four received AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy infusion (trial subjects 1â€“3 and 5) and one received placebo infusion (trial subject 4).

This subject was admitted 74 days after IMP infusion for right HF decompensation requiring inotrope support and leading to urgent transplant listing. This was a clinical deterioration due to underlying disease progression in the opinion of the investigators. Subject 5 had been noted to have an elevated troponin at baseline before AAV1/SERCA2a infusion, and there was no further rise in troponin after IMP infusion with CK, WCC and CRP remaining normal. Subject 5 had no clinical features to support the diagnosis of myocarditis clinically and their ELISPOT at M3 was negative. Subject 5 proceeded to urgent cardiac transplantation on day 165 following IMP infusion. Their explanted heart was collected for clinical assessment and research samples for PCR. There was no evidence of inflammatory infiltrate on histopathological assessment (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Unfortunately the post-operative course was complicated by recurrent sepsis and multiorgan failure, and subject 5 died 4 weeks post cardiac transplantation and 28 weeks post IMP infusion. The clinical course and death was reviewed by the local principal investigator and the data safety monitoring committee and not judged to be IMP related.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Histopathology from human hearts following AAV1/SERCA2a gene delivery.</title><p>Both hearts showed similar features with the myocardium showing patchy fine interstitial fibrosis around myocytes with focal areas of more confluent fibrous replacement (Fig.Â 2a Elastin Van Gieson (x40) and <bold>b</bold>.

Blood tests and clinical assessment were normal, with no evidence of LVAD thrombosis or haemolysis, and the subject was discharged home after a period of observation without any change to treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par28">There was one procedure-related vascular complication with a haematoma related to the femoral artery access site (subject 1 â€“ AAV1/SERCA2a), and one subject (4 â€“ placebo) developed a new atrial flutter 26 days following their infusion.

                <p id="Par30">There were no clinically significant changes in haemoglobin, renal function or liver enzymes on safety blood tests. One subject (4 â€“ placebo) had a new troponin rise 1 week following IMP infusion (see TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The troponin remained elevated from week 1 to month 5, and was normal at baseline and 6 months. The subject was clinically stable with no new symptoms and specifically no symptoms or signs suggestive of a systemic inflammatory reaction or cardiac complication. Other blood tests including white cell profile, CK, LDH, CRP and liver enzymes remained normal. An additional ELISPOT sample was taken which was normal. This subject received placebo and therefore the troponin rise was not related to AAV1/SERCA2a, but could possibly have been related to the study infusion procedure given the temporal correlation. Subject 5 had an elevated troponin at baseline and it remained stably elevated without a significant change. Subject 3 had a single borderline measurement (40â€‰ng/L) at M3 without any clinical or biochemical abnormalities.</p>
                <p id="Par31">In summary, none of the patients receiving AAV1/SERCA2a had an AE attributable to AAV1/SERCA2a, but there was one definite (haematoma) and two possible (asymptomatic troponin rise, atrial flutter) AEs related to the infusion procedure.

There was no correlation with any clinical or laboratory changes to suggest a clinical immunoreaction, and trial investigators were blinded to ELISPOT results until the end of the trial.

Fourteen echocardiograms were performed on the 5 subjects. The fifteenth scheduled echo scan was not performed as the patient was critically ill awaiting cardiac transplantation (subject 5, M6). These 14 scans included 10 low speed assessments, and in each of these the target low speed was reached (HeartMate II, 6,000â€‰rpm; HVAD, 1800â€‰rpm; see Supplementary Method) and there were no complications. Four low speed assessments were omitted, three of these due to suspension of the trial. The fourth (in subject 3 at M3) was omitted due to a LVAD alarm and possible haemolysis episode occurring in the interval between 0 and M3 assessments (described above), and the theoretical risk of exacerbating or precipitating an LVAD thrombosis. Data obtained from echocardiography was limited by quality of ultrasound windows, constrained by apical placement of the LVAD.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par41">This is the first clinical trial of gene therapy in patients with LVADs for chronic HF. The SERCA-LVAD trial did not complete recruitment due to the results of CUPID 2 which became available during the study and altered the risk:benefit ratio for this patient cohort leading to cessation of recruitment and inability to obtain planned EMB for 2 subjects. This is a major limitation of the trial, and interpretation and discussion of the results reflects the observational nature with the lack of power for any statistical analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The primary aims were safety and feasibility. There was no suggestion of a safety concern in this small cohort, with none of the four subjects undergoing gene therapy displaying any clinical or laboratory abnormalities directly attributed to administration of the AAV1/SERCA2a vector at the dose studied. One patient deteriorated 10 weeks post administration, and required hospitalisation for HF, inotropic support and proceeded to cardiac transplantation. The local PI and trial steering committee concluded this deterioration reflected the natural history of the underlying disease in this subject, and there was no objective evidence of a viral mediated immune reaction or myocarditis as a contributory factor. ELISPOT, CK, WCC and CRP were all normal in the subject at M3 post infusion, and cardiac troponin which was raised at baseline, reflecting advanced HF, did not significantly rise from baseline. Histopathology also excluded an inflammatory infiltrate (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, given the limited experience of AAV gene therapy in patients with HF, and specifically in patients with LVADs, absolute exclusion of a contributory effect of the gene therapy infusion in the subsequent clinical deterioration of subject 5 is not possible, although the investigatorsâ€™ view is that there is no evidence of a causal relation. One procedure related AE (femoral artery access site haematoma) should be noted, which reflects the complexity of performing angiography in LVAD patients with reduced pulse pressure and complex anticoagulation requirements and the need for real time arterial BP monitoring during IV GTN infusions.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Five trial subjects with LVADs received IMP infusion, with four receiving AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy. This trial confirmed the feasibility to perform this procedure in this patient group, and in one case EMB at 6 months confirmed the presence of viral transgene DNA. Analysis of myocardial samples from one of the two transplanted hearts confirmed detection of exogenous AAV1/SERCA2a DNA confirming delivery to the human failing heart (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). It was also feasible to perform a range of cellular and tissue research studies in explanted human hearts following gene therapy (Figs.Â <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>â€“<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par44">There are several challenges that need to be overcome if future gene therapy trials with larger patient cohorts are to be successful. Firstly, the patient cohort with LVADs is limited in number compared with the wider chronic HF population. The LVAD patient cohort are a younger population compared with the general HF population, but have an important unmet clinical need of long term outcome and weaning strategies, and our experience was that this patient cohort is engaged to participate in research studies of advanced medicinal products such as gene and stem cell therapies. The unselected LVAD population have many co-morbidities, and with LVAD-associated thrombosis an ongoing concern, there are a number of factors limiting the population suitable for research trials where anticoagulation needs to be interrupted for invasive procedures. These factors raise the challenge of the absolute population of LVAD patients eligible to participate in a trial of this type, and the number of centres required.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Secondly the readout of efficacy is more challenging in HF patients with LVADs compared with those without. Clinical parameters such as LVEF and natriuretic peptides can be measured but are greatly influenced by the impact of the associated LVAD, introducing significant variability which requires large cohort numbers to overcome. For gene therapy trials the ability to measure exogenously delivered DNA via PCR is an attractive strategy as proof of delivery. However, the requirement for myocardial tissue presents a challenge in a patient cohort where stable LVAD patients may undergo prolonged LVAD support without proceeding to transplantation, and in several countries a growing proportion of the LVAD population have destination therapy and are ineligible for transplantation. To overcome these limitations, we introduced EMB into the trial protocol for participants who had not proceeded to cardiac transplantation in the 6 months following IMP infusion. Whilst LV EMBs are possible in this patient population, they raise a number of important scientific and safety issues. The myocardium of patients with advanced HF who require LVAD support may have significant amounts of fibrosis due to the underlying disease, particularly but not exclusively if they have coronary disease and prior myocardial infarction. Following long term LVAD support endocardial fibrosis may develop, limiting the quality of EMB samples suitable for PCR analysis. In the two subjects where EMB was technically possible and performed, one had multiple samples taken but all were too fibrotic for analysis. EMB in this patient cohort is technically challenging, both for safety (avoiding the LVAD inflow cannula in the LV, risk of cardiac rupture in a thinned myocardium), and practical reasons (crossing the aortic valve in a retrograde direction can be challenging if aortic valve opening is reduced on LVAD support). Peri-procedural management of anticoagulation is complex, and interrupting stable anticoagulation for a research procedure is an important factor to consider in the context of LVAD-associated thrombosis with continuous flow devices.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Human myocardium was obtained from three trial subjects via EMB or cardiac transplantation, although it was only suitable for myocardial analysis from two subjects, as the EMB from subject 2 were too fibrotic. Viral transgene DNA was detectable using PCR in one biopsy and one transplant sample, but at low copy number, and absent in another biopsy and transplant sample (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These low or absent levels are consistent with the previously reported levels of transgene DNA measured in patients enroled in CUPID 1 and CUPID 2 trials who proceeded to LVAD implantation or cardiac transplantation (reported levels in range &lt;10â€“192 ssDNA copy number/Âµg human DNA in samples from 8 patients in CUPID 2: see TableÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In AGENT-HF, myocardium was obtained from one patient at the time of explant at 18 months, but again no AAV1/SERCA2a DNA was detected by qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the CUPID 1, CUPID 2 and AGENT-HF trials there is the potential bias that LV myocardium was only available from patients that clinically deteriorated, and therefore by definition had not received a potential therapeutic benefit from the trial intervention. In this current trial, the prospective planned collection of tissue from all trial subjects was designed to overcome that bias. However in the context of the CUPID 2 results where no clinical benefit was observed in the active gene therapy arm across a range of clinical parameters, the result from this trial with low or absent levels of transgene DNA, would support the hypothesis that the main reason for lack of benefit observed with AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy at the dose studied in CUPID 2, AGENT-HF and SERCA-LVAD trials was the failure to deliver the transgene at sufficiently high levels to the failing human heart to have an impact upon the underlying disease pathophysiology. The low or absent levels of viral transgene DNA in this trial and the CUPID 2 trial is in contrast to much higher levels in preclinical small and large animal models of HF where SERCA2a was tested (range 8000â€“42,000 ssDNA copy number/Âµg DNA). The potential reasons for this failure of gene delivery and clinical impact are multiple, including the dose studied being too low, high first pass washout in the coronary circulation, lack of proof of functional protein expression and elevated SERCA2a enzymatic activity with the associated changes in cardiomyocyte calcium physiology observed in preclinical models. Other gene therapy trials for the treatment of monogenic diseases have used much higher doses of AAV vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] however there are limits to how much the doses can be increased before toxicity occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">One new aspect of this trial was the recruitment of patients with NAbs to the viral vector to test the hypothesis of whether they prevented transfection efficiency and also if there are any safety concerns. This is the first cardiac gene therapy trial to enrol NAb positive patients, although subjects recruited in other gene therapy trials have been reported. Only one of our 5 subjects was NAb positive (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), in contrast to the much higher rates (59%) of detectable NAbs in the general HFrEF population prescreened for the CUPID 2 trial and our general HFrEF population, which may reflect the younger cohort in comparison with the CUPID trials. There were no safety concerns in our trial subject who was NAb positive and received AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy, but it was this subject who had positive ELISPOT results on blood tests taken at 3 and 6 months which may reflect amplification of the T cell response due to previous exposure. Unfortunately, the EMB in this patient did not yield tissue for analysis, but given that we only had a single patient in this group, and also that gene transfer was low or absent in other subjects, it is unlikely to have provided an answer at the dose studied. Definitive data regarding safety and whether efficacy of delivery is affected by NAb requires further studies with larger number and at higher AAV doses.</p>
              <p id="Par48">In summary, the SERCA-LVAD trial is the first trial of gene therapy for patients with HF and LVADs. It was feasible to deliver the AAV1/SERCA2a gene therapy infusion in this patient cohort, and DNA was detectable at follow up EMB in one case and one explanted heart. The detected level of DNA was very low, and absent in the other second explanted heart analysed which had the positive EMB result, supporting the observation from the CUPID 2 and AGENT-HF trials that the gene therapy was not effectively delivered and the dose and protocol applied in these trials, and this may explain the neutral result of CUPID 2 trial on clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">The main impact of the SERCA-LVAD trial may be to alert the Advanced Therapies field to the challenges of using this patient cohort. It is frequently suggested that LVAD patients might have advantages, for example the possibility to add vectors (or regenerative patches) and sample myocardium in an open-chest procedure as the LVAD is implanted. However, the reality is that the instability of the clinical condition during and immediately after LVAD implantation precludes reliable baseline measurements of cardiac function or blood and tissue markers. In addition, we have now observed the complications of intra-arterial delivery of a vector when there is no pulse; the issues regarding anticoagulation management during vector delivery or biopsy; the difficulty of measuring cardiac function with the LVAD supporting LV function; and the dilemma of whether to immunosuppress for a positive ELISPOT when the LVAD patient is highly susceptible to drive-line infections. Overall, these safety concerns are significant, especially for untried Advanced Therapies where potential benefit is far from defined, and the SERCA-LVAD trial is the first to identify and address these challenges and aid the design of future trials in this field.</p>
