                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Sodium valproate (VPA) has been associated with a reduced risk of head and neck cancer development. The potential protective mechanism of action is believed to be via inhibition of histone deacetylase and subsequent epigenetic reprogramming. SAVER is a phase IIb open-label, randomised control trial of VPA as a chemopreventive agent in patients with high-risk oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). The aim of the trial is to gather preliminary evidence of the clinical and biological effects of VPA upon OED and assess the feasibility and acceptability of such a trial, with a view to inform a future definitive phase III study.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">One hundred andÂ ten patients with high-risk OED will be recruited from up to 10 secondary care sites in the UK and randomised into either VPA or observation only for 4 months. Women of childbearing potential will be excluded due to the teratogenic properties of VPA. Tissue and blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and on the last day of the intervention/observation-only period (end of 4 months). Clinical measurement and additional safety bloods will be taken at multiple time points during the trial. The primary outcome will be a composite, surrogate endpoint of change in lesion size, change in grade of dysplasia and change in LOH profile at 8 key microsatellite regions. Feasibility outcomes will include recruitment targets, compliance with the study protocol and adverse effects. A qualitative sub-study will explore patient experience and perception of the trial.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The current management options for patients with high-risk OED are limited and mostly include surgical resection and clinical surveillance. However, there remains little evidence whether surgery can effectively lead to a notable reduction in the risk of oral cancer development. Similarly, surveillance is associated with concerns regarding delayed diagnosis of OED progressing to malignancy. The SAVER trial provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of a repurposed, inexpensive and well-tolerated medication as a potential chemopreventive strategy for patients with high-risk OED. The clinical and biological findings of SAVER will inform the appropriateness, design and feasibility of a definitive phase III trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par35">The incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been increasing for several decades and is predicted to rise 33% by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The disease results in notably high rates of mortality and morbidity, with 50â€“60% 5-year survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most oral cancers are preceded by long-standing clinical changes of the oral mucosa, mainly white (leukoplakia) and red (erythroplakia) patches, with progression from normal epithelium to invasive OSCC occurring through sequential stages of histological intra-epithelial changes including mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. A recent systematic review suggests that OED is associated with oral cancer development in 12.1% of cases, with severe OED showing higher rates of progression compared to mild and moderate dysplasia (24.1% vs 10.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Management of OED should aim at reducing the risk of oral cancer development; however, there remains little convincing evidence that this can be achieved with any of the treatment strategies currently adopted in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. OED is typically managed through surveillance or surgical resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; however, neither have strong evidence to support their use nor address the underlying pathogenesis. Surveillance is associated with concerns regarding delayed diagnosis of OED progressing to OSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Surgery is not always possible for all lesions or all patients, and recurrence rates for premalignant lesions range from 4 to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also, localised therapies fail to treat the wider mucosal field, often encompassing the entire upper aerodigestive tract, and therefore do not address the risk of multifocal synchronous or metachronous dysplastic lesions. Accordingly, there is an urgent unmet need to develop well-designed clinical trials of novel interventions that, especially in high-risk OED, could effectively reduce the risk of progression to malignancy.</p>
              <p id="Par36">This paper presents the protocol for the SAVER trial, a multi-site, phase IIb, open-label, randomised control trial of VPA in high-risk OED. This trial offers treatment to patients with high-risk lesions who may otherwise have no other option for active treatment and addresses the need for further research in the area of chemoprevention treatment in OED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This protocol report adheres to SPIRIT guidance (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>

                <title>Evidence supporting the use of sodium valproate as a chemopreventive agent for head and neck cancer</title>
                <p id="Par37">The Kang study is a cohort study of approximately 440,000 patients in the US Veteransâ€™ Affairs System, with long-term psychiatric or neurological diagnoses and at increased risk of smoking-related cancers; 26,000 had been taking VPA for more than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There was a lower incidence of head and neck malignancy in the group taking VPA, with a 32% protective effect reported (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50â€“0.93). The reduction in risk was maintained in a multivariate analysis for age, sex, race, past vs current smoking, psychiatric or neurological disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and alcohol and substance use (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48â€“0.92). The weight of this observation is reinforced by dose effect, with both the length of treatment and dose of VPA correlating with a further reduction of risk. The most plausible mechanism of reduction of cancer risk is through the epigenetic reprogramming effects of VPA through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale for the SAVER trial</title>
                <p id="Par38">The unmet need for an effective treatment to prevent progression of OED to oral cancer, the risk-reduction effect demonstrated in the Kang study and the underlying plausible epigenetic mechanisms underpin the need for a clinical trial using VPA as an HDAC inhibitor in the chemoprevention of oral cancer in individuals with high-risk OED. HDACis are an emerging class of drugs that have shown promise as anticancer agents when used alone or in combination with conventional therapies. HDACi and VPA have been comprehensively reviewed in their role in combination therapies, with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted agents, in haematological malignancy or recurrent/metastatic solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is good evidence for clinical benefit of epigenetic therapy in haematological pre-malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In contrast, the rationale for HDACi monotherapy in the setting of chemoprevention for oral lesions presents a differing opportunity and there is a paucity of data. There is no in vivo data related to HDACi in oral carcinogenesis; however, there is in vitro evidence of the effect of HDACi on growth inhibition and mediation of apoptosis of OSCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There is also evidence of growth suppression of xenograft tumours in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par39">Before embarking in a long and expensive phase III trial, we suggest that preparatory research is needed in order to (i) inform important aspects of the trial design such as feasibility and outcome measures and (ii) identify a preliminary signal of clinical efficacy linked to reasonable biological mechanisms. We have therefore designed a phase IIb trial so to gather data on such preliminary evidence of effect, explore outcome measures and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the trial in this population.</p>
                <p id="Par40">It is expected that the clinical, mechanistic and feasibility data of SAVER will inform the decision for a future larger phase III trial with robust cancer (cancer development) endpoints, necessitating much larger cohorts and longer follow-up.</p>

The aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of VPA as an epigenetic chemopreventive therapy in high-risk OED. The primary objective is to determine: clinical activity of sodium valproate in high-risk OED, using a composite surrogate endpoint of change in the size of clinical lesion, changes in loss of heterozygosity profile and change in grade of dysplasia (see the â€˜Outcome measuresâ€™ section). The key secondary objectives are to determine, in subjects with high-risk OED: the mechanism of action of VPA, associated toxicity, overall survival, development of any cancer and the feasibility of conducting such research in the UK National Health Service.

                <p id="Par72">Sodium valproate is licensed for use in epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It is also used off-label for depression, neuropathic pain, dementia and migraine. Very common adverse effects, defined as occurring in &gt;10% of patients, include nausea and tremor. Common adverse events (between 1 and 10% of patients) include upper abdominal cramps, transient increase in liver enzymes, weight gain and diarrhoea, transient alopecia, reduced bone density, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Neurological adverse effects such as fatigue, sedation, confusion and dizziness are also observed commonly. Due to the significant risk of birth defects and developmental disorders in babies born to mothers taking VPA during pregnancy, the MHRA have issued guidance advising: â€˜Valproate medicines must no longer be used in women or girls of childbearing potential unless a Pregnancy Prevention Programme is in placeâ€™. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will not be recruited to the trial, due to known teratogenic effects of VPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All women will require a follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) test prior to randomisation, to confirm post-menopausal status. The exception to this is women who have undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>
                <p id="Par73">The SAVER trial will use VPA at 1000 mg/day; this is a low to medium dose, associated with mild or absent toxicities, and is well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Higher doses, sometimes justified in epilepsy, are associated with weight gain, tremor, drowsiness and cognitive slowing. In the context of premalignant oral conditions, we feel that these would not be justified. The impact of weight gain will be reduced by excluding obese patients (BMI &gt; 30).</p>

Patients discontinuing due to toxicity will be followed up and assessed as per protocol. Patients discontinuing treatment for any reason will continue to be followed up unless the patient explicitly withdraws consent for follow-up.

As a guide, it is proposed that if the study will be recruiting within 80% of the intended rate (at least 34 and 70 for 12 and 24 months, respectively) then no action will be taken. If the study is recruiting between 50% and 80% (between 22â€“33 and 44â€“69 for 12 and 24 months, respectively) of the intended rate, the ISDMC may recommend continuation only if strategies will be put in place to increase recruitment.

              <p id="Par93">This study protocol describes a multi-site, open-label randomised control trial of VPA vs observation only in the management of high-risk OED. There is an unmet need for additional strategies in the management of OED. Patients are currently offered surgery or close surveillance, neither of which have sufficient supporting evidence for the prevention of malignant transformation of OED. Efforts in chemoprevention of malignant transformation of OED have been limited and this represents the first trial of VPA as a chemopreventive agent in OED. The SAVER trial will investigate the clinical activity of VPA, using a composite endpoint of clinical, pathological and molecular changes. The mechanism of action will be explored using gene expression studies, investigation of epigenetic changes and expression of markers of cell cycle regulation. Feasibility of recruitment and patient perception of this type of trial will be assessed through interviews of patients approached for recruitment in the hope of informing the design of a future Phase III clinical trial.</p>

                <p id="Par95">The trial protocol has been reviewed and approved by the North West Haydock Research Ethics Committee, reference number: 18/NW/0180. The trial has been registered with the MHRA; 04196/0048/001-0001.</p>
                <p id="Par96">Vulnerable patients will not be recruited to the SAVER trial. Additional visits required by the trial are minimal, typically one extra visit for screening and randomisation and one extra trial review at 2 months. Additional tests will be required and include three blood tests over six months and one additional biopsy. WOCBP will not be recruited to the trial. The patient must: be fully informed, have received PIS (Patient Information Sheet) and considered this during a â€˜cooling-offâ€™ period and be competent to consent. The consent process is in two stages; the initial consent is simply for the screening biopsy and the second stage is consent for recruitment to the main study, if eligible. This includes consent for the collection and use of biological specimens in the mechanistic sub-study. Consent will be obtained by an appropriately qualified clinician. Patients being registered for the SAVER clinical trial should be informed by their clinical teams about the extra risks potentially associated with COVID-19, as they would before any cancer or pre-cancer treatment in the COVID-19 era.</p>
