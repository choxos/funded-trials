                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There are high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in ethnically diverse, sexually active students aged 16–24 years attending London further education (FE) colleges. However, uptake of chlamydia screening remains low. The TnT study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a future trial in FE colleges to investigate if frequent, rapid, on-site testing and treatment (TnT) reduces chlamydia rates. This article presents the statistical analysis plan for the main study publication as approved and signed off by the Trial Management Group prior to the first data extraction for the final report.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">TnT is a cluster-randomised feasibility trial conducted over 7 months with parallel qualitative and economic assessments. Colleges will be randomly allocated into the intervention (TnT) or the control group (no TnT). Six FE colleges in London will be included. At each college for 2 days, 80 consecutive sexually active students aged 16–24 years (total 480 students across all six colleges) will be recruited from public areas and asked to provide baseline samples. One and 4 months after recruitment intervention colleges will be visited on two consecutive days by the TnT team where participating students will be texted and invited to come for same-day, on-site, rapid chlamydia testing and, if positive, treatment. Participants in the control colleges will receive ‘thank you’ texts 1 and 4 months after recruitment. Seven months after recruitment, participants from both groups will be invited to complete questionnaires and provide samples for TnT. All samples will be tested, and same-day treatment offered to participants with positive results. Key feasibility outcomes include: recruitment rates, testing and treatment uptake rates (at 1 and 4 months) and follow-up rates (at 7 months).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">There are high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in ethnically diverse, sexually active students aged 16–24 years attending London further education (FE) colleges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with around 8% testing positive for <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>. However, uptake of chlamydia screening remains low: below 30% annually in 16–24-year-olds in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although chlamydia and gonorrhoea primarily affect young people, the consequences of infection such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain or epididymitis can last a lifetime. It is estimated that 10–16% of women with untreated chlamydia will develop clinical pelvic inflammatory disease of whom 8% will have an ectopic pregnancy and 11% will suffer from tubal-factor infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The cost of chlamydia and gonorrhoea to the NHS is estimated to be over £100 million each year.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Barriers to reducing chlamydia rates include low uptake of testing by those most at risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (such as teenagers, people from ethnic minorities and people who are socioeconomically deprived), and long delays in receiving a positive diagnosis or attending for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Introducing rapid, on-the-spot chlamydia tests and treatment into the community could make it easier for young people to get tested and treated faster before they can pass on their infection. It might also prevent complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These novel tests can have 99% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and studies have demonstrated their feasibility in remote communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there have been no UK trials of rapid sexually transmitted infection (STI) tests and same-day, on-site treatment in non-healthcare settings.</p>

            <sec id="Sec2">
              <title>Objective</title>
              <p id="Par15">To assess the feasibility of conducting a future trial in further education (FE) colleges to investigate if frequent, rapid, on-site testing and treatment (TnT) reduces chlamydia rates in sexually active male and female students aged 16–24 years.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec3">
              <title>Methods and design</title>
              <p id="Par16">TnT is a cluster-randomised feasibility trial conducted over 7 months with parallel qualitative and economic assessments. The outcome is measured within one academic year to optimise follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Both the current feasibility study and a future, definitive trial will be cluster randomised. This is to avoid contamination, which may arise if students were individually randomised within the same college, as sexual partners could potentially be allocated to different groups. The cluster design also reflects how TnT would be rolled out in practice, with college visits once each term.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Six FE colleges in London will be included. Colleges were included based on their high proportion of black and ethnic minority students and an even gender split, as well as their close proximity to St George’s, University of London (SGUL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At each college, for 2 days, 80 consecutive sexually active students aged 16–24 years will be recruited from public areas (total 480 students across all six colleges). Research assistants will approach students in common room areas. The students will be asked if they are willing to help with research on sexual health. Potentially eligible students will be invited to come to the study table where recruiters will explain that as the study is about chlamydia and sexually transmitted infections, only students who have had penetrative sexual intercourse should consider taking part. Those who are interested will be given a patient information sheet and consent form to read and encouraged to ask questions.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="Par22">Randomisation will take place once recruitment is completed and baseline data collected for all colleges. Colleges will be randomly allocated into the intervention (TnT) or the control group (no TnT) in a 1:1 (i.e. equal allocation) ratio by the trial statistician. The randomisation will be constrained to ensure that three colleges are allocated to each group. Recruitment of colleges and participants will take place prior to group allocation to ensure allocation concealment and prevent selection bias, and, therefore, the baseline data collection from students will be blind to treatment group.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Participants will be asked to provide samples (urine for males and self-taken vaginal swabs for females) at baseline and after 7 months and to complete questionnaires on sexual lifestyle and healthcare use at both time points. Questionnaire data will be collected at the college using encrypted tablet computers. As a contingency, paper questionnaires will be used as back up. All participants will be informed that baseline samples will not be tested for 7 months and will be advised to get screened separately from the study in the event that they are allocated to the control group.</p>
                <p id="Par24">One month after recruitment, each intervention campus will be visited on two consecutive days by the TnT team. (These will be the same days of the week as at recruitment to optimise participating student attendance.) The 80 participating students in each campus will be invited to provide a sample, but this time the sample will be tested immediately on site using the Cepheid GeneXpert system which takes 90 min. Participants will be given a card designed by the user group containing information about STIs, and links to the Brook sexual health website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brook.org.uk">www.brook.org.uk</ext-link>. Negative results will be sent to participants by text. Participants with positive chlamydia results will be telephoned and invited to come to the college nurse’s room for treatment, partner notification, advice and follow-up by a visiting dispensing (under Patient Group Directive) nurse health adviser. Participants with infections will be asked to bring any sexual partners who attend the college so they can also be tested and treated. The nurse health adviser will arrange for participants who are positive for gonorrhoea to be reviewed by a clinician on the same or the next day at a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. This is for clinical examination, so that repeat samples can be taken to evaluate gonorrhoea resistance to antibiotics, for intramuscular injection of antibiotics and for partner notification. All participants in the three intervention campuses will be invited to provide repeat samples for on-site TnT 4 months after recruitment (i.e. the next college term), when all the procedures described above will be repeated.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Participants from the three control colleges will not get TnT but will receive texts 1 and 4 months after recruitment thanking them for being in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par26">All participants will be asked to provide samples and to complete questionnaires at college at 7 months. Testing at 7 months is required in the proposed full trial to calculate the main outcome (prevalence of chlamydia), and is included here to test the feasibility of collecting these data. Treatment will also be offered to those diagnosed with infection at 7 months. This is not part of the assessed intervention, but is offered to enhance screening uptake, and participation in general among the control group. In addition, at the end of the study, stored baseline samples will be tested using standard tests, and participants with positive results will be contacted by the health adviser. Those not attending for follow-up will be sent an SMS text with a link to the final questionnaire to be completed online. They will also be telephoned and offered the opportunity to provide a sample for routine (not rapid) testing either in college at a prearranged time or by post.</p>

              <p id="Par47">Assuming a 30% recruitment rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], 1600 students will be approached to recruit 480 overall (80 per college across six colleges: three intervention colleges and three control colleges). Estimates of testing uptake at 1 and 4 months (intervention colleges only) will be based on 240 students, and at 7 months will be based on 480 students (all colleges).</p>
              <p id="Par48">Teare et al. recommend that 60 to 100 subjects are sufficient to estimate an event rate with acceptable precision in a feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Prevalence of chlamydia at baseline will be estimated separately for each of the six colleges (80 students per college), and these prevalence figures will be used to inform the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), required for the sample size calculation for the main study. From our previous research involving 11 colleges, the ICC was estimated to be 0.005 (95% confidence interval − 0.013 to 0.026) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adding data from another six colleges will improve the precision of this ICC, reducing the width of the confidence interval by around 20%.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Assuming 70% followed up at 7 months, final estimates of chlamydia prevalence would be based on 168 students in each of the intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The study is not powered to find a statistically significant difference in chlamydia rates between groups, but may provide useful information on possible effect size to inform future sample size calculations.</p>

              <p id="Par72">Findings from this study are intended to assess the feasibility of running a future definitive trial to investigate whether a FE college-based TnT model leads to a reduction in prevalence of chlamydia. In this article, we have described the TnT statistical analysis plan which provides details about how data from the TnT feasibility trial will be analysed. The protocol for the trial is published by Kerry-Barnard et al. (in press). By publishing our statistical analysis plan, we believe that we will ensure a more balanced, accurate and complete report of our final results.</p>
