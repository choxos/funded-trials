                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not) are a common feature of psychosis, causing significant distress and disability. Existing treatments such as cognitiveâ€“behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) have modest benefits, and there is a lack of CBTp-trained staff. Shorter, targeted treatments that focus on specific symptoms delivered by a non-specialist workforce could substantially increase access to treatment.</p>
                  <p>Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences (MUSE) explains why people have hallucinations and helps the person to develop and use coping strategies to reduce distress. MUSE focuses only on hallucinations, and treatment is short (four to six, 1-hour sessions per week). It is a digital intervention, run on National Health Service (NHS) laptops, which provides information about hallucinations in an engaging way, using audio, video and animated content. Crucially, it is designed for use by non-specialist staff like community psychiatric nurses.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study is a two-arm feasibility randomised controlled trial comparing MUSE and treatment as usual (TAU) (n=40) to TAU alone (n=40), recruiting across two NHS Trusts, using 1:1 allocation and blind assessments before and after treatment (2 months) and at follow-up (3 months). Quantitative information on recruitment rates, adherence and completion of outcome assessments will be collected. Qualitative interviews will capture service usersâ€™ experience of therapy and cliniciansâ€™ experiences of the training and supervision in MUSE. Clinicians will also be asked about factors affecting uptake, adherence and facilitators/barriers to implementation. Analyses will focus on feasibility outcomes and provide initial estimates of intervention effects. Thematic analysis of the qualitative interviews will assess the acceptability of the training, intervention and trial procedures.</p>

              <p>Almost all people with psychosis at some stage report hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that others do not.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While for some these experiences can be positive,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> for many others these hallucinations can be distressing and disabling.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> To address this need, treatments like cognitiveâ€“behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) are recommended.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A recent meta-analysis<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> indicated that CBTp has a specific and beneficial effect on hallucinations in comparison to active and inactive control conditions (Hedgesâ€™ <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>=0.34). While welcome, the effects are still relatively modest. Moreover, access to CBTp remains limited<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> owing to the number of therapists available and the time it requires to deliver treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> CBTp is meant to be offered as 16â€“24 sessions per week offered over 6â€“9 months.</p>
              <p>Two approaches can help. The first is to provide briefer interventions, allowing more people to receive treatment. However, the benefits of CBTp are already modest and dose of therapy is associated with outcome.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> To retain the impact in a briefer form, it is essential that shorter treatments are sufficiently potent, which will likely involve targeting key causal mechanisms<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> leading to hallucinations. The second approach is to increase access by enabling a larger and less well-trained workforce to provide treatment. The present study combines these approaches.</p>
              <p>In terms of causal mechanisms, the exact reasons people see and hear things others do not are unclear. However, research on auditory hallucinations has shown that they take different forms that may respond to specific therapeutic approaches. A review by the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> outlined at least three different potential routes to experiencing voices for people with psychosis which may be suited to different kinds of tailored intervention: <italic toggle="yes">inner speech</italic> voices (postulated to result from the misattribution of ordinary inner speech to an external agent), <italic toggle="yes">hypervigilance</italic> voices (resulting from a biased attention to environmental stimuli) and <italic toggle="yes">memory</italic> voices (the result of intrusions from traumatic memory<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>The present approach draws on this understanding and uses it in a novel, digital toolkit called Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences (MUSE) that focuses only on hallucinations. MUSE uses psychoeducation about the currently known causal mechanisms of hallucination as means of exploring, with service users, why their specific experiences may be happening. This knowledge is then matched to specific, tailored interventions and coping strategies that enable the person to understand and manage their experiences differently and reduce their distress. This process relies on psychoeducation as its basis, but it is more fundamentally about helping a person to change their understanding, manage their experiences better and thus cope more effectively. MUSE is a departure from traditional CBTp as it focuses only on hallucinations and reduces the typical number of sessions to four to six. This helps prevent the â€˜driftâ€™ that can occur in treatment when there is not a specific target symptom or clear conceptual model underpinning treatment.</p>
              <p>To help increase access to therapy, attempts have been made to train non-psychological therapy staff such as community psychiatric nurses (CPNs) in the delivery of talking therapies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, such efforts have not demonstrated the anticipated benefits, owing to the challenge of managing high caseloads and of providing brief training for a complex intervention and a lack of standardisation of delivery.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Recently, brief interventions (defined as less than 12 sessions<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) provided by assistant psychologists for hallucinations have been trialled with some encouraging findings,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> indicating that brief targeted therapies can be provided by non-psychological therapists.</p>
              <p>The present research continues to address this unmet need by putting high-quality treatment tools in the hands of care coordinators working in early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services. Care coordinators (who are often CPNs) are the most widely available workforce in EIP teams<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> potentially providing the maximum access to high-quality care. EIP care coordinators work with smaller caseloads (12â€“15) than in other services, meaning there is capacity to deliver the treatment. Using the benefits of digital technology, we manualised and loaded MUSE onto an National Health Service (NHS) laptop, meaning that treatment is standardised, reducing the training required and the risk that staff will not feel confident in delivery. MUSE presents the content in a user-friendly, engaging way and is designed for joint use of therapist and service user in the therapy session. Clinicians use prepared videos and other types of media to help explain why the person may see or hear things others do not, and to help service users to practise coping strategies and carry out behavioural experiments to test the reality of their experiences.</p>
              <p>An earlier version of MUSE was delivered to people with distressing voices by psychological therapists (not care coordinators who will deliver the toolkit in this project) in a recently completed uncontrolled single group feasibility study Managing Unusual Sensory Experiences in Psychosis (MUSE PSYCHOSIS<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Twelve participants who completed follow-up after 10 MUSE sessions reported high treatment satisfaction and acceptability (87%â€“90% mean overall ratings). The within-subject effect size for reducing auditory hallucination severity was large (d=0.7). Even greater benefits were evident on a recently completed uncontrolled study in which MUSE was used by psychological therapists with a group of people in an at-risk mental state for psychosis.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The effect size was d=0.8 (n=19) for reduction of the intensity of auditory hallucinations, and satisfaction ratings were 90%. These studies provide encouraging evidence of the value of this approach when delivered by expert therapists.</p>
              <p>Learning from these studies, we revised the toolkit in three important ways. First, MUSE now incorporates more information about a range of hallucinations and not just auditory.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Second, the lived-experience input was strengthened to improve the relevance and accessibility of the MUSE materials. Third, MUSE was made easier to use for front-line staff, and specialist training and supervision for these staff were developed to enable them to use the MUSE toolkit.</p>
              <p>The treatment now requires testing in a randomised trial to determine the effects on hallucinations and whether access can be improved if delivered by a non-specialist workforce. Consequently, the present study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of MUSE treatment delivered by CPNs in participants experiencing first-episode psychosis.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of the present study was to establish if it is possible to undertake a larger, definitive trial in the future. Therefore, we will collect data to inform the feasibility and acceptability of a targeted hallucination-focussed treatment delivered by non-psychological therapists to establish the key parameters for a future definitive trial. The study will use mixed methods to (1) assess the feasibility of CPN staff training and delivery of the MUSE toolkit; (2) assess the acceptability of the MUSE toolkit to patients and staff; and (3) collect data to inform the effectiveness of future definitive trial (including referral, recruitment, uptake and attrition rates).</p>

                <title>Trial design and flowchart</title>
                <p>The design is a prospective, single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled feasibility trial to evaluate a novel hallucination intervention (MUSE) in addition to usual care versus usual care alone in people with psychosis attending NHS EIP services. Usual care will be recorded but will remain as standard in both groups. Assessments will be carried out at 0 week (baseline), 8 weeks (post-treatment) and 12 weeks (follow-up which is 1â€‰month post therapy but with an allowance of another month if needed) by a researcher blind to treatment allocation. A number of related qualitative studies will explore the acceptability of study procedures, the delivery and experience of the intervention to participants as well as the value of the training and supervision for the staff delivering MUSE. A summary of the trial design can be seen in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (registered 24 November 2021). There is an independent trial data monitoring committee (DMC) and a trial steering committee (TSC) and a patient and public involvement (PPI) group facilitated by a coapplicant for the study with lived experience of psychosis.</p>

                <p>Independent assessors blind to therapy group will conduct all assessments at the three time points. Basic demographic and clinical data will be collected (eg, age, gender, ethnicity and clinical diagnosis). Clinical outcomes including hallucinations, affective symptoms, social functioning, quality of life and physical health will be assessed at all three time points (baseline 0 month, postintervention 2 months and follow-up 3â€“4 months)</p>
                <p>Hallucinations are assessed using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> which is an 11-item semistructured interview, with three items being used to identify voice-related distress. Also, the self-report voice-impact subscale on the Hamilton Programme for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> will also be used. Additional items asking about hallucinations in non-auditory modalities (ie, visual, somatic, olfactory and sense of presence) are assessed as well.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>Levels of anxiety and depression (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) as well as perceived recovery (Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) are assessed. The perceived impact of the intervention (The Choice of Outcome In CBT for Psychoses<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) is used to assess progress towards therapy-related goals. To determine therapeutic alliance and therapy acceptability, the Satisfaction with Therapy and Therapist Scale<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and Working Alliance inventory<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> are used. In addition, at each session, a short self-assessment form comprising items adapted from the main measure of hallucinations will monitor variations in voice frequency and distress. To help establish health economics, service use and quality of life will be measured by interview/self-report (Short Form-36<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), EQ-5D,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> perceived capability (Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and from a case record review using a tool developed for the study.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>
                <p>These measures are to help identify important parameters for a future trial (ie, completion rates and selection of best outcome measures) and to estimate the SD of outcomes in order to facilitate a sample size calculation for use within a definitive trial.

                  <list-item>
                    <p>What Are Voices? This module provides normalising information about the frequency of voices and the factors that tend to increase voice hearing (eg, substance misuse and sleep deprivation), along with testimonies from other voice hearers.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>How the Mind Works. This module outlines current understanding of key psychological processes such as threat detection, the importance of prediction (top-down processing) and how intrusive thoughts work.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Assessment. This module identifies the subtype of hallucination a service user is experiencing (inner speechâ€“auditory verbal hallucination (AVH), a memory-based AVH or a hypervigilance AVH).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Inner Speech. This module provides psychoeducation about the evidence that voice hearing involves people not recognising their own inner speech. An individual understanding or formulation of voice-hearing experiences is coproduced, and then targeted coping strategies and behavioural experiments are employed, such as means of interrupting and manipulating inner speech via singing or humming.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Memory and Trauma. This module provides psychoeducation about how memories from traumatic events are more likely to be experienced as intrusive memories without contextual cues and can therefore be experienced as belonging to the here and now. Treatment helps people manage and reframe difficult memories.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Hypervigilance. This module describes how our brain uses prediction to interpret the world and make sense of sensory data received. If people are expecting threatening stimuli, they may struggle to scrutinise poor quality sensory data and rely more heavily on predictions while adopting a â€˜better safe than sorryâ€™ decision bias. Based on this understanding, targeted coping strategies are employed (such as reducing arousal and stress when under threat).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Seeing Visions. This module draws on these other modules and explains how our visual perceptual system can lead to mistaken perceptions, for example, how easily we see faces in clouds. An individual formulation and treatment plan is then developed that normalises the experience and addresses the key cause of distress, and then targeted coping strategies and behavioural experiments are employed (such as training oneself to switch attention to and from visions).</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Sleep. This module provides psychoeducation and treatment strategies about sleep, which is often a key factor in all types of unusual sensory experiences.</p>

                <p>The intervention is delivered by a care coordinator on an individual basis in up to eight 1-hour sessions, though four to six is the usual number. There is typically one session per week. A treatment dose is defined as three or more sessions. MUSE is provided flexibly, often in peopleâ€™s homes or clinics. MUSE is provided in addition to usual care. With patient consent, sessions will be audio-recorded and independently rated for quality, including fidelity and competence. MUSE is provided by care coordinators who have attended a 3-day training in MUSE. They are offered regular supervision sessions. As a minimum, we aim to train one team member per service that we recruit from, and they would provide the intervention in that service.</p>

These criteria are being developed with the PPI group to help determine if a full trial is warranted. We will use criteria on participant recruitment, adherence with the intervention and retention at follow-up to assess the trial (as set out in ADePT), plus data on uptake, retention of participants, intervention fidelity and acceptability. This will use both quantitative and qualitative data derived from the study.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The progression criteria will be divided into three categories (green, red and amber<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Areas that are amenable to change before a pilot trial will be investigated and solutions will be discussed with the patient group for acceptability.

                <title>Adverse events</title>
                <p>Adverse events will be reported for all participants randomised. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalisation, or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Accordingly, we will record admissions to hospital, suicide attempts, serious violent incidents and deaths. Treatment or hospitalisation for a pre-existing physical health condition, which has not worsened, does not constitute an SAE. We will record the occurrence of any SAEs reported to us and also systematically check all participantsâ€™ medical records following completion of the final assessment. We will also record formal complaints regarding therapy. The relevant clinical team, sponsor and DMC will be informed of any adverse event. The DMC chair and sponsor will determine if it is trial related.</p>

                <p>PPI is facilitated by a coapplicant with personal experience of psychosis. The grant application and MUSE intervention were developed in collaboration with people who have lived with hallucinations. Following the award of the grant, a fully funded PPI group has been formed in line with recommendations of advisory groups that encourage service-user involvement in NHS research (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.invo.org.uk/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.invo.org.uk/</ext-link>). The PPI group will be actively involved in all stages of the research programme, for example, advising on participant recruitment, information sheets, staff training, topic guides, analysis of the qualitative interview data and dissemination of the research findings. PPI members also sit on the TSC.</p>

CNTW NHS Foundation Trust is the trial sponsor. The R&amp;D team in the two recruitment sites (Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, CNTW and Tees, Esk and Wear Vally, TEWV NHS Trusts) have confirmed local capacity and capability to deliver the research. The results of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and made open access. On the basis of a reasonable request, the main outcome data (anonymised) will be available from the trial team after publication of the main results paper.
