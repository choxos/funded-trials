                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Patients with severe dry eye disease (DED) often have limited treatment options with standard non-surgical management focused on the use of artificial tears for lubrication and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, artificial tears do not address the extraordinary complexity of human tears. Crudely, human tears with its vast constituents is essentially filtered blood. Blood and several blood-derived products including autologous serum, have been studied as tear substitutes. This study proposes to test the use of whole, fresh, autologous blood obtained from a finger prick for treatment of severe DED.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The research team at the two participating sites will approach patients with severe DED for this study. Recruitment will take place over 12 months and we expect to recruit 60 patients in total. The primary outcome of this feasibility study is to estimate the proportion of eligible patients approached who consent to and comply with study procedures including treatment regimen and completion of required questionnaires. The secondary outcome measures, although not powered for in this feasibility, include corneal inflammation (assessed by the Oxford corneal staining guide), patient pain and symptoms scores (assessed by the Ocular Surface Disease Index Score), and objective signs of DED as indicated by visual acuity (assessed by Schirmer’s test, tear break-up time, lower and/or upper tear meniscus height measurement). Other secondary outcomes include patients’ quality of life (assessed using the validated EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire), cost to the National Health Service (NHS) and patient (assessed via use of NHS services and privately purchased over-the-counter treatment related to DED) and safety measure of pressure within the eye (assessed by the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Score).</p>

                  <p>This protocol and any subsequent amendments, along with any accompanying material provided to the participant in addition to any advertising material used in this trial have been approved by the East of England - Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 17/EE/0508). Written approval from the committee was obtained and subsequently submitted to the respective Trust’s Research and Development (R&amp;D) office with final NHS R&amp;D approval obtained. Data obtained from this study will be published in a suitable peer-review journal and will also presented at international ophthalmic conferences including the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Royal College of Ophthalmology Annual Congress, the Association for Research and Vision and Ophthalmology, and the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. Information will be provided to patient groups and charities such as the Sjogren’s Society and the Royal National Institute of Blind People. This will also be shared with the study participants as well as with relevant patient groups and charities.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dry eye disease (DED) is an umbrella term encompassing a range of ocular diseases estimated to affect 14% of all adults aged 48–91 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> If left untreated, DED can lead to severe reduction in the quality of life (QoL) of the patient. It can also cause loss of vision, pain in response to light, painful recurring stabbing sensations and the feeling of grit in the affected eye(s). Studies show that moderate-to-severe DED can be as disruptive to patient QoL as angina.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Despite this, only less than 2% of all UK medical research funding is directed at diseases of the eye, leaving eye research critically underfunded.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> No curative agents for DED exist. The treatment of the disorder is essentially symptomatic with standard non-surgical treatment focused on the use of artificial tears for lubrication and anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
              <p>Anti-inflammatory agents used in DED include topical steroids and ciclosporine drops but these can cause side effects that limit their long-term use.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Topical steroids can also cause cataracts and glaucoma, all of which further limit their use. Surgical options for DED include punctal occlusion to reduce tear drainage, punctal cauterisation (burning the drainage channel of tears and preventing their outflow) and partial suturing of the eyelids. However, these treatment options are associated with adverse effects and varying levels of patient tolerability. Overall, available conventional treatment options for DED often only alleviate symptoms, have limited effectiveness, and in most cases patients may fail to respond—although the exact rate of treatment failure is unavailable in the published literature.</p>
              <p>The mainstay of non-surgical treatment for DED focuses on the use of artificial tears. These can be purchased over the counter and include brand name products such as Viscotears and Optrex.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Human tears contain an extensive range of growth factors, immunoglobulins, enzymes, cytokines, vitamins and electrolytes and these have been shown in numerous studies to be essential for the maintenance and proliferation of corneal epithelial cells as well as for defence against infection.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It is well known that artificial tears fail to account for the extraordinarily complex composition of the natural tear film. Also, many artificial tears contain preservatives that have been shown to adversely affect the cornea.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Crudely, the human tear with its vast constituents is essentially filtered blood and as such is an obvious source for a ‘tear mimic’ containing all tear constituents. Blood and several blood-derived products including autologous serum (AS) have been studied as tear substitute candidates.</p>
              <p>AS eye drops have been found to be beneficial in uncontrolled trials by improving the ocular surface and reducing symptoms.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> However, a Cochrane review concluded that there is inconsistency in evidence on its benefit.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Obtaining AS requires frequent drawing of blood from the patient—a feature that excludes patients with anaemia or heart failure from using AS. Furthermore it also appears that 100% AS is more beneficial than 50% serum and requires larger volumes of blood and/or more frequent venesection.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Patients using AS also require access to a fridge, as the product needs to be stored at low temperatures—a factor that is likely to be inconvenient for patients. In addition, AS is obtained by processing clotted blood at an initial cost of £1653.56 to the National Health Service (NHS), and subsequent 3-monthly costs of £1131.27 per patient.</p>
              <p>The relatively high cost represents the biggest hurdle in the use of AS and is often the reason for delay or inaccessibility in its use as a treatment for DED. We propose that finger prick autologous blood (FAB) is a simpler, cost-effective and possibly more acceptable method for treating DED. For this reason, this study proposes to test the use of FAB in which blood obtained from a small finger prick is applied to the eye. Autologous fresh blood is already being used in the subconjunctiva to help heal leaking trabeculectomy blebs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> It is also used to help attach limbal autografts in cases of pterygium,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and in vitreoretinal macular hole surgery<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> with no adverse effects reported. The FAB method can be used in patients who are awaiting conventional treatment for autologous blood.</p>
              <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Rationale and risks/benefits</title>
                <p>This study proposes to test the feasibility of the use of whole, fresh, autologous blood as a treatment for severe DED (detailed study protocol presented as online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file</xref>). The blood can be obtained from a clean finger, pricked by the patient using a diabetic lancet and administered immediately to the eye. This allows the delivery of most of the aforementioned beneficial components of tears and additional growth factors and proteins, fresh and unprocessed, which can help heal the ocular surface. If validated, this may replace current AS practice and with its ease of use, vastly reduced cost and greater convenience may mean that it could be extended to other ocular surface diseases. The proposing team have completed an exploratory study on the use of FAB for persistent epithelial defects and severe DED and preliminary results indicate improvement with no adverse events (AEs) reported.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The exploratory study included 16 patients with a diagnosis of severe-to-moderate dry eye syndrome and used the FAB method for treatment. The findings of the study demonstrated mean improvements in visual acuity, Oxford corneal staining grade, tear break-up time and DED questionnaire score. The response rate from participants was good with only a single patient who met the inclusion criteria not wishing to participate in the trial. Both the amount of staining (indicating inflammation and ocular surface damage) and their DED questionnaire scores (indicating severity of their symptoms and impact on QoL) showed mean improvement which reached statistical significance. A search of clinical databases (Medline, CINAHL and AMED) including ongoing trials on the UKCRN (UK Clinical Research Network) portfolio database and related websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link>) did not identify any studies using FAB as a treatment for DED.</p>

              <title>Primary and secondary objectives</title>
              <p>The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate effectiveness of the use of fresh autologous blood (FAB) compared with conventional treatment for patients with severe dry eye syndrome. The primary outcome is the proportion of eligible patients approached who consent to and comply with study procedure including treatment regimen and completion of required questionnaires. The secondary objectives, although not powered for within this feasibility include: to estimate the effectiveness of the trial intervention and further explore the acceptability of the study design, and to explore the feasibility of collecting resource use and QoL data to inform the design of the health economics component of a future definitive trial. The secondary outcome measures, although not powered for within this feasibility, include corneal inflammation (assessed by the Oxford Corneal Staining Guide), patient pain and symptoms scores (assessed by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score) and objective signs of DED as indicated by visual acuity (assessed by Schirmer’s test, tear break-up time, lower and/or upper tear meniscus height measurement). Other secondary outcomes include patients’ QoL (assessed using the validated EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire), cost to the NHS and patient (assessed via use of NHS services and privately purchased over-the-counter treatment related to dry eye disease) and safety measure of pressure within the eye (assessed by the Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Score).</p>

Topics, questions and probes in the interviews will emerge from three sources: the relevant literature; our experience of and involvement in clinical ophthalmology; and consultation with patients. In this feasibility study, we will use a convenience sampling technique for the qualitative work. We will interview all clinicians who administer the intervention in the study and we will aim to interview 10 patients (adjusted for setting, gender and age group representation). Given the resources, we will aim to draw findings from a larger sample in a future study. This phase will work in parallel to the quantitative data collection so that emerging themes can be investigated in later interviews. Even though the feasibility study sample is reasonably limited, we anticipate some useful insights about the use of FAB because of the triangulation between the RCT and the qualitative findings (for example, reasons for partial adherence).</p>

The main purpose of the economic analysis is to inform the decision regarding how and what cost and effect data would be collected within a more definitive study.

Once a patient has consented to take part in the trial, they will be randomly allocated either to Arm A to receive FAB and conventional therapy or to Arm B to receive conventional therapy only. The research nurse or fellow or designated staff will log on to a web browser application and enter the patient’s eligibility factors into the system. The treatment allocation will be sent to the research team who will make the necessary arrangements for the patient’s treatment plan.</p>
                  <p>The treating ophthalmologist in the clinic will prescribe and counsel all patients on the correct technique for conventional treatment. The unblinded research nurses will provide additional training to the patients on the method of delivering FAB, including the use of a training video. Patients will be advised by the research team to inform their ophthalmologist if they have been started on any new treatment during the trial period by other clinicians or themselves.</p>

                <p>No serious AEs (SAEs) or complications associated with use of FAB in the treatment of ocular disease has been reported by the literature. Preliminary results of a pilot study conducted by the authors and involving 16 patients with DED also demonstrated no adverse effects of using FAB in the eye for 2 months.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although, we do not envisage any SAEs with the intervention in this trial, if an AE occurs and is not defined as SERIOUS, the AE will be recorded in the study file and the participant followed up by the research team. The AE will also be documented in the participants’ medical notes (where appropriate) and the case report form (CRF). SAEs that are considered to be ‘related’ and ‘unexpected’ will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event and to the main research ethics committee within 15 days in line with the required time frame. SAE reporting will commence at the start of the trial and up to 4 weeks after the intervention.</p>
