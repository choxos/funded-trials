                <p>Distinct protective humoral signatures are induced by Vi-conjugate and Vi-polysaccharide vaccines. Shared humoral features across both vaccines suggest that protection against typhoid fever is mediated through a combination of qualitative features of the polyclonal humoral response (avidity and innate immune cell functional responses) in addition to antibody quantity.</p>

                <p>Typhoid Vi vaccines have been shown to be efficacious in children living in endemic regions; however, a widely accepted correlate of protection remains to be established. We applied a systems serology approach to identify Vi-specific serological correlates of protection using samples obtained from participants enrolled in an experimental controlled human infection study. Participants were vaccinated with Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Vi-TT) or unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) vaccines and were subsequently challenged with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi bacteria. Multivariate analyses identified distinct protective signatures for Vi-TT and Vi-PS vaccines in addition to shared features that predicted protection across both groups. Vi IgA quantity and avidity correlated with protection from <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infection, whereas higher fold increases in Vi IgG responses were associated with reduced disease severity. Targeted antibody-mediated functional responses, particularly neutrophil phagocytosis, were also identified as important components of the protective signature. These humoral markers could be used to evaluate and develop efficacious Vi-conjugate vaccines and assist with accelerating vaccine availability to typhoid-endemic regions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Typhoid fever is a systemic febrile illness that affects 9–13 million individuals globally each year (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Stanaway et al., 2019</xref>). Incidence rates are highest among children living in low- and lower-middle–income countries who lack access to safe water. Antimicrobial resistance among <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi (<italic>S.</italic> Typhi) strains is increasing. The current fluoroquinolone-ceftriaxone extensively drug-resistant typhoid fever outbreak occurring in Pakistan has highlighted the need for urgent intervention (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Klemm et al., 2018</xref>). Fortunately, several advancements toward disease control have been made in recent years. In 2018, the World Health Organization recommended the programmatic use of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) to protect children living in high-burden endemic regions (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>), and the Global Vaccine Alliance pledged $85 million to assist with the rollout of TCVs in Global Vaccine Alliance–eligible countries (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">The Lancet, 2018</xref>). In December 2019, the first efficacy data evaluating the only World Health Organization–prequalified TCV (Typbar-TCV) in children aged 9 months to 15 years from an endemic region were published. Vaccine efficacy was estimated at 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.8–91.8) after 15-month follow-up (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that demand for TCVs will increase in the coming years. Several TCVs in development are immunogenic and safe but lack efficacy data (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bhutta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Capeding et al., 2020</xref>). Vaccine-induced correlates of protection could be used to screen TCV candidates to identify efficacious vaccines, removing the need for large-scale efficacy studies and thereby accelerating the process of vaccine development and licensure. Correlates of protection have already been used to license other types of conjugate vaccines, such as the capsular group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nguipdop Djomo et al., 2013</xref>) and newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jódar et al., 2003</xref>). Currently, widely accepted correlates of protection for typhoid fever do not exist. Protective thresholds of Vi IgG titers, extrapolated from Vi-polysaccharide (Vi-PS) and Vi-recombinant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A carrier conjugate vaccine (Vi-rEPA; TCV with recombinant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A carrier protein) efficacy trials, have been difficult to replicate owing to differences in antibody detection methods. Furthermore, limited availability of sera from the original studies has prevented bridging studies from being successfully undertaken (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Szu et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>It can be difficult to identify serological correlates of protection from large vaccine efficacy trials, as not all vaccinees are guaranteed to be exposed to the pathogen, and sera are usually not available from all participants. However, direct correlations can be made in experimental controlled human infection models (CHIMs), in which volunteers are deliberately infected with <italic>S.</italic> Typhi. In 2017, we published the first efficacy data for a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Vi-TT) vaccine, which was evaluated using a <italic>S.</italic> Typhi CHIM. Participants were randomized to vaccination with Vi-TT, unconjugated Vi-PS, or control (meningococcal ACWY conjugate) vaccines and were orally challenged with live <italic>S.</italic> Typhi bacteria in a bicarbonate solution ∼28 days later. Typhoid fever was diagnosed in individuals with <italic>S</italic>. Typhi bacteremia or clinical features of disease (persistent fever ≥38°C). We observed attack rates of 77% (24/31) in the control group, 35% (13/37) in the Vi-TT group, and 37% (13/35) in the Vi-PS group, resulting in efficacy estimates of 54.6% (95% CI 26.8–71.8) for Vi-TT and 52.0% (95% CI 23.3–70.0) for Vi-PS (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
              <p>Logistic regression modeling of Vi IgG titers from the CHIM efficacy study found that higher Vi IgG titers reduced the probability of typhoid fever diagnosis; however, an absolute threshold of protection could not be established. More recently, we have observed that higher Vi IgA titers induced by Vi vaccination were also associated with protection; however, once again, a protective threshold was not identified (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dahora et al., 2019</xref>). The median Vi IgA concentration in protected Vi-PS vaccinees was 504 µg/ml; however, the median concentration in diagnosed Vi-TT participants was similar, at 595 µg/ml. Protected Vi-TT vaccinees had a median Vi IgA concentration of 2,118 µg/ml (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dahora et al., 2019</xref>). These preliminary findings suggest that other subpopulations of antibodies, within the polyclonal Vi antibody response, may be involved in mediating protection against <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection and that Vi-TT and Vi-PS induce protective responses through different humoral mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Here, we employed a systems serology approach (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chung and Alter, 2017</xref>), using samples obtained from Vi-TT and Vi-PS vaccinees from the <italic>S</italic>.

                <title>Vi IgA and IgG responses together predict protection from typhoid fever</title>
                <p>Univariate analyses identified Vi IgA and potentially Vi IgG as mediators of protection. We hypothesized that a combination of features within the polyclonal Vi-specific humoral response were involved in mediating protection from <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection. To further explore this, we used a supervised multivariate approach that combined least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with partial least squares discriminatory analysis (PLSDA) to define a minimal set of humoral features (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gunn et al., 2018</xref>) that, together, distinguished protected versus diagnosed vaccinees across the two vaccine arms. Given the correlated nature of the humoral immune measurements, additional features that were correlated to the LASSO-selected features were also examined to help understand the biological and potential mechanistic underpinnings of the identified correlates.</p>
                <p>Multivariate analyses identified a set of five shared features that predicted protection across both Vi-TT and Vi-PS vaccine groups at day 28: Vi IgA quantity (detected using the binding antibody multiplex assay [BAMA]; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dahora et al., 2019</xref>), Vi IgG2 titer (measured using ELISA), and IgA2 avidity were associated with protection, whereas ADNKA features (release of IFNγ and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β [MIP-1β]) were associated with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). Univariate comparisons of the latent variable (LV) scores across the most discriminatory axis, LV1, pointed to Vi IgA as the top feature that was selectively enriched among protected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Furthermore, network analysis highlighted a tightly interconnected network of features all linked to Vi IgA and IgG2, including Vi IgG1 and IgG3, and ADNOB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Given the constitutive expression of both FcγRs and FcαR on neutrophils, these data point to a protective role for coordinated IgA- and IgG-mediated neutrophil activation as a potential mechanism underlying protective immunity for both vaccine groups. Moreover, the enrichment of ADNKA with other functions, including ADCP and antibody-dependent complement deposition (ADCD), among diagnosed volunteers points to a highly specialized and unique functional axis in which broad innate immune activation may be detrimental to control, whereas selective neutrophil activation may be key to protective antimicrobial activity.</p>

                <p>Distinct protective signatures were identified for Vi-TT and Vi-PS when each vaccine group was evaluated separately. A set of 10 features were needed to predict protection within participants vaccinated with Vi-TT, and interestingly, protection was primarily associated with Vi IgA responses (IgA quantity and avidity) and IgG1 avidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>).

Degranulation of NK cells (CD107a surface expression) was also associated with protection, suggesting that cytotoxic activity by NK cells, but not proinflammatory activities, may contribute to protection. The association of Vi IgG1 avidity with protection may suggest that a subset of Vi IgG1 antibodies capable of inducing NK cell degranulation and neutrophil activity may be protective. Protected participants continued to maintain or develop antibodies capable of inducing ADNP, as ADNP activity remained elevated in sera of protected Vi-TT vaccinees up to day 208, in concert with elevated Vi IgG and IgA titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study represents the first comprehensive evaluation of Vi-vaccine correlates of protection performed using samples obtained from an <italic>S</italic>. Typhi human infection model. Using a systems serology approach, we integrated a range of vaccine-induced humoral measures to evaluate co-correlate networks and identified multivariate protective humoral signatures that may have been overlooked with traditional univariate methods. Our findings suggest that protection from typhoid fever is mediated through the synergistic effects of the polyclonal antibody response, involving both qualitative antibody components (avidity and innate immune cell functional responses) and Vi IgA and IgG quantity.</p>
              <p>Protection in Vi-PS vaccinees was associated with a generalized polyisotypic response (IgA, IgM, and all subclasses of IgG). In contrast, protection associated with Vi-TT vaccination was more selective, involving only Vi IgA responses (quantity and avidity) and Vi IgG1 avidity. These findings likely reflect differences in the underlying immune mechanisms elicited by T-independent PS vaccines (extrafollicular B cell responses) versus T-dependent glycoconjugate vaccines (germinal center formation).</p>
              <p>Of note, protection in both vaccine groups was associated with antibody-mediated functional activity. While protective functions induced by Vi-TT vaccination were more restricted, primarily involving neutrophil phagocytosis, a broader range of functional activities, including ADNP, was observed in protected Vi-PS vaccinees. These findings suggest that neutralizing antibodies alone are insufficient to prevent <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection and could account for the difficulties in identifying antibody “thresholds of protection” (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dahora et al., 2019</xref>). Similar observations have been made following parenteral malaria vaccination, in which different vaccine strategies (adenoviral vaccine prime with a protein boost versus protein vaccination alone) resulted in comparable protective efficacies despite the induction of different antibody titers (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ockenhouse et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>As we have previously described, Vi IgA responses were associated with protection in both vaccine groups (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dahora et al., 2019</xref>). Although the protective role of secretory IgA has been well described for certain enteropathogenic viruses (e.g., rotavirus; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coulson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Matson et al., 1993</xref>), and nonenteropathogenic viruses (e.g., poliovirus; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Buisman et al., 2008</xref>), few studies have evaluated IgA titers following parenteral Vi-vaccination (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chernokhvostova et al., 1969</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kossaczka et al., 1999</xref>). As such, the mechanisms by which Vi IgA mediates protection are unknown. During the early stages of infection, the periods when <italic>S.</italic> Typhi bacteria are extracellular and expressing the Vi-PS capsule are limited (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Watson and Holden, 2010</xref>). Vi capsular expression does not occur within the gut lumen owing to the high osmolarity environment (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2017</xref>); as such, secretory Vi IgA or exudative IgG are unlikely to prevent <italic>S.</italic> Typhi invasion. We postulate that high concentrations of Vi IgA present in local mucosal sites, such as the lamina propria, Peyer’s patches, or efferent lymphatics, are responsible for opsonizing Vi-expressing extracellular <italic>S</italic>. Typhi, thereby preventing the establishment of infection.</p>
              <p>Several studies have reported mechanisms of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi killing mediated by Vi IgG, such as complement-mediated serum bactericidal activity and phagocyte-mediated killing (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pulickal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2016</xref>), but none have investigated the role of Vi IgA on downstream effector responses. Univariate analyses of Fc-mediated effector responses from this study have shown a significant increase in antibody-mediated complement deposition, neutrophil phagocytosis, and cellular (monocyte) phagocytosis following Vi-TT and Vi-PS vaccination. However, these functional assays were performed using sera containing polyclonal Vi antibodies and not purified Vi IgA. Co-correlate network analyses identified an association between neutrophil activity (phagocytosis and oxidative burst) and Vi IgA and IgG2 with protection. While this suggests that neutrophils are important mediators of protection, further studies are required to investigate the mechanistic interactions between Vi vaccine–induced IgA and neutrophil effector functions such as the NADPH-dependent oxidative burst, degranulation, and release of antimicrobial enzymes, and perhaps even the release of neutrophil extracellular traps.</p>
              <p>Human challenge models are useful experimental settings for evaluating vaccine correlates of protection. They provide opportunities for intensive blood sampling and collection of clinical data in the context of timed interventions (e.g., vaccination and challenge). However, many aspects of natural <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection cannot be reproduced within a challenge model setting. As such, there are differences in study population (children vs. adults), time interval between vaccination and challenge, challenge inoculum, and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi strain. The limitations of CHIM studies are numerous and a consequence of logistical factors, in addition to ethical and safety considerations. The sample size of this study was calculated based on efficacy outcomes and was not powered to specifically evaluate correlates of protection. This has affected the statistical interpretation of our results, as many findings were nonsignificant after adjusting for multiple testing.</p>
              <p>The administered challenge inoculum (1–5 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU) and 14-day study design also affect the identification of correlates of protection. The administered challenge dose of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi was calculated to produce an attack rate of 60–75% in naive participants (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Waddington et al., 2014</xref>). The typhoid fever attack rate within our control group was 77%. It is unknown whether the remaining 23% of individuals were protected from infection by the presence of preexisting immunity or innate immune responses, or whether they would have succumbed to typhoid infection if treatment were delayed. It is reasonable to assume that a proportion of nondiagnosed individuals, within both Vi vaccine groups, fall under the same category as the nondiagnosed control participants. Inclusion of this group of individuals within our analyses may have reduced the signal of certain protective humoral responses.</p>
              <p>We recognize that some of these limitations affect the generalizability of our findings to relevant endemic settings. In particular, definitions used to identify typhoid fever cases differ between phase III efficacy trials (which identify participants with typhoid fever disease, i.e., febrile or symptomatic participants with <italic>S</italic>. Typhi bacteremia) and CHIM studies. Our composite definition facilitated detection of all participants with typhoid fever infection, including both those with disease (febrile participants) and those who were infected without clinical manifestations (asymptomatic <italic>S</italic>. Typhi bacteremia). We were unable to perform any correlate analyses using a typhoid fever disease definition, similar to that used in field efficacy trials (fever ≥38°C followed by positive <italic>S</italic>. Typhi culture), because of the small sample size of our study (Vi-PS diagnosed, <italic>n</italic> = 7/35; Vi-TT diagnosed, <italic>n</italic> = 2/37, using the above definition).</p>
              <p>However, our analyses did identify an association between higher fold increases in Vi IgG titer and delayed time to first fever, lower peak temperatures, and lower CRP levels. We hypothesize that Vi IgG controls bacterial burden after <italic>S.</italic> Typhi are released into the bloodstream during bacteremic phases of infection, thereby reducing clinical manifestations of disease. This is supported by the observation that higher fold increases in Vi IgG titer were associated with lower numbers of <italic>S.</italic> Typhi bacteria detected from blood at the time of typhoid fever diagnosis. Conversely, no correlations between fold change in Vi IgA titer and surrogate clinical outcomes were observed. Vi-TT induced significantly higher Vi IgG titers than Vi-PS, which may provide an explanation for the reduction in fever and severity of symptoms observed in diagnosed Vi-TT vaccinees compared with their Vi-PS counterparts (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, no significant differences in fold increase in Vi IgA titers were observed between vaccine groups, which may explain why equivalent efficacies for Vi-TT and Vi-PS were observed in the CHIM efficacy trial, as an <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infection endpoint rather than typhoid fever disease endpoint was used to measure vaccine efficacy. In summary, these findings may indicate that Vi IgA responses are important for preventing <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infection, therefore representing a correlate of protection for infection, while Vi IgG responses reduce clinical manifestations of disease after infection has been established, supporting the concept of Vi IgG as a correlate of protection for typhoid fever disease.</p>
              <p>It is important to recognize that the pathogenesis of typhoid fever differs from invasive disease caused by other encapsulated bacteria, for which serological correlates of protection have been successfully identified (e.g., <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type B, <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, and certain serotypes of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>). As discussed above, <italic>S</italic>. Typhi is primarily an intracellular pathogen. Infection results from several invasion events, and unlike other encapsulated bacteria, early bloodstream invasion with high numbers of bacteria does not occur. This may explain the complex relationship between Vi humoral responses detected in serum and protection against <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infection observed in our study. Murine models have also identified direct dissemination of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium from the gut lumen to secondary lymphoid organs via CD18-expressing macrophages, suggesting that <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria could potentially bypass vaccine-induced antibodies altogether by remaining within protected intracellular environments (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Torres et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
              <p>The past few years represent a critical turning point for typhoid fever disease control. The ongoing outbreak caused by an extensively drug-resistant <italic>S.</italic> Typhi clone in Pakistan is a reminder of the catastrophic effects uncontrolled <italic>S</italic>. Typhi spread can have on resource-limited countries (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Klemm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rasheed et al., 2019</xref>). Although strategies to control disease burden using TCV programs are underway (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2019</xref>), efforts that could assist with the acceleration of these vaccination programs should be prioritized. The findings from this study are an exciting development in TCV research and have increased our understanding of protective Vi vaccine–mediated humoral responses against <italic>S.</italic> Typhi infection and disease, which could in turn be used to evaluate TCVs in development and guide future vaccine design. Further studies are required, including the assessment of Vi IgA and IgG responses in children vaccinated with TCVs from typhoid-endemic settings, as responses may differ, and evaluation of antibody-mediated effector responses, in particular neutrophil activity, which will assist with elucidating mechanistic correlates of protection.</p>

                <title>Multivariate analysis</title>
                <p>An Elastic-net/LASSO regularization with PLSDA under a fivefold repeated cross-validation framework was used to determine the combinatorial effects of multiple features together associating to the outcome (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gunn et al., 2018</xref>). Partial least squares (PLS) modeling is a multivariate modeling approach used to transform a high-dimensional immune parameter space into a new low-dimensional space (latent component space). While reducing the dimensionality, PLS extracts a set of orthogonal LVs that together capture the maximum covariance between all the input features and the response (challenge outcome). Each of the LVs was formulated to linearly combine all features based on the feature weights. Derived weights assist with assessing the importance of the individual features’ impact on the predictive model. The Elastic-net/LASSO method, integrating the penalty functions of LASSO and ridge regression, is used to remove irrelevant features to improve the robustness of high-dimensional modeling (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Zou and Hastie, 2005</xref>). PLSDA models the covariance relationship between the selected feature variables (X) and the outcome variable (Y; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Wold et al., 2001</xref>). The model is built using a repeated cross-validation framework, to minimize model overfitting driven by outliers, and is coupled with permutation tests to a statistical validation of the classification model. Importantly, the model also calculates the feature weights (variable importance in the projection [VIP] scores), a weighted sum of squares of the PLSDA variable loadings (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Galindo-Prieto et al., 2014</xref>), to gain enhanced resolution of the degree to which each correlate contributes to the overall model classification.</p>
                <p>The mean values of measurements (all samples and assays were run at least in duplicate) were calculated and carried over into the model analyses. The feature matrices were first processed and normalized before multivariate modeling. The features were removed if the missing values were &gt;25% of total subjects or if variance was low (variance ≤ 1; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Missing values in the matrices were estimated using a <italic>k</italic>–nearest neighbor algorithm, a weighted average of values in <italic>k</italic> closest samples to the missing feature determined by Euclidean distance. The matrices were then normalized by Z-score standardization, which made each feature mean centered and unit variance scaled. To define the minimal correlates that best explained protection, a 5,000-repeated fivefold cross-validation was designed. In each repetition, the dataset was randomly divided into a training and testing dataset, while maintaining approximately the same proportions in each outcome group. A set of the correlates was identified by an Elastic-net/LASSO PLSDA model, and the goodness of fit of the model was measured by accuracy. The frequency of the feature selected among 5,000 repetitive models was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup8">Table S8</xref>) and used to rank all features. A step-forward approach was then used to determine the minimal correlates starting from the top feature. Coefficient of variation accuracy was calculated in each step, and the minimal correlates that generated the highest accuracy were selected. Because of the limited sample size and unavailability of an independent dataset, the models trained using cross-validation were not tested in an independent dataset. The customized scripts for multivariate model analysis were performed in Matlab and are available on request (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p>The correlation network was constructed based on the correlation coefficients between the immunological features measured in this report. Edges between nodes were weighted based on the correlation coefficient (Spearman ρ) between the features represented by the two nodes. Using significant correlation coefficients after correcting for multiple comparisons (Benjamini–Hochberg <italic>q</italic> value &lt;0.01, testing the hypothesis of zero correlation), an adjacency matrix was constructed using soft thresholding to define edge weights. The correlation networks were built using the open-access software Cytoscape v3.7.1.</p>
