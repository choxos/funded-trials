                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>A qualitative sub-study was carried out within a larger phase II feasibility
trial, to identify and describe the burden experienced by advanced melanoma
patients participating in a clinical trial and the factors affecting their
capacity to cope with the burden.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen patients with
advanced melanoma recruited from National Health Service hospitals in the
United Kingdom. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using a framework
analysis approach. Normalisation process theory was applied to the concept
of research participation burden in order to interpret and categorise
findings.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Burdens of participation were identified as arising from making sense of the
trial and treatment; arranging transport, appointment and prescriptions;
enacting management strategies and enduring side effects; reflecting on
trial documents and treatment efficacy, and emotional and mental effects of
randomisation and treatment side effects. Factors reported as influencing
capacity include personal attributes and skills, physical and cognitive
abilities and support network.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>This is the first study to highlight the substantial burden faced by patients
with advanced melanoma in a clinical trial and factors that may lessen or
worsen the burden. Consideration of identified burdens during trial design
and execution will reduce the burden experienced by research
participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Melanoma is a life-threatening skin cancer with a high incidence rate and accounts
for 4% of all new cancer cases.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Globally, incidence rates of
melanoma rose by 44% between 2008 and 2018,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> with deaths increasing by 32%.
Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK) are among the countries with the
highest incidence rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy that tends to
metastasize beyond its primary site. The introduction of oral targeted combination
therapies that target the BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1)
mutations has improved overall survival rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> These targeted therapies incur
significant toxicity and this can limit their efficacy. Moreover, patients assume
the responsibility for understanding the medication regimen and determining how to
best integrate the treatment and treatment-related side effects into their daily
lives.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
Consequently, many patients will experience burden both from their illness and from
the demanding treatment regimen. The increased emphasis on self-management in cancer
patients, deemed necessary to improve outcomes and reduce costs, shifts the
long-term management of ill-health from clinicians to patients;<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> yet the treatment burden that
patients experience is not well understood.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Treatment burden is the healthcare workload (tasks recommended by clinicians to
improve health status, e.g., attending medical appointments, managing complex
medication, diet and exercise regimens) experienced by patients with chronic
conditions and the impact this has on behavioural, cognitive, physical and
psychological well-being.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â<xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Patients who struggle with complex and demanding treatment
regimens often experience adverse outcomes including poor self-management, adherence
to medication therapies and quality of life (QOL), leading to increased
hospitalisation rates, healthcare costs and mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The medical approach to poor
outcomes which is to intensify treatment may inadvertently increase treatment burden
as already burdened patients are asked to do more by their clinicians.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Treatment
burden for people with advanced melanoma on oral therapies remains
under-researched.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Research participation will exacerbate basic treatment
burden as patients face the additional burden of increased travel, completing
questionnaires and undergoing supplementary procedures specific to a
trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Evidently, research participants in clinical trials experience
both treatment and trial burden; underscoring the need to fully explore their
experiences.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Capacity is the abilities and resources that patients can mobilise to manage and cope
with the demands of healthcare and life that if limited, impacts the ability of
individuals to self-manage.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Patient capacity determines whether the combination of
participating in a clinical trial in conjunction with the burden of taking a therapy

              <p>Despite improving outcomes, continuous daily dosing is associated with several
challenges including treatment resistance with a median progression-free survival of
12 months, treatment compliance and QOL. Hence, intermittent dosing may help delay
onset of disease progression, manage drug-induced toxicity and improve tolerability.
INTERIM (INTERmittent vs. continuous dosing of oral targeted combination therapy in
patients with BRAFV600 mutant stage 3 unresectable or stage 4 metastatic melanoma)
was the first randomised phase II feasibility trial to deliver intermittent dosing
of the oral targeted combination therapy alongside standard care (continuous
dosing), and examine QOL, clinical efficacy, safety, time to treatment failure,
overall survival and toxicity. In addition to trial outcomes, patient experiences
were explored to gain perspectives about the intervention and trial participation
that were not otherwise evaluable through quantitative measures. Qualitative
research provides insight into areas of enquiry with little baseline understanding,
explores experiences of sub-groups, enhances trial findings and allows more complex
phenomena to be explored in detail.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Therefore, the aim of this
qualitative sub-study was to identify and describe the burden of participating in a
clinical trial whilst living with advanced melanoma, and the factors affecting
capacity to cope with this burden.</p>

melanoma; predicted life expectancy Ë12 weeks; adequate renal, liver and bone
marrow function; willingness to comply with scheduled visits, treatment, lab
tests and completion of trial procedures described in the protocol. Of the 16

                <p>The tasks carried out by patients to manage their illness (e.g., taking
medications, reading information leaflets, arranging transportation to attend
hospital appointments, making lifestyle changes) and the personal impacts of
trial participation, were discussed by participants.</p>

                  <title>Sense-making work</title>
                  <p>All participants described their diagnosis as life-changing and previous
cancer treatments as torturous. However, despite undergoing and experiencing
adverse effects of several procedures including surgery, radiotherapy and
immunotherapy, they learned that their disease had become advanced following
unfavourable scan results. The combined targeted oral therapy was
subsequently prescribed to reduce the likelihood of further disease
progression. They reported that clinicians explained the challenges
associated with continuous administration of the drug (standard care),
however, it was unclear whether equipoise was sufficiently explained.</p>
                  <p>Participants reported that they were provided with verbal and written
information which they described as informative, and noted being given
sufficient time to make an informed decision. Many participants acknowledged
not having a good understanding of melanoma treatment and management at the
outset but invested time and effort into understanding the treatment and
trial by reading trial documents and asking questions.<disp-quote><p>I basically asked how it would workââ¦âjust to have the whole process
explained to me because it is quite complicated â¦ It did take
getting my head round itââ¦âwhat to expect and all that sort of thing
â¦ initially, I knew nothing about it. [P8, I]</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Some routinely used the internet to look up health information and through
personal research, enhanced their understanding of the treatment.</p>
                  <p>Despite the reported level of written and oral information provided
beforehand, some participants acknowledged that they did not fully
understand the information provided which subsequently led to
misconceptions; for example, erroneously perceiving the treatment as
curative rather than life-extending. Important RCT concepts such as
randomisation were also difficult for some to understand and/or accept.<disp-quote><p>[Randomisation] was quite an unusual aspect to deal with certainly in
terms of the fact that we were dealing with such an important
treatment for myself â¦ I was keen to try and understand â¦ was every
patient treated completely randomly? Or was every second patient
treated conversely to the first patient? [P5,
SC]</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Additionally, participants felt that they had not received comprehensive
information regarding treatment side effects.</p>

                <title>Relationship work</title>
                <p>Participants engaged with clinicians, friends and family with regard to the
disease and its management to enable them to provide support. They reported good
relationships with the trial clinicians who they consulted frequently during the
trial. Those who contacted clinicians by phone either received advice over the
phone or organised a clinic appointment. Participants spoke highly of the trial
clinicians and mentioned the exceptional care received and the approachability
of the research nurses.<disp-quote><p>Dr [name] at [city], he organised everything extremely quickly in
conjunction with [hospital], and the service and the care Iâve got was
fantastic â¦ well, I couldn't have got any better if Iâd have gone
private, to be quite honest; it was excellent. [P7,
SC]</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Participants felt that seeing the same clinicians at each consultation was
important and invaluable to their experience. They highlighted that whereas
continuity of care was often lacking in secondary care, being in the trial made
it possible for participants to be looked after by the same nurse(s), with whom
they had developed a relationship.</p>
                <p>Participants were also involved in arranging hospital appointments,
transportation and prescriptions. Most patients relied on others, mostly family
members, to help out with transport to appointments. Some also spent time
liaising with and arranging help from social services and cancer charities.
There were very few reports of unsatisfactory encounters during the trial that
fell below participantsâ expectations although several participants complained
about the delay with the prescription service that resulted in more time being
spent in hospital than necessary.</p>

                <title>Enacting work</title>
                <p>Participants described the logistic and practical day-to-day activities they had
to undertake in order to adhere to treatments and maintain their health. They
highlighted the considerable amount of work and time involved in attending
multiple hospital appointments, including consultations, questionnaire
completion, blood tests and scans.<disp-quote><p>The main problem is all the hospital appointments. It's getting there all
the time that they want you there â¦ that's the only thing that gets me
down a bit. [P1, SC]</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>However, some felt that this level of monitoring was essential given the advanced
stage of the disease and potency of the oral therapy.</p>
                <p>Adhering to treatment consumed an immense amount of time, and working out the
strict timing of the medication proved particularly difficult for participants.
Hence, medication non-compliance occurred despite strategies to prevent it, that
is, using alarm clocks and log books/diaries. Additionally, enduring and
managing treatment side effects consumed the largest proportion of participant's
time and energy. All participants experienced a number of treatment side effects
that affected their physical and mental wellbeing, including pyrexia, flu-like
symptoms, vomiting, syncope and pustular eruptions.<disp-quote><p>One morning I collapsed and then I got the shakesâ¦ My blood pressure went
very low. I got out of bed and then I fell in the bathroom â¦ and my wife
couldn't get me out and then they took me into [hospital] and they kept
me in for about five days. [P12, I]</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Most participants were taking a variety of medications to control treatment side
effects including proton pump inhibitors, morphine and steroids, which also had
side effects which they endured, for example, insomnia. Participants stressed
that they were solely responsible for self-managing their disease(s) and
treatment, and felt that the onus was on patients to follow cliniciansâ
directives. Most reported initially relying on clinicians for advice but had
since developed confidence to self-manage their side effects.</p>

                <title>Appraisal work</title>
                <p>Much effort was also expended on trying to incorporate the treatment and side
effects into daily lives, and participants independently altered medication
regimens to fit in with their daily activities. In addition, participants spent
time assessing management plans either with the help of clinicians or
independently, hence, those who suffered severe adverse effects were advised to
either introduce a break in the medication regimen or continue on a reduced dose
indefinitely. Participants on the reduced dose experienced improved QOL.<disp-quote><p>Iâve noticed a difference now on a lower dose that Iâm not that tired â¦
As for the [side effects], theyâve really kind of dissipated â¦ at the
moment the medication's suiting me and keeping the cancer at bay, and my
quality of life isn't being affected. [P3, I]</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Participants also reported reflecting on self-management practices and treatment
efficacy. Participants were motivated to persevere with current treatment
despite experiencing side effects as they saw noticeable improvements in the
extent of their disease.</p>
                <p>Overall, participants were satisfied with the efficacy of the targeted therapy.
Participants also attended monthly follow-up visits, self-completed
questionnaires every 3 months, and reported all other side effects as they arose
by completing questionnaires. Participants felt that the questionnaires were
useful because they assessed both physical and psychological effects, and
enabled participants to reflect on their progress and wellbeing. However, some
felt that it did not fully capture the psychological issues participants
experienced during the trial.</p>
                <p>Participants also reflected on and reported being satisfied with the overall
conduct of the trial. However, they suggested that in future, due to the potency
of the drug, the current dosage should be more closely monitored or reduced in
order to prevent severe adverse reactions.</p>

                <title>Psychological burden</title>
                <p>The emotional and mental effects of trial and treatment featured prominently and
were frequently mentioned by participants. For example, some reported feeling
fearful and anxious at the possibility of not meeting the trial eligibility
criteria. They also reported experiencing low mood, sadness and anxiety during
the trial. In addition, they ascribed the strong negative emotions they felt to
the targeted therapy.<disp-quote><p>The first few weeks it made me feel really aggressive and really quite
angry â¦ Iâve never really experienced that amount of aggression and
anger before. [P7, SC]</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p>Given the severity of side effects, many participants reported spending time
gauging their physical and mental limitations and adjusting their day
accordingly. They found carrying out daily activities very difficult as it
demanded more energy than they could muster, leading to feelings of
frustration.</p>
                <p>Preference for the intermittent arm led to dissatisfaction. Despite progress made
during the trial, risk of further disease progression caused distress and
anxiety. </p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a detailed description of the
burdensome impacts of trial participation and elements of patient capacity that
could influence the burden experienced by patients with advanced melanoma taking
oral targeted combination therapy. This study reveals the extensive effort afforded
by patients entering a clinical trial including understanding their illness, the
treatments, trial documents and processes. Findings show that participants received
adequate amount of verbal and written information, and had easy access to
clinicians; however, knowledge gaps and misconceptions still existed. In addition,
the rationale for randomisation were poorly understood. These findings are in line
with the literature<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which also found therapeutic misconceptions, and
insufficient health and research literacy in patients with chronic illness. The
rationale for these findings include information overload at an emotional time and
failure to remember, understand or fully engage with trial information prior to
consenting to participate.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Similar to our findings, evidence shows that treatment side
effects, for example, fatigue, contribute to emotional distress and mental health
problems among patients with cancer, potentially leading to inability to
work.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, up to 70% of patients with cancer stop working or
experience a reduction in work hours after being diagnosed or treated for cancer,
with negative implications for their income.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Participants in this study lived a considerable distance from hospitals, attended
multiple appointments for treatment and trial-related activities, and endured an
enormous burden associated with travel to attend appointments. This has cost
implications as out-of-pocket expenses for travel are not covered or
reimbursed.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The high burden of trial participation in clinical trials
has been identified as a barrier to recruitment, retention and active engagement in
interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A recent systematic review<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> found that the most common
reasons cited by people with cancer for declining participation, missing hospital
appointments and withdrawing from an ongoing trial, were complexity and stringency
of the study protocol, additional research procedures, appointments and travel time
to hospitals. These are important points of consideration because the success of
RCTs depend on their ability to recruit sufficient patients and to ensure that as
few patients as possible withdraw from the trial or become lost to follow-up.
Similar to our findings, the literature<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> shows that aspects of the
trial process such as recruitment, randomisation and treatment allocation often
impose a psychological burden on research participants including disappointment,
anger and depression.</p>
              <p>Patients with advanced melanoma in this study experienced demanding treatment
workload with debilitating side effects. Participants obtained and administered oral
medication, monitored symptoms and self-managed side effects. In line with other
studies,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> several participants in this study also took several
medications to control treatment side effects. Thus, the daily work that patients do
to manage their cancer is exacerbated by the additional effort to manage drug
interactions and side effects, all of which have to be integrated into their social,
work and family lives.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Self-management practices represent a significant burden
for patients despite being seen as a solution to the long-term management of chronic
illness by healthcare professionals and policy makers,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> as the resources to achieve
these ends may not be available to the patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Participants in this study
highlighted several factors that they felt affected the burdens they experienced
including altruistic motivation, emotion-focused coping, personal attributes and
skills, physical and cognitive abilities and support network. These are resources
that may counteract the negative impact of excessive demand of healthcare, lessen
the treatment burden and influence adherence and engagement with
clinicians.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Hence, it is vital that clinicians assess and assist with areas
in which patients may need extra support and guidance, and consider patientsâ
capacity to undertake healthcare workload.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It is also vital that trials
consider patient burden and capacity as study variables.</p>
              <p>The findings also show that participants drew upon a range of personal and social
resources to help them manage and cope with the demands of research participation.
For example, in line with the literature, emotion-focused coping such as focussing
on other life priorities, could help to manage negative emotions arising from the
burdensome work of self-care.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Also, altruistic motivation,
maintaining a positive attitude and support from social network, employers and
clinicians could bolster a sense of positive psychological wellbeing and adherence
to self-care regimens.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The literature supports the use of social comparison as a means
of adapting to stressful circumstances.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Participants also identified
positive reinforcement and feedback in research studies as enabling factors, in line
with the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> These findings underscore the need to encourage patients to
acknowledge their burdens and communicate what could be done to better support
them.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Considerations for future trials to minimise participant burden</title>
                <p>Patients and members of the public should be involved at the planning stage of a
trial. Drawing on their experiential knowledge and ideas will ensure that
burdens are identified early and either eliminated or strategies are put in
place to minimise their effect.</p>
                <p>Clinicians and researchers should assess and carefully consider the difficulties
and challenges that patients will experience from therapeutic commitments and
trial participation. Consideration should also be given to capacity to manage
burden. The standard care clinical burden that patients already face need to be
determined and balanced against the demands of the trial in order to determine
whether they can realistically participate.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Education, guidance and support should be provided on how patients can
effectively integrate taking medications into their daily lives, simplify the
regimen, increase adherence and manage side effects of treatment. The reliance
of patients on clinicians for advice and support creates an opportunity for
clinicians and patients to co-create a feasible and actionable plan that would
help maximise patient capacity. These discussions could elicit a more open
dialogue with patients about how they are coping with their illness, treatment
and research participation, and how they can be assisted in areas where they may
need extra support and guidance. Toolkits to aid discussion include goal
elicitation, instrument for patient capacity assessment, workload assessments
and medication therapy management tools.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Patients should also be
signposted to financial and mental health support resources.</p>
                <p>The process of seeking informed consent in trials contributes to psychological
burden, particularly where patients are told about the potential benefits of a
new treatment and then informed that their treatment allocation would be
determined by randomisation.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> A clear explanation of
true equipoise and the rationale for randomisation could reduce this burden.
Furthermore, research burden is not sufficiently considered by regulatory
agencies which focus more on the risks of the intervention and data
collection.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Shifting the focus to ensure protocols meet ethical
standards whilst imposing the smallest possible burden to effectively answer
research questions is paramount.</p>
                <p>One study showed that the median number of items collected per participant in a
sample of cancer RCTs was 599, but only 18% of the collected data was used and
reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Researchers are urged to include only essential
items.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, using electronic questionnaires and
scheduling several activities for the same day, for example, consenting patients
in clinic during wait times and collecting data at the same visit, could
minimise number of patient visits to hospitals, interruptions to daily routine
and work, as well as minimising parking issues and other burdens.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
                <p>This study examined the burden of research participation experienced by patients
with advanced melanoma taking part in a clinical trial, and factors that may
affect their capacity to cope with these burdens. Although the sample size is
small, the study obtained rich information about participantsâ experiences.
However, this study used a convenient sample of patients who volunteered their
time and provided self-reports of their experiences and it is possible that the
most burdened patients declined to be interviewed due to time constraints or
severity of illness. The factors affecting patient capacity discussed here were
based on participantsâ account and further research is needed to examine their
possible role in influencing capacity to manage burden of research
participation. In addition, NPT appears to offer a robust conceptual framework
for understanding overall burden of research participation, although in line
with another qualitative study,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-17423953211060253" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> psychological burden fell
outside the NPT framework. Nevertheless, by combining inductive and deductive
analyses, the emotional aspects of participantsâ experiences were captured.</p>

              <p>This study provides a detailed description of burdens experienced by patients with
advanced melanoma in a clinical trial and elucidates factors that may lessen or
worsen the burden. Clearly, the burden of research participation for chronically ill
patients is a significant issue and will become even more pronounced with the
projected rise of cancer survivors in the UK and around the world. The consideration
of burdens during the planning and design of RCTs could help improve their conduct,
recruitment and retention as many of the burdens can be anticipated and avoided in a
move towards minimally disruptive research.</p>
