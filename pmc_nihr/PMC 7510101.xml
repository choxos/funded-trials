                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p id="Par1">This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of FRESH (Families Reporting Every Step to Health), a theory-based child-led family physical activity (PA) intervention delivered online. We also assessed the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on outcomes of interest and whether pre-specified criteria were met to progress to a full-scale definitive trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In a three-armed randomised pilot trial, 41 families (with a 7â11-year-old index child) were allocated to a: âfamilyâ (FAM), âpedometer-onlyâ (PED), or a no-treatment control (CON) arm. The FAM arm received access to the FRESH website, allowing participants to select step challenges to âtravelâ to target cities around the world, log their steps, and track progress as families virtually globetrot. FAM and PED arms also received family sets of pedometers. All family members could participate in the evaluation. Physical (e.g., fitness, blood pressure), psychosocial (e.g., social support), behavioural (e.g., objectively-measured PA), and economic (e.g., expenditure for PA) data were collected at baseline,Â 8- and 52-weeks.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">At 8- and 52-weeks, 98 and 88% of families were retained, respectively. Most children liked participating in the study (&gt;â90%) and thought it was fun (&gt;â80%). Compared to the PED (45%) and CON (39%) arms, a higher percentage of children in the FAM (81%) arm reported doing more activities with their family. Adults agreed that FRESH encouraged their family do more PA and made their family more aware of the amount of PA they do. No notable between-group differences were found for childrensâ minutes in moderate-to-vigorous PA. Sizeable changes of 9.4 (95%CI: 0.4, 18.4) and 15.3 (95%CI: 6.0, 24.5) minutes in moderate-to-vigorous PA was found for adults in the FAM group compared to those in the PED or CON groups, respectively. No other notable differences were found.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This study demonstrates feasibility and acceptability of the FRESH intervention. All progression criteria were at least partially satisfied. However, we failed to recruit the target sample size and did not find a signal of effectiveness on PA particularly long-term or in children. Further refinements are required to progress to a full-scale trial.</p>

Approximately one-third of adults in the UK are insufficiently physically active, falling short of achieving the national recommendation of at least 150âmin of moderate- or 75âmin of vigorous-intensity physical activity weekly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adults with school-aged children are particularly at risk for physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and a recent review showed that young adults exhibited greater declines in physical activity over the transition to parenthood compared to those without dependent children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Half of UK children fail to meet the national recommendation of 60âmin of daily moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Observational data also reveal that children are less active after school and on weekends than during school time, and that activity levels decline most steeply outside of school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Targeting children and adults as a family therefore appears to be a promising avenue for promoting physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Previous research suggests that involving family members is critical for sustained behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and home-based family physical activity interventions are potentially more effective than those requiring the family to travel to community or other intervention locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many studies, however, centre around promoting child physical activity instead of considering the family as a unit that may work together to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Our recent feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] evaluated an intervention that specifically targeted whole family engagement. The findings showed that it was feasible to deliver and evaluate a family-targeted physical activity promotion intervention with high acceptability from participating families.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Building upon this work, here we present the findings from the Families Reporting Every Step to Health (FRESH) pilot trial. The primary aim of this pilot trial was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the revised recruitment strategy, intervention, and outcome evaluation (i.e., after feasibility testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). Secondary aims were: (1) to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on potential outcomes of interest and; (2) to assess whether pre-specified criteria were sufficiently met to warrant progression to a full-scale definitive trial.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par13">A detailed description of the study protocol has been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; a brief summary of the methods is provided below. We received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee for the School of the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Cambridge (ID number: 17/113) and this study was prospectively registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12789422">ISRCTN12789422</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Study overview</title>
                <p id="Par14">This pilot trial was a three-armed, parallel-group, randomised controlled pilot trial using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio and included follow-up assessments at 8- and 52-weeks post-baseline. After baseline assessments, families were randomly allocated to one of the three study arms: (1) family arm, (2) pedometer-only arm, or (3) no-intervention control arm. Families were recruited from the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, UK.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Recruitment difficulties led to an 8-week extension of the originally planned 16-week period. At minimum, families with at least one child in school Years 3â6 (aged 7â11âyears, hereafter referred to as the index child) were eligible to participate if at least one adult responsible for the index child and living in the main household (hereafter referred to as the index parent) provided consent. However, we ideally sought to recruit whole families, that is, all adults and children living in the main household with the index child. If requested, we also enabled the inclusion of parents or siblings that lived outside the main household or extended family members (e.g., grandparents) living inside or outside the index childâs main household. All participants were required to be able to perform light-intensity physical activity, have access to the Internet, and have sufficient understanding of the English language to provide informed consent. For this study, we permitted family members to take part in the intervention irrespective of their participation in the accompanying evaluation and vice versa.</p>
                <p id="Par16">We aimed to recruit 60 families using a multi-faceted recruitment strategy that was informed by our prior work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This approach targeted adults and children, included a wide range of physical settings (such as schools, employers, community settings including community centres, shopping centres, GP surgeries), used electronic media (e.g., social media, television news). It was also based on direct (e.g., face-to-face recruitment during school pick up) and indirect recruitment strategies (e.g., posting recruitment material on parent groups on social media platforms). Following dissemination of recruitment materials, families were encouraged to express interest in participating to the study team, who conducted a screening assessment and scheduled a baseline appointment with eligible families. Prior to baseline assessments, written informed consent was obtained for all participating adults, alongside written parental consent and child assent for each participating child. After baseline assessments, families were randomised in blocks of six and stratified by county (i.e., Norfolk or Suffolk) by an independent statistician using a computer-generated algorithm.</p>

                  <title>Family arm (FAM)</title>
                  <p id="Par17">The development, feasibility, acceptability, and refinements made to the intervention prior to the current pilot trial have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], including a detailed description of the FRESH intervention as implemented in the pilot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In summary, families in the FAM arm received a theory-based intervention that was delivered online and aimed at increasing physical activity for the whole family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Intervention participation started with a 1-h kick-off meeting in which a member of the research team introduced families to the intervention website, distributed pedometers to all family members, and prompted the first of weekly âfamily timeâ meetings. The index child or children (if multiple) were designated the role of team captain(s) and they led weekly âfamily timeâ meetings. During these meetings, families completed family action planners and accessed the FRESH website which enabled them to choose weekly step challenges. Family action planners prompted families to plan weekly family physical activities to assist in meeting their step challenge for a given week. It was intended that families would plan activities they would do together as a family; however, participants had the flexibility to also set individual level goals. The action planners also prompt families to monitor weekly step counts, discuss any potential upcoming barriers for physical activity and strategies to overcome them. Index children will be allocated as their familyâs âteam captainâ leading in challenge selection and uploading steps on the FRESH website. Families retained their pedometers and were permitted to use the website for as long as they liked, with continuing support.</p>

                  <p id="Par18">Following baseline, families allocated to the PED arm were mailed pedometers for all family members and generic family physical activity promotion information produced by Walk4Life, a sub-brand of Change4Life (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/change4life">www.nhs.uk/change4life</ext-link>).

                  <title>Accelerometer and GPS assessment</title>
                  <p id="Par21">Participants were asked to simultaneously wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ tri-axial accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC; Pensacola, Florida) and QStarz Travel Recorder BT1000X global positioning system (GPS) monitor (QStarz; Taipei, Taiwan) on each hip during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. After the 7âdays of wear, participants either posted the devices back to the research team using pre-paid envelopes or the research team picked up the devices at an agreed time.</p>
                  <p id="Par22">The accelerometer was initialised to record step counts and acceleration using a sampling frequency of 50âHz. Data from the device were then downloaded and interpolated to a 10âs epoch using the ActiLife software. A valid week for the accelerometery was defined as a minimum of 480âmin/day from 3âdays (including 1 weekend day) over the 7-day measurement period. Non-wear was defined as â¥90 mins of consecutive zeros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The cut points of Evenson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and Troiano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] were used to estimate physical activity for children and adults, respectively.</p>
                  <p id="Par23">The GPS device recorded participantsâ locations at a 10âs interval with an accuracy of approximately 3âm. Data from the GPS devices were downloaded and entered into the ArcGIS v10.3 (ESRI Inc., California, USA) Geographical Information System, and then longitude and latitude values were converted to easting and northing values respectively according to the British National Grid coordinate reference system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par24">The accelerometer and GPS data were then integrated based on their date and time-stamps using bespoke software written in Java. From the integrated accelerometer and GPS data, individual measures of time spent with and without other family members present were computed. This was undertaken using a script written in STATA v16 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA) that calculated the straight-line distance between each participant and every member of their family for all 10âs intervals, based on each participantâs easting and northing locations. To identify physical activity undertaken together, a distance of â¤50âm was taken as being indicative of the same location of members of the family during any given 10âs interval. This distance was selected because it is approximately equivalent to a ball court (e.g. tennis, basketball) or a large residential garden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>

We did not recruit any extended family members or any family members that lived outside the index childâs main household. Consent was obtained for 149 participants, averaging ~â4 members/family (rangeâ=â2â6 family members) and included 39 mothers (95%), 31 fathers (76%), and 41 siblings (from 32 families with an eligible sibling, 78%). Eleven siblings were younger than index children (&lt;â7âyears of age), 15 were in the same age category (7â11âyears) and 15 were older (&gt;â11âyears). Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> describes the participant characteristics at baseline.

Approximately, 92% of adults reported being married or living as married, 94% of adults reported their ethnicity as white, and the meanâÂ±âSD age that adults finished full-time education was 20.5âÂ±â3.5âyears.

                <p id="Par39">Most children reported that they liked taking part in the study (&gt;â90%) and thought it was fun (&gt;â80%). Compared to the PED (45%) and CON (39%) arms, a higher percentage of children in the FAM (81%) arm reported doing more activities with their family at 8-week follow up. TableÂ <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>a shows adultsâ overall perceptions of FRESH. Scores were generally positive and favoured the FAM over the PED arm. In particular, adults agreed that FRESH encouraged their family do more physical activity and made their family more aware of the amount of physical activity they do. Focus group findings also related to family physical activity, physical activity awareness, and parental modelling, for example:<disp-quote><p id="Par40">âIt was really fun, it pushed us to get our steps in and do more activities and sports together, you know. I never really thought about how many steps or exercise Iâve done to be honest, so since these [step] counters, I just look and go â3,000 [steps] only? I have to do somethingâ. So sometimes they [her 3 sons] come home and they see meâ¦ dancing, doing something, or skipping, they say, âwhat are you doing, mum?â [<italic>laughs</italic>] and I say, âIâm just putting effort in to get my stepsâ and then they join me, you know. It just made your more awareâ¦ I even started walking for small shopping instead of driving just to get my steps up [<italic>laughs</italic>]â¦ small things, you know, it just made you aware.â (Mother of 3, FAM group).</p></disp-quote>Overall acceptability of the pedometers was fairly high for adults in both the FAM and PED arms (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>b). Families in both groups reported that it became habitual to wear the pedometers; one parent stated: âI think itâs become quite habitual now, we pick them up first thing in the morning and take them off last thing at night and they [her children] were quite happy to do that, so that was good from a parent point of view.â (Mother of 2, FAM group). A greater percentage of PED children self-reported that they liked wearing their pedometer compared to FAM children (86% vs. 62%). Also, compared to our previous feasibility study, familiesâ preference to wear wrist-worn pedometers was emphasised more strongly during focus group discussions in this study.

                <p id="Par41">Based on a 4-point Likert scale (1â=âstrongly disagree, 4â=âstrongly), FAM adults found the kick-off meeting useful (meanâÂ±âSDâ=â3.6âÂ±â1.0) to help them get started, felt they had enough technical support if needed (3.9âÂ±â0.6), and found it feasible to schedule âfamily timeâ but not consistently so (see Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>c). Focus groups revealed that families were rarely using their action planners.

                <p>The majority of FAM children found the website easy to use (93%), wanted to keep using it (81%), enjoyed being their familyâs team captain (70%), and did not find it too difficult to reach their step goals (65%). Overall, adultsâ mean scores were generally positive in relation to the intervention website (see Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>d). In particular, adults strongly agreed that the website was easy to use and found various website elements to be useful (e.g., the step converter).

When asked in focus groups about suggestions for improvement, PED families suggested elements that were delivered to the FAM group, for example:<disp-quote><p>âI think if you can walk so many steps and it gets you to a place, like a country or something like that. So maybe there could be mini challenges like you walk to London or walk to Paris, you know, or something. Yeah, something like that would be probably quite good for you guys [referring to her children]. [â¦] We havenât been around the world, but weâd like to go around the world.

The most common behaviour flow was to log on, access the challenge page (to select a new challenge) and then access the steps page (to add steps to complete their challenge). Families selected an average of 11 challenges and completed 9 of those.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par52">Our findings showed that it was feasible to deliver and evaluate a family-targeted physical activity promotion intervention with generally high acceptability from participating families. In addition, each of the pre-specified progression criteria were at least partially met (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, we only found a favourable indication of effectiveness for adults and not children, that is, a sizeable positive change in MVPA for adults in the FAM group compared to the other groups. The between-group difference found for adultsâ minutes in MVPA was not maintained at 52-weeks follow-up and we also found no notable between-group differences for any other outcome measured at either time point.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Family recruitment posed a substantial challenge, and this progression criterion was not met (i.e., recruiting 20 families/month). Our average recruitment rate was ~â7 families/month (rangeâ=â2â15 families/month) despite using a multi-faceted recruitment strategy that targeted adults and children, included a wide range of settings, and direct and indirect recruitment strategies. The recruitment of participants into intervention research has been notoriously difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. A review of 73 publicly funded trials in the UK (through the National Institute for Health Research) found that only 55% recruited 100% of their target sample size within their pre-agreed timescale and nearly 45% received an extension of some kind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Several studies have reported that the recruitment of families is particularly challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and we have described specific recruitment challenges we have encountered previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the extent to which under-recruitment occurs in family-based research in unclear. A recent systematic review and Delphi survey investigating effective and resource efficient strategies for recruiting families in physical activity, diet, and obesity prevention research identified 48 eligible studies of which only 31% of studies reported a target sample sizeÂ [Guagliano JM, Morton KL, Hughes C, van Sluijs EMF, unpublished data]. A subsequent survey showed that only 38% recruited their target sample size over a median (interquartile range) of 12 (7.5â52) weeks. Recruitment periods were extended in 33% studies with a median extension of 20 (8â37.5) weeksÂ [Guagliano JM, Morton KL, Hughes C, van Sluijs EMF, unpublished data]. In terms of recruitment, 94% of adults reported their ethnicity as white. While this figure is reflective of the population of the counties where recruitment occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], the potential effectiveness of this intervention on minority families is unclear. Several studies have acknowledged the underrepresentation of minority groups in trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, further research is needed to better establish regarding how to recruit families in family-based research is needed, and in particular, greater consideration should be given to recruiting families of ethnic minority groups. Targeting specific recruitment settings or tailored messaging on recruitment materials are strategies that could be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">An extensive measurement protocol was applied in both the FRESH feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the current study, and it is not possible to disentangle whether the challenges of recruiting families were due to families having a lack of interest in increasing their physical activity, a lack of interest in FRESH in particular, or that the commitment to three rounds of home-based assessment of all family members was a barrier. Families in both the FRESH feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and pilot studies indicated that the level of measurement was acceptable to them, but this is likely to be a biased perception of a group of families that has made the commitment to take part in the FRESH study. Further research is needed to identify whether families may not be interested in physical activity promotion per se, or whether the research commitment required poses a barrier. With this in mind, researchers and funders should carefully balance the scientific need for detailed data collection (driven for example by questions around how interventions work, and impacts on important physical health outcomes beyond the target behaviour) with the burden on participants and its impact on recruitment of a representative sample of participants.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Encouragingly, we found evidence of preliminary short-term effectiveness for adults and, in particular, for fathers in the FAM group. Similar interventions with mothers have resulted in positive physical activity promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, the effect on fathers may be noteworthy as evidence indicates that fathers have an independent influence on their childrenâs health and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] and an important influence on childrenâs physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">Similar to other family-based physical activity interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], we did not find evidence of preliminary effectiveness for children or for co-participation in physical activity between parents and their children in this study. This may be due to a number of reasons. First, our process evaluation and focus groups revealed that family planning time was not being implemented as intended. In a family-based physical activity intervention that included a similar planning component, the authors found that childrenâs MVPA significantly increased in the short-term compared to a condition that received education only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Therefore, without implementing the planning component in our study, the step challenges alone may have not been enough to change childrenâs MVPA. There were also group differences in childrenâs sex and age, with fewer girls in the PED group and more older children in the FAM group. Observational data reveal that childrenâs physical activity declines with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and girls accumulate less physical activity than boys throughout childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], and girlsâ physical activity declines more precipitously than boys with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. These differences may have affected preliminary intervention effectiveness on MVPA, but this issue would likely be resolved through randomisation in an adequately powered trial. Lastly, there may have a been a healthy volunteer bias as participants across groups were generally already meeting physical activity recommendations at baseline. In future, excluding families that are sufficiently active could be considered.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Delivery of the FRESH intervention was estimated to cost Â£90 per family (~Â£15 per participant), including pedometers for all family members, face-to-face kick-off meeting and personalised follow-up support. The latter accounted for ~â55% of the costs. These costs could be reduced in future as this part of the intervention delivery had not been automated, but was processed manually by research staff. Further automation of these processes will help reduce delivery costs, and make it more attractive to funding agencies to consider delivering FRESH as part of their portfolio of physical activity interventions, if proven effective. Previous work has estimated the cost of delivering a multi-component school-based physical activity intervention at ~Â£190/participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], and an after-school intervention at Â£51/participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], suggesting that cost of delivering the FRESH intervention is low in comparison. However, little is known about how much local authorities or other delivery agents are willing to pay, and future research should explore this.</p>
              <sec id="Sec28">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par58">There are several noteworthy strengths of this study which include high retention rates, device-measured physical activity, a measure of family functioning, and a long-term follow-up assessment (i.e., 52-weeks post-baseline). There were also some limitations.</p>
                <p id="Par59">Despite bolstering our recruitment strategy after our feasibility study, we were still unable to recruit the desired number of families into this study; so further optimisation regarding recruitment in family-based research appears prudent. Also, the children and adults that participated in this pilot study were generally sufficiently physically active at baseline, which may have affected the potential of the intervention. Lastly, randomisation did not lead to balanced groups as there were large differences in sex and age among children across groups, where there were noticeably less girls in the PED group and older children in the FAM group. This may have affected our findings for preliminary intervention effectiveness. The randomisation procedure was likely affected by small sample size and the use of a stratified randomisation procedure by county due to funding. There is no indication that this issue would also affect an adequately powered trial; however, stratified randomisation by child sex and/or age could also be considered.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par60">In conclusion, this study demonstrates feasibility and acceptability of the family-targeted FRESH intervention, as well as satisfying all progression criteria, at least partially. However, we failed to recruit the target sample size and did not find a signal of effectiveness on MVPA particularly long-term or in children. Therefore, further refinements around intervention delivery and recruitment may be required prior to progressing to a full-scale trial.</p>
