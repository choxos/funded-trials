                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">People with serious mental illness (SMI) have sexual health needs but there is little evidence to inform effective interventions to address them. In fact, there are few studies that have addressed this topic for people with SMI outside USA and Brazil. Therefore, the aim of the study was to establish the acceptability and feasibility of a trial of a sexual health promotion intervention for people with SMI in the UK.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The RESPECT study was a two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility trial (RCT) comparing Sexual health promotion intervention (3 individual sessions of 1 h) (I) or treatment as usual (TAU) for adults aged 18 or over, with SMI, within community mental health services in four UK cities. The main outcome of interest was the percentage who consented to participate, and retained in each arm of the trial, retention for the intervention, and completeness of data collection. A nested qualitative study obtained the views of participants regarding the acceptability of the study using individual telephone interviews conducted by lived experience researchers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Of a target sample of 100, a total of 72 people were enrolled in the trial over 12 months. Recruitment in the initial months was low and so an extension was granted. However this extension meant that the later recruited participants would only be followed up to the 3 month point. There was good retention in the intervention and the study as a whole; 77.8% of those allocated to intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 28) received it. At three months, 81.9% (30 I; 29 TAU) and at 6 months, 76.3% (13 I and 16 TAU) completed the follow-up data collection. No adverse events were reported. There was good completeness of the data. The sexual health outcomes for the intervention group changed in favour of the intervention. Based on analysis of the qualitative interviews, the methods of recruitment, the quality of the participant information, the data collection, and the intervention were deemed to be acceptable to the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 22).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The target of 100 participants was not achieved within the study’s timescale. However, effective strategies were identified that improved recruitment in the final few months. Retention rates and completeness of data in both groups indicate that it is acceptable and feasible to undertake a study promoting sexual health for people with SMI. A fully powered RCT is required to establish effectiveness of the intervention in adoption of safer sex.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par21">People who live with serious mental health illness (SMI) are sexually active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; and some engage in sexual risk behaviour (such as condom-less sex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This may explain why people with SMI are at increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], sexually transmitted infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], unintended pregnancy and abortion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] compared to the general population. The reasons for engaging in sexual risk behaviour may include hyper-sexuality when in an acute phase of illness; co-occurring drug and alcohol problems, and being vulnerable to sexual coercion, exploitation and abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite these concerns, there has been a lack of attention to sexual health promotion in mental health care settings including staff avoiding the topic of sex and reporting significant structural and personal barriers to having conversations about sexual health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These barriers include lack of knowledge about sexual health and sexual health services, concerns about the topic causing embarrassment or distress, and a lack of local or national policy drivers.</p>
              <p id="Par22">A number of studies have been conducted in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] which sought to evaluate tailored sexual health interventions for people with serious mental illness. These studies were randomized trials of group interventions (compared with treatment as usual or other time and attention control) and were targeted at HIV risk behaviour for people who have significant and long term mental health problems. The interventions ranged from brief 2–3 sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] to a more intensive 12 session intervention which was for people who were homeless and had mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These studies have shown promise in the in terms of engaging and retaining people with SMI in the interventions, but have not always demonstrated an impact on adoption of safer sexual practices (such as increased use of condoms) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) commissioned a feasibility study (HTA 14/172/01) to develop and evaluate a bespoke sexual health intervention targeted at those with SMI. As there had been no previous trials of this nature in the UK, the first step in the process for evaluation of a complex intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] is to assess feasibility and acceptability in order to establish the parameters for a fully powered trial.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Design</title>
                <p id="Par24">The RESPECT study was a pragmatic, multi-centred, open feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants meeting the eligibility criteria were individually randomised (1:1) to receive either:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par25">The control arm: treatment as usual (TAU) which consisted of usual mental health care. All participants were free to pursue reproductive health and sexual health services via general services in their local area.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">The intervention arm: in addition to TAU, participants took part in three sessions of sexual health promotion, each of 1 h.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par27">Irrespective of arm of the trial, all participants received written information on local sexual health, contraceptive services, some condoms, and national helplines at the baseline appointment.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="Par28">The study took place in the National Health Service (NHS) community mental health services which provides mental health support to people with severe mental illness who live in the community. People in receipt of this service will have a named care coordinator (often a mental health nurse or social worker) and will see their care coordinator as well as other support staff as well as regular reviews by other members of the multi-disciplinary team including psychiatrist.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par29">The sample size calculations were based on estimating attrition rates and standard deviation of the primary outcome. Assuming 30% of participants were lost to follow up (as in the SCIMITAR pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) with a sample size of 100, then the 95% confidence interval for this level of attrition would be the observed difference ± 9 percentage points (i.e. between 21 and 39% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>];). Hence an external pilot trial of 100 participants would ensure robust estimates of follow-up in this population. Furthermore, an external feasibility study of at least 70 measured subjects provides robust estimates of the standard deviation of the outcome measure to inform the sample size calculation for the subsequent larger definitive fully powered trial.<sup>11</sup></p>

                <p id="Par49">Once eligibility was confirmed by mental health service, a RESPECT researcher arranged a convenient time and venue to meet with the potential participant to discuss participation. The first part of the meeting involved the researcher fully explaining the study and what would be involved (as per information sheet) and an opportunity for the person to ask questions and seek clarification. Written informed consent was then obtained and baseline data was collected (or a further date was arranged for baseline data collection). Participants received a £10 voucher for baseline, and for each follow-up data collection point as a token of gratitude for participating.</p>

                <title>Trial intervention</title>
                <p id="Par50">The overall aim of the intervention was for people to adopt safer sexual behaviours (as evidenced by reduced condom-less sex) and engage in more positive sexual relationships. The intervention was based on the Information Motivation Behaviour (IMB) model of sexual health behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and ensured that it addressed the following:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par51">Addressing any information needs using quizzes and exercises;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Increase motivation to adopt safer sexual behaviours using exercises and conversations;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Increase behavioural skills (and self-efficacy) to adopt safer sexual behaviours through role play and skills practice.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par54">The intervention was designed to be delivered over 3 × 1-h sessions that were delivered face-to-face by a specifically trained mental health worker. These interventionists were identified within each site and received training and an intervention pack prior to being allocated to participants. The sessions could be delivered at the local clinical service (where the person usually attended) or at their homes.</p>
                <p id="Par55">The manual was developed by an Intervention Mapping process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] using a combination of review of existing manuals that had been developed specifically for people with serious mental illness as well as consultation with service users and other stakeholders. Attention was paid to addressing the knowledge, motivational and behavioural and social skills deficits that have been identified as challenges to adopting safer sexual behaviours in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Iterations of the manual were reviewed by stakeholders and the members of the RESPECT study Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives and the content and format was refined based on feedback and discussion. The development of the intervention is described in more detail in the published NIHR final report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The delivery of the topics was designed to be interactive and used a series of quizzes, exercises and scenarios to generate discussion. The aim of the exercises within the sessions was to facilitate discussion about knowledge about sexual health and to supplement the gaps in knowledge in the session or signpost people to local sexual health and family planning services. In terms of the theoretical underpinning of the intervention (The IMB model) the quizzes were designed to improve knowledge and the discussions related to own risks and choices was designed to promote the importance of considering changing behaviour (build motivation). In addition to developing a sense of importance of change, the intervention used exercises and role play to increase a sense of self-efficacy and self-worth. The role plays of negotiation and assertiveness skills as well as the practice of putting a condom on and off safely improved behavioural skills. All participants were offered condoms and sachets of lubricant at each session.</p>

                <p id="Par75">Randomisation was performed by a secure, remote, telephone service based at York Trials Unit. An independent statistician at the University of York undertook the generation of the randomisation sequence. Randomisation was on a 1:1 basis using stratified block randomisation with stratification by centre and variable block sizes. Periodic checks were made on the computerised randomisation system during the trial following standard operating procedures:

Participants had given consent at the start of the study to be re-contacted to be invited to take part in individual interviews conducted by phone. They were not interviewed by the same person who had collected the baseline and follow-up data to avoid social desirability responses. Lived experience researchers were involved in this aspect of the study along with the two main researchers. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed and then coded using thematic analysis.

                <p id="Par92">The original recruitment target was 100 people over 6 months. However, recruitment was slower than expected and changes to recruitment strategy were made in an attempt to increase recruitment after 3 months. This included focusing recruitment on a more direct service user approach (face to face, posting packs and follow-up phone calls). Following these changes, recruitment did improve (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

                <p id="Par93">Over the course of 12 months 138 people were recorded as being formally screened for eligibility. This number is based on data from the screening logs from the NHS Research and Development offices. However, it is likely the number that were eligible was much higher as many participants were notified about the study more informally via leaflets, posters and talking to their care coordinators. Of those formally screened, 117 (84.8%) met the eligibility defined for inclusion into the trial. This 84.8% eligible is much higher than the 50–60% anticipated based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A total of 72 participants were randomised into the trial giving a recruitment rate of 61.5% (52.2% of screened participants then went on to enter the study), which was higher than the 40% which was predicted. The flow of participants can be seen in 2.</p>

                <title>Follow-up, withdrawals and intervention attendance</title>
                <p id="Par94">There was good retention in the trial. All participants were followed up at 3 month post randomisation, and a subsample (<italic>n</italic> = 38) were also followed up at 6 months (limited only due to time constraints of the end of the study period). At 3 months, 59 of the 72 participants completed the questionnaire (81.9%), split equally across the two arms (<italic>n</italic> = 30 intervention, and <italic>n</italic> = 29 control). Similarly, at 6 months 76.3% of participant due to complete the questionnaire did (<italic>n</italic> = 29, 13 intervention and 16 control). This shows that participants in both arms are willing to be involved and retain in the study, demonstrating that a future trial would have the ability to retain participants.</p>
                <p id="Par95">Overall, ten participants (13.9%) withdrew from the study. Two participants were withdrawn from follow-up only, one after discussion with the lead investigator and clinician (due to their poor mental state at the time of follow-up) and the other gave no reasons (one in each arm). Full withdrawal from the trial was requested by four participants; two in each treatment arm. One person changed their mind about taking part due to the topic, and a further three gave no reason.</p>
                <p id="Par96">Thirty-six participants (50.0%) were randomised to the intervention arm. The intervention was designed to consist of 31-hour sessions. Nine of these participants (25.0%) never started the intervention; five withdrew from treatment prior to starting. The first session was attended by 25 participants (69.4%), the second by 19 (52.8%) and the third by 18 (50.0%). However, several (<italic>n</italic> = 5) participants requested to combine sessions, so this might be an under-estimate of attendance. In total, 17 participants (47.2%) attended all three sessions and 22 participants were exposed to all the content (61.1% of those initially randomised; 81.5% of those who started the intervention).

                <p id="Par102">The results of the qualitative study are reported in more detail in the NIHR report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but in summary the participants were very positive about the whole experience of taking part in RESPECT. There was no overall preference for any one method of recruitment, but there was a common theme of stating a preference in being able to have a conversation with someone about participating (such as with their care coordinator). This is interesting to note considering care coordinators had not engaged directly conversations about the study during recruitment and the more successful route had been by direct contact with potential participants. The study information provided was reported to be easy to understand and provided enough information to prepare them for what would be involved in taking part. People found the data collection comfortable and not distressing despite the fact that for some people the data collection appointments could be up to 2 h and involve questions about sexual activity. They reported that the research staff were friendly and approachable and they valued flexibility in times and locations of appointments. They appreciated the voucher as a “thank you” for taking part. Some felt that parts of the data collection was a bit boring and repetitive, but not to the point that it was very uncomfortable. For those who received the intervention, they found it interesting, thought provoking and informative. They liked the interactive nature of the sessions and again there were comments appreciating the flexibility of times and locations of delivery. Some of the participants mentioned they had never spoken to a care coordinator about sexual health before, and one participant reported that taking part in RESPECT had been an “ice breaker” meaning that they had begun to have conversations with their care coordinator about the subject. Finally, almost all of the 22 participants said they would recommend participating in the study to other people.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par103">The RESPECT study was the first study to test the feasibility of undertaking a randomised trial of a sexual health intervention outside the Americas. Few studies related to sex and sexuality have been conducted in the UK, and as well as identifying if such as study is acceptable and feasible, this also has provided useful data on how to recruit to and collect data on sexual health for people who use community mental health services.</p>
              <p id="Par104">As this was designed to establish feasibility, it was not powered to detect statistically differences between intervention and control group so despite the intervention group outcomes appearing to favour a benefit from the intervention, this has not been definitively established in this study. The time to recruit the sample was in hindsight underestimated. The target of 100 was not achieved, even with an extension to the recruitment phase. However the attrition was not as high as the predicted 30%. The other limitation is a lack of detail on exact numbers screened at each site, and how many of those eligible actually received information regarding the study. Therefore it is not known for sure if the lower recruitment was due to the study being unattractive to eligible participants, or if it was because the information did not reach the potential participants. Certainly, the recruitment did improve using a more direct approach rather than relying on busy mental health staff to discuss the study and pass on information. The participants who were interviewed did not express a preference for recruitment method but did feel that it was important to be able to speak to someone (such as their care coordinator about the study).</p>
              <p id="Par105">The profile of people recruited broadly reflect the characteristics of people with serious mental Illness (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition to the demographics, the average ReQoL scores reflect those of a clinical population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Equal numbers of men and women were recruited and evenly distributed across both arms. Retention was similar in both arms of the trial. The study was conducted over several services and a range of geographical areas in England therefore the challenges and solutions that have been identified are likely to be applicable to further sites in a larger trial.</p>
              <p id="Par106">The fact that 72 people with serious mental illness across several services in England engaged with the study is a positive finding. This indicates that it is feasible to engage people with SMI in a study related to sexual health without any adverse events. Retention was good in terms of both the data collection (both in control and intervention group) in spite of the fact that data collection appointments took between one and 2 h and focused on sexual behaviour. The intervention was well attended; most people who attended at least the first session of the intervention went on to complete all three. The feedback from the qualitative interviews comfirmed that this was perceived to be a comfortable and interesting study to participate in,</p>
              <p id="Par107">The feasibility study has identified a number of issues that could be addressed in a future fully powered trial of effectiveness: This includes dedicating more time to support the role of the care coordinators in community mental health teams in terms of promoting the topic and allaying any concerns regarding the study. In addition, there should be sufficient people trained and able to deliver the intervention within each service (and of both genders). There were periods in the study where there was a lack of availability of a trained interventionist, and some participants did not receive the intervention due to this delay.</p>
              <p id="Par108">Many people were not sexually active during the study period (even if they had been active in other periods) and so this means that the primary outcome of N% “condom less sex” could be problematic to base the sample size calculation for a future trial. However, the intervention sought to be broader than simply using condoms, and also includes the whole range of contraceptive choices, as well as assertiveness skills and planning within sexual relationships, in line with the World Health Organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] definition. This sees sexual health as broader than simply the prevention of infections; and incorporates the right to express one’s own sexuality free from abuse and coercion. The RESPECT study gave people an opportunity to have frank discussions about their past current and future sexual encounters, as well as receiving a clear message that sexual expression is important part of being human and having a mental illness should not exclude them from what is actually a fundamental human right. One of the measures assessed behavioural intentions to adopt safer sex and at follow-up the scores were positive in the direction of the intervention. Therefore it will be important in a future trial that people are not excluded on the basis of not being currently sexually active, and the sample size will have to be larger to account for the fact that some people may not be having sex during the study period itself.</p>
              <p id="Par109">Despite not quite achieving the target sample, at the end of recruitment period there were other potential recruits identified, and the recruitment graph suggests that recruitment improved over time, so it is reasonable to assume that targets could be achieved in a future trial with sufficient sites fully engaged and with capacity to deliver on the intervention for the trial period.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par110">People with serious mental illness are interested in sexual health and have a range of sexual health needs that need exploring and responding to. This study was able to recruit a sample of people who are living with serious mental illness and retain them in both the intervention and data collection. The topic did not trigger distress or other harms. Therefore undertaking sexual health research with people with serious mental illness is important, and this study demonstrated that it is feasible, safe and acceptable to participants.</p>
