                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The majority of surgical wounds are closed (for example with sutures or staples) and so heal by primary intention. Where closure is not possible, or the wound subsequently breaks down, wounds may be left to heal from the bottom up (healing by secondary intention). Surgical wound healing by secondary intention (SWHSI) frequently presents a significant management challenge. Additional treatments are often required during the course of healing, and thus a significant financial burden is associated with treating these wounds.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Increasingly, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used in the management of SWHSI. This wound dressing system provides a negative pressure (vacuum) to the wound, removing fluid into a canister, which is believed to be conducive to wound healing. Despite the increasing use of NPWT, there is limited robust evidence for the effectiveness of this device. A well-designed and conducted randomised controlled trial is now required to ascertain if NPWT is a clinically and cost-effective treatment for SWHSI.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">SWHSI-2 is a pragmatic, multi-centre, cross surgical specialty, two arm, parallel group, randomised controlled superiority trial. Adult patients with a SWHSI will be randomised to receive either NPWT or usual care (no NPWT) and will be followed up for 12 months.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The primary outcome will be time to healing (defined as full epithelial cover in absence of a scab) in number of days since randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include key clinical events (hospital admission or discharge, treatment status, reoperation, amputation, antibiotic use and death), wound infection, wound pain, health-related quality of life, health utility and resource use.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Given the increasing use of NPWT, despite limited high-quality supporting evidence, the SWHSI-2 Trial will provide robust evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT in the management of SWHSI.</p>
                  <p id="Par6">The SWHSI-2 Trial opened to recruitment in May 2019 and is currently recruiting across 20 participating centres.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par36">More than 10 million surgical operations are performed in the NHS every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].Wounds are usually closed by apposing the wound edges — “healing by primary intention”. However, when closure is not possible, or when primarily closed wounds break down (dehisce), they are usually left open to heal from the bottom up, through formation of granulation tissue — “healing by secondary intention”.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (SWHSI) are a common, complex problem. A recent survey estimated the UK prevalence of SWHSI to be 4.1 per 10,000 population and identified colorectal, plastics and vascular as the surgical specialties most commonly associated with SWHSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Treatment of these wounds presents a significant financial burden to the NHS, with costs of SWHSI estimated to be £1060 per patient, before inclusion of treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The healing pathway of SWHSI patients is often prolonged and complex with a variety of treatment options, ranging from basic, relatively inexpensive wound dressings (around £441 per month) to complex, expensive treatments such as Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT, around £1323 per month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]).</p>
                <p id="Par39">These wounds pose a unique management challenge and difficulties for patients; they can remain open for many months, may require a multitude of treatments, are highly susceptible to infection and may require prolonged hospitalisation and/or further operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The healing pathway of patients with an open wound is often prolonged, which has a substantial impact on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a recent cohort study of 396 people undergoing SWHSI, the median time to healing was 86 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 75 to 130). In specific wound sites (e.g. foot/leg), the duration was almost double that of wounds elsewhere on the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Infection (32.1%), hospital readmission (24.7%) and further surgical procedures (16.8%) were all common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. People with SWHSI often require frequent dressing changes, and for many years standard dressings that filled cavities and/or covered open surgical wounds were used widely. More recently negative pressure wound therapy has been introduced and seen rapid increased use: a recent UK-based survey and cohort study of SWHSI found an increase from 6 to 29% in a 1-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">NPWT was developed in the 1990s as a treatment for open wounds (although versions for closed wounds are now available they are not the focus here). The device applies a controlled negative pressure (vacuum) to a wound via a specialist dressing, removing wound fluid into a canister [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI), the manufacturer who pioneered the use of NPWT with their V.A.C® device, claim that the mechanical forces generated by the negative pressure create a wound environment that is conducive to healing by removing infective materials and exudate, reducing oedema and promoting perfusion and granulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. NPWT is not anticipated to be used to the point of healing, rather its use is promoted as part of the treatment pathway to reduce the time taken for healing to be achieved.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Despite the increasing use of NPWT as a treatment for SWHSI, there is limited robust evidence to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this treatment for this patient group. A Cochrane review identified three randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] of NPWT as a treatment for SWHSI; however, all were small and caution was advised when interpreting the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The clinical and cost-effectiveness and the harms and benefits of NPWT in the treatment of SWHSI therefore remain uncertain.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par42">To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT compared to usual care (no NPWT) in treating SWHSI. This trial will test the hypothesis that NPWT is superior to usual care in treating SWHSI, based on time to healing in days from randomisation. A detailed economic evaluation will be undertaken to compare the cost-effectiveness of NPWT to usual care to determine the most efficient provision for future care and resources.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par43">SWHSI-2 is a pragmatic, multi-centre, cross surgical specialty, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled, superiority trial. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatments (NPWT and usual care).</p>
                <p id="Par44">Funded by the MRC PROMETHEUS Programme (MR/R013748/1), the trial includes two nested studies within a trial (SWATs) to assess the effectiveness of strategies to improve recruitment (infographic plus participant information sheet (PIS) vs PIS only) and retention (thank you card sent between follow-up time points vs no card).</p>

                  <title>Intervention (negative pressure wound therapy — NPWT)</title>
                  <p id="Par81">Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) devices are used as part of the SWHSI treatment pathway rather than necessarily to the point of healing and are administered by a range of healthcare professionals.</p>
                  <p id="Par82">Prior to application of NPWT, the wound is filled with a suitable NPWT-specific dressing (for example, black, polyurethane foam dressings with reticulated (open) pores; white, polyvinyl alcohol foam with high tensile strength, pre-moistened with sterile water; or antimicrobial gauze (impregnated with polyhexamethylene biguanide)). A liner may also be placed in the wound bed to prevent dressing adherence. A controlled negative pressure is then applied to the wound via a specialist vacuum pump dressing. The dressing is attached to tubing, which enables wound fluid to be removed into a canister. The canister is removed and changed weekly or when it becomes full, whichever occurs first.</p>
                  <p id="Par83">The device will be used in accordance with manufacturer guidance. The clinical care team, in conjunction with local treatment guidelines, will determine the duration of device use, whether this includes continuous or intermittent pressure cycles, and the type of dressing used. Treatment regimen and details will be recorded during weekly telephone follow-up.</p>

                  <p id="Par90">The primary outcome for SWHSI-2 is time to healing (defined using the clinical criterion “complete epithelial cover in the absence of a scab”) in days from randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">Participants will be contacted weekly by a research nurse and asked if a healthcare professional has indicated that their wound has healed and whether this meets the healing definition (i.e. there is full coverage and no scab present). If the participant believes the wound is healed, but this has not been confirmed by a healthcare professional, the research nurse will seek confirmation/further information from the clinical team.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">Once healing has been confirmed, participants will undergo clinical assessments on 3 subsequent consecutive weeks to confirm continued wound healing. A standardised photograph will be taken of the wound at the first healing assessment. Participants (with assistance from family/friends if necessary) will also be asked to take a digital photograph of the wound themselves and submit this to the study team. Study specific instructions will be provided to facilitate this.</p>
                  <p id="Par93">Given the subjective nature of healing assessment (23), the photographs will be used to facilitate additional outcome (time to healing) verification by clinically experienced, independent, blinded observers.</p>

                <p id="Par104">To detect a 25% reduction in median time to healing (from 86 days with usual care to 65 days with NPWT), with 90% power, 12-month follow-up, and allowing for 20% attrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], 696 participants are required to be recruited and randomised (348 NPWT; 348 usual care).</p>
                <p id="Par105">A conservative estimate of a 25% decrease in median time to healing is used to derive this sample size, assuming a median time to healing of 86 days in the usual care group, which equates to a 21-day reduction in time to healing to 65 days in the NPWT group.</p>

                <p id="Par112">Participants with a planned SWHSI can be approached prior to surgery and those with unplanned SWHSIs or whose wound dehisces can be approached after surgery. Where patients are screened pre-operatively, consent will be obtained pre-operatively and randomisation completed either in theatre or post operatively. Baseline data will be collected post-operatively.</p>
                <p id="Par113">To supplement recruitment, a study within a trial (SWAT) testing an infographic to aid recruitment is nested within the SWHSI-2 trial.

                <p id="Par114">A recent review showed that tailoring or shortening the PIS given to participants makes little or no difference to recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, infographics have been shown to improve patient knowledge and experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

                  <p id="Par130">Data will be collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation, and via weekly clinical telephone follow-ups.</p>
                  <p id="Par131">At baseline, epidemiological data will be collected including patient demographics, comorbidities, smoking status and surgical procedure details. Participants will complete a questionnaire comprising of a number of outcomes measures including surgical site infection (Bluebelle WHQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), wound pain (using a visual analogue scale), quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) and resource use (using a bespoke, study specific questionnaire, which was designed based on the experiences learnt from the earlier feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]).</p>
                  <p id="Par132">At 3, 6 and 12 months, participants will be sent a postal questionnaire to complete and return comprising of a number of outcomes measures including surgical site infection (Bluebelle WHQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), wound pain (using a visual analogue scale), health-related quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) and resource use (using a bespoke, study specific questionnaire). Where no response is provided after 2 weeks, a reminder questionnaire will be sent. If after 2 further weeks no response is received, a reminder telephone call will be made to the participant, and data collected by telephone if the participant is agreeable.</p>
                  <p id="Par133">During the trial, participants will also be telephoned weekly to collect data on wound healing (using the criteria complete epithelial cover in the absence of a scab (eschar)), clinical events, treatment status and adverse events. When the participant reports that their treating healthcare professional has indicated that their wound is healed, and this has been confirmed in accordance with the SWHSI-2 trial definition (as above), the research nurse will undertake an assessment with the participant, ideally within 48 h of the report of healing being made, to confirm that the wound has healed. In the event wound healing has not been confirmed by a healthcare professional, the research nurse will first contact the clinical care team to obtain this confirmation and the date the participant was advised their wound was healed will be taken as the date of wound healing.</p>
                  <p id="Par134">When the wound is confirmed to be healed, clinical assessments will be completed with the participant on 3 consecutive weeks (commencing with the initial healing visit). At the initial visit a standardised photograph will be taken to facilitate blinded outcome verification, and the Bluebelle WHQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] will be completed. The research nurse will also determine whether surgical site infection (SSI) has occurred in the time since the participant has had an open surgical wound using a SSI reference assessment (Centre for Disease Control (CDC) criteria, assessed retrospectively. This CDC assessment is required as a reference assessment to enable validation of an SSI threshold score for the Bluebelle WHQ in patients with open surgical wounds.</p>
                  <p id="Par135">Wherever possible the initial visit will be completed face to face at the participant’s home or in a clinical care setting to facilitate provision of the standardised photograph taken by the research nurse. Where this is not possible, a video call, using NHS approved technologies, will be arranged and a photograph taken via screen shot. If this is also not possible, the participant will be contacted by telephone and will be asked to take and to return (by electronic submission) a photograph of their wound. Subsequent healing visits (weeks 2 and 3) may then be completed by telephone, if preferred, to confirm continued wound healing.</p>
                  <p id="Par136">At 12 months following randomisation, the research team will conduct a review of participants’ NHS medical records to identify and document any resources used, in relation to the participants wound, during the preceding 12 month period.</p>

                  <p id="Par137">With the study primary outcome being time to wound healing, if participants wish to withdraw involvement from the trial, we will seek, where possible, consent to obtain data on healing status from the participant’s treating healthcare professional. This should ensure attrition of the primary outcome data is limited.</p>
                  <p id="Par138">To ensure we are able to collect as much participant reported questionnaire data as possible, a range of strategies will be employed. Firstly, if there is no response to a postal questionnaire after 2 weeks, a reminder letter and questionnaire will be sent. If there is still no response after a further 2 weeks, the participant will be telephoned to collect their data. In addition, if for any reason a questionnaire cannot be posted to the participant, the study team may contact the participant by telephone in order to complete data collection. Secondly, participants will be sent a pen with each follow-up questionnaire and will receive an unconditional £5 with both the 6- and 12-month questionnaires. Both strategies have been found to have an effect in improving participant retention and questionnaire response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants will also be sent a study newsletter 2 weeks before the 6-month follow-up time point to encourage continued engagement.</p>
                  <p id="Par139">A SWAT testing a thank you card is also embedded within the SWHSI-2 trial. Participants will be individually randomised to either receive a thank you card at months four and nine following recruitment or to receive no thank you card at these time points.</p>
                  <p id="Par140">Many recruitment and retention strategies routinely include some element of thanks within them; however, there is little to no evidence to suggest these work. There is therefore a need to test the impact of thanks in the context of trial retention.</p>

                  <p id="Par153">To assess the impact of compliance on the primary outcome we will consider a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis. This will produce an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect in the presence of non-compliance (defined as participants in the NPWT group who do not receive NPWT). Participants in the standard care group who receive NPWT will be considered as a cross-over.</p>
                  <p id="Par154">For all outcomes, the level of missing data and the missing data mechanism will be assessed, and if required appropriate imputation techniques will be considered.</p>

                    <title>Economic analysis</title>
                    <p id="Par155">The economic analysis will aim to evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of NPWT, compared to all relevant comparators, in the treatment of SWHSI. The perspective of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be of the UK NHS and the Personal Social Services. The primary economic outcome will be the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for NPWT vs usual care, expressed as cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained.</p>
                    <p id="Par156">In addition, and to best assist decision-making, we will aim to build a de novo decision analytic model to establish which treatment is cost-effective, under current information. Evidence from the SWHSI-2 trial will be key to inform parameters of this economic model and the wider existing evidence base, identified through literature reviews, will also be used, including evidence from our previous cohort study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. When required and suitable, evidence synthesis techniques will be used to pool data to best inform specific decision model input parameters.</p>
                    <p id="Par157">Regression approaches will be used to derive costs and health benefits (health utility measured using EQ-5D-5L), allowing for correlation between these as well as adjusting for key covariates. Alternative scenarios regarding the extrapolation of the primary outcome over the lifetime of the model, and the evidence informing it, will be explored. Uncertainty in the evidence base used to populate the decision analytic model will be characterised using appropriate distributions and uncertainty in the adoption decision will be demonstrated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The value of further data collection will be established using a value of information analysis.</p>
                    <p id="Par158">Full details of the health economic analysis will be provided in a health economic analysis plan, which will be prepared prior to the completion of data collection.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par185">Use of NPWT as a treatment for SWHSI has been rapidly increasing despite there being limited high-quality evidence to support its clinical and cost-effectiveness. Given the increasing use of this device in routine care, a full and sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment for SWHSI. The SWHSI-2 trial is therefore designed to generate robust evidence to fill this gap.</p>
              <sec id="Sec54">
                <title>Study status</title>
                <p id="Par186">Recruitment to the SWHSI-2 Trial commenced in May 2019, and to date 252 participants of the target 696 (36.2%) have been recruited. Twenty sites are currently open to study recruitment, with recruitment of at least one participant having occurred at 18 sites to date.</p>
                <p id="Par187">The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a pause of recruitment between 23 March and 29 July 2020. Subsequent waves of COVID-19, including the presence of new variants across the UK, have limited the study’s ability to recruit to target due to substantial reductions in elective surgeries across the NHS, due to staff sickness and/or isolation, and the requirement of NHS Trusts to prioritise urgent public health studies in relation to COVID-19. Recruitment activity will therefore continue to ensure sufficient recruitment to enable a powered analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par188">Despite COVID-19, attrition remains low within the study. Use of a clinical, rather than patient-reported, primary outcome (time to wound healing in days since randomisation) has enabled collection of primary outcome data from treating healthcare professionals, if required and subject to participant consent, which has reduced any potential attrition for this key outcome. Follow-up assessment of participants through use of telephone and video assessments, conducted by the coordinating team when required, has been used throughout to minimise attrition for secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par189">Results of the SWHSI-2 study are currently expected in 2022.</p>
