                  <p id="Par2">The BATCH trial will assess the effectiveness of an additional procalcitonin test in children (aged 72 h to 18 years) hospitalised with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection to guide antimicrobial prescribing decisions. Participants will be enrolled in the trial from randomisation until day 28 follow-up. The co-primary outcomes are duration of intravenous antibiotic use and a composite safety outcome. Target sample size is 1942 patients, based on detecting a 1-day reduction in intravenous antibiotic use (90% power, two-sided) and on a non-inferiority margin of 5% risk difference in the composite safety outcome (90% power, one-sided), while allowing for up to 10% loss to follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Baseline characteristics will be summarised overall, by trial arm, and by whether patients were recruited before or after the pause in recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the primary analysis, duration of intravenous antibiotic use will be tested for superiority using Cox regression, and the composite safety outcome will be tested for non-inferiority using logistic regression. The intervention will be judged successful if it reduces the duration of intravenous antibiotic use without compromising safety. Secondary analyses will include sensitivity analyses, pre-specified subgroup analyses, and analysis of secondary outcomes. Two sub-studies, including PRECISE, involve additional pre-specified subgroup analyses. All analyses will be adjusted for the balancing factors used in the randomisation, namely centre and patient age.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">We describe the statistical analysis plan for the BATCH trial and PRECISE sub-study, including definitions of clinical outcomes, reporting guidelines, statistical principles, and analysis methods. The trial uses a design with co-primary superiority and non-inferiority endpoints. The analysis plan has been written prior to the completion of follow-up.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par29">Most hospitals in the UK National Health Service (NHS) use a blood test called C-reactive protein (CRP) to monitor response to infection, but it is not specific for bacterial infection and shows a delayed response. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a blood test which is specific for bacterial infection and responds more quickly than CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], but it is not routinely used in NHS. Previous studies, mostly in adults, show that using PCT to guide clinicians’ decision-making may reduce the amount of antibiotics used, reduce hospital stay, and is not associated with an increase in adverse effects such as hospital re-admission, incomplete treatment of infections, relapse, or death. A recent guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends further research on PCT testing to guide antibiotic use in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">BATCH (biomarker-guided duration of antibiotic treatment in children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection) is a randomised controlled trial to compare PCT-guided management of severe bacterial infection in children with current management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The primary research question is whether addition of PCT testing to current best practice based on the NICE antimicrobial stewardship guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] can safely allow a reduction in duration of antibiotic therapy in hospitalised children with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection compared to current best practice alone. The aim of the intervention is to reduce prescribing with no adverse effect on safety. Clinical management in the intervention arm is identical to current practice, but clinicians will have an additional PCT test with advice on how to interpret the result. Clinicians will use clinical judgement and may also use CRP to decide on duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotics.</p>
              <p id="Par31">PRECISE (MR-proADM [mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin] and ImmunoXpert evaluation of PCT-guided antibiotic duration in children with infection for stratification of effectiveness) is a mechanistic sub-study embedded into the BATCH trial. The aim of this sub-study is to determine if the effectiveness of the PCT-guided algorithm in reducing IV antibiotic duration varies depending on patients’ endothelial dysfunction (as measured by MR-proADM) and host immune response (as quantified by ImmunoXpert score).</p>
              <p id="Par32">This paper describes the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the BATCH trial and PRECISE sub-study in advance of trial completion, including statistical principles, procedures for the analysis and presentation of primary and secondary trial outcomes, and pre-specified subgroup analyses.</p>

                <p id="Par49">In children randomised to the intervention arm, a blood sample will be sent to the hospital laboratory for a PCT test at baseline/randomisation and every 1–3 days while still on IV antibiotics to align with clinical workflow and routine laboratory testing where possible. PCT results feed into an algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] that provides both definitive and advisory guidelines, based on thresholds of PCT concentration and PCT change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinicians can overrule the algorithm if they feel it is appropriate to do so. Children in the control arm will not have the PCT test performed. The trial protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] includes further detail on the implementation of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par52">The trial has two co-primary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (“Co-primary outcomes” section), and the overall sample size is determined by both. The focus for the intervention is on moving the step down from IV to oral therapy earlier, and therefore, the time until this step down is our primary outcome on antibiotic usage (overall usage across both oral and IV is a secondary outcome). The study is powered to detect if PCT-directed care is superior to standard care on time until switch from IV antibiotics. The size of potential shortening of time to detect an effect has been taken from a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The safety co-primary outcome is a composite measure reflecting various outcomes which represent deterioration or lack of clinical response in the child, and it would therefore be expected to increase if IV antibiotics were being withdrawn inappropriately early.</p>
                <p id="Par53">A 1-day reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in IV antibiotic duration from an estimated median of 5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in the control arm implies a hazard ratio of 1.25 (assuming proportional hazards and an exponential survival distribution). At 5% two-sided significance level with 90% power, 844 participants with observed IV antibiotics duration are needed. In terms of the event rates of safety elements, we estimate an admission/re-admission rate of 8.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In critically ill patients, up to 3% reinstating IV antibiotic therapy rate, and 4% mortality were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. With some overlaps considered, we estimate an overall rate of about 15% for the composite safety outcome. A previous trial on PCT-guided antibiotic therapy in adults used a non-inferiority margin of 8% risk difference for mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Given the lower expected rate of safety outcomes in this population, we have chosen a similar (relative) non-inferiority margin of 5% (absolute) risk difference for the composite safety outcome. This means that an increase of no more than 5% (from 15% to 20%) using PCT-guided therapy would be considered non-inferior. To test non-inferiority with a one-sided significance level of 0.05 and 90% power would therefore require 874 participants per arm. Overall, with 1748 effectively recruited participants, we would have 99% power to detect an antibiotic duration decrease corresponding to a hazard ratio of 1.25 and 90% power to test non-inferiority in safety separately. This means that the power of the combined analysis would be at least 89% (if the co-primary outcomes are independent) and at most 90% (if the co-primary outcomes are colinear) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Allowing for up to 10% loss to follow-up, our target sample size is inflated to 1942.</p>

                <p id="Par59">There will be multiple measures of non-adherence, reflecting different stages of the clinical decision-making. Reasons for non-consideration of the PCT result or non-adherence to the algorithm can be broken down into three steps (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Steps 2 and 3 are only relevant when step 1 has been adhered to, i.e., when a PCT result is available. In cases where the PCT result was available and was considered, this will be considered adherence to the intervention policy specified in the trial protocol, regardless of the actual clinical decision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Types of non-adherence</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Non-adherence step</th><th align="left">Reasons or examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

If the PCT result was available but not considered, clinical judgement may or may not agree with the PCT-guided algorithm. Therefore, non-adherence to the PCT-guided algorithm will also be considered independently of adherence to the intervention policy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par60">For those patients whose clinical reviews were adherent to the intervention policy (steps 1 and 2), we will investigate step 3a by comparing the actual clinical decision with the recommendation given by the PCT-guided algorithm. For patients whose procedures were adherent to step 1, we will separately investigate step 3b by comparing the actual clinical decision with the recommendation given by the PCT-guided algorithm, regardless of adherence to step 2.</p>
                <p id="Par61">In this clinical context, contamination of the control arm is very unlikely, i.e., we do not expect that any patient in the control arm will have a PCT test done.</p>

Missingness (frequency and percentage) will be reported for each combination of the components of the composite safety outcome. For the primary analysis, the composite safety outcome will be considered missing if (1) data on unscheduled readmission are missing and (2) the patient is not known to have experienced at least one of the two other components. This assumes that it would be known if a patient had restarted IV antibiotics or died. The potential influence of this assumption will be investigated by comparing estimates from best-case and worst-case imputation (“Sensitivity analyses” section).</p>
                <p id="Par115">Missing data on IV antibiotic stopping time will lead to censoring at the patient’s last available clinical review. Patients with missing outcome data can therefore still be included in the Cox regression model, under the assumption that this censoring is non-informative. Truncation due to death would violate this assumption. The potential influence of this will be investigated in the survivor average causal effect (SACE) sensitivity analysis ( “Sensitivity analyses” section).</p>

                <p id="Par117">We will perform subgroup analyses on the primary outcomes, only if the primary analysis of that outcome indicates that the intervention was successful (i.e., in the case of the composite safety outcome, if the intervention is found to be non-inferior). Subgroups will be based on pre-specified baseline characteristics (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The trial is not powered to reliably detect subgroup effects.

                <p id="Par120">The sample size calculation (“Sample size” section) assumed a 15% rate of the composite safety outcome in the control group. Because the non-inferiority margin is defined using a fixed risk difference, deviations from the assumed control group rate could cause a reduction in power (if &gt; 15%) or an inflation of the tolerable relative risk in the treatment group (if &lt; 15%). We will therefore repeat the primary analysis with the non-inferiority margin modified according to the power-stabilising arcsine transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. If the observed rate in the control group is less than 15%, we will also assess non-inferiority on the relative risk scale: the risk ratio will be calculated via the delta method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and non-inferiority will be concluded if the upper bound of the confidence interval is below <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. When the control group rate is less than 15%, this relative non-inferiority margin is more stringent than the absolute margin used in the primary analysis.</p>

CACE estimates the intervention effect for the subset of patients who would have received fully compliant treatment in either trial arm. In addition, primary analyses will be repeated on subpopulations based on different forms of non-adherence (“Analysis populations” section). If patients are recruited but subsequently found to have been ineligible, we will perform an additional sensitivity analysis excluding all ineligible patients.</p>

We will investigate this possibility in one of the subgroup analyses described above. In addition, we will compare the effect of treatment between patients with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis.

We will classify clinicians by whether they adhere to the PCT-guided algorithm during least 90% of decisions, restricting the analysis to clinicians who have made a minimum number of decisions (this cut-off will be determined after inspection of the distribution of the number of decisions, whether adherent or not, taken per clinician). We will also explore how adherence changed over the course of the study and whether clinician choices were associated with the sex or ethnicity of the patient.

                <title>PRECISE</title>
                <p id="Par128">The aim of the PRECISE sub-study is to identify whether the effectiveness of the PCT-guided algorithm in reducing IV antibiotic duration differs between patients with different endotypes, based on two biomarkers: MR-proADM, a marker of endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and ImmunoXpert score, a marker of host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par129">The PRECISE sub-study will take place at a subset of BATCH sites. Additional blood samples will be taken at randomisation, in both the intervention and the control arm. When extra blood samples are taken for routine care, then serial blood samples will also be taken for the PRECISE biomarkers, but no additional venepuncture or finger pricks will be performed.</p>
                <p id="Par130">Outcome definitions will be the same as in the host trial (BATCH). The primary outcome is duration of IV antibiotic treatment, and secondary outcomes are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par131">Total duration of antibiotics (IV and oral)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par132">Time to switch from broad spectrum to narrow spectrum antibiotics</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par133">Time to discharge from hospital</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par134">Suspected ADR</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par135">HAI up to 28 days</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par136">Sample size calculation for the PRECISE sub-study was based on a comparison between three subgroups, separately for each biomarker: In the sample size calculation for MR-proADM, we assumed median antibiotic durations of 2 versus 4 days (control vs. PCT) in the low MR-proADM subgroup, 7 versus 5 days (control vs. PCT) in the intermediate MR-proADM subgroup, and 10 versus 5 days (control vs. PCT) in the high MR-proADM subgroup. To detect an arm-by-subgroup interaction effect of this size with 90% power whilst controlling the type I error rate at 5%, we need 25 participants per biomarker subgroup in each trial arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To achieve this sample size, given the assumed proportions of participants falling into each MR-proADM subgroup, and inflating for 5% dropout, we need analysable baseline blood samples from 266 participants. In the sample size calculation for ImmunoXpert, we assumed median antibiotic durations of 1 versus 3 days (control vs. PCT) in the low ImmunoXpert subgroup, 7 versus 4 days (control vs. PCT) in the intermediate ImmunoXpert subgroup, and 10 versus 5 days (control vs. PCT) in the high ImmunoXpert subgroup. Based on similar calculations as for MR-proADM above, we need 13 participants per biomarker subgroup in each trial arm. To achieve this sample size, given the assumed proportions of participants falling into each ImmunoXpert subgroup, and inflating for 5% dropout, we would need analysable baseline blood samples from 138 participants. Consequently, 266 is the overall sample size target for this sub-study.</p>
                <p id="Par137">In the primary PRECISE analysis, we will fit a Cox proportional hazards model with duration of IV antibiotic treatment as dependent variable. We will test the interaction between biomarker score and treatment arm, separately for MR-proADM and for ImmunoXpert, using the procedure described for subgroup analyses in the “Subgroup analyses” section.</p>
                <p id="Par138">Analysis of the secondary outcomes will involve similar regression models, depending on the type of the outcome variable. In a further secondary analysis with IV antibiotic duration as the outcome, we will test the interaction between treatment arm and biomarker subgroups, categorised according to the following criteria: MR-proADM high (≥ 0.7 nmol/l) or low (&lt; 0.7 nmol/l) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], ImmunoXpert score high (&gt; 0.65), intermediate, or low (&lt; 0.35) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. PRECISE secondary analyses will not be performed if analysis of the same outcome in the host trial fails to discover a significant treatment effect.</p>
                <p id="Par139">All PRECISE participants will remain in the trial arm assigned by randomisation in the host trial, regardless of protocol deviations or non-adherence, and will be included in all analyses if outcome and biomarker data are available. Missingness within the PRECISE sub-study will be reported for each outcome as described in the “Missing data” section. We will present a descriptive summary of serial biomarker measurements, including the distributions of the observation intervals and of the number of observations per patient.</p>

Missing data on patient comorbidities is likely to be minimal.</p>
                <p id="Par142">For the primary analysis, we will fit a Cox proportional hazards model with duration of IV antibiotic treatment as dependent variable. Patients will be classified into three comorbidity subgroups (no comorbidity, single comorbidity, or multiple comorbidities). Secondary analyses will involve similar regression models, depending on the type of the outcome variable. The procedure for subgroup analyses is described in the “Subgroup analyses” section.
