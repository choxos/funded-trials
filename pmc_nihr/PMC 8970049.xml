                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>The CODES Trial for adults with dissociative seizures had a predesignated 12-month post-randomisation follow-up point for outcome evaluation. We undertook an exploratory, unplanned, secondary analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy plus standardised medical care (CBT+SMC) compared to SMC alone at 6 months post-randomisation, i.e., closer to the end of treatment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The analysis of 6-month data followed our previous method of using multiple imputation and an intention-to-treat approach to analyse variables 12 months post-randomisation.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The original trial primary outcome of monthly seizure frequency showed greater benefit from CBT+SMC than SMC-alone at 6 months (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Of 13 comparable previously-defined secondary outcomes, 12 showed a significant between group effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in favour of the CBT intervention at 6 months. The average effect size of the comparable previously-defined primary and secondary continuous outcomes was 0.33 at 6 months vs 0.26 at 12 months. The estimated Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) quantifying monthly seizure reduction was IRR = 0.72 (95%CI from 0.55 to 0.93) at 6 months compared to IRR = 0.78 at 12 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>DS-specific CBT (plus SMC) produced evidence of significant benefits at 6 months post- randomisation (around which time CBT was complete) compared to SMC alone; for the majority of these outcomes, better results following CBT (plus SMC) had previously been reported at 12 months. Our pattern of results suggests that short- and longer-term follow-ups are necessary to understand treatment effects in this disorder. Studies only providing short-term follow-up data should be interpreted with caution.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para0010">While psychological interventions are considered to be the treatment of choice for adults with dissociative seizures (DS), evidence for such treatments was limited prior to the ‘Cognitive behavioural therapy vs standardised medical care for adults with Dissociative non-Epileptic Seizures (CODES)’ Trial. The CODES trial set out to investigate the effectiveness of standardised medical care (SMC) alone versus DS-specific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) plus SMC for adults with DS <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Before completion of the CODES trial only two pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had been completed using different CBT approaches [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which suggested efficacy for CBT-based interventions. In Goldstein et al.’s <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> study, which randomised 66 patients, there was evidence of significant benefit from a DS-specific CBT intervention at the end of treatment compared to neuropsychiatric care (p=0.002; between-groups effect size = 0.75) although, at a 6-month follow-up post end of treatment, the difference between the groups was no longer significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.082; between-groups effect size = 0.42). LaFrance et al. <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> evaluated data from a total of 34 of 38 recruited patients randomised across four treatment arms at week 16. Their study was not powered to allow between-group comparisons and only within-arm comparisons were made, which are not directly comparable to the data in the study above. LaFrance et al. <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> found that CBT-informed psychotherapy, alone or with sertraline, led to a reduction in DS frequency (Slope [95%CI]: -0.72 [-1.3, -0.2] <italic>n</italic> = 9; and -0.90 [-1.6, -0.2] <italic>n</italic> = 9, respectively). Improvements in secondary outcomes included global functioning.</p>
              <p id="para0011">The CODES trial was a fully-powered, parallel arm multi-centre RCT designed to address the limitations in the evidence for psychotherapeutic interventions for people with DS. Results indicated that at 12 months, which was the predesignated endpoint, there was no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome (monthly DS frequency) <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This broadly corresponded to the final timepoint in the pilot RCT <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Differences between groups were also significant in several important secondary outcomes in favour of CBT+SMC <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. At 12 months post-randomisation, the CBT+SMC group rated their DS as less bothersome <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.020), they reported a longer number of consecutive days without DS in the previous six months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001), better functioning as measured on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), fewer somatic symptoms on a modified PHQ-15 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008), less distress as measured on the CORE-10 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.013) and better health ratings on the visual analogue scale from the EQ-5D-5L <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.010). In addition, the CBT+SMC group had better self-rated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and clinician-rated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) global outcomes and were more satisfied with the treatment they had received (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up we did not demonstrate significant differences in the proportions of people showing a &gt;50% reduction in seizures or in the proportions of people who were seizure free in the last three months of the study. Neither did the two groups differ significantly in their ratings of seizure severity, anxiety, depression or on the Mental or Physical Component Score on the SF-12v2 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Where significant differences were found these reflected moderate effect sizes. At 12 months post-randomisation none of the secondary outcome measures favoured the SMC-alone group.</p>
              <p id="para0012">However, to further inform clinical practice, to understand better the pattern of responses to our interventions and to determine whether there was a treatment effect in favour of our CBT+SMC group close to the end of the treatment delivery (i.e., at 6 months post-randomisation), it is important to understand which outcomes may have been better in the CBT+SMC intervention arm compared to SMC-alone at the 6-month post-randomisation timepoint. An exploration of the pattern of change in the two arms of the study may provide information about the impact of the different aspects of treatment provided. It may also help with the development and optimal management pathways in the future. In addition, this analysis may inform the understanding of the results of other studies with shorter follow-ups, and where the sample sizes were considerably smaller than in the CODES study. In a recent systematic review of different psychotherapies for DS <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, seven studies of varying designs [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>] chose to evaluate outcomes only at the end of treatment. All studies were small and likely underpowered. The median number of participants was 37 (range 6–60). In this paper, we report an exploratory, unplanned, secondary analysis of the fully powered CODES trial data (<italic>n</italic> = 368) to evaluate the effectiveness of the CBT+SMC intervention, compared to SMC alone at 6 months post-randomisation. This may shed light on the extent to which CBT is effective for people with DS, close to treatment end and in a substantially larger sample than in previous studies.</p>

                <title>Description of CODES Trial CBT+SMC and SMC alone</title>
                <p id="para0013">The CODES trial was a pragmatic, parallel-arm, multi-centre randomised controlled trial that randomised 368 people with DS to receive either SMC alone (<italic>n</italic> = 182) or DS-specific CBT (12 sessions plus a booster session) plus SMC (CBT+SMC <italic>n</italic> = 186). Following initial recruitment of 698 people from 27 neurology or specialist epilepsy services in England, Wales and Scotland into a screening phase between October 2014 and February 2017, 368 patients were randomised (from 17 liaison psychiatry / neuropsychiatry services) using a 1:1 ratio to SMC or CBT+SMC, stratifying by liaison psychiatry / neuropsychiatry site and with randomly varying block sizes within the strata, between January 2015 and May 2017. Participants’ eligibility criteria have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Follow-up data collection occurred at 6- and 12-months post-randomisation by blinded research workers. Statisticians were also blinded to treatment group prior to the main outcome analysis but participants, carers, clinicians the Trial Manager and Chief Investigator were not blinded to intervention allocation.</p>
                <p id="para0014">As reported elsewhere <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> SMC was provided by neurologists / epilepsy specialists and liaison psychiatrists / neuropsychiatrists who had a role in the delivery of the patient's diagnosis and ongoing management. The SMC doctors gave patients information booklets (downloadable from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.codestrial.org/information-booklets/4579871164" id="interref0005">http://www.codestrial.org/information-booklets/4579871164</ext-link>). They were provided with written guidelines to assist them in their explanation of the diagnosis and subsequent management. While the neurologists’ provision of SMC began with the DS diagnosis delivery, their main role in subsequent appointments was to review the patient, supervise the withdrawal of anti-seizure medications if appropriate, manage any comorbid physical problems and provide psychopharmacological interventions for depression / anxiety before the patient was assessed by a liaison psychiatrist / neuropsychiatrist. Psychiatrists began their delivery of SMC by undertaking a clinical psychiatric assessment around three months after the patients had received their diagnosis from their neurologist. They then carried out a general review of their patients, provided support and considered the possibility of psychopharmacological interventions for patients’ comorbidities. They were asked not to undertake any CBT-based interventions with trial patients. The option of referral for crisis management was available to neurologists and psychiatrists. We suggested that there should be at least two SMC sessions provided by neurologists and three to four SMC sessions from psychiatrists. As indicated above, neurologists / epilepsy specialists were based across 27 services and psychiatrists were employed in 17 services in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <p id="para0015">Our model of DS-specific CBT was based broadly on the approach used in our pilot study <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is based largely on models of fear-avoidance [<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The model conceptualises DS as states of altered awareness and responsiveness that initially occur when the person is in a state of heightened arousal <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. DS then give rise to behavioural and emotional avoidance through fear of having further seizures, leading to a more restricted lifestyle. The intervention was designed to include techniques to promote the reduction of DS and of behavioural and emotional avoidance, with the aim of facilitating patients’ re-engagement in everyday activities and healthy relationships. The treatment was structured to be delivered in 12 sessions over a four-to-five-month period with a later booster session at nine months post-randomisation. The intervention was manualised with a suggested structure and content for each session but allowed sufficient flexibility to be formulation-based and tailored to the individual. Therapy was delivered by one of 39 CBT therapists who in addition to previous CBT training had received study-specific training and who were allocated to study supervision groups. Therapy fidelity was evaluated and found to be acceptable [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

                <p id="para0016">For this secondary analysis we evaluated the treatment effects at 6 months post-randomisation, using an intention-to-treat analysis. As previously noted <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, one patient randomised to SMC-alone received our DS-specific CBT in error.</p>
                <p id="para0017">From a theoretical and clinical perspective, we expected that our secondary analysis of outcomes would show an improvement around the end of CBT. Although limited in the number of measures we could include, our selection of outcome measures, as in the main CODES trial, focused on those we felt would change as a result of the targeted intervention, as previously described elsewhere [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and which addressed DS occurrence, behavioural and emotional avoidance, emotional distress, DS-related cognitions / beliefs, trauma and social factors. Indeed, DS are a heterogeneous, multifaceted disorder which may confer disability in a range of ways, not only through seizure frequency but also their association with mental and physical disorders or social effects <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, our outcome measures included measures of seizure occurrence, impact of seizures, distress and global improvement.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para0041">The study was powered for the primary outcome as defined for the main trial to detect a difference in monthly seizure frequency in the CBT+SMC arm compared to the SMC-alone arm, represented by an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of around 0.66. The previously-defined primary and 16 secondary outcomes for the RCT were formally tested at 12 months post-randomisation. However, the secondary outcomes were not powered to show a difference between treatment arms. Therefore no adjustment for multiple comparisons was made. For consistency we used this same approach for the exploratory analysis of the 6-month outcomes.</p>
                <p id="para0042">The statistical approach used in this paper matched how we evaluated differences in treatment effects at 12 months. This was described in detail in our original trial publications [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The only difference was that the 6-month outcome featured as the dependant variable, rather than the 12-month outcome. Outcome variables were assessed in the intention-to-treat population with multiple imputation (MI) used to facilitate the inclusion of all randomised participants in formal analyses. The use of MI was necessary as post-randomisation variables contained missing values and treatment compliance within the CBT+SMC arm was found to be predictive of missingness at 12-month follow-up. MI provides valid inferences under a missing at random assumption if observed variables are included in the imputation step to allow prediction of missingness. Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) requires the specification of an imputation model and an analysis model. The imputation models employed in this study were the same as those described previously [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], i.e., the following baseline predictors of missing outcome were included: longest period of seizure in the previous 6 months, number of somatic symptoms measured on the Modified PHQ-15, relationship status, having a carer and previously having sought help for a mental health problem. Other variables included were: trial arm, baseline measure of outcome, and trial centre; and all variables in the imputation step were included in the analysis models, as described previously [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over-dispersed count variables such as seizure frequency were analysed using a negative binomial model with CBT effects expressed as IRRs. Continuous and discrete outcome variables, such as seizure severity, were analysed using linear regression with CBT effects expressed by mean differences. Finally, logistic regression modelling was used for binary variables such as achieving &gt;50% reduction in DS frequency with CBT effects expressed by odds ratios (ORs).</p>

The mean age of the sample was 37.5 years (SD 14.3) and 330 (90%) were white. One hundred and ninety-five (53%) were married or living with a partner as opposed to being single, separated or widowed. Of 365 providing information about employment status, only 123 (34%) were currently employed or in education. The majority who were of working age and who were unemployed (165/233 (71%)) were in receipt of state disability benefits as were 18/110 (16%) of those who were of working age and employed. Just over half of the sample (195 (53%)) had received their diagnosis based on video-electroencephalography. The median age at onset of DS was 29 (IQR 19, 42; mode 19 years) and the median duration of their disorder was 3 years (IQR 1, 8). In addition, 236/366 (64%) patients were judged by their clinician to have predominantly hyperkinetic as opposed to predominantly hypokinetic seizures. Just over a quarter of patients (101; 27%) self-reported a previous diagnosis of epilepsy. Nearly two-thirds (241; 66%) reported previously having sought help for a mental health problem and 261/365 (72%) reported having comorbid medical conditions.

In no instances did the SMC-alone group show more favourable outcomes than the CBT+SMC group.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Descriptive summaries of outcome measures at baseline (pre-randomisation) and 6 months follow-up.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0004">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top"/><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="top">Baseline<hr/></th><th colspan="3" align="center" valign="top">6-months<hr/></th></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">SMC N=182</th><th valign="top">CBT+SMC N=186</th><th valign="top">Overall N=368</th><th valign="top">SMC N=182</th><th valign="top">CBT+SMC N=186</th><th valign="top">Overall N=368</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Monthly seizure frequency in last 4 weeks</td><td valign="top">median (IQR) [range]</td><td valign="top">19 (5, 49) [0, 649] <italic>n</italic> = 182</td><td valign="top">12.5 (4, 41) [0, 535] <italic>n</italic> = 186</td><td valign="top">15 (4, 47) [0, 649] <italic>n</italic> = 368</td><td valign="top">18 (3, 48) [0, 640] <italic>n</italic> = 162</td><td valign="top">6 (0, 24) [0, 849] <italic>n</italic> = 161</td><td valign="top">9 (1, 38) [0, 849] <italic>n</italic> = 323</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Seizure severity 1=very mild, 7=very severe</td><td valign="top">mean (SD) [range]</td><td valign="top">4.8 (1.6) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 179</td><td valign="top">4.7 (1.6) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 182</td><td valign="top">4.7 (1.6) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 361</td><td valign="top">4.4 (1.6) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 135</td><td valign="top">3.9 (1.9) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 125</td><td valign="top">4.1 (1.8) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 260</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Seizure bothersomeness 1=no bother at all, 7=very bothersome</td><td valign="top">mean (SD) [range]</td><td valign="top">5.4 (1.7) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 180</td><td valign="top">5.2 (1.7) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 182</td><td valign="top">5.3 (1.7) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 362</td><td valign="top">4.7 (2.0) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 143</td><td valign="top">3.9 (2.1) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 134</td><td valign="top">4.3 (2.1) [1,7] <italic>n</italic> = 277</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;50% reduction in monthly seizure</td><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> frequency relative to baseline</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top"><italic>n</italic> = 157</td><td valign="top"><italic>n</italic> = 153</td><td valign="top"><italic>n</italic> = 310</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">43 (27.4)</td><td valign="top">65 (42.5)</td><td valign="top">108 (34.8)</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">114 (72.6)</td><td valign="top">88 (57.5)</td><td valign="top">202 (65.2)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Physical Component Summary Score (SF-12v2) 0=worst health, 100=best health</td><td valign="top">mean (SD) [range]</td><td valign="top">38.8 (11.9) [13.9, 65.6] <italic>n</italic> = 181</td><td valign="top">40.5 (12.4) [13.4, 65.9] <italic>n</italic> = 185</td><td valign="top">39.7 (12.2) [13.4, 65.9] <italic>n</italic> = 366</td><td valign="top">38.8 (11.4) [13.1, 59.5] <italic>n</italic> = 142</td><td valign="top">41.5 (13.4) [15.9, 66.7] <italic>n</italic> = 134</td><td valign="top">40.1 (12.4) [13.1, 66.7] <italic>n</italic> = 276</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Mental Component Summary Score (SF-12v2) 0=worst health, 100=best health</td><td valign="top">mean (SD) [range]</td><td valign="top">37.9 (11.4) [16.9, 68.1] <italic>n</italic> = 181</td><td valign="top">37.7 (12.2) [13.4, 67.6] <italic>n</italic> = 185</td><td valign="top">37.8 (11.8) [13.4, 68.1] <italic>n</italic> = 366</td><td valign="top">37.5 (12.1) [10.5, 63.0] <italic>n</italic> = 142</td><td valign="top">40.3 (11.7) [17.4, 67.5] <italic>n</italic> = 134</td><td valign="top">38.8 (12.0) [10.5, 67.5] <italic>n</italic> = 276</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Health today (EQ-5D-5L VAS) 0=worst health, 100=best health</td><td valign="top">mean (SD) [range]</td><td valign="top">54.9 (21.9) [10, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 181</td><td valign="top">56.2 (24.1) [1, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 182</td><td valign="top">55.5 (23.0) [1, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 363</td><td valign="top">50.9 (23.1) [0, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 143</td><td valign="top">58.8 (24.4) [0, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 135</td><td valign="top">54.7 (24.0) [0, 100] <italic>n</italic> = 278</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Impact of DS on functioning (WSAS) (range 0–40;

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0047">We investigated differences between groups in our RCT comparing DS-specific CBT + SMC with SMC alone. Our exploratory secondary analyses found that all but one of the outcomes were significantly different in favour of CBT+SMC at the unadjusted 5% level, with large-to-moderate effect sizes at the 6-month post-randomisation point. This included monthly DS frequency, the predefined primary outcome measure at the 12-month follow-up point. The findings are consistent with the impression gained from the unadjusted raw data and data plots over time reported in our previous paper [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> here. Fewer significant differences were found at 12 months post-randomisation but this paper focuses on the 6-month follow-up, which occurred at a time broadly corresponding to the end of active regular treatment sessions.</p>
              <p id="para0048">The use of independent analyses at 6- and 12-months post-randomisation makes a formal comparison between two timepoints difficult. The data and effect sizes at 6 and 12 months (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) give the impression of clear between-group differences at 6 months across almost all outcome measures. These were slightly weaker in most instances at 12 months. The clearest exception to this is the impact of seizures reflected by WSAS scores, where the CBT effect was found to be highly significant at both 6 and 12 months. This is likely to reflect the strong emphasis on reducing avoidance behaviour in the DS-specific CBT intervention. Self-rated improvement was also clearly significant at both timepoints as was satisfaction with treatment. These three findings (WSAS scores, self-rated improvement and satisfaction with treatment) seem, therefore, to indicate better maintained between-group treatment effects. There was a clear CBT+SMC group advantage at both timepoints in terms of self-ratings of seizure ‘bothersomeness’, suggesting that the CBT intervention appeared to have led patients to better tolerate ongoing seizures. There was also evidence of maintained benefits in terms of measures of distress (CORE-10), somatic symptoms (Modified PHQ-15) and ratings of health today (EQ-5D-5L VAS). The effect sizes were not as large at 12 months. Nevertheless, the fact that differences between groups were maintained in these outcomes suggests that the treatment effects were long lasting.</p>
              <p id="para0049">The current finding that DS frequency was significantly lower in the CBT+SMC group than in the SMC-alone group at the 6-month post-randomisation follow-up, supports the findings of our previous pilot study <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> where DS frequency was significantly lower at treatment end following CBT. Indeed, the overall pattern of DS frequency over time is very similar to that seen in the earlier study. In that study we may have been underpowered to detect between-group differences in secondary outcomes, which in the CODES trial we were better able to do.</p>
              <p id="para0050">We have commented previously [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] that our SMC intervention contained many active treatment ingredients. Although we did not formally monitor psychopharmacological interventions by the SMC clinicians, providing a coherent explanation for seizure maintenance, support, review and, where appropriate, psychotropic medication prescription resulted in some benefit. As part of SMC, patients received what can be conceptualised as standardised, but also specialist, medical care that involved input from neurologists and psychiatrists who had been provided with study materials to guide their diagnosis delivery and explanation of the disorder. In addition, clinicians were permitted to describe (but were asked not to not practise with trial patients) seizure distraction techniques to avert seizures. They were also able to direct participants to self-help websites which contained information on seizure control techniques.</p>
              <p id="para0051">Our raw data tables and plots (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Goldstein et al. [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) lead us to speculate that, rather than the change in significance in the between-group differences being attributable to diminished benefit in the CBT+SMC group, the weakening of between-groups significance could be explained by improvements in the SMC-alone group at 12 months. Since SMC was not a treatment-as-usual comparison arm, it is possible that our specialist intervention, with sessions that were often spread across the 12-month post-randomisation period and content that was potentially therapeutic, led to gradual improvement in the SMC-alone group, reducing between-group differences. Although the CBT+SMC group advantage in terms of DS frequency reduction at the end of active treatment (6 months) may relate to the inclusion of DS control techniques as part of the CBT intervention, the SMC-alone group may have been experiencing beneficial exposure to distraction techniques and online materials <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, leading to improvement.</p>
              <p id="para0052">CBT+SMC participants seemed to show gains in relation to seizure impact as assessed by the WSAS which asks specifically about work. However, whether these gains were accompanied by improved actual work status is unknown. Again, while we cannot know which components of the CBT approach were selectively effective, our DS-specific CBT did address avoidance behaviour, and this may correlate with improvements seen on the WSAS.</p>
              <p id="para0053">Our investigation here of the 6-month differences between trial arms raises the possibility of more rapid change / improvement in the CBT+SMC group versus SMC alone. We recognise that better outcomes at 6 months may be valuable to many patients, even if some between-group differences are smaller at 12 months. However, since we did not match groups for therapist contact, we cannot rule out the possibility of an increased contact effect rather than a true CBT-effect in terms of seizure frequency in the CBT+SMC vs SMC-alone groups. For informed roll-out of the intervention, it is important to understand which baseline characteristics interact with the CBT treatment effect to bring about greater improvement. We will, therefore, be exploring moderators of treatment effects in a future paper.</p>
              <p id="para0054">The lack of adjustment for multiple comparisons may be considered to be a limitation of this study but our approach was consistent with the analysis of the 12-month outcome data [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to adopting a consistent approach, most methods of adjustment for multiple comparisons are overly-conservative, and are more relevant when trying to claim results are fully powered, which as we noted earlier they were not. We were more interested in the clinical significance of the 6-month results in the context of the overall study, rather than the p-values per se.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="para0055">Overall, our analyses suggest that while at 12 months post-randomisation our predesignated primary outcome (monthly seizure frequency) was no longer significantly different between groups [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], despite significant benefits of CBT+SMC on other outcomes, there is evidence of more rapid benefit in the CBT+SMC group. This includes DS frequency reduction. This pattern of results can potentially be attributed to improvements made in the SMC-alone group at 12 months which were not as apparent at 6 months (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and demonstrates the importance of longer follow-up outcome evaluations in treatment trials <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. It suggests caution should be exercised when reviewing positive trial outcomes with only short follow-up periods.</p>
