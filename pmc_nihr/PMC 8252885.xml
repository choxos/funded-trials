                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing and disabling condition that affects significant numbers of children and adolescents. Youth exposed to multiple traumas (eg, abuse, domestic violence) are at particular risk of developing PTSD. Cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD), derived from adult work, is a theoretically informed, disorder-specific form of trauma-focused cognitive–behavioural therapy. While efficacious for child and adolescent single-event trauma samples, its effectiveness in routine settings with more complex, multiple trauma-exposed youth has not been established. The Delivery of Cognitive Therapy for Young People after Trauma randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of CT-PTSD for treating PTSD following multiple trauma exposure in children and young people in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU).</p>

                  <p>This protocol describes a two-arm, patient-level, single blind, superiority RCT comparing CT-PTSD (n=60) with TAU (n=60) in children and young people aged 8–17 years with a diagnosis of PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. The primary outcome is PTSD severity assessed using the Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (8-item version) at post-treatment (ie, approximately 5 months post-randomisation). Secondary outcomes include structured interview assessment for PTSD, complex PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, overall functioning and parent-rated mental health. Mid-treatment and 11-month and 29-month post-randomisation assessments will also be completed. Process–outcome evaluation will consider which mechanisms underpin or moderate recovery. Qualitative interviews with the young people, their families and their therapists will be undertaken. Cost-effectiveness of CT-PTSD relative to TAU will be also be assessed.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a deeply distressing and disabling psychiatric disorder. PTSD in youth is usually comorbid with other psychiatric conditions,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> and may persist for years or even decades if untreated.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> The UK Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the prevalence of PTSD in UK youth to be 3%, while a recent epidemiological study suggested that over 7% of UK youth will have developed PTSD at some point by the age of 18 years.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
                <p>Traumatic events, defined<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> as those that involve exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence, are experienced by up to two-thirds of children by age 16 years.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> A significant minority of trauma-exposed children and adolescents go on to develop PTSD.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 10</xref> For those young people subjected to <italic toggle="yes">multiple</italic> traumatic stressors (eg, physical or sexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence, war or community violence), the clinical presentation of PTSD is particularly severe.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> The life-long impact of multiple trauma exposure in childhood is well documented, with dramatically increased prevalence of a range of emotional disorders, compromised educational, occupational and social functioning, increased use of mental health services and poor physical health.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–18</xref> PTSD has been shown to have a uniquely harmful role in determining the long-term response to childhood trauma exposure, by mediating the relationship between such experiences and a range of physical and mental health outcomes later in childhood<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and adulthood,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> including psychosis.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
                <p>In adults, empirical support for trauma-focused cognitive–behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) is substantial.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref> TF-CBT typically comprises several core elements: psychoeducation, exposure (to help desensitise patients to trauma memories), cognitive elements (to reframe the meanings and interpretations associated with trauma and its aftermath), and coping management (eg, problem-solving, anxiety management). Over the past 15 years, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted that support the efficacy of TF-CBT (using a variety of specific manuals) in children and adolescents.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> While this evidence shows considerable promise, a number of important issues remain to be resolved.</p>
                <p>First, existing trials rarely compare an experimental treatment with treatment as usual, that is, active treatment/clinical care from a child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). Moreover, many studies have not focused on cases of the kind typically referred to mental health services, instead focusing on youth identified in child protection/social services settings. Similarly, many trials have not used ‘frontline therapists’, reducing the ability to implement trial findings in routine settings.</p>
                <p>Second, the cost-effectiveness of implementing a trauma-focused psychological intervention (such as different forms of TF-CBT) in youth mental health services has received little consideration. Evaluating the health economic implications of the investment of time in training and supervising therapists in delivering such specific treatments is essential for the future service delivery.</p>
                <p>Third, it is important to consider whether a cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) treatment protocol, a particular form of TF-CBT, can be used in child and adolescent mental health services by frontline therapists. Step increases in treatment efficacy for adults with PTSD have been achieved through careful individual formulation and the enhanced use of theoretically derived techniques in CT-PTSD.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref> The cognitive model of PTSD has been largely supported in children and youth.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> While CT-PTSD adapted for youth<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> has been shown to be efficacious for PTSD following single-event trauma when delivered in research clinics,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> its effectiveness in routine clinical settings with youth exposed to multiple traumas has yet to be established. We felt that CT-PTSD may translate well to ‘frontline’ clinical settings as it employs a formulation-based approach, that is, clinicians are able to tailor session content (ie, particular techniques) to their client’s individual presentation which may be particularly helpful when working with clients with more complex histories.</p>
                <p>Fourth, the responsiveness of complex PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents to psychological treatment is still poorly understood. Symptoms of complex PTSD include the defining criteria of PTSD alongside disruptions in emotion regulation, relational capacities and self-concept, and are associated with multiple trauma exposures (eg, sexual or physical abuse). While the understanding of complex PTSD in adults has seen significant advances over recent years (with the disorder now included in International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision), little is known about the nature and presentation of complex PTSD in youth, and our treatments for these youth lag behind provision for adults. The ability of youth with high levels of complex PTSD symptoms to derive benefit from psychological therapies for PTSD is largely unknown. However, the first study to address this issue in youth found that complex PTSD symptoms were responsive to TF-CBT, and that the presence of complex PTSD did not lessen the efficacy of TF-CBT to treat PTSD symptoms.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></p>
                <p>Fifth, moderators and mediators of treatment responsiveness are still poorly understood. While change in negative trauma-related misappraisals has been shown to underpin (ie, mediate) treatment response for CBTs<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> (hence our specific secondary hypothesis regarding this mechanism), other potential mechanisms or moderating factors have received scant or no attention. Potential contraindicative moderators for CBTs for PTSD in youth have received comparatively little attention. Shedding light on these factors would inform decision-making about treatments for youth with PTSD and clarify the essential ‘ingredients’ of successful treatment and barriers to change.</p>
                <p>Sixth, the lived experiences of youth undergoing treatment for PTSD following multiple traumas have received little consideration. Qualitative methods may offer important insights into the acceptability and feasibility of delivering treatments like CT-PTSD for youth with PTSD. Such insights may direct how treatments are evaluated and delivered in the future, as well as informing clinician attitudes to the management of this population’s needs.</p>

              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>This study aims to fill these gaps in the literature by addressing several objectives. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether CT-PTSD is an effective treatment for PTSD symptoms in youth aged 8–17 years old who have been exposed to multiple traumatic stressors, relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in UK National Health Service (NHS) child and adolescent/youth mental health services. The primary outcome is the Child Revised Impact of Event Scale (8-item version; CRIES-8) score at post-treatment. The CRIES-8 is the routine outcome monitoring measure for PTSD in UK CAMHS. We hypothesised that CT-PTSD will be superior to TAU at post-treatment (approximately 5 months post-randomisation) with respect to scores on the CRIES-8. The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: (1) Is CT-PTSD effective in the treatment of complex PTSD, anxiety, depression, general functioning and parent-related mental health in youth with PTSD, relative to TAU?; (2) Is the treatment cost-effective, relative to TAU?; (3) If effective relative to TAU, by what mechanisms does CT-PTSD have its effect?; (4) What demographic, symptomatic, cognitive and psychosocial factors moderate response to treatment?; (5) What are the views and experiences of youth with PTSD, their parents and therapists, about receiving or delivering CT-PTSD, and how do these inform judgements of the acceptability and feasibility of CT-PTSD? In particular, we hypothesised that CT-PTSD would be superior to TAU with respect to complex PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, general functioning and parent-related mental health in youth with PTSD; CT-PTSD would be cost-effective relative to TAU; and that the efficacy of CT-PTSD would be mediated through change in trauma-related appraisals.</p>
                <p>Given the significant uncertainties over the effect size associated with both CT-PTSD and TAU in this context and the ability of therapists in settings to deliver CT-PTSD with this relatively complex population, this study was considered to be a phase II trial. It is anticipated that the trial will inform the development of a later definitive trial of CT-PTSD for this population.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>A total of 120 children/young people aged 8–17 years will be randomised to either CT-PTSD (n=60) or TAU (n=60). Youth are eligible to be included in the study if they: (1) meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; (2) score 17 or greater on the CRIES-8; and (3) have been exposed to multiple traumatic stressors.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria are: (1) <italic toggle="yes">change</italic> of prescribed psychiatric medication within the past 2 months (though receiving medication was not an exclusion criterion); (2) pervasive developmental disorder or neurodevelopmental disorder (eg, autism, but not attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); (3) intellectual disability; (4) another primary psychiatric diagnosis or clinical need that warrants treatment ahead of PTSD (eg, psychosis, suicidal behaviour, conduct disorder); (5) inability to speak English; (6) ongoing exposure to threat (eg, living with an abuser; regularly placing self in danger) or safeguarding issues; (7) strong likelihood of being unable to complete treatment (eg, imminent house or foster placement move); or (8) history of organic brain damage.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p><italic toggle="yes">CT-PTSD</italic>. CT-PTSD for PTSD is a structured, fully manualised<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> psychological treatment delivered in an individual format for children and adolescents. The proposed frequency and duration of treatment is up to 15 treatment sessions (typically 10–12, of 60–90 min duration).</p>
                <p>CT-PTSD involves several core elements: psychoeducation, with an emphasis on the role of cognitive processes in the onset and maintenance of PTSD; narrative work and imaginal reliving to help develop a coherent trauma narrative; cognitive restructuring (to reframe the meanings and interpretations associated with trauma and its aftermath), and coping management (eg, addressing maladaptive strategies such as thought suppression, rumination and safety-seeking behaviours). Up to three sessions will be allowed for stabilising other comorbid conditions and difficulties (eg, depression or self-harm).</p>
                <p>CT-PTSD will be delivered by NHS CAMHS/youth mental health service therapists who will have completed training in CT-PTSD by a member of the trial team. Trial therapists who deliver CT-PTSD must have an appropriate professional qualification (eg, as a nurse, occupational therapist, clinical psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or British Association for Behavioural &amp; Cognitive Psychotherapies-registered cognitive–behavioural therapist) and be approved by their local site principal investigator to act as a trial therapist. Individual teams will nominate staff members to complete the CT-PTSD training.</p>
                <p>CT-PTSD will be delivered wherever is permitted and feasible for local therapists (eg, in NHS mental health clinics, local general practitioner (GP) surgeries, at home). Supervision will be provided by a clinical psychologist from the trial team. Following the completion of a course of CT-PTSD, usual NHS care arrangements will apply for participants in this arm.</p>
                <sec id="s2-3-1">
                  <title>TAU</title>
                  <p>Mental health professionals and others involved in the care of the participants in the TAU arm will be encouraged to provide whatever help they deem necessary, for example, general clinical management, supportive counselling, family therapy, medication. TAU must involve an active treatment, that is, it cannot involve being on a waiting-list. Since TF-CBT has been a recommended treatment for PTSD in youth in the UK since 2005,<sup>25</sup> no therapists in the TAU arm were prevented from delivering this intervention; they were not, however, trained by the research team to deliver the CT-PTSD intervention. Therapist contact in the TAU arm would not be prescribed by trial participation in any way, with one exception: the participants will receive no contact with the trained trial therapists delivering CT-PTSD, and their therapist/clinician will not receive supervision for that case from a trained trial therapist.</p>

                  <title>Primary clinical outcome</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome measure is PTSD severity using the CRIES-8 score at post-treatment (approximately 5 months post-randomisation). The CRIES-8, a validated self-report questionnaire,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> is the routine outcome monitoring tool for PTSD in children and adolescents endorsed by the UK Children and Young People’s programme–Improving Access to Psychological Therapies. Selecting this measure as our primary outcome is therefore consistent with the pragmatic, ‘frontline’ focus of the present trial, and will allow clinicians to interpret the trial’s findings with regard to their routine outcome measures. The CRIES-8 has the advantage of being used internationally in numerous languages, and being impervious to future changes in diagnostic algorithms, having been in constant use for over 25 years. The CRIES-8 will also be completed at baseline, 2.5 months post-randomisation (mid-treatment), and 11 months and 29 months post-randomisation.</p>

                <p>This is the first trial to compare CT-PTSD (or any other treatment) to routine care in NHS CAMHS and youth mental health settings for children and young people with PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. While two waiting-list controlled trials have been conducted of the CT-PTSD treatment package in research clinics,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> no UK trials have evaluated the effectiveness of routine care for the treatment of PTSD in young people with multiple trauma exposure, or the effectiveness of CT-PTSD as delivered by therapists working in routine clinical settings. As such, no reliable estimates of effect size are available. An attempt was made to estimate likely effect size based on meta-analyses of existing psychological therapies for PTSD in children and adolescents. The waiting-list controlled effect size of CT-PTSD was greater than 1.2 in each of the studies to have examined this intervention to date.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> The Cochrane meta-analysis of treatments for PTSD in children and adolescents<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> yielded an effect size of 1.05 for all psychological therapies versus control conditions, whereas for CBT versus control conditions, the effect size was 1.34. However, these effect sizes are likely to overestimate the efficacy of CBT; few studies were included in the headline analyses, and those that were included were waiting-list controlled, rather than using an active control condition (eg, TAU or other interventions that involved clinician/therapist contact). A high-quality trial of another psychological therapy (prolonged exposure, a form of TF-CBT) for adolescent girls with PTSD following sexual abuse, that used supportive counselling as a control intervention, yielded a controlled (ie, between groups) effect size of 1.0.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> An alternative meta-analysis,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> including a broader range of studies to evaluate CBT in youth with PTSD (many of which used active control treatments such as supportive counselling) suggested a controlled effect size of around 0.67; a more recent meta-analysis<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> suggested an effect size for TF-CBT of 0.79. The more conservative effect size estimate of 0.67 was used for the proposed trial.</p>
                <p>In order to have 90% power to detect a between groups effect size of 0.67 (two-tailed t-test, 0.05 significance level), a sample size of 96 (48 participants per group) is required; a combined sample size of 96 would have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.58 (two-tailed t-test, 0.05 significance level). In order to account for drop-out (estimated at 20%), 120 participants will be recruited.</p>

                <p>Our primary analysis will compare CT-PTSD with TAU on CRIES-8 scores at post-treatment. The primary analysis will be on the intention-to-treat principle: that is, all participants will be followed up for data collection irrespective of adherence to treatment and will be analysed according to group allocation rather than intervention received. Assuming a normal distribution (potentially of transformed values), a linear model will be constructed. This will include recruiting site (as a random factor), CRIES-8 at baseline (as a covariate) and any factors considered prognostic and determined in advance of any analysis, together with treatment arm as a fixed effect. Analysis of other secondary outcomes, and of putative moderators and mediators, will be considered exploratory.</p>
                <p>The primary intention-to-treat analysis is intended to provide inferences regarding the effectiveness of the intervention overall not to provide inferences regarding the causal effect of the intervention itself, but on the intervention as deployed in ‘real life’.

Service users commenting on the PYCES trial (National Institute for Health Research RfPB-funded RCT addressing PTSD in preschool children) also stressed the need to investigate youth with PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. Patient/participant feedback was an essential component of a case series of the treatment protocol (CT-PTSD) for PTSD in this group. Families participating in this study provided extensive feedback on the acceptability of the treatment protocol and the research procedures developed for use with this multiple trauma population. These responses were collated and were used to guide the development of this protocol.</p>
                <p>The youth panel of <italic toggle="yes">inspire</italic> (a PPI group hosted by Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust) identified several agencies to involve in the service study and dissemination, and raised questions over the nature of ‘TAU’ for this population and the adequate ‘dosage’ of CT-PTSD. The <italic toggle="yes">inspire</italic> youth panel were keen to be represented on the Trial Management Group (TMG) and TSC.

                <p>There are no publication restrictions and findings will be disseminated broadly to participants, healthcare professionals, the public and other relevant groups. The study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals. Clinical workshops will be offered to practitioners and team leads to share study findings and consider how practice can be improved. The full trial protocol is available from RM-S. Outcomes from the post-treatment and 11-month post-randomisation assessments may be analysed and published prior to the completion of the 29-month assessments.</p>

              <p>PTSD in children and adolescents represents a significant public health burden. It is hoped that the DECRYPT trial will provide insight into how some of the most severe PTSD cases in youth might be better treated in a real-world setting, and provide a platform to future pragmatic research in this area.</p>
