                  <p id="Par1">Delay to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) and nonadherence compromise the health and wellbeing of people living with HIV (PLWH), raise the cost of care and increase risk of transmission to sexual partners. To date, interventions to improve adherence to ART have had limited success, perhaps because they have failed to systematically elicit and address both perceptual and practical barriers to adherence. The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Supporting UPtake and Adherence (SUPA) intervention.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study comprises 2 phases. Phase 1 is an observational cohort study, in which PLWH who are ART naïve and recommended to take ART by their clinician complete a questionnaire assessing their beliefs about ART over 12 months. Phase 2 is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) nested within the observational cohort study to investigate the effectiveness of the SUPA intervention on adherence to ART. PLWH at risk of nonadherence (based on their beliefs about ART) will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to the intervention (SUPA intervention + usual care) and control (usual care) arms. The SUPA intervention involves 4 tailored treatment support sessions delivered by a Research Nurse utilising a collaborative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) approach. Sessions are tailored to individual needs and preferences based on the individual patient’s perceptions and practical barriers to ART. An animation series and intervention manual have been developed to communicate a rationale for the personal necessity for ART and illustrate concerns and potential solutions. The primary outcome is adherence to ART measured using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Three hundred seventy-two patients will be sufficient to detect a 15% difference in adherence with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Costs will be compared between intervention and control groups. Costs will be combined with the primary outcome in cost-effectiveness analyses. Quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) will also be estimated over the follow-up period and used in the analyses.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par35">Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in near-normal life expectancy for many people living with HIV (PLWH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and there is solid evidence that viral suppression in PLWH taking ART prevents sexual transmission of HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the UK, uptake of ART among people with diagnosed HIV attending healthcare services is generally high, but a significant number of PLWH are not on ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The number of people with diagnosed HIV who are not taking ART is likely to be an underestimate because not everyone who is prescribed ART actually receives or takes it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies show that nonadherence to ART remains suboptimal: a meta-analysis of 84 studies across 20 different countries found the mean rate of ART adherence (defined as ≥90%) was 62% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In a more recent UK study, 873 (32%) of 2704 people taking ART reported nonadherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Delay to start ART and nonadherence compromise the health and wellbeing of individual patients, raise the cost of care and impact on public health through increased risk of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adherence to effective treatment should not only improve physical health, but also psychological wellbeing by empowering patients to take an active role in managing their condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Interventions to increase adherence to medicines have had limited success and it is not clear which strategies are most effective. Systematic reviews of adherence interventions have reported variable findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent recent comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions to increase adherence to ART found that a variety of different types of interventions (e.g. interventions delivered via short message service (SMS), counselling and interventions delivered by a treatment supporter) were effective but effect sizes were generally small and the review did not specify specific intervention content or theoretical approaches that were effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">In order to address this, we developed the Supporting Uptake and Adherence to ART (SUPA) intervention. In line with the guidance of the Medical Research Council (MRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the intervention was informed by our preparatory research in which we explored and developed relevant theory. In our preliminary studies, ART nonadherence had multiple causes for a given individual, both intentional and unintentional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We subsequently identified the salient beliefs about medicines influencing adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In studies across a range of illnesses and in different cultural contexts, adherence was consistently related to how patients judged their personal necessity for treatment relative to their concerns about potential adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Studies conducted with PLWH demonstrated the utility of this Necessity Concerns Framework (NCF) for predicting ART uptake and adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">In addition to perceptual factors influencing adherence, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends addressing practical factors such as limitations in capacity and resources: the Perceptions and Practicalities Approach (PAPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To date, few interventions have utilised this approach. One exception is a telephone-based medicines support intervention, where patients receiving the intervention had fewer doubts about necessity and fewer concerns, fewer medication problems and higher reported adherence than standard care controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">The content of the SUPA intervention has been described in detail (King K, Horne R, Cooper V, Glendinning E, Michie S, Chalder T, SUPA Group: The development of an intervention to support uptake and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV: the SUPA intervention, submitted). In summary, the SUPA intervention uses a Perceptions and Practicalities Approach (PAPA) to support uptake and adherence to ART. It comprises 3 key elements aiming to address factors related to the motivation to take treatment, elicit and help the patient overcome barriers to implementing the intention to take treatment and help them establish routines leading to habit formation:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39">Communicate a common-sense rationale for ART</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Elicit and address specific Necessity beliefs and Concerns about ART</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Identify and address practical barriers to ART uptake and adherence.</p></list-item></list></p>

All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the observational component of the study (Phase 1). Following informed consent, all participants will complete the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire-ART specific version (BMQ-ART). The clinician or Research Assistant (RA) will score the questionnaire immediately. If the score indicates that the participant is at high risk for nonadherence (ART-Necessity score ≤ 3 and/or ART-Concerns score ≥ 3), they will be provided with information by the study team and invited to consider taking part in Phase 2, the interventional trial component. Further written informed consent to take part in Phase 2 will be received after the patient has been given an opportunity to consider their participation in the study and discuss this with others if they wish.</p>

All participants will be allocated a study identification number, so the participants will only be identifiable to study staff. De-identified data (no name, date of birth) will be stored in a password-protected database at the UCL School of Pharmacy for 15 years. After that time the study register, Case Report Forms (CRFs), and consent forms will be destroyed making it impossible to link participants’ names to identification numbers. The original copy of the consent form will be stored in the patient’s case notes and a copy of the consent form will be kept in the site file.</p>

The randomisation procedure will be a stratified block randomisation. Centres will be blocked to ensure that there are equal participants in each arm at each site. The randomisation schedule will be incorporated into a dedicated electronic database and kept securely within this electronic system, inaccessible to the enrolment location. Once an eligible participant has given written informed consent and completed the baseline assessment, the RA will log on to the randomisation system, enter the participant identification number and hospital, and will click on the ‘randomise’ function. The treatment allocation will appear immediately on screen and be communicated to the patient. The confirmation of treatment allocation details will be sent to the research team immediately. The RA will inform the participant’s HIV clinical team on the same day. Movement from the observational cohort to the intervention trial or declining participation in the trial will be recorded on the central database.</p>

This support will be in the form of 4 tailored treatment support sessions delivered by a Research Nurse (RN) utilising a collaborative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) approach. The sessions will be conducted face-to-face (or by telephone if the patient prefers or cannot meet face to face) and will communicate a rationale for the personal necessity of medication, elicit and address concerns about medication and problem-solve potential practical barriers to adherence. Sessions will be tailored to individual needs and preferences, based on (1) the individual patient’s perceptions and practical barriers to ART identified using the BMQ-ART, and (2) salient issues arising during the sessions. An animation series and intervention manual have been developed as tools to communicate a rationale for the personal necessity of ART and to illustrate concerns and potential solutions. The specific timing of the sessions will differ according to the patient’s specific needs and availability; however, the first two sessions will take place within 1 month of enrolment, and sessions 3 and 4 will provide additional support 3 and 6 months post randomisation. These appointments will be scheduled at the patient’s convenience.</p>

As the distribution of this variable is unknown, we will categorise the proportion of participants achieving ≥90% adherence as &lt; vs ≥0.8 of the follow-up months. Essentially, this study assesses whether the participant has been ≥90% adherent for at least 80% of their time spent in the trial. The 80% threshold to define a good outcome is based on the fact that 4–6 weeks delay to ART initiation following a treatment recommendation is reasonable, and if followed by consistent ≥90% adherence to ART for the remainder of the trial (10 of the 12 months), the participant is likely to achieve and maintain viral load suppression. To calculate each monthly adherence value, the percentage of adherence (according to MEMS) for each individual over each month of follow-up from randomisation will be calculated, treating every day off ART or not taking all prescribed ART doses (indicating either nonadherence or delayed treatment initiation) as 0% adherence.</p>

The ART-Necessity scale consists of 10 items which assess how patients perceive their personal need for ART for keeping their HIV under control, maintaining their health and preventing illness. The ART-Concerns scale consists of 10 items measuring concerns about potential adverse effects of ART that have been identified in previous studies. These include fears about short- and long-term side effects, concerns about the timing of tablets and the disruptive effects of the ART regimen on daily life. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they agree with each item on a scale with possible responses ranging from strongly agree (scored 5) to strongly disagree (scored 1). A total score for each scale is computed by adding the scores for each scale item together and dividing by the number of items. This yields a mean score ranging from 1 to 5 for the necessity and concerns scales.</p>

                  <title>Perspective</title>
                  <p id="Par98">The evaluation will primarily adopt a health and social care perspective as preferred by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for decision-making, including both direct and indirect costs of low uptake and sub-optimal adherence. Other resources relevant to a wider societal perspective such as informal care and productivity loss (due to time off work) will be included in the secondary analyses.</p>
                  <p id="Par99">Intervention costs will be estimated from information relating to staff time (RNs) in delivering the SUPA intervention, including time spent training and actually delivering the intervention, and other non-staff costs (e.g. manual development and printing). The frequency and duration of health and social care service use data will be combined with appropriate unit costs to generate total care costs per patient.</p>
                  <p id="Par100">Costs will be compared between intervention and control groups. Bootstrapping methods will be used to produce confidence intervals around the cost differences to account for skewness often associated with the distribution of cost data. Costs will be combined with the primary trial outcome in the form of cost-effectiveness analyses. However, as the primary outcome is not a clinical outcome and is condition specific, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated from the EQ-5D will be used to estimate cost-effectiveness. The use of QALYs and the EQ-5D in HIV is supported by previous work. If the intervention results in reduced costs and better outcomes then it will be defined as being ‘dominant.’ However, supposing the costs are higher and outcomes are better, then incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated to show the extra costs incurred to gain an extra level of outcome. Uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates will be explored using cost-effectiveness planes. The results will be further evaluated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p>

                  <title>Determining the cost effectiveness of the long-term impact of the interventions</title>
                  <p id="Par101">Although we will measure costs, QALYs and the cost per QALY over the study period, this information will be limited because it would be expected that QALY gains would largely occur later in time. To address this issue a Markov model will be constructed to examine how patients might move from one health state to another over a longer period of time. Health states will be defined according to CD4 counts or viral load. The probabilities of moving from one health state to another will be based on a review of the literature and from expert opinion. Assuming some degree of patient variation, the data collected in the trial will give information on EQ-5D utility scores and costs that are associated with different CD4 ranges and where necessary this information will be supplemented by data from the literature. As well as allowing us to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the interventions, this approach will enable an estimation of the long-term cost associated with different levels of ART uptake and adherence. This will be of importance from a public health perspective in that it will illustrate the economic savings that might be made through interventions. Increased uptake and adherence may have further benefits if infections in others are reduced and we will explore the possibility of incorporating such externalities into the model. The time horizon used will depend on data availability, but is it expected that we will measure costs and outcomes over a 5–10, and 15-year period. The results over the longer periods will by definition be more speculative.</p>

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) will be defined according to usual clinical trial definitions. If the RA/RN is uncertain about whether the AE is an SAE, they will contact the centre Principal Investigator for their opinion. All SAEs must be reported by the RA/RN to the patient’s doctor (or doctor to the RA/RN), the centre Principal Investigator and the Trial Manager immediately. SAEs that are related to administration of any of the research procedures will be reported to the Sponsor and also sent to REC by the CI (or delegated individual) within 15 days of the CI becoming aware of the event.</p>

One month after an SAE, the RA/RN will provide both the site Principal Investigator and Trial Manager with a follow-up report. If the SAE is not resolved, further monthly reports will be sent via the Trial Manager to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par134">We have described the design of the Supporting Uptake and Adherence to ART (SUPA) trial, an observational cohort study with nested randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a CBT-based intervention to increase uptake and adherence to ART by addressing perceptual and practical barriers.</p>
              <p id="Par135">The intervention is based on the Necessity Concerns Framework and aims to address both perceptual and practical barriers to adherence as recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and BHIVA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The intervention has been developed according to published guidelines for the development of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and builds on preparatory research with PLWH showing that uptake and adherence to ART is driven by patients’ perceptions of their personal necessity for ART and concerns about adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide support at the time of a treatment recommendation to PLWH who may be at risk of delaying uptake or developing issues with adherence. This study targets individuals who may be considered as being hard to reach, and who are not usually represented in randomised trials. The study design allows the examination of process variables and the mechanism by which the intervention exerts its effect. The cost effectiveness analysis will enable health-care service providers to make informed decisions about the value of the intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par136">While it was not possible to mask the allocation of participants to intervention or control groups, we have taken steps to reduce bias, including blinding of the statistical team to group allocation and ensuring that data is not collected or entered by those delivering the intervention. It possible that the primary outcome measure (MEMS) may impact on adherence as it serves as a reminder to participants that they are monitored. However, the impact of adherence monitoring alone is likely to be minimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although participants are selected for risk of delay to initiate treatment and nonadherence using a screening tool (BMQ-ART), patients who decline to take part in the study may represent a different group who are more at risk of disengaging from care. However, these participants will be followed up in the observational cohort, therefore their virological outcomes can be compared with those of trial participants.</p>
              <p id="Par137">This is the first study to apply the perceptions and practicalities approach recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to the design of an intervention to increase uptake and adherence to ART. It will provide information on the efficacy of the intervention as well as the mechanism by which the intervention exerts its effect. The findings will enable patients, healthcare providers and policy makers to make informed decisions about the value of the intervention.</p>
