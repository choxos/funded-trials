                  <p>Randomized controlled design. At baseline (May 20 to June 6, 2022), 7,835 UK adults reported how much time they spent wearing face coverings in work, public transport, and indoor leisure settings as well as their capabilities, opportunities, and motivations. 3,871 participants were randomized to form implementation intentions; 3,964 control participants completed questionnaires only. Measures were repeated 6 months postbaseline (November 1 to November 14, 2022).

                  <p>The proportion of time spend wearing face coverings declined substantially across the 6-month study period, from 15.28% to 9.87% in work settings, 38.31% to 24.55% on public transport, and 9.58% to 7.85% in leisure settings. Bayes Factors indicated moderate relative evidence of no effect of implementation intentions on behavior in work and leisure settings, and inconclusive evidence of a positive effect on public transport.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The wearing of face coverings decreases community transmission of airborne viruses including SARS-CoV-2 [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. At the height of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, governments in the UK made it a legal requirement to wear a face covering in defined public areas. For example, from June 15, 2020, the wearing of face coverings on public transport was a legal requirement enforceable by fines of up to £6,400 (US$8,700) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over time, these restrictions were removed and government messaging shifted from mandate to recommendations to advice. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is unlikely to be the last novel airborne viral threat and it would be valuable to know what would promote the uptake and sustained use of face coverings in the future. The aim of the present study was to take the learning from previous research on face covering to test a theory-based intervention to promote uptake and sustained use of face coverings.</p>
              <p>The starting point for a theory-based intervention is identifying what needs to change [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and there have been numerous studies that have identified predictors of adherence to requirements/guidelines for wearing face coverings. For example, using Ajzen’s [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework, Sun et al. [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that attitudes and perceptions of control were predictive of students’ intentions to wear face coverings [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the theory of planned behavior has been criticized for focusing on reflective motivation (e.g., attitudes, perceptions of control) to the neglect of automatic influences on behavior, such as habits and emotions [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, Michie et al.’s [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] capabilities, opportunities, and motivations model of behavior (COM-B) is designed to capture all the key drivers of human behavior, including the influence of automatic motivation.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have used COM-B, endorsed by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a key theoretical framework for understanding and supporting behavior change [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as a lens with which to understand the wearing of face coverings. For example, Armitage et al. [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that COM-B consistently predicted people’s adherence to the wearing of face coverings in work, public transport, and indoor leisure settings. Across each of these contexts, lack of automatic motivation was a recurring finding and Armitage et al. [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] recommended focusing on interventions designed to support automatic motivation. The question then arises as to what kind of intervention could be deployed to support automatic motivation; implementation intentions [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] offer one possible solution.</p>
              <p>Implementation intentions [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] are “if-then” plans that have been shown to impact people’s automatic motivation (e.g., habits) through which sustained changes in behavior are achieved (e.g., [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>]). Implementation intentions are formed by asking people to link critical situations (“if”) with appropriate responses (“then”). The effect of implementation intention formation on automatic motivation is demonstrated through laboratory studies which show that specifying the “if” component of an implementation intention enhances the accessibility of critical situations and that linking “if” with “then” automates the response specified in the “then” component [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, one possible cue might be “being tempted not to wear a face covering consistently” and it could be linked to “seeking out someone who encourages me to wear a face covering when I don’t feel up to it” as an appropriate response. The idea is that if the temptation not to wear a face covering is encountered, the appropriate response (“seeking out someone who encourages me to wear a face covering when I don’t feel up to it”) is triggered automatically. Thus, implementation intentions are one means by which automatic motivation can be changed to promote sustained behavior change [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several meta-analyses now attest to the effectiveness of implementation intention-based interventions in areas such as smoking cessation [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but not in relation to face covering. However, Gollwitzer and Sheeran’s [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] meta-analysis across multiple behavioral domains showed that, across 94 independent studies in laboratory and field settings, implementation intention-based interventions exerted an average effect size of <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.65. We were unable to identify previous research applying implementation intentions to the problem of face covering, but conclude there are promising grounds for pursuing this approach.</p>
              <sec id="s7">
                <title>The Current Study</title>
                <p>For the first time, the present study aims to test an implementation intention-based intervention to promote uptake and sustained use of face coverings in large samples that are representative of the UK population, and to understand changes using COM-B. Based on the research reviewed above, it is predicted that participants randomized to form implementation intentions will have higher automatic motivation to wear a face covering and will be more likely to wear a face covering.</p>

                <p>This was a randomized controlled trial and had a mixed design. The between-persons factor was <italic toggle="yes">condition</italic>, which had two levels: <italic toggle="yes">Intervention</italic> in which participants were asked to form implementation intentions and <italic toggle="yes">control</italic> in which participants were not asked to form implementation intentions. All dependent measures were taken at baseline and follow-up meaning that the within-persons factor was <italic toggle="yes">time</italic>. Follow-up occurred 6 months postbaseline, a time period that is commonly regarded as the period by which behavior change is considered maintained [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The principal outcome measure was the proportion of time wearing face coverings, the other dependent variables were people’s capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to wear a face covering. The trial was preregistered.</p>

                <p>In addition to completing the measures described above, participants were randomized to one of two conditions. Participants in the control condition exited the online survey after completing the baseline questionnaire. Participants in the intervention condition were additionally asked to plan to wear a face covering and were presented with a “volitional help sheet,” a tool for helping people to form implementation intentions [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The volitional help sheet comprised the critical situation “if I am tempted not to wear a face covering consistently,” with a drop-down menu that allowed participants to link this critical situation with up to 10 appropriate responses (see <xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix</xref>). The appropriate responses were adapted from previous volitional help sheets [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which in turn were adapted from Prochaska and DiClemente’s [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] processes of change from their transtheoretical model. The appropriate responses included: “then I will seek out someone who encourages me to wear a face covering when I don’t feel up to it,” “then I will think about how I would be a better role model for others if I were to wear a face covering,” and “then I will put things around my home to remind me to wear a face covering.”</p>

Follow-up was conducted 6 months later, November 1 to November 14, 2022 when Median new COVID-19 cases was 0 (0–31,552) per day.</p>

                <p>Data were weighted, by age, gender, social class, country of residence, and level of education to ensure analyses properly reflected the UK population. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, such that people who dropped out of the study were treated as no changers.</p>
                <p>Randomization was tested using MANOVA. This was designed to establish that the intervention and control groups were similar in terms of their demographics and other descriptive characteristics. The principal outcome measures were tested using mixed ANOVAs. <italic toggle="yes">Condition</italic> (intervention versus control) was the between-participants factor, and <italic toggle="yes">time</italic> (baseline vs. 6-month follow-up) the within-persons factor. Proportion of time spent wearing a face covering was the main outcome measure; capabilities, opportunities, and motivations were the secondary outcome measures. An online calculator <ext-link xlink:href="https://harry-tattan-birch.shinyapps.io/bayes-factor-calculator/" ext-link-type="uri">https://harry-tattan-birch.shinyapps.io/bayes-factor-calculator/</ext-link> was used to examine whether the observed data supported the experimental hypothesis (a 10% improvement in COM-B scores) or the null hypothesis (no change). Bayes Factors greater than 3 indicate moderate relative evidence for an effect; Bayes Factors lower than 0.33 indicate moderate relative evidence for no effect.</p>

                <title>Effects of the Intervention</title>
                <p>A series of mixed ANOVAs with <italic toggle="yes">condition</italic> (intervention vs. control) as the between-participants factor, and <italic toggle="yes">time</italic> (baseline vs. 6-month follow-up) as the within-persons factor was used to test the effects of the intervention (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>–<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Tests of statistical significance implied no evidence to suggest that the implementation intention-based intervention arrested the decline in the wearing of face coverings or influenced people’s perceptions of their capabilities, opportunities, and motivations in any of the three contexts.</p>
                <p>However, examination of Bayes Factors (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>–<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) reveals a more nuanced picture. For face covering in work settings (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), each analysis was associated with Bayes Factors lower than 0.33 indicating moderate relative evidence for no effect. In contrast, the Bayes Factors associated with several dependent variables for face covering on public transport exceeded 0.33, but did not breach 3.00, meaning inconclusive evidence of a positive effect of the intervention on public transport (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). More specifically, there were positive changes over time in behavior, physical opportunity, social opportunity, and automatic motivation in relation to face covering on public transport. For example, the decline in wearing face coverings on public transport was less steep in the intervention group. For leisure settings, there was similarly moderate relative evidence for no effect of the intervention (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), with the exception of physical opportunity and social opportunity, both of which showed inconclusive evidence of a positive effect of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Principal Findings</title>
                <p>The aim of the present study was to test the potential effects of an implementation intention-based intervention on uptake and sustained use of face coverings. In the context of declining infection rates and absence of relevant legislation, the wearing of face coverings decreased over time. Over time, people’s perceptions of their capabilities and opportunities remained relatively stable compared to their motivations. An intervention based on Gollwitzer’s [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concept of implementation intentions largely failed to address this decline, albeit with some areas of uncertainty, particularly with respect to the wearing of face coverings on public transport.</p>

                <title>Previous Studies</title>
                <p>Meta-analyses show that, in general, implementation intentions are effective in changing people’s behavior over sustained periods of time [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which contrasts with the present inconclusive findings. However, in the context of a public health emergency that was abating, it is unclear whether the present study is directly comparable with previous studies of implementation intentions in relation to (for example) smoking [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and dietary intake [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, smoking and dietary intake are typically presented as enduring threats whereas face covering was presented as a response to the acute threat of COVID-19, rather than the relatively enduring threat of airborne transmissible viruses.</p>

                <title>Implications</title>
                <p>From the perspective of developing interventions to encourage face covering, it would be valuable to examine what would be the effect of reframing the wearing of face coverings in response to the enduring threat of airborne transmissible viruses rather than the relatively acute threat of COVID-19. It is perhaps instructive that the most promising findings were on public transport, where people are often forced to be in close proximity and lack the ventilation of many work places and leisure settings. In terms of augmenting the present intervention, there is a growing body of research showing that repeated administration of implementation intentions are particularly effective at changing people’s behavior [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; it is plausible that a single administration of implementation intentions may not have been sufficient to change this particular behavior.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Although the present research takes the literature on implementation intentions forward in some important respects it is important to reflect on strengths and limitations of the study. Null findings are difficult to interpret, but the large representative samples allay concerns about statistical power. However, the self-reported outcome measure is a limitation and it would be valuable to develop objective measures of face covering.</p>

                <title>Future Research</title>
                <p>The consistent finding was that motivation decreased over time, irrespective of context and so further work using models such as West and Michie’s [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] PRIME theory, which seeks to explain the interplay of reflective and automatic motivation, is required to develop interventions to promote the wearing of face coverings, should they be required in the future. Implementation intentions might be part of this solution, but may be insufficient on their own to change the wearing of face coverings.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A single administration of an implementation intention-based intervention was insufficient to change people’s behavior with respect to wearing face coverings, but it would be worthwhile exploring repeated administration of implementation intentions. As infection rates declined, so too did people’s wearing of face coverings; while people’s perceptions of their capabilities and opportunities remained stable, levels of motivation declined. Preparations for future viral pandemics that are airborne transmissible should focus on motivating people to take up face coverings.</p>
