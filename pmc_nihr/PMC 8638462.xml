                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Psilocybin-assisted therapy may be a new treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with encouraging data from pilot trials. In this trial (short name: PsiDeR) we aimed to test the feasibility of a parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled design. The primary outcomes in this trial are measures of feasibility: recruitment rates, dropout rates and the variance of the primary outcome measure of depression.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are recruiting up to 60 participants at a single centre in London, UK who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, at least two evidence-based treatments for MDD. Participants are randomised to receive a single dosing session of 25 mg psilocybin or a placebo. All participants receive a package of psychological therapy. The primary outcome measure for depression is the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale collected by blinded, independent raters. The primary endpoint is at 3 weeks, and the total follow-up is 6 weeks. With further informed consent, this study collects neuroimaging and omics data for mechanism and biomarker analyses and offers participants an open label extension consisting of a further, open label dose of 25 mg of psilocybin.</p>

              <p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disabling and economically costly mental health problem. Its prevalence in England is estimated to be between 29 and 42 per thousand people.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The estimated cost in England is estimated by the UK government to be £20.2–£23.8 billion per year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Treatment resistant depression (TRD), defined as failure to respond to at least two antidepressants at therapeutic dose for at least 6 weeks, is seen in 1/3 of those who suffer from clinical depression, and as resistance to treatment develops, prognosis worsens.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Except for esketamine and transcranial magnetic stimulation, there have been no significant medical treatment developments for MDD since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the late 1980s.</p>
              <p>The classical psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin and d-lysergic acid diethylamide, were marketed as treatments before classification in Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in 1971, which effectively ended routine clinical use and research.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite this classification, they were not considered dangerous when used in medically controlled settings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref></p>
              <p>A systematic review in 2016 of trials published prior to prohibition detailed trials of psychedelics in patients with broadly defined depression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While pre-prohibition studies were often of suboptimal design, at high risk of bias and did not collect consistent outcome measures, in aggregate 335 of 423 (79.2%, median 80.0%) patients in 19 separate studies were judged by their clinicians to have at least ‘improved’ with psychedelic therapy.</p>
              <p>Psilocybin was isolated and synthesised by Albert Hofmann in 1957 and 1958, respectively.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Psilocybin is a partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor in the brain, and this likely accounts for the characteristic subjective effects.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, its activity at serotonin receptors is broad.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It has low or absent affinity for the serotonin transporter, dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic or cholinergic receptors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Psilocybin is not habit forming in either humans or animals.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The subjective effects include heightened emotions, mystical experiences, misperceptions and blurring of conceptual boundaries. Some users of psilocybin have reported benefits in mental well-being that continue for weeks or after the dose.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>In a resurgence of clinical interest, government licensed clinical trials using psilocybin in phase 1 and 2 designs have been published since 2000.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–23</xref> We completed a phase 1 randomised, placebo-controlled safety study in which 89 healthy volunteers were randomised 1:1:1 to receive a single dose of placebo, 10 mg of psilocybin or 25 mg psilocybin in a clinical research facility, with 3 months of clinical follow-up. In this trial, there were no serious adverse events (AEs), no AEs that led to withdrawal and data from cognitive tasks indicated no negative effects of psilocybin when compared with placebo.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>In an open label pilot study of oral psilocybin in adults with TRD, 20 patients were given two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart in a clinical research facility with psychological support before, during and after the experience.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 17</xref> Both the 10 mg and 25 mg doses were well tolerated; no serious or unexpected AEs occurred. One patient withdrew from the trial after treatment, citing lack of efficacy. Patient rated depression severity was markedly reduced in comparison to baseline at 1 week after 25 mg psilocybin (Cohen’s d=2.2, p&lt;0.001) and 5 weeks (Cohen’s d=2.3, p&lt;0.001), remaining positive at months 3 and 6 following treatment (Cohen’s d=1.5, p&lt;0.001 and d=1.4, p&lt;0.001, respectively). However, this study was not blinded and did not have a placebo control group. Expectation and/or the psychological support provided as part of the trial may account for the improvements in depression scores. Furthermore, it could not be determined from the open label design whether a randomised, placebo-controlled design investigating psilocybin would be acceptable to patients with TRD.</p>
              <p>Thus, the purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy, given under supportive conditions, compared with placebo-assisted therapy in a randomised, blinded trial design in adult participants with treatment resistant MDD. A further purpose of this trial was to estimate the variance of the primary outcome measure between groups to inform a power calculation for a future efficacy trial.</p>
              <p>Since the inception of this trial, other feasibility trials have been published with psilocybin in non-TRD patient samples.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> However, as well as not focussing on a treatment resistant population, these trials did not include a true placebo control. In discussion with the funders of this trial, we decided to use a true placebo control to measure the difference in AE rate and the variance in the primary depression outcome measure without the difficulties implied by an active control.</p>

                <p>The trial is a parallel group, two arm, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, between-subjects, single centre, exploratory design in up to 60 participants. The trial is taking place between September 2020 and September 2023 in a single centre in London, UK. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the recruitment period may be extended, subject to necessary approvals. All study visits and dosing sessions take place in the Clinical Research Facility of King’s College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, UK.</p>
                <p>The trial is funded by the National Institute for Health Research Clinician Scientist Programme (CS-2017-17-007). The sponsor of this trial is King’s College London and the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. The trial protocol was peer-reviewed at grant application and by an internal process of risk, capability and capacity assessment by delegates on the sponsor.</p>

We presented this trial to the sponsor’s Service User Research Enterprise programme during the design of the trial to seek further feedback. Subsequently, five people with lived experience of mental health difficulty were recruited to the trial steering committee and have reviewed participant facing written material and contributed to the overall design of the trial in addition to ongoing oversight of the trial.</p>
                <p>Since the study is exploratory, formal sample size calculations were not undertaken. The sample size selected was informed by published work that models processes of parameter estimates for continuous measures from early phase trials.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We aim to recruit 60 participants, randomised 1:1 to treatment versus placebo arms. This is considered sufficient to test the intervention and provide adequately reliable estimates of recruitment rate and loss to follow-up. The expected rate of loss to follow-up is 20%. With 60 participants, we would be able to estimate this target rate with a 95% CI of ±10.1% (9.9% to 30.1%).</p>

                <p>Bottles are labelled by a code that does not reveal the identity of the contents. Each bottle contains five opaque capsules. Capsules of psilocybin and placebo are matched for weight, colour, taste, and smell.</p>
                <p>Participants, research staff, clinical staff and the trial statistician are kept blind to allocation throughout the trial; however, psilocybin induces an altered state of consciousness that may allow subjects and researchers to predict allocation. To mitigate against bias in the collection of the primary outcome (MADRS), raters are independent of the immediate study team but not independent of the institution undertaking the trial. Raters are trained to collect the MADRS using the Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and required to ask participants not to discuss any information that might reveal their beliefs about treatment allocation. Participants are asked about their beliefs about allocation via an electronic scale.</p>
                <p>In the event of a serious unsuspected serious adverse reaction in which pharmacovigilance authorities require knowledge of treatment allocation, unblinding may be undertaken by a representative of the sponsor without unblinding the study team.
