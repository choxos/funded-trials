                  <p>The CAPP2 trial investigated the long-term effects of aspirin and resistant starch on cancer incidence in patients with Lynch syndrome (LS). Participants with LS were randomized double-blind to 30 g resistant starch (RS) daily or placebo for up to 4 years. We present long-term cancer outcomes based on the planned 10-year follow-up from recruitment, supplemented by National Cancer Registry data to 20 years in England, Wales, and Finland. Overall, 463 participants received RS and 455 participants received placebo. After up to 20 years follow-up, there was no difference in colorectal cancer incidence (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 52 diagnosed with colorectal cancer among those randomized to RS against <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 53 on placebo) but fewer participants had non-colorectal LS cancers in those randomized to RS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 27) compared with placebo (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 48); intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis [HR, 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33–0.86; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.010]. In ITT analysis, allowing for multiple primary cancer diagnoses among participants by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRR) confirmed the protective effect of RS against non–colorectal cancer LS cancers (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.84; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0075). These effects are particularly pronounced for cancers of the upper GI tract; 5 diagnoses in those on RS versus 21 diagnoses on placebo. The reduction in non–colorectal cancer LS cancers was detectable in the first 10 years and continued in the next decade. For colorectal cancer, ITT analysis showed no effect of RS on colorectal cancer risk (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62–1.34; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.63). There was no interaction between aspirin and RS treatments. In conclusion, 30 g daily RS appears to have a substantial protective effect against non–colorectal cancer cancers for patients with LS.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Lynch syndrome (LS) is due to germline pathogenic variants in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes that increase the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colorectum (colorectal cancer) but also of the endometrium, ovary, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, bile duct, urinary tract, brain, and skin (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom has recommended, primarily based on the outcome of the aspirin limb of the CAPP2 trial (discussed below in more detail), “Consider daily aspirin, to be taken for more than 2 years, to prevent colorectal cancer in people with Lynch syndrome” (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>In contrast, the only intervention proven to reduce the risk of extracolonic LS-related cancers is prophylactic surgery, where feasible. As a result of their incidence and challenging presentations, extracolonic cancers contribute more cancer deaths than does colorectal cancer to overall mortality among LS patients with cancers of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and brain being substantially more likely to be lethal than are colorectal malignancies (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Fifty years ago, Burkitt proposed that higher dietary fiber (DF) intake may protect against colorectal cancer and other bowel disorders (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). An analysis of pooled data from 13 prospective cohort studies showed that higher DF intake was associated inversely with risk of colorectal cancer in age-adjusted analyses, but this protection disappeared after accounting for other dietary risk factors (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recent meta-analysis of data from prospective cohort studies shows lower risk of all-cause mortality with higher DF intake (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This health benefit of higher DF intake was reflected in lower incidence of cardiometabolic disease and of colorectal cancer and lower cancer mortality (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There is strong evidence that higher intakes of foods containing DF, including wholegrain foods, lower risk of colorectal cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and may lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). DF encompasses a heterogeneous mixture of food-derived carbohydrates which escape small-bowel digestion and are fermented to differing extents in the large bowel. The resultant production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including the antineoplastic butyrate (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and other metabolites, and changes in the gut microbiota, may be important mechanisms through which DF protects against colorectal cancer (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11, 12</xref>).</p>
              <p>From 1999, the CAPP2 study recruited people with LS, formerly known as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In a 2 × 2 factorial design, participants received (i) 600 mg enteric-coated aspirin or placebo, and (ii) 30 grams of resistant starch (RS) or placebo, daily. RS is a component of DF found in foods such as bananas, potatoes, grains, pulses, and seeds (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
              <p>In total, 937 patients with LS, mean age 45 years, were recruited to the CAPP2 study. At the end of the intervention period (2.5 years), there was no significant impact of either agent on “neoplasia”, which combined colorectal adenoma and carcinoma formation (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, because epidemiologic studies suggest a delayed effect of aspirin on colorectal cancer incidence (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the protocol provided for follow-up to 10 years. When the first recruits reached 10-year follow-up (mean follow-up 4.5 years), an interim analysis revealed no detectable effect of RS on cancer development (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>The CAPP2 study had two primary hypotheses that examined evidence, separately, for long-term effects of aspirin and of RS. The primary hypothesis was that each intervention, aspirin and RS, would separately prevent colorectal cancer. A secondary outcome was the effect of each intervention on non–colorectal cancer LS cancers. The design involved consent to follow up for 10 years with the explicit aim of investigating long-term effects of aspirin and of RS treatment on cancer incidence. We have reported the long-term impact of aspirin (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and we now report the impact of RS censored to 10 years from recruitment. We have complemented this planned analysis with available national cancer registry data through the second decade for three countries where there are formal policies to allow all cancers to be recorded; England, Wales (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and Finland, the latter via the Finnish Lynch Syndrome Registry (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>

                <p>The methods have been described (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13, 17</xref>). In brief, 937 LS carriers were randomized to RS and/or aspirin in a factorial design such that, if willing to take both interventions, they were randomized with equal probability to one of four groups: aspirin + RS, aspirin placebo tablets + RS, aspirin + placebo (cornstarch), or aspirin placebo tablets + placebo (cornstarch). There was an option to be randomized to a single limb [aspirin/placebo, RS/placebo (cornstarch)] if medically dictated. Intervention took place between 1999 and 2007 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Of the 937 participants, 463 were assigned to RS and 455 to cornstarch placebo (henceforth called placebo; ref. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>): 19 participants chose not to be randomized in the RS arm of the study. Participants and investigators were blinded to randomized intervention. Daily interventions were 30 g of RS (1:1 blend of Novelose 240 and Novelose 330) or placebo [waxy starch (Amioca)]. Intervention lasted 2 years with an option to continue for a further 2 years. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the relevant ethics committee in each country (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Consent included health record follow-up for 10 years and was refreshed in the later stages of the study. Participants and their clinicians were informed of randomization category no sooner than the 10-year review, or if and when, later contact was achieved.</p>

                <p>Recruitment to CAPP2 was through specialist centers worldwide which also organized and monitored regular bowel screening as part of routine clinical care of patients with LS. LS cancers can occur at multiple anatomic sites making it more challenging for some specialist centers to record extracolonic cancers. The accession of information from the English, Finnish, and Welsh national records (described below) alleviated such concerns and ensured complete cancer follow-up of participants in these locations.</p>
                <p>Data on clinical outcomes from participating centers were sent to the CAPP2 Offices, Newcastle University, United Kingdom, and entered into a TrakGene database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.trakgene.com/" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://www.trakgene.com/</ext-link>). These data were linked to study number, anonymized and sent to the University of Leeds for statistical analysis.</p>

                <p>The current analysis includes 10-year data across all centers plus up to a further decade of registry follow-up for participants resident in England, Wales, and Finland. For England and Wales, cancer history was assessed using National Cancer Registration information from Public Health England (PHE) and Welsh counterparts (see below). Similarly, because LS carriers in Finland are monitored centrally, long-term (up to 20 years) cancer data for these participants were obtained from the Finnish national registry.</p>

                <p>The National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) provided information on all diagnoses of cancer among the CAPP2 participants resident in England (from Public Health England (PHE) and Wales [from Public Health Wales (PHW)]. Note that this service is now known as the National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) and is provided by NHS Digital (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). This included ICD-coded information on specific diagnoses and dates of registration. For inclusion in the life-table analyses, we confirmed that participants had remained resident in England or Wales throughout this time period (whether or not they had a cancer diagnosis) by identification of current general practitioner. This provided complete cancer information for these participants through to the last date at which the registry was considered complete. For those participants known to have died or emigrated, follow-up was censored at death or at estimated date of emigration.</p>

                <p>Data were obtained from the Lynch Syndrome Registry of Finland (LSRFi) maintained by the Department of Surgery, Jyväskylä, Finland, which operates as a national research database of MMR pathogenic variant carriers and their high-risk family members. Historically, families were included in the registry based on clustered LS-associated cancers within the families. Because genetic testing became available, pathogenic variants only are recorded in the registry and families are identified by universal MMR testing of LS-related cancers or by clinical phenotype.</p>
                <p>Most centers report their clinical findings to the LSRFi office routinely. In addition, the LSRFi office monitors scheduled surveillance for each carrier and requests the clinical reports from the treating institutions. Finally, the nationally operated Finnish Cancer Registry is queried for the carriers of pathological variants known to the LSRFi office. The administration and the ethical board of the Central Finland health care district approved the study.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>We have reported details of adenoma recurrence, adverse events, and compliance (i.e., proportion of scheduled starch sachets taken during the intervention; ref. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
                <p>The primary outcomes of the CAPP2 study were the number, size, and histologic stage of colorectal carcinomas after a minimum of two years’ intervention through to the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were size and number of adenomas and numbers of LS-related extracolonic cancers.</p>
                <p>This analysis focused on the 918 CAPP2 study participants randomly assigned to RS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 463) or placebo (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 455) from the date of entry until the latest date of information on cancer status. For recruits in England, Finland, and Wales, this was supplemented with passive recording of cancer registration. The analysis included all LS cancer diagnoses, during the intervention phase and during long-term follow-up. Designation of a reported diagnosis as being within the LS cancer spectrum (i.e., endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, small bowel, gall bladder, ureter, stomach, and kidney cancers and cancer of the brain) was a clinical assessment, masked to intervention (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Our initial plan was document cancer diagnoses for up to 10 years since starting the intervention. However, the staggered start across countries and the availability of national clinical records for England, Finland, and Wales meant that longer follow-up (up to 20 years) was available for these countries. Consequently, we report here the results for the follow-up up to 20 years to provide the most detailed assessment of impact. Analysis when follow-up is restricted to 10 years is included in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.</p>
                <p>During the intervention phase, adverse events were similar for RS and placebo groups (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). For at least 80% of the time, 77% of the participants complied with the use of RS or placebo. A subgroup of 100 participants from the United Kingdom completed a 4-day dietary assessment and provided a urine sample; the compliance biomarker 4-aminobenzoic acid was detected in 93% of these participants (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were conducted according to randomization, RS, or placebo to provide marginal results that are independent of assignment to aspirin/aspirin placebo. Participants were provided with two starch sachets daily and, at clinic visits during intervention, participants were asked to show the sachets remaining; this number was used to estimate the number taken. We also conducted per protocol (PP) analysis restricted to those who took at least 1,400 sachets (equivalent to 2 years’ provision of the treatment).</p>
                <p>We used two analytical approaches: (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) we examined time to first occurrence of colorectal cancer (primary endpoint) and non-colorectal cancer LS cancers using life-table methods and Cox proportional hazards, and (ii) we investigated multiple primary cancers at the same, or multiple, anatomic sites using negative binomial regression (NBR), which considers the complete LS cancer history since randomization. In an earlier study, we used Poisson regression modeling (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) but analysis of this extended dataset indicated overdispersion.</p>
                <p>For life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis, end of follow-up was the time to first diagnosis of colorectal cancer (or other LS cancer, as appropriate), or the last recorded date at which clinical status was known. The date of the last clinical follow-up was provided by the local recruiting center for each participant except for those in England and Wales. For the English and Welsh centers, the data from NCRAS was the December 31, 2016, version of complete cancer registration, so participants without a diagnosis were censored at that date. For participants who had died or emigrated, follow-up was censored at the date of death or the date of embarkation, respectively.</p>
                <p>For the NBR analysis, exposure time was calculated from randomization until the date of last known clinical status, or 10 years if this came earlier for the whole CAPP2 study cohort and up to 20 years for participants in England, Finland, and Wales.</p>
                <p>Sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models, and cumulative incidence curves were used to assess nonparametrically outcome differences between groups. We made these adjustments because of the variation in cancer risk with age and the sex differences in cancer spectrum. The assumption of proportional hazard was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. Sex- and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using NBR to estimate the effect of RS from log-linear models for the number of primary cancers diagnosed after randomization until last follow-up.</p>
                <p>Secondary analysis examined the incidence of non–colorectal cancer LS cancers and, finally, the total burden of LS-related cancers.

                <p>As is standard practice in reporting factorial design clinical trials, in the main tables and text, we document the marginal effects of RS on cancer risk. We report in Supplementary Table S3 analyses after adjusting for the randomization within the aspirin arm. In addition, we report the outcomes and analyses for two subsets of the complete follow-up: (i) for all CAPP2 study participants restricted to 10 years follow-up (Supplementary Table S1) and (ii) for the cohort of participants from England, Finland, and Wales for whom up to 20 years of follow-up are available (Supplementary Table S4).</p>

                <p>We present analyses of the whole CAPP2 cohort at 10 years plus England, Finland, and Wales to 20 years as the main analysis. The characteristics of participants randomized to RS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 463) and placebo (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 455) were similar with approximately 25 months of intervention and ≈10 years of follow-up in each group (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Supplementary Table S5).

                <p>Since randomization, 52 and 53 participants developed colorectal cancer in RS and placebo groups, respectively. ITT analysis indicated no effect of RS on colorectal cancer incidence (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62–1.34; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.63; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similarly, PP analysis restricted to participants on treatment for ≥2 years showed no effect of RS on colorectal cancer incidence (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.69–1.76; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.69; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Because participants could be diagnosed with multiple primary cancers, we calculated IRR using NBR and confirmed no effect of RS on colorectal cancer in both ITT and PP analyses (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There was no evidence of any interaction between aspirin and RS treatments; Supplementary Table S4 shows the marginal results for RS treatment both without adjustment for aspirin as well as after adjustment for the aspirin arm to which the participant was randomized.</p>

                <p>There were extracolonic LS cancers among 27 participants in the RS group (and 29 cancers overall) compared with 48 participants in the placebo group (and 53 cancers overall; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This protective effect was apparent in ITT analysis (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33–0.86; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.010; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and the effect was greater in PP analysis (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22–0.81; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0090; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). When accounting for multiple primary cancers using IRR analysis, the protective effect of RS against non–colorectal cancer LS cancers was evident for both ITT (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.84; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0075) and PP (IRR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19–0.73; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0040) analyses (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These effects appeared to be particularly pronounced for cancers of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (stomach, duodenal, bile duct, and pancreatic cancers; Supplementary Fig. S4), which totaled 5 cancers in 5 participants in those randomized to RS versus 21 cancers in 17 participants in the placebo group. Findings were similar when analyses were restricted to all CAPP2 study participants at up to 10 years follow-up (Supplementary Table S5; ITT analysis; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30–0.85; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.011); PP analysis (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.72; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0044) or to participants in England, Finland, and Wales with up to 20 years follow-up whose information on cancer diagnoses was supplemented by national records (Supplementary Table S6; ITT analysis (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20–0.78; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0077); PP analysis (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12–0.77; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.012).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Randomization to RS for a mean of 25 months had no effect on colorectal cancer risk in patients with LS after long-term follow-up of the CAPP2 study in the test of our primary hypothesis. Our findings of no effect of RS on colorectal cancer risk in this long-term follow-up study are consistent with our findings of the interim follow-up at mean 53 months, which showed that RS had no detectable effect on colorectal cancer development in patients with LS (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Dietary supplementation with RS for this limited time period does not emulate the apparently protective effect of diets rich in DF against colorectal cancer in the general population (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>In contrast, those randomized to RS had significantly lower risk of diagnosis with non-colorectal LS cancers, our secondary hypothesis. This protective effect of RS was robust to both ITT and PP analyses and was evident in participants resident in England, Finland, and Wales for whom we had national registry follow-up for up to 20 years as well as in the whole CAPP2 study cohort with 10-year follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of RS on endometrial cancer incidence (15 diagnoses in RS group, 16 in placebo group), the most common extracolonic site but, for all other anatomic sites, limited numbers precluded conclusions. However, an effect appeared particularly evident for upper GI cancers (including pancreatic, bile duct, stomach, and duodenal cancers) where we found 5 cancers in 5 participants in those on RS compared with 21 cancers in 17 controls.</p>
              <p>Given their lower incidence, it is unsurprising that there is much less evidence from epidemiologic studies of associations between DF intake and risk of upper GI cancers than for colorectal cancer (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, findings from meta-analyses of data from case–control and prospective cohort studies suggest higher DF intake may lower risk of both stomach (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and pancreatic (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) cancers. In a Japanese prospective cohort study, higher DF intake was associated with lower extrahepatic bile duct cancer (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) whereas in the EPIC study, higher DF was associated with reduced intrahepatic bile duct cancer but not with biliary tract cancer incidence (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our unexpected finding has important implications for the management for patients with LS because surveillance for such cancers is challenging and survival after upper GI cancer diagnosis is much lower than for other LS cancers. For patients with LS diagnosed under 65 years, 5-year survival is 0%, 29%, 61%, and 67% for pancreatic, bile duct &amp; gall bladder, stomach, and duodenal cancers, respectively, compared with 88% and 93% for colon and endometrial cancers, respectively (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Overall, in a Finnish study, deaths due to upper GI cancers accounted for about 30% of non–colorectal cancer deaths in patients with LS (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>RS is a component of DF (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and prospective cohort studies provide strong evidence that higher DF intake is associated with lower colorectal cancer risk (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). However, few intervention studies have tested the effects of higher DF intake on colorectal cancer risk. A recent meta-analysis of outcomes from 5 studies that tested the effect of DF on colorectal adenomatous polyps recurrence found no difference in the number of people with ≥1 adenoma (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.95–1.13), &gt;1 adenoma (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20), or ≥1 adenoma ≥1 cm (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82–1.20; ref. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The authors concluded that there is a lack of evidence from RCTs that increased DF reduces polyp recurrence but that the findings should be interpreted cautiously because of the relatively high rate of loss to follow-up and because polyp recurrence was used as a surrogate for colorectal cancer.</p>
              <p>Our earlier randomized controlled trial (RCT) of colorectal cancer patients given RS, showed reduction of cell proliferation in the upper part of colonic crypts and changes in gene expression that were consistent with antineoplastic effects (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) Meta-analysis of findings from two studies that reported colorectal cancer outcomes at ≤4 years of intervention (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27, 28</xref>) showed higher colorectal cancer risk in those randomized to DF (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.07–6.85; ref. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, there were few colorectal cancer events (23 among 2,794 participants) and the evidence was graded as low quality (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>RS is fermented by multiple human colonic bacteria including members of the <italic toggle="yes">Ruminococcaceae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Lachnospiraceae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Erysipelotrichaceae</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Clostridiaceae</italic> families that are butyrate producers (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and involves synergy between primary RS degraders and secondary starch scavengers (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Butyrate suppresses cancer cell proliferation and may enhance apoptosis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In addition, cells defective in MMR may be more susceptible to the antineoplastic effects of butyrate (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In the CAPP1 trial, we randomized 227 participants with familial adenomatous polyposis to RS or placebo for median 17 months (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). RS had no effect on polyp number or size but colorectal mucosal crypt length diminished in those randomized to RS (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). There is evidence from short-term mechanistic studies that RS and/ or its fermentation end products is antineoplastic; for example, in a well-controlled human intervention study in which healthy adults consumed high intakes of red meat (a risk factor for bowel cancer) for 4 weeks, supplementation with RS reduced multiple biomarkers of cancer risk, including the pattern of expression of oncogenic microRNAs and reduction of red-meat induced O6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>
              <p>An indirect effect of RS on the immune response to a highly immunogenic tumor could explain the effect on the wide spectrum of non–colorectal cancer cancers although this does not account for the lack of an effect in the colon or endometrium. The mechanisms through which RS appears to have a protective effect on upper GI tumors are not apparent. In a xenograft pancreatic cancer mouse model, RS reduced tumor growth and expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 in tumors (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Very recent studies in mice have revealed a central role for butyrate (a fermentation product derived from RS) in reversing the progression of necrotizing pancreatitis (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Although the causal links remain unclear, pancreatitis appears to increase risk of pancreatic cancer (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). There is, although, no suggestion that pancreatitis is a feature of LS.</p>
              <p>One possible explanation for our findings could be an effect of RS on total and, especially, unconjugated secondary bile acids. Bile salts exiting the terminal ileum into the colon are exposed to bile salt hydrolases (expressed by multiple intestinal bacteria) and metabolized to secondary bile acids (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>); these can promote carcinogenesis (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) by inducing cancer stem cells (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Intervention studies in both healthy volunteers (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and participants with recent colorectal adenomas, showed that RS reduced fecal concentrations of total and secondary bile acids (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Lower secondary bile acids may result from RS-induced changes in bile acid metabolism by the gut microbiota but RS can also change bile acid patterns through pathways independent of the microbiome (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is growing evidence that pancreatic cancer is associated with distinctive changes in the gut microbiome (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), but to date, it is unclear whether those changes are causes or consequences of the disease. If they are causal, then manipulation of the microbiome via RS (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) may offer potential for reduced risk of this difficult cancer.</p>
              <p>Antineoplastic effects may also be mediated via microbial modulation of immune homeostasis (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This was demonstrated in experimental studies showing differential stimulation of Toll-like receptors and attenuation of proinflammatory cytokines in dendritic cells (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Although the mechanisms through which RS reduces risk of upper GI cancer remain to be discovered, it is likely that they involve the gut microbiota since, by definition, RS is not digested in the small bowel but is fermented to SCFA by the commensal bacteria in the large bowel (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
              <p>The consensus statement from the International Cancer Microbiome Consortium (ICMC) concluded that, despite mechanistic and supporting evidence from animal and human studies, there is currently no direct evidence that the human commensal microbiome is a key determinant in the etiopathogenesis of cancer (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, the recent discovery that some colorectal cancer cases may be due to exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing <italic toggle="yes">pks</italic> pathogenicity island (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), which induces chromosomal instability and DNA damage (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), indicates a novel mechanism through which dietary factors may influence colorectal cancer risk. The ICMC concluded that the microbiome represents one apex of a tripartite, multidirectional interactome [the other apices are environmental factors (including diet) and host epigenetic/genetic vulnerability] that drives carcinogenesis (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our finding that a RS supplement reduced upper GI cancers in patients with LS, who are at higher genetic susceptibility, should prompt further mechanistic investigation.</p>
              <p>A recent analysis of the NHANES 2015 to 2016 survey suggested that American adults eat, on average, 4.0 g RS/day (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) The supplement used in CAPP2 delivered a daily dose of RS equivalent to eating a green tipped banana. Thus, the potential health benefits observed in this intervention study might be achievable in the wider population of LS gene carriers with a modest dietary change.</p>
              <p>A major strength of this study was that blinded follow up was sustained to the planned 10-year follow-up from recruitment, supplemented by reliable national registry data in England, Wales, and Finland. We found strong evidence of lack of effect of RS on colorectal cancer risk and a clearly significant reduction in other LS cancers. Possible mechanisms are explored but these could not be investigated in this study in the absence of a suitable biobank.</p>
              <p>A weakness of these results is that our original hypothesis focused on colorectal cancer where no effect was found. Detection of an effect on other LS cancers so long after a relatively brief intervention is surprising but not impossible; mutagens can damage stem cells and lead to malignancy many years later, especially where DNA repair mechanisms are impaired.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found no evidence that RS alters colorectal cancer risk in LS but those randomized to RS have significantly lower risk of non–colorectal cancer LS cancers, especially upper GI cancers. Given that diagnosis and management of these cancers is difficult, this finding has substantial potential benefits for patients with LS. Furthermore, the possibility that RS, and by analogy other forms of DF, may reduce upper GI cancers in the wider population should be investigated in large-scale prospective cohort studies.</p>
