                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Although cardiologists were â€˜late-comersâ€™ to the multidisciplinary teamâ€”contributing to the complex care of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), they now recognise the importance of systematic cardiac surveillance and timely therapy to prolonged survival in patients with DMD. Empirical deployment of cardioactive medications has already improved outcomes, but the evidence base for clinical decision making is weak. Fundamental questions remain as to whether prophylactic therapy is justified and convincingly superior to prompt deployment of the same therapies once left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is detected. Even if it were, at what age should therapy be introduced and with what specific drugs?</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We are conducting a multicentre, parallel group, randomised, placebo-controlled study of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and a beta-blocker (bisoprolol) in boys with DMD aged 5â€“13 years, with normal LV function by echocardiographic criteria at the time of recruitment. Boys are being followed-up for a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5â€‰years and undergo repeat assessments of LV function, heart rate and ECG, forced expiratory volume in the 1 s and forced vital capacity, adverse event reporting and quality of life at 6â€‰monthly intervals.</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome is change in LV function between active and placebo-treated participants over the course of the study.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency in the expression of the protein dystrophin on the inner aspect of muscle cell sarcolemma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Its clinical course has traditionally been characterised by weakness of proximal limb muscles and calf muscle hypertrophy and progresses to involve all body muscles.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Affected individuals typically lose ambulation and become wheelchair-dependent before the age of 13Â years and die from cardiorespiratory failure in their third to fourth decade of age.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> From the cardiology perspective, some 90% of men with DMD develop a severe, progressive form of cardiomyopathy. Twenty per cent to 30% have evidence of left ventricularÂ (LV) impairment on echocardiography by age 10 years.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â€“8</xref> Subtler abnormalities in LVÂ function are evident in an even larger proportion of patients at all ages when more sensitive imaging techniques, such as tissue Doppler, magnetic resonance or metabolic imaging, are deployed.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Despite the prevalence of cardiac involvement, until recently cardiologists were not included in the multidisciplinary team managing patients with DMD. Historically, this was because survival in DMD was determined predominantly by respiratory muscle weakness and consequent respiratory failure. Despite the severity of underlying cardiomyopathy, patients with DMD remain asymptomatic because their limited physical activity, due to generalised muscle weakness, means that cardiac symptoms only emerge with the onset of heart failure. Even then, when cardiac medications were introduced, they were usually deployed tentatively and without any expectation that they would improve survival.</p>
              <p>However, lifeÂ expectancy in DMD has improved over recent decades, primarily as a result of three changes: routine use of corticosteroid therapy for muscle strengthening, non-invasive ventilation for respiratory muscle weakness and wider multidisciplinary care arrangements.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11â€“13</xref> This has meant that patients with DMD are now surviving routinely to an age when cardiac involvement is more advanced and the heart more often contributes directly to death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 12 13</xref></p>
              <p>The results of large randomised controlled trials in patients with idiopathic forms of dilated cardiomyopathy have established that cardioactive medications can reverse or change the trajectory of decline in LVÂ dysfunction and so improve prognosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14â€“16</xref> Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor (ACEi),<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> beta-blocker<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19â€“21</xref> and an aldosterone antagonist<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> are now deployed routinely and well tolerated in adults. More recently, the findings from cohort series of patients with established cardiac dystrophinopathy have shown that the rate of decline in LV function can be slowed also by the same drug combinations.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24â€“27</xref> However, when introduced after the detection of early, asymptomatic, LVÂ systolic dysfunction, these therapies do not seem to be able to prevent a slower rate of decline over a longer period of time.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

              <title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
              <p>The aim of this randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial is to determine whether the introduction of ACEi (perindopril) combined with beta-blocker (bisoprolol) therapy, before the onset of echo-detectable LVÂ systolic dysfunction, can delay the age of onset and/or slow the rate of progression of cardiomyopathy compared with placebo in men aged 5â€“13 years with DMD. The study is being conducted at four National Health Service (NHS) specialist hospital sites. LVÂ function will be assessed serially over a minimum of 3Â years and a maximum of 5â€‰years. The study was designed on the assumption that only one high-quality placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic cardioactive therapy is ever likely to be funded and brought to completion.Â Patient recruitment began in mid-2011Â and the last participant was recruited in January 2015. Patient follow-up is ongoing.</p>
              <p><italic>Primary hypothesis</italic>: starting the combination of perindopril and bisoprolol before there is any evidence of LVÂ systolic dysfunction, detectable by echocardiography, in children with DMD will delay the onset and/or slow the rate of progression of cardiac dystrophinopathy compared with placebo.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>The study was designed against the background of uncertainties recognised both by clinicians and patient support groups about the value of prophylactic, cardio-specific medications for children with DMD and the optimum age to start therapy. This issue was a common theme raised by parents of boys attending cardiac surveillance clinics. This prompted the development of this clinical trial and the aims, study duration and the therapies to be tested evolved in discussion with patients/patient groups (eg, <italic>Action Duchenne, UK</italic>; an ENMC workshop with patient representatives; and so on) and clinician experts over several years. The burden of testing for the study was not specifically assessed with patients/patient but was designed to be intentionally low.</p>
                <sec id="s3a1">
                  <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                  <p>At each of the four participating UKÂ hospitals, boys with DMD attend neuromuscular clinics at least annually for supervision of musculoskeletal and respiratory function. Each hospital also has a regular schedule for cardiac surveillance, by which patients have LVÂ function assessed every 2â€‰years before the age of 10 yearsÂ and annually thereafter in accordance with published DMD care recommendations.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Males, aged 5â€‰years to less than their 13th birthday, with proximal muscle weakness and genetically confirmed DMD (ie, an out-of-frame deletion or frameshifting point mutation in the dystrophin gene or less than 3% dystrophin expression on muscle biopsy by immunohistochemistry or western blot) were identified from their clinical records ahead of a scheduled neuromuscular or cardiology clinic attendance. The parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of those not already receiving cardiac medications were contacted initially by letter, informed of the nature and purpose of the trial and invited to have their child participate. Parents and children received age-appropriate information documents about the study prior to attending a dedicated study screening clinic. Parents provided written consent, and as far as possible, the assent of children was also obtained prior to study entry as required by local regulations. A screening log was kept by each site of those approached but not recruited to the study. Permission to use their childâ€™s NHS number for tracing in the case of loss to follow-up and for assessment of long-term survival status was also obtained from the parent(s)/legal guardian(s).</p>
                  <p>Boys then underwent baseline testing. This comprised an echocardiogram with tissue Doppler imaging, 12-lead ECG, vitalograph for forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in the 1Â s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)Â and peak flow measurements as well as blood sampling for haematology and biochemistry parameters. A parent and the boy also completed core and Neuromuscular disease specific module (NMD)Â module PedsQual quality of life questionnaires.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> To be eligible for randomisation and study enrolment, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), calculated by the 16-segment wall motion score method, had to beÂ â‰¥55%, fractional shortening (FS)Â â‰¥28%â€‰and there could not be any LV segmental hypokinesis on baseline echoÂ imaging.</p>

                    <title>Additional inclusion/exclusion considerations</title>
                    <p>Current or recent inclusion in a separate natural history trial did not preclude participation in the DMD Heart Protection study. Patients with contraindications to either ACEi or beta-blocker medications were not recruited. Renal function was measured by plasma urea, creatinine and potassium prior to study entry. Patients with abnormal renal function (ie, creatinine&gt;upperâ€‰limit of local laboratory range; typicallyÂ &gt;60â€‰mmol/L) or consistently abnormally high serum potassium level (K&gt;upperâ€‰limit of local laboratory range; typically 5â€‰mmol/L) were also excluded. To achieve blinding throughout the study, participants had to be able to swallow an empty capsule identical in size, colour and shape to that to be used throughout the study at the screening visit to be enrolled in the trial.</p>

                    <title>Randomisation and dosing</title>
                    <p>To ensure concealment of allocation, randomisation was performed using the web-based Newcastle Clinical Trials Unitâ€™s Randomisation Service in variable blocks, blocked and stratified by centre. Boys fulfilling study entry criteria were randomised to receive capsules containing both active medications (ie, perindopril 2â€‰mg and bisoprolol 1.25â€‰mg) or an identical placebo capsule (ie, containing an inert filler). All participants took one capsule at bedtime for the first month and those weighing more than 30â€‰kg then increased to two capsules at bedtime thereafter. If a participantâ€™s weight increases to more than 30â€‰kg at any scheduled review, study medication increases to two capsules per day for the remainder of the study.</p>

                    <title>Blinding</title>
                    <p>Randomisation to active or placebo combined capsule (1:1 ratio) is doubleÂ blinded from the point of manufacture and identifiable only by a master code held at the NewcastleÂ Clinical TrialsÂ Unit (NCTU). Participants, clinicians, pharmacy and other trial staff are also blinded to treatment allocation. Study drug and placebo capsules are identical in appearance and packaging, identifiable only through the study code numbers on the medication bottles. Following entry of a participant into the study, bottle numbers assigned to him are recorded on the prescription, and a list of bottles received by participants is maintained by the NCTU. Emergency code-break envelopes, one per participant, are stored in the trial pharmacy at sites to allow unblinding in the event of an emergency. Any unblinding is notified to the trial coordinating team and a record will be maintained in both the Trial Master File and the Investigator Site File. Code breaks will not be performed routinely for participants on study completion.</p>

                  <title>Evaluation and follow-up</title>
                  <p>All participants are being followed-up 6â€‰monthly for a minimum of 3Â years and a maximum of 5â€‰years. At each attendance, participants have height and/or armÂ span, weight, blood pressure and heart rate measured, and the family is questioned about any adverse events, intercurrent illnesses and need for urgent or elective hospital admissions since last assessed. A list of all concomitant medications and any changes in doses are recorded. Boys have a repeat echocardiogram, 12-lead ECG, peak flow, FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC measurements and both the boy and a parent complete age-appropriate PedsQL, quality of life questionnaires. Families are instructed to bring all used and unused containers of trial medications back with them at each assessment as a way of assessing compliance with their allocated treatment (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                  <p>To increase the sensitivity of testing, cardiac MRI (cMRI) will be offered once to each participant as they exit the trial. This will allow supplementary measures of LVEF%, wall thicknesses, chamber dimensions and volume for comparisons between active and placebo cohorts in those who consent to this additional test.</p>

A difference of 5% between active and placebo-treated groups was considered to be the smallest that would represent a clinically useful gain.

Since the age of onset of earliest detectable cardiomyopathy is variable, depending on age at recruitment, duration of follow-up, steroid use as well as any impact of specific DMD-mutations, it was not possible to factor these meaningfully into a power calculation.</p>

                <title>Potential weaknesses in study design</title>
                <p>This protocol was conceived originally at a time when cardiac medications were not prescribed routinely even for patients with DMD before the onset of symptomatic heart failure in most hospitals. Although the results of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic perindopril in DMD were known, their clinical significance was debated.<sup>52</sup> On this basis, it was concluded that another placebo-controlled study was both necessary and ethically justifiable.</p>
                <p>Ideally, the study would have had four arms (perindopril alone, bisoprolol alone, perindopril and bisoprololÂ and placebo alone). However, it rapidly became apparent that there were insufficient potential participants available to recruiting sites to allow that design. Furthermore, the anticipated cost over the study duration planned would have been prohibitive. It was decided, therefore, that this protocol should build on the finding of the earlier perindopril study by recruiting a larger patient cohort and by testing combination (perindopril and bisoprolol) rather than single agent (perindopril) therapy.</p>
                <p>The optimum age at which to start prophylactic heart therapy is unknown. By recruiting participants as young as 5 years of age, the study aimed to check for intolerance which might outweigh cardiac benefits, particularly in the very young. However, recognising that the youngest recruits were less likely to develop echo-detectable cardiac dysfunction over even the maximum study follow-up of 5â€‰years, the protocol included a prespecified analysis of results by age.</p>
                <p>The decision to use echo rather than MRÂ assessments for the main outcome measures was discussed repeatedly at the planning stage. Ultimately, echoÂ measures were adopted for the following reasons: (1) young children might not tolerate the length and nature of cMRI without sedation or general anaesthesia. Both were considered unreasonable in a research study planned in 2009; (2) towards the end of study participation, older subjects might not be able to fit comfortably into an MRI scanner due to steroid induced changes in body habitus, scoliosis or limb contractures;Â and (3) because of respiratory muscle weakness, older patients with DMD do not tolerate lying supine for long without assisted ventilation. Inability to breath-hold adequately and/orâ€‰patient movement reduce the imageÂ quality of cardiac MRÂ scans and so their sensitivity in detecting subtler abnormalities. Furthermore, although cMRI is now used more routinely for surveillance and is more sensitive in detecting cardiac abnormalities at earlier stages in DMD, it was not as widely available in many hospitals in 2009.</p>
                <p>A further important consideration was that if the findings were ultimately to change the conservative approach to heart management that prevailed when the study was first approved, they would need to be sufficiently robust to convince non-specialists of the benefits of prophylactic therapy. Also, allowing for wide variations in age of onset of detectable cardiac changes in DMD, a study of longer duration using less sensitive heart measures was considered more likely to provide clinically relevant answers than one of shorter duration even using more sensitive assessments. With the increased use and availability of cMRI since the study was first conceived, participants are now being offered cMRI once as they complete follow-up. This will increase the studyâ€™s ability to detect subtler differences in cardiac function and in fibrosis between active and placebo arms.</p>
                <p>Each of the decisions made in developing the final protocol involved compromises and several can legitimately be criticised. However, it is probably only after results become available that it will become clearer whether the best trade-offs were made and whether the protocol should have been optimised differently.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>It has been known for decades that a progressive form of cardiomyopathy affects almost all patients with DMD.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 32â€“38</xref> LVÂ function deteriorates progressively without symptoms for most of its course but ultimately contributes to heart failure and premature death in these patients.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> Traditionally, cardiac-specific medications were not deployed, because it was assumed that they would be of little benefit except in alleviating heart failure symptoms.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> This was based on the knowledge that none of them could correct the underlying dystrophin deficiency, which results in progressive cardiac myocyte damage from cardiac contractions. However, various cohort series have established that glucocorticoid steroid therapy delays the onset of cardiac dystrophinopathy<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42â€“46</xref> and that a range of cardiac-specific drugs can slow the rate of deterioration in ventricular function when introduced after cardiomyopathy is detected.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 47â€“50</xref></p>
              <p>Based on current understanding of the cause and course of cardiomyopathy, therapies are more likely to be effective if started before the process has led to functional abnormalities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Support for the prophylactic use of ACEi therapy (perindopril) comes from the results of the only randomised, placebo-controlled trial in children with DMD. This found that, although mean LVEF% did not differ between treated and placebo groups after either three or 5â€‰years, LVEF% fell to less than 45% after 5â€‰years in eight of those initially receiving placebo as compared with only one taking perindopril.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Additionally, early perindopril seemed to be associated with improved survival after 10 years.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The results are encouraging but the findings have been criticised for a number of shortcomings in study design and the small trial size was not powered to detect a mortality outcome.</p>
              <p>Some clinicians found the results persuasive and began to deploy prophylactic ACEi therapy routinely. However, others found the available evidence insufficient to justify daily drug-therapy for an average of 5â€‰years before asymptomatic LVÂ dysfunction would usually be detectable. The effect is that although steroid therapy is now recommended routinely for children with DMD, prophylactic ACEi therapy is not, primarily because of the lack of convincing evidence of benefit. Furthermore, even if the benefits of prophylactic ACEiÂ therapy are accepted, available evidence does not define the optimum age for their introduction. Nor is it established whether therapy should be with ACEi alone, ACEi and beta-blocker, aldosterone antagonist alone or a combination of ACEi, beta-blocker and aldosterone antagonist.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It is even debated whether prophylactic cardiac therapy is really superior to the prompt introduction of combination cardiac therapies on detecting the earliest evidence of ventricular dysfunction.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p>
              <p>This randomised placebo-controlled study protocol was developed in recognition of these therapeutic uncertainties and to improve the evidence base for clinical decisionÂ making about how best to protect the hearts of children with DMD using currently available medications.</p>
