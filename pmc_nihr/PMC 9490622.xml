                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Kidney cancer (renal cell cancer (RCC)) is the seventh most common cancer in the UK. As RCC is largely curable if detected at an early stage and most patients have no symptoms, there is international interest in evaluating a screening programme for RCC. The Yorkshire Kidney Screening Trial (YKST) will assess the feasibility of adding non-contrast abdominal CT scanning to screen for RCC and other abdominal pathology within the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial (YLST), a randomised trial of community-based CT screening for lung cancer.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In YLST, ever-smokers aged 55–80 years registered with a general practice in Leeds have been randomised to a Lung Health Check assessment, including a thoracic low-dose CT (LDCT) for those at high risk of lung cancer, or routine care. YLST participants randomised to the Lung Health Check arm who attend for the second round of screening at 2 years without a history of RCC or abdominal CT scan within the previous 6 months will be invited to take part in YKST. We anticipate inviting 4700 participants. Those who consent will have an abdominal CT immediately following their YLST thoracic LDCT. A subset of participants and the healthcare workers involved will be invited to take part in a qualitative interview. Primary objectives are to quantify the uptake of the abdominal CT, assess the acceptability of the combined screening approach and pilot the majority of procedures for a subsequent randomised controlled trial of RCC screening within lung cancer screening.</p>

                  <p>YKST was approved by the North West-Preston Research Ethics Committee (21/NW/0021), and the Health Research Authority on 3 February 2021. Trial results will be disseminated at clinical meetings, in peer-reviewed journals and to policy-makers.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Kidney cancer (or renal cell cancer (RCC)) is the seventh most common cancer in the UK, and incidence is increasing.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As with other cancers, survival is strongly dependent on stage at diagnosis: 5-year survival is 87% in stage I compared with 12% in stage IV.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Diagnosing RCC at an early stage is therefore central to improving survival.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A particular challenge for the diagnosis of RCC is that 60% of patients are asymptomatic, rising to 87% when considering only stage I cancers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As a result, up to a third of patients present with incurable stage IV disease<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and half of all patients developing the disease die from it.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>The fact that RCC incidence is increasing, is largely curable if detected early and most patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, has resulted in interest from both the scientific community and patient representatives for the development of an RCC screening programme. In particular, screening and early detection of RCC has been identified as a key research priority in three independent priority setting initiatives over the last 5 years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> However, despite three decades of interest in the topic, no definitive studies have been conducted and there remain a number of key uncertainties.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These include whether detecting RCC earlier would translate into reductions in mortality or lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment and whether the benefits at population level would outweigh the potential physical, psychosocial and financial harms. Randomised controlled trials are, therefore, needed. Additionally, despite the increasing incidence, extrapolating from studies in the USA or Japan, the prevalence of RCC among middle-aged adults within the general population in the UK is estimated to be 0.21% (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.28%).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This means that approximately 500 individuals would need to be screened to identify one person with a RCC unless screening was targeted towards higher-risk individuals.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>The gold standard test for detecting and investigating renal masses is a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan. It is not feasible to use a contrast-enhanced CT as a stand-alone screening test for RCC due to the relatively high radiation dose and cost, particularly given the low prevalence of RCC. However, using a non-contrast CT scan and combining that with the thoracic low-dose CT (LDCT) scans recommended in the USA in adults aged 50–80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history or have quit smoking within the past 15 years<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and currently being reviewed by the UK National Screening Committee has been proposed.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Over 95% of deaths from RCC in the UK occur in those aged over 50 and the relative risk for RCC compared with never smokers is 1.35 for current smokers and 1.22 for ex-smokers. This combined approach would therefore reduce both the costs and radiation, while also targeting those at higher risk due to their age and smoking status.</p>
              <p>The potential benefits of using CT to detect RCC have been seen in one of the randomised control trials of lung cancer screening in the USA<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in which participants diagnosed with RCC within 12 months of the thoracic scan who had a reported abnormality in the upper abdomen had a significantly shorter median time to diagnosis that those without an abnormality in the upper abdomen. However, the thoracic LDCT used within lung cancer screening only includes the upper pole of the kidneys. Additionally, for any screening programme to be successful, eligible individuals need to take up the offer of screening. Previous research has shown that providing combined ‘one stop’ cancer screening programmes is viewed positively by members of the public<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and a survey of over 1000 individuals found that 95% would be ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ to take up an abdominal CT for RCC screening if it was offered in addition to lung cancer screening.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These studies, however, report only intention, and not actual attendance, as no such screening programme currently exists. There are also no studies piloting the additional logistics required for such a combined screening programme.</p>
              <p>The Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial (YLST) is a community-based, lung screening programme that has recruited individuals who are current or ex-smokers, 55–80 years of age and at high risk of developing lung cancer as defined by the LLP<sub>v2</sub> score,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> PLCO<sub>M2012</sub><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> score or using the 2014 USPSTF criteria.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Participants are being invited back for a second thoracic LDCT after 2 years. Nested within YLST, the Yorkshire Kidney Screening Trial (YKST) will take advantage of this unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and acceptability of offering an additional non-contrast abdominal CT at the same time as the thoracic LDCT as a combined abdominal and lung cancer screening approach and to estimate other key uncertainties needed to inform a health economic analysis and subsequent randomised controlled trials within future screening programmes.</p>

Participants randomised to the intervention arm are invited to contact a telephone line for a lung cancer risk assessment. Those at high risk of lung cancer are offered a Lung Health Check appointment at a mobile unit sited in convenient community locations, including LDCT screening for lung cancer. The YLST screening programme includes a baseline visit (T0), where participants undergo baseline measurements of height and weight, spirometry (pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic), oxygen saturation and exhaled carbon monoxide alongside a smoking cessation intervention and a thoracic LDCT, and a second visit 2 years later (T2), where participants are offered a further thoracic LDCT.</p>

They will be invited to view the YLST T2 Patient Information video, followed directly by the YKST information video. The YKST video explains the context of the study and the benefits and harms of the additional abdominal CT, including an estimate that in about 5 out of 1000 eligible people the scan may show evidence of RCC, the uncertainty over whether detecting cancers in this way reduces deaths from RCC, the risks associated with the radiation dose and overdiagnosis and the potential to cause anxiety and worry. Participants are also provided with a written participant information sheet covering the same information (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>). A YLST consultation will follow, at the end of which participants will be asked if they would like to take part in YKST. Translation services are offered to patients where required. Eligibility will be checked and fully informed written consent obtained. As part of this consent, participants will consent to allowing the YKST research team access to their medical records.</p>

                <title>CT scanning protocol</title>
                <p>The scanning protocol for the non-contrast abdominal CT will be based on the protocol used for kidney ureter and bladder scans within Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust (LTHT) and will be reviewed and monitored by the LTHT medical physics team to ensure that the lowest possible dose allowing interpretable images is used for the YKST abdominal images. A 64-channel (or higher) mobile multidetector CT will be used throughout the study. Participants will lie supine on the CT table with arms above their head and thorax and abdomen in the midline of the scanner. Subject comfort will be optimised and maximal inspiration rehearsed prior to the scan to minimise motion during the CT. Imaging will then be performed during suspended maximal inspiration with the standard scanogram used to localise the start and end positions of the scan. No intravenous contrast material will be administered. The kidneys will be scanned in their entirety in a single craniocaudal acquisition and transaxial images of 1 mm thickness will be generated, with further reconstructions as necessary. Radiation exposures will be kept as low as possible while maintaining good image quality. The average CT dose index (CTDIvol) and Dose Length Product for 70–80 kg patients will be monitored to ensure that they closely match the current typical values of 5 mGy and 110 mGycm, respectively, from LTHT scanners. The X-ray tube current (mAs) settings will be automatically varied by the scanner according to participant body habitus. The CT images will then be transferred from the mobile unit to LTH PACS system within 2 days.</p>

Recruitment began 2 months into T2 on 10 May 2021 and will run until 31 October 2022. Approximately 4700 individuals will therefore be eligible for inclusion into YKST. If 80%–90% of those take up the additional screening, it will be possible to measure the proportion taking up the additional scan, the primary quantitative outcome of this study, to within 1%. For the qualitative substudy, the principles of information power<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> will be used to decide when to cease data collection but we anticipate interviewing up to 40 participants. We will purposefully sample participants with the aim to include approximately 20 who accept the additional scan and 20 who do not, with a range of ages, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. For the qualitative interviews with healthcare professionals, there are approximately 10 closely involved in the screening process and all will be approached.</p>

                  <p>We will report the proportion of the population attending the T2 screening round who (1) are eligible to take part in YKST; (2) are invited to take part in YKST; (3) consent to the additional scan within YKST and (4) decline taking part in YKST. We will also report these proportions by age, sex, smoking status, ethnicity and socioeconomic status and compare those invited who accept and undergo the abdominal CT scan between demographic subgroups. The additional time required at each stage (obtaining consent, performing, reporting and reviewing the scans and feeding back the results to participants) of the combined screening approach will be reported. Qualitative data evaluating the acceptability of the combined screening approach will be analysed using Framework analysis, guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Each transcript will be read by at least two members of the study team with other members of the study team reading some of the transcripts and contributing to discussions about the overall findings.</p>

When reporting the prevalence and stage distribution of RCC, we will present data among the participants who had the abdominal CT as well as among those from the baseline round of scanning in YLST who either had a renal mass identified in that baseline (T0) lung LDCT or staging investigations for any lung lesions identified and so would have had their full kidneys imaged.</p>

              <p>This study was granted approval by the North West—Preston Research Ethics Committee (reference 21/NW/0021), and the Health Research Authority on 3 February 2021. It has been adopted onto the National Institute for Health Research trial portfolio (reference 290336). The University of Leeds is the sponsor and together with LTHT acts as joint data controller. The trial will have three committees providing oversight: the Trial Management Group (TMG), the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) and an Independent Trials Steering Committee (TSC). The TMG will meet on a monthly basis, and will consist of the co-ordinating team based in Cambridge, members of the YKST team based in Leeds as well as the YLST principal investigator, data manager, project manager and lead nurse. The TMG will provide regular monitoring of the trial and provide clinical, scientific and practical advice. The IDMC will meet once or twice a year and will monitor patient safety as well as interim data. The TSC will meet once or twice a year and will provide overall oversight for the trial. The independent members of the IDMC and TSC will include experts in the field of cancer screening, radiology, renal cancer and statistics. The TSC will also include at least one patient/public representative.</p>
              <p>Findings from the study will be reported in open-access papers in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. We will also provide a lay summary of the findings on the study website (<ext-link xlink:href="www.YKST.org" ext-link-type="uri">www.YKST.org</ext-link>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>As the first study of its kind, YKST will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a combined abdominal and lung cancer screening approach and estimate other key uncertainties needed to inform a health economic analysis and future randomised controlled trials. Nesting YKST within an ongoing randomised lung cancer screening trial also provides a unique opportunity to generate the first cohort of participants invited to undergo screening for RCC. Although limited to assessing uptake and acceptability among participants who have already accepted screening for lung cancer and not large enough on its own to enable precise estimates of prevalence of RCC or an assessment of whether screening for RCC reduces RCC mortality, this cohort will be a valuable foundation for future research.</p>
