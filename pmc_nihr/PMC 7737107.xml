                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>14 NHs (7 intervention, 7 control) in London and West Yorkshire.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Complex intervention to support healthcare and improve early detection and treatment of urinary tract and respiratory infections, chronic heart failure and dehydration, comprising: (1) â€˜Stop and Watch (S&amp;W)â€™ early warning tool for changes in physical health, (2) condition-specific care pathway and (3) Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation tool to enhance communication with primary care. Implementation was supported by Practice Development Champions, a Practice Development Support Group and regular telephone coaching with external facilitators.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Data on NH (quality ratings, size, ownership), residents, family carers and staff demographics during the month prior to intervention and subsequently, numbers of admissions, accident and emergency visits, and unscheduled general practitioner visits monthly for 6 months during intervention. We collected data on how the intervention was used, healthcare resource use and quality of life data for economic evaluation. We assessed recruitment and retention, and whether a full trial was warranted.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We recruited 14 NHs, 148 staff, 95 family carers and 245 residents. We retained the majority of participants recruited (95%). 15% of residents had an unplanned hospital admission for one of the four study conditions. We were able to collect sufficient questionnaire data (all over 96% complete). No NH implemented intervention tools as planned. Only 16 S&amp;W forms and 8 care pathways were completed. There was no evidence of harm.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Recruitment, retention and data collection processes were effective but the intervention not implemented. A full trial is not warranted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Currently in the UK more than 420â€‰000 people aged over 65 years live in residential care, of which approximately 220â€‰000 reside in care homes with nursing (referred to in this paper as â€˜nursing homesâ€™ (NHs)).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Most UK NHs are owned by private companies and residents pay on a means-tested basis. Unlike some European NHs, for example in the Netherlands, there is no on-site provision of medical care. NH residents are served by a general practitioner and other visiting staff such as specialist nurses. NH residents have complex healthcare needs with high levels of multimorbidity, frailty and dementia. The Kingâ€™s Fund<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and British Geriatrics Society<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> have raised concerns about the inconsistency and quality of healthcare provision to NHs.</p>
              <p>There has been a 63% increase in all-cause hospital admissions from NHs between 2011 and 2015.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As well as causing distress to residents, their families and staff, hospitalisation is expensive for health and social care systems, costing an estimated Â£1.2 billion per-annum in the UK.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hospital admission increases risk of decline in functional ability, delirium, adverse events and prolonged stays.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref></p>
              <p>Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs) are â€˜conditions that can lead to unplanned hospital admissions that may have been avoidable or manageable by timely access to medical care in the communityâ€™.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Four ACSCs contribute to a 30% of hospitalisations from NHs<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>: respiratory infections<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10â€“12</xref>; acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>; urinary tract infections (UTIs)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 15</xref> and dehydration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>A number of interventions have been developed to enhance healthcare in NHs, falling broadly into two categories: single component interventions (predominantly advanced care planning or single-disease care pathways, eg, for pneumonia) and multicomponent interventions which include enhancing staff knowledge and skills,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> clinical guidance and decision-support tools (care pathways), engaging with families,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and input from geriatricians or nurse practitioners.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Research highlights the importance of collaborative intervention development with staff,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> residents and families,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and using local champions to support implementation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> â€˜INTERACTâ€™ (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers), developed in the USA, focuses on managing acute changes in residentsâ€™ condition and reduces transfers to acute hospitals.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We worked with stakeholders and our family Carer Reference Panel (CRP) to develop and adapt INTERACT for use in the UK.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This included 18 semistructured interviews and three co-design workshops over 5â€‰months, with amendments made to the intervention after each workshop. Participants comprised 22 diverse stakeholders (two NH managers, three care assistants, eight nurses, four general practitioners, three family carers, a geriatrician and a quality improvement manager) (paper in preparation). The Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework underpinned co-design of implementation support and guidance.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>

                <p>The project was developed in collaboration with the UK Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Network. Patient and public involvement representatives (SN and BW-C) were grant co-applicants. Two CRPs ensured public involvement at all stages. Each comprised eight family carers of people with dementia and a person living with dementia, supported by Alzheimerâ€™s Society research volunteer network. They collaborated on intervention design, recruitment and consent processes, accessibility of information leaflets, data collection, interpretation and dissemination.</p>

                  <p>We recruited 14 NHs (eight in West Yorkshire and six in London) with adequate staffing to implement the intervention and support research. These were identified via local Clinical Research Networks, and the Enabling Research in Care Homes Network, purposively selected to include a range of providers (large and small chains, independent providers), urban, suburban and rural. Managers, regional managers or owners gave written permission. The intervention was an enhanced version of â€˜usual careâ€™ implemented at NH level. Therefore, individual consent was not required and all staff were involved in delivering the intervention to all NH residents.</p>

                  <p>The NH manager or deputy manager identified all potentially eligible residents. If necessary, we conducted a capacity assessment regarding trial participation, adhering to the UK Mental Capacity Act (2005). If the resident lacked capacity, we used a personal consultee (friend or family), or if not available, a professional consultee (health or social care staff with a professional relationship to the resident but no connection with the project). If a resident lost capacity during the study, a consultee was found.</p>

              <p>The pilot trial ran for 10 months (November 2017â€“August 2018). Sites were set up in months 1 and 2, in month 3 we collected pre-intervention (baseline) data over 4â€‰weeks before the intervention was implemented. The intervention ran for 6â€‰months with final data collection and site closure in month 10. We planned for the trial to run for 16 months from November 2017 but had to reduce follow-up due to delays in obtaining ethical approvals. Thus, timing of data collection differs from our protocol.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>

                <p>This was developed consistent with the PARiHS framework to ensure implementation matched individual contexts. It was important for Practice Development Champions (PDCs) to decide on how they approached this, given the philosophy of quality collaboratives and â€˜championsâ€™ in place. This enhanced the role of PDCs in developing their own approach.</p>

                  <title>Workshop</title>
                  <p>The research team delivered a 1-day workshop to two PDCs from each NH comprising an introduction to four key ACSCs (respiratory and UTIs, dehydration, acute exacerbation of CHF) and elements of how to bring about organisational change.

The nurse recorded the outcome of the primary and secondary assessment and their care plan in the residentâ€™s records and decided on the next course of action. This may have included further monitoring using the Stop and Watch early warning tool, treatment initiated in the NH, or communication with primary care using the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation (SBAR) tool.

Where we had pconsent to collect individual-level resident data, we monitored participants monthly for serious adverse events (SAEs) defined as â€˜any untoward occurrence that resulted in death, was considered life-threatening at the time of the event, required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or was any other important medical conditionâ€™.</p>

                      <p>To explore intervention fidelity, two nurse researchers aimed to review a convenience sample of five records for residents admitted to hospital, or received treatment in the NH, for ACSCs. They used a free-text review sheet to record references to trial intervention tools (Stop and Watch, the care pathway and SBAR) and assessed compliance with the care pathways. We noted where NHs made amendments to the structure or content of the care pathway.</p>

                      <p>To explore the impact of enhanced healthcare in the NH, we documented hospital admissions for the four key ACSCs (acute exacerbation of CHF, respiratory and UTIs, dehydration). Number (%) of residents requiring one or more ambulance calls, one or more unscheduled out-of-hours GP visits or phone calls, and having one or more A&amp;E department visits were documented as potential secondary outcomes.</p>
                      <p>We tested the assumption that a hospitalisation for an ACSC was a proxy for an avoidable hospital admission using the Structured Implicit Record Review (SIRR) tool.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Two independent experts (geriatrician and community nurse) used the SIRR, which takes account of the residentâ€™s pre-existing health, any advance directives and the care options available at the time to assess the â€˜avoidabilityâ€™ of the admission.</p>

Resources use associated with hospital admissions, primary care, and National Health Service (NHS) and social care services were collected using the CSRI and costed from the NHS/personal social services perspective.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32â€“34</xref> All costs are reported in 2016/2017 British pounds (Â£). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for residents were calculated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and associated algorithms mapping the 5L descriptive system data onto the 3L valuation set as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35â€“38</xref> We report only results based on QALYs calculated using the resident self-completed EQ-5D-5L questionnaire as these had higher return. There was no discounting of costs or QALYs given they were reported over 6 months only. For missing data we used multivariate imputation by chained equation, generating 20 imputed data sets. For each of these, we ran 1000 bootstrap replications using non-parametric bootstrapping. Bootstrap results were combined to calculate the mean values for costs and utilities and the SEs around the imputed values used to calculate 95%â€‰CI around point estimates. To report the probability that the intervention is cost-effective compared with treatment as usual (TAU) for a range of values of willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY gained, the bootstrap results have been used to generate a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and the probability that the intervention is cost-effective compared with TAU at a Â£20â€‰000 for a QALY gained reported.</p>

                    <p>Rates of hospitalisation for ACSCs</p>
                    <p>At baseline the rates of hospitalisation for ACSCs (respiratory infection, exacerbation of CHF, UTI and dehydration), our potential primary outcome, were low and 0.4% of the cohort had an admission for respiratory infections, 1% for UTI, none for dehydration and 0.4% had an admission for CHF in the month before the trial started. There were six admissions in total from the 235 residents in the study. Considering the whole 6-month study period, 25 study participants (15%) had an unplanned hospital admission for one of the ACSCs. The low rates of unplanned hospital admission (per 100 person months) for these ACSCs suggest this is not an optimal primary outcome measure for future studies <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Considering secondary outcome measures for a definitive trial, we found a slightly higher proportion of participants (n=38, 16%) had an A&amp;E attendance during the follow-up period, 42 (18%) had at least one ambulance called, 29 (12%) had an unscheduled (out-of-hours) GP visit and 21 (11%) died. The incidence of these events was still relatively low and not sufficiently frequent to be definitive study outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Hospitalisation for an ACSC as a proxy for avoidable hospital admission</p>
                    <p>We intended to use the SIRR tool to assess the appropriateness of 30 resident admissions for one of the four ACSCs, but it was not always possible to identify the reasons for admission and these were low overall. We therefore expanded our sample to include hospital admissions for any cause. One NH had no eligible residents, because those admitted to hospital had died and/or their care records were no longer available. We therefore also included residents who died in hospital, as long as their records were still available. We were able to assess 10 admissions from a total of 24, which occurred during the study period. Using the SIRR tool, we deemed 3 of the 10 admissions assessed potentially avoidable. None of the NH care records provided a complete picture of residentsâ€™ health in the period leading up to admission. This suggested an ACSC admission was not a reliable proxy measure for an â€˜avoidable admissionâ€™.</p>

                    <p>We collected data on most recruited care staff at baseline (N=132). For example, 129 care staff gave demographic details (98%) and 127 (96%) completed the P-CAT scale. Attrition in response to these scales was secondary to NHs dropping out of the study, rather than staff being unwilling or unable to complete them.</p>

We cannot be sure that no admissions or visits to acute hospital were missed as NHs did not have centralised systems for collecting these data.</p>

                    <p>One NH withdrew after randomisation and therefore, we considered the cost of intervention to be Â£0 (as â€˜per randomisedâ€™ approach). Assuming the intervention was offered to all 89 residents randomised to the intervention group, the mean cost per resident would be Â£74 (95% CI Â£64 to Â£84). During follow-up, there were no significant differences in the majority of the components of healthcare resource use between the intervention and TAU groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental appendices 9 and 10</xref>). Differences in mean utility values and QALYs were not statistically significant when carers assessed their QoL and therefore, no further analysis was performed. The mean total cost of healthcare resource use/resident over 6 months was Â£1458 (95% CI Â£1351 to Â£1566) in the intervention group and Â£1233 (95% CI Â£1171 to Â£1295) in the TAU group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental appendix 11</xref>). Non-parametric bootstrapping after multiple imputation produced a mean total cost per resident in the intervention group of Â£1479 (95% CI Â£757 to Â£2200), compared with Â£1271 (95% CI Â£975 to Â£1566) in the TAU group. The mean difference in cost between the BHiRCH-NH and TAU group was Â£208 (95% CI âˆ’Â£561 to Â£977). Non-parametric bootstrapping after multiple imputation produced 0.315 (95% CI 0.304 to 0.326) QALYs in the intervention group and 0.298 (95% CI 0.290 to 0.307) QALYs in the TAU group, generating a statistically significant mean difference in QALYs of 0.016 (95% CI 0.003 to 0.300) (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our cluster randomised pilot trial of the BHiRCH-NH intervention in 12 NHs found study processes were effective. We successfully recruited, retained and obtained individual-level data from residents, staff and family carers. Adverse event data did not suggest the intervention caused harm. Our CRP worked with us throughout, advising on study set-up, engaging with homes and potential participants, data collection, and contributing to data analysis and interpretation. However, despite excellent recruitment and retention, there was limited engagement with the intervention tools and the support offered for their implementation. The lack of use of the intervention coupled with the economic analysis means that we would not recommend a definitive randomised controlled trial of the BHiRCH-NH intervention. We focused on four key ACSCs (dehydration, respiratory and UTIs, and exacerbation of CHF) because they are common causes of potentially avoidable hospital admissions and a significant area of health policy focus. There is lack of national comparative data, but we found lower hospitalisation rates for these conditions than we expected. Categorising admissions to hospital is complex and people may present with broader symptoms that is, delirium or falls. ACSCs may be more of an administrative label to be used in large data analyses rather than a sensitive tool for assessing the â€˜avoidabilityâ€™ or otherwise of acute hospital admissions.</p>
              <p>Implementing practice change in NHs can be challenging. Despite offering monthly telephone support calls during the study at times agreed with PDCs, they often could not speak due to changes in duty rosters, last-minute leave or being too busy. While the INTERACT programme, from which our BHiRCH-NH intervention was adapted, demonstrated reductions in all-cause hospitalisations among actively participating NHs, a subsequent larger randomised controlled implementation trial in 85 US NHs had no effect on emergency department visits or hospital admissions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Resources, competing demands and instability of NH leadership were all barriers to successful INTERACT implementation,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and it is likely that these factors were also present in our study.</p>
              <p>Our study has limitations. We recruited NHs, residents, staff and family carers to target, although two NHs dropped out from the intervention arm. Our NHs may be atypical as 79% were rated as â€˜goodâ€™ by the CQC, compared with the UK national average of 73%. Residents in our sample were broadly representative of the UK NH population in terms of age and gender.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Monthly visits from research fieldworkers and the appointment of research facilitators who were existing NH staff fostered positive relationships between NHs and the research team and facilitated access to NH records. We cannot verify that data on hospital attendances, staffing and support from external healthcare services are complete, as most NHs did not routinely record hospital admissions or ambulance and GP call-outs. Staff self-rated their knowledge and skills regarding health conditions and their communication with primary care and research assistants collecting outcome data were not blind to NH allocation. We assumed we could use admission for ACSCs as a proxy for avoidable admissions, but even after using the SIRR tool,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> it was difficult to identify whether an admission was for an ACSC or not. Future studies should include consent to access hospital records so this can be more thoroughly assessed.</p>
              <p>Current UK policy focus on reducing hospitalisations and enhanced healthcare in NHs has led to significant levels of activity in local health and social care services. Research in such a fast-moving landscape is challenging. NHS Englandâ€™s demonstration projects â€˜Vanguardsâ€™ and increasing numbers of local quality improvement initiatives means â€˜usual careâ€™ will be improving, making trials challenging to conduct. Although our intervention was co-designed with staff, this involved an extra burden of observation and documentation, which was difficult for staff who were already pressed for time. Recent studies conducted in care homes suggest that a higher level of support and facilitation may be required for effective implementation; meetings involving all NH staff may be more successful.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The Palliative Care for Older People Steps to Success Programme conducted in 78 NHs across seven countries, which involved a complex intervention to improve end-of-life care, did not improve resident comfort or staff knowledge despite using a train-the-trainer approach.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, the Well-Being and Health for People with Dementia programme was successfully implemented in 69 UK care homes and showed a significant effect on reducing agitation possibly through a much higher intensity of external facilitation that may not be sustainable or cost-effective.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Since we designed our intervention and conducted our pilot trial, knowledge on improving healthcare for NH residents has increased. Key components for resident healthcare, identified in the 2017 â€˜Optimalâ€™ study were GP involvement supported by integrated external services.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> These findings are reflected by emerging evidence that change to the wider health and social care system may be more effective in reducing the number of NH residents admitted to hospital.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our co-designed complex intervention for early detection, monitoring and communication of change in residentsâ€™ health does not warrant a future definitive trial because it was not implemented in practice. It was important that this pilot trial was conducted as this has avoided the risk of embarking on a full trial and subsequent waste of resources and time.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Our study contributes to learning in the under-researched but vital field of NH research.</p>
