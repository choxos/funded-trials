                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>For patients with advanced cancer, research shows that pain is frequent,
burdensome and undertreated. Evidence-based approaches to support cancer pain
management have been developed but have not been implemented within the context of
the UK National Health Service. This protocol is for a pragmatic multicentre
randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess feasibility, acceptability,
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for a multicomponent intervention for pain
management in patients with advanced cancer.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This trial will assess the feasibility of implementation and uptake of
evidence-based interventions, developed and piloted as part of the Improving the
Management of Pain from Advanced Cancer in the Community Programme grant, into
routine clinical practice and determine whether there are potential differences
with respect to patient-rated pain, patient pain knowledge and experience,
healthcare use, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. 160 patients will receive
either the intervention (usual care plus supported self-management) delivered
within the oncology clinic and palliative care services by locally assigned
community palliative care nurses, consisting of a self-management educational
intervention and eHealth intervention for routine pain assessment and monitoring;
or usual care. The primary outcomes are to assess implementation and uptake of the
interventions, and differences in terms of pain severity. Secondary outcomes
include pain interference, participant pain knowledge and experience, and
cost-effectiveness. Outcome assessment will be blinded and patient-reported
outcome measures collected via post at 6 and 12 weeks following randomisation.</p>

                  <p>This RCT has the potential to significantly influence National Health Service
delivery to community-based patients with pain from advanced cancer. We aim to
provide definitive evidence of whether two simple interventions delivered by
community palliative care nurse in palliative care that support-self-management
are clinically effective and cost-effective additions to standard community
palliative care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Each year in the UK, 163 000 people die from cancer.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For patients with cancer, research shows that pain is frequent,
burdensome and undertreated.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>
Over two-thirds (66.4%) of these patients will experience pain during advanced,
metastatic or terminal stages of their cancer.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
Many patients with cancer spend their last 6 months of life living in the community,
typically at home, though many are admitted as inpatients nearer to death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Barriers to good pain control include inadequate
support and patient education,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> poor assessment
and communication,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and lack of access to an
adequate prescription and timely analgesia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A
range of approaches have been developed that seek to improve the management of pain in
patients with advanced cancer but have not been implemented within the context of the
National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. Three emerging approaches that address
key barriers to pain management for patients with advanced cancer are outlined,
including referral to specialist palliative care, self-management of pain and analgesia,
and routine monitoring of pain.</p>
              <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Specialist palliative care</title>
                <p>Specialist palliative care aims to relieve suffering and improve quality of life for
people with advanced diseases, such as cancer, who are facing death. For patients
with advanced cancer, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref> have shown that
early access to palliative care can improve symptoms, reduce acute hospital
admissions, minimise aggressive cancer treatments and enable patients to make choices
about their end-of-life care, including exercising the choice to die at home.
Interventions in these trials varied, but common characteristics included assessment
and several follow-up consultations by specialist palliative care teams over a period
of 2–3 months. Where reported, patients were recruited and received these
interventions about 6 to 14 months before their death.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref> Collectively, these data suggest
that a dose of three to four palliative care contacts applied about 6 months before
death is associated with better end-of-life care. The trials from which this evidence
is derived were based in North America, and the studies vary widely in their
definition of what constitutes palliative care services and who provides them. These
limitations have prevented direct translation and implementation of this evidence
within the context of the UK NHS.</p>

                <title>Supporting self-management of pain and analgesia</title>
                <p>Pain for patients with advanced cancer is a complex and dynamic experience.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Poor knowledge and fearful attitudes within
patients towards cancer pain and analgesia are associated with reluctance to commence
opioids, reduced medication adherence and higher pain intensity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> Providing information to patients with cancer pain and
addressing concerns regarding pain and analgesia are effective interventions that
support self-management and lead to improvements in pain outcomes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–22</xref> While evidence
supports the use of self-management approaches, there remains uncertainty on the
optimum dose and components of a self-management intervention, and how best to
implement these in routine practice.</p>

                <title>Routine monitoring of pain</title>
                <p>Assessing pain and presenting data to physicians prior to consultation, who then use
it within discussions, significantly improves pain outcomes and quality of life for
patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Assessment alone without
ensuring that this is seen by prescribing clinicians does not lead to improvements in
pain,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> highlighting the need for
interventions to alert clinicians to patients’ symptoms. Two large RCTs, one
conducted in the USA<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and one in the
Netherlands,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> have demonstrated
improvements in cancer pain when combinations of interventions have been evaluated.
The first compared telephone self-management support from nurses combined with
automated symptom monitoring, with usual care. Significant reductions in pain scores
were demonstrated over a 12-month period.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
The second combined specialist pain consultation with nurse-led self-management
support and compared this with usual care.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
Over an 8-week follow-up period, significant benefits were experienced by
intervention patients in pain scores and reduction in interference in daily living
from pain. Similar to education self-management approaches, there is uncertainty
about the optimum dose, alongside a lack of evidence of implementation in the context
of the UK NHS.</p>

                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>We have developed a complex intervention consisting of three distinct components: (1)
referral to community palliative care support, (2) a resource to support
self-management of pain and analgesia, and (3) an electronic pain monitoring
system. We hypothesise that within oncology (or related) services, screening and
referral of community-based patients with pain from advanced cancer to a cancer pain
pathway, combined with a package of routine pain assessment and monitoring using an
e-health tool, will reduce the extent of pain and psychological distress reported by
the patient.</p>
                <p>We will undertake a multicentre RCT to assess the acceptability and feasibility of
implementation of the complex intervention, its potential cost-effectiveness and
impact on pain management.</p>

and quality of life for patients.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> PainCheck was developed to facilitate this communication by
enabling patients to routinely report and share pain data for health
professionals to access. Its development was informed by patient,
caregiver and health professional involvement.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–35</xref>
<break/><italic>What:</italic> PainCheck allows patients to record their
pain and gives them access to personalised pain management advice.
Patients are asked to answer various questions about their pain including
providing a description of their pain, rating current pain intensity and
intensity in the last 12, pain control, interference and sleep. Items
were taken from the Brief Pain Inventory<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and Coping Strategies Questionnaire.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Patients are asked about pain management
techniques, which of these were helpful and how likely they are to try
them in the future. Various question response options are used including
multiple choice, numerical (0–10 or 0–6) slider scales and
free text. After completion, patients are provided with a summary of
their results and suggestions of pain management techniques they may want
to try in the future. Health professionals can log in to PainCheck and
view all patients registered on PainCheck and see who have completed
reports. They are then able to select a patient and view responses to
individual questions. Health professionals are presented with a graph
that tracks patients’ current pain and pain in the last
12 hours over time. Patients are given a ‘red flag’
in the health professional system if they reach certain thresholds for
current pain and pain control. After reading the patient report, health
professionals can decide what action, if any, they would like to take as
a result. Health professionals have the option to contact patients
through PainCheck to provide information and advice. PainCheck was
developed using QTool. QTool is a secure online system, which can be
integrated in real time with the electronic patient records, enabling
collection of patient-reported information (such as symptoms, treatment
side effects, pre-clinic questions, satisfaction surveys). QTool
was developed by the collaborative efforts of multiple research groups
based at the University of Leeds pooling approximately
£400 000 of research funding. The current version of
PainCheck does not use linkage with existing electronic clinical record
systems; instead, PainCheck is currently run as a standalone
intervention. <break/><italic>Who provides:</italic> PainCheck will be
introduced to participants by their locally assigned community palliative
care nurse within 1 week of randomisation. Training on using
PainCheck with patients will be provided by trial researchers to
community palliative care nurses. Training will include instructions for
training the participants in the interventions, which will include a
demonstration for the participant on how to log on and use the Routine
Pain Assessment and Monitoring system at the initial visit.
<break/><italic>How:</italic> PainCheck will be introduced to patients
by their locally assigned community palliative care nurse. The
introduction will involve participants logging in to the system (using
unique login details that will be provided by the community palliative
care nurse) and working through an assessment using the instruction
leaflet as a guide. The palliative care nurse will oversee the
participant’s first access and use of PainCheck and will provide
additional support/guidance if necessary. At induction into the system,
participants will be made aware that PainCheck should not be used to
request urgent or emergency help; where urgent or emergency help is
required participants are told to contact the emergency services. On
visiting PainCheck, participants are reminded, by use of an on-screen
message, that should they need immediate medical attention they should
call the emergency services. If they require urgent medical advice, they
are advised to contact their doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This reminder
is provided near the beginning and at the end of each PainCheck session.
Following an introduction to PainCheck, participants (or a person
submitting responses on a participant’s behalf) will be expected
to complete pain assessments without the community palliative care nurse
present. Each pain assessment asks for clarification of who is entering
data (ie, a patient, or someone on their behalf), which is reflected in
reports when viewed by health professionals. Based on reports submitted
by participants, the PainCheck system can provide two types of email
alert to health professionals: high priority (generated immediately when
a patient submits a report indicating high pain and/or low levels of
control) and low priority (a weekly email sent when participants are
interacting with PainCheck but reporting very low levels of pain or no
pain). After reviewing reports submitted to PainCheck, a health
professional is asked to record in the system what action they took: (1)
no further action, (2) contact another health professional, (3) contact
the patient and (4) other. PainCheck can be accessed by patients
and health professionals using any device that enables access to the
internet (eg, using laptop, smartphone or tablet computers).
<break/><italic>Where:</italic> The expectation is that PainCheck will
be accessed by patients or their families while in the community setting,
which could include usual place of residence or alternative chosen
location. <break/><italic>When and how much:</italic> Following the
introduction of routine completion of PainCheck in the community,
participants will be encouraged to use the system at least once a day,
with additional entries being encouraged when/if pain events occur.
PainCheck will be available to participants until 14 days after
their 12-week follow-up assessment. Participants are notified in writing
that access to PainCheck will be ending.
<break/><italic>Modifications:</italic> On-going <break/><italic>How
well (planned)</italic>: Intervention data collection (at baseline)
will confirm that a patient received details to access PainCheck. Data
captured by PainCheck will provide insight into the frequency of use by
patients, alongside identifying interaction between health professionals
and patients that occurs through PainCheck (ie, messages sent to patients
by health professionals). Semistructured end-of-trial interviews with
patients and health professionals will inform how the intervention is
used. <break/><italic>How well (actual):</italic> On-going</td>

                  <p>Training in the use of the interventions will be provided to the Community
Palliative Care Team prior to the participating centres opening to recruitment.
Training will be provided by the trial researchers based at the University of
Leeds and involved in the IMPACCT Programme Grant working closely with the lead
nurse at palliative care sites, recruiting sites and the administrative support
staff for the community team. As part of the training, the Community Palliative
Care Team will receive instructions for training the participants in the
interventions, which will include a demonstration for the participant on how to
log on and use PainCheck at the initial visit, and written instructions and a
contact for any future queries will be provided. The participants will receive the
educational intervention ‘Tackling Cancer Pain’ booklet and DVD from
the palliative care team and asked to use it as much and as often as they would
like.</p>

interventions—including training sessions with palliative care nurses such
as additional training on delivery of the routine pain assessment and monitoring
intervention for new staff. Monitoring adherence to the educational and routine

                  <title>Contamination</title>
                  <p>The risk of contamination between the two trial arms will be minimal as the
educational intervention and routine pain monitoring will be made available only
to participants allocated to the supported self-management arm of the trial, and
there is little opportunity for participants in either trial arms to meet and
discuss treatment. The importance of contamination was included in site training,
so site teams are made aware not to share materials. We will record the number of
contacts in community palliative care and the staff involved in the care to
explore the potential for contamination. The number of Tackling Cancer Pain
booklets and accompanying DVDs provided to each hospice will be monitored against
the number of participants allocated to receive this intervention to ensure these
are not being used for other patients. The online pain monitoring system can only
be used by participants allocated to the intervention who are assigned a trial
specific username and password obtained from the research team. There is no risk
of contamination in the recruiting clinics as intervention delivery takes place in
the community palliative care setting; notification of trial referrals to the
palliative care team will clearly document the participants’ randomisation
allocation. We will monitor the timing at which patients are referred into
palliative care and documentation of previous palliative care discussions.</p>

                <p>To address the potential effectiveness of the intervention the power calculation is
based on the difference in mean pain severity (BPI) at 12 weeks. With 80% power and a
two-sided type I error rate of 0.05, we estimate that 128 patients (64 per group)
will be required to detect a moderate intervention effect size of 0.5<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> between the intervention and control arm. In
addition, a relative reduction of ≥30% in pain severity (BPI) is an
accepted threshold for clinically significant improvement in pain trials.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Results from a previous study involving
automated symptom modelling found a 27% difference in such improvement rates at 12
weeks.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Our estimated sample size will
therefore also provide 80% power to detect a similar difference in rate. As our
patient sample is drawn from a generally frail population, we have allowed for an
attrition rate of 20% and therefore aim to recruit 160 participants (80 per group).
The trial is expected to recruit from four to five participating centres that will be
selected due to their large oncology (or related) clinics.</p>

              <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
              <p>The IMPACCT research programme comprises four work streams. The first three work
streams, running in parallel, sought to understand and improve current cancer pain
management at the levels of the patient and their caregiver, health professional and
healthcare system. Across these three work streams, extensive user engagement with
patients, caregivers and health professionals occurred, informing an understanding of
their priorities, experience and preferences relating to cancer pain management. Part of
this work involved the development and piloting of interventions used in the trial,
including assessment of their acceptability, and informed the design of the trial, its
research question and outcome measures. The research programme also has a patient and
public involvement (PPI) group, comprising patients with cancer and caregivers of those
with cancer. PPI representatives are co-investigators on the research programme,
contributors at all quarterly programme management meetings and members of the trial
steering group. The latter enabled PPI representatives to inform the recruitment
processes and conduct of the trial. For example, it was decided that due to participants
having advanced disease, information sheets should provide contact details to enquire
about study findings rather than active dissemination by the research team. PPI
involvement has been central to all research programme activities, informing our
approach to patient, caregiver and health professional engagement prior to and during
the trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial will conclude a 5-year programme of research funded by the NIHR PGfAR
Programme. The wider aim of the programme, IMPACCT, is to reduce distress from cancer
pain in palliative care patients and reduce the impact on the NHS of avoidable
admissions for cancer pain. We believe that our RCT has the potential to significantly
influence NHS service delivery to community-based patients with pain from advanced
cancer. We aim to provide definitive evidence of whether two simple interventions
delivered by community palliative care nurse in palliative care that
support self-management are clinically and cost-effective additions to standard
community palliative care. We are conducting a detailed process evaluation that will
inform an implementation strategy for the wider NHS if we find a benefit for
intervention. One of our interventions, ‘Tackling Cancer Pain—A toolkit
for patients and families’ addresses all the information recommendations in the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on ‘Opioids in
Palliative Care’ and was runner-up in the British Medical Association Patient
Education awards 2016. Our electronic pain monitoring system ‘PainCheck’
is underpinned by significant development work,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–35</xref> which explores engagement by patient
and healthcare professionals. PainCheck offers a potentially time-efficient and
cost-efficient way for busy community palliative care teams to monitor patients with
cancer pain and respond when needed.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>A favourable ethical opinion was obtained from the NHS National Research Ethics
Service Committee Yorkshire &amp; The Humber—Leeds East, reference number
15/YH/0235. The trial opened and recruited the first participant in October 2015.
Screening, recruitment and implementation were monitored on a monthly basis. After 6
months of recruitment and after 13 patients had been recruited, it was apparent that
the trial design needed to be changed to ensure the trial is embedded in existing NHS
care pathways. A substantial amendment was made to remove the concept of
‘early screening and referral’ to allow identification at point of
referral. The rationale for this was that patients were already being referred to
community palliative care services for pain management support when needed. The trial
is sponsored by the University of Leeds (Faculty Head of Research and Innovation
Support, Faculty of Medicine and Health Research Office, University of Leeds),
managed by the Clinical Trials Research Unit at the University of Leeds and supported
by a Trial Management Group (TMG) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The TMG is
composed of individuals responsible for the day-to-day management of the trial,
including the PI (MIB), statisticians, trial manager, research nurse and researchers.
The TSC includes external experts who will provide overall supervision for a trial on
behalf of the Trial Sponsor and Trial Funder.</p>

our work and encourage wider adoption of our findings. We will also disseminate
through academic papers and presentation at national and international clinical
