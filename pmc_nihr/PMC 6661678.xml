                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Peripheral neuropathy is a major risk factor for falls in adults with diabetes. Innovative footwear devices which artificially manipulate the sensory environment at the feet, such as textured shoe insoles, are emerging as an attractive option to mitigate balance and walking problems in neuropathic populations. This study aims to explore whether wearing textured insoles for 4 weeks alters balance performance in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A prospective, single-blinded randomised controlled trial with parallel groups will be conducted on 70 adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Adults with a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy (secondary to type 2 diabetes), aged ≥18 years, ambulant over 20 m (with/without an assistive device), will be recruited. Participants will be randomised to receive a textured insole (n=35) or smooth insole (n=35), to be worn for 4 weeks. During baseline and post intervention assessments, standing balance (foam/firm surface; eyes open/closed) and walking tasks will be completed barefoot, wearing standard shoes only, and two different insoles (smooth, textured). The primary outcome measure will be centre of pressure (CoP) velocity, with higher values indicating poorer balance. Secondary outcome measures include walking quality (gait velocity, base of support, stride length and double-limb support time), physical activity levels, foot sensation (light-touch pressure, vibration) and proprioception (ankle joint position sense), and other balance parameters (CoP path length, anteroposterior and mediolateral excursion). Patient-reported outcomes will be completed evaluating foot health, frequency of falls and fear of falling. Data will be analysed using a repeated measures mixed models approach (including covariates) to establish any differences between-groups, for all outcome measures, over the intervention period.</p>

              <p>Peripheral neuropathy affects between 22% and 51% of people with diabetes,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> and is a major risk factor for falls, reported to be present in the lower limbs of up to 86% of older diabetic fallers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Nerve damage can severely disrupt the quality of sensory information transmitted from the feet to the brain, which provides vital cues about the supporting surface and position of body segments, to help older people remain upright. Similarly, balance impairments can also be observed in younger adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, placing them too at risk of sustaining falls-related injuries, with potential for deterioration with increasing age.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Loss of cutaneous sensory information from the foot sole is reported to be a critical factor contributing to walking instability, poor balance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and falls,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.</p>
              <p>Foot care is a standard practice in the management of diabetic populations, with shoe insoles routinely prescribed by healthcare professionals to help prevent foot ulceration,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> or provide pain relief, by way of redistributing plantar pressures. The effect of traditional footwear devices on balance performance in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy has received little attention, with inconclusive evidence both supporting<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> and refuting,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> the efficacy of shoe insoles. In contrast, lower limb strengthening exercises demonstrate stronger evidence as an effective balance intervention for people with diabetic neuropathy,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which may also have the capacity to improve cutaneous reinnervation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, innovative footwear devices which artificially manipulate the sensory environment at the feet are emerging as an attractive treatment option, which may compliment current exercise strategies to help mitigate balance and walking problems and reduce the risk of falling in adults with diabetes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> Textured shoe insoles, designed to stimulate cutaneous receptors on the soles of the feet and provide enhanced sensory feedback, have been shown to improve lateral (sideways) standing balance in healthy older adults,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and those with Parkinson’s disease.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This is a clinically important finding, as lateral balance is reported to be a strong predictor of falls.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Furthermore, in older fallers,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and adults with multiple sclerosis,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> wearing textured insoles have also brought about changes in spatiotemporal gait measures, synonymous with more confident and stable walking patterns.</p>
              <p>The potential therapeutic effects of textured insoles in people with pathological sensory loss largely remain unknown, due to the exclusion of this population from previous research strategies. However, a systematic review by Paton <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> revealed that people with pathological loss of foot sensation may benefit most from wearing footwear devices which augment the plantar sensory environment. There is limited evidence exploring the concept of lower limb sensory devices for adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 21 22</xref> One study applied tactile stimulation to the calf, therefore bypassing critical foot regions showing neuropathic damage.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> A further study explored insoles comprising in-built, battery-powered, vibrating mechtrodes<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>: a design feature which is impractical, complex to integrate into everyday footwear and expensive as a neuropathic treatment. Paton <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> provided new evidence to demonstrate that wearing textured insoles may heighten reliance on, and responsiveness to, plantar sensory inputs even in the presence of severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Further, compelling evidence by Wegener has demonstrated that wearing sensorimotor foot orthoses can alter ankle, knee and hip motion during walking, which may translate to increased gait stability, in adults with inherited neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This area urgently requires investigation in the real world context to understand the clinical impact in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Textured insoles may offer a new rehabilitative approach, which promotes self-management by the user, to improve balance and walking, and reduce the risk of falling, in adults with diabetes.</p>

                <p>This study protocol describes a randomised controlled trial of textured insoles, worn over a 4-week period, in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The primary aim of the study is to determine if wearing textured insoles for 4 weeks alters measures of standing balance ability (centre of pressure (CoP) velocity), under different conditions where visual information and the supporting surface are manipulated. Secondary aims are to determine if short-term wear of textured insoles leads to changes in walking quality (spatiotemporal gait parameters: gait velocity, base of support, stride length and double-limb support time), foot sensation (light touch pressure, vibration, ankle joint proprioception), physical activity levels using wearable sensors, other standing balance parameters (CoP path length, anteroposterior and mediolateral excursion) and patient-reported outcomes (foot-health specific quality of life, frequency of self-reported falls and fear of falling).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Recruitment of participants commenced on 14 August 2017 and remains ongoing. Community-dwelling men and women with a clinical diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes will be identified through a pool of sampling frames including Diabetes Australia, Diabetes Queensland and local community organisations across the Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and Logan regions, via mainstream media advertisements, including social media (eg, Facebook). Participants will also be identified through research volunteer databases maintained by the Centre for Neurorehabilitation, Ageing and Balance Research at UQ and Movement Neuroscience Programme at Queensland University of Technology (QUT); UQ and QUT Health Clinics, whereby recruitment processes will be coordinated by clinical staff to maintain patient confidentiality.</p>
                <p>Participants will be permitted to take part in the trial if they meet the following criteria: aged ≥18 years; clinical diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy secondary to type 2 diabetes; ambulant over 20 m (with or without the use of an assistive device, eg, single cane); willing to wear shoe insoles for 4 weeks; and have adequate English communication skills to provide informed consent and comprehend the study procedures. A diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy will be determined using one of two criteria. First, participants will be asked to provide details of their diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, previously given by a health professional. Second, participants who have a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but not of peripheral neuropathy, yet self-report significant alterations in lower limb sensation synonymous with neuropathy, will be screened using the Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom Score to determine eligibility.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This tool comprises four items addressing the nature and frequency of neuropathic symptoms (experienced across both lower limbs collectively) including (1) unsteadiness in walking; (2) burning, aching pain or tenderness in the legs or feet; (3) prickling sensations in the legs or feet and; (4) numbness in the legs or feet, experienced in the last 2 weeks. The presence of one symptom is scored as 1 point, and a total score of 1–4 points indicates the presence of peripheral neuropathy. This tool has comparable sensitivity (79%) and higher specificity (78%) compared with physical examination techniques (monofilaments: 81% sensitivity, 56% specificity; vibration perception threshold: 81% sensitivity, 58% specificity),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and is recommended by Diabetes Australia and The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> as a method for confirming a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Exclusion criteria are current foot ulceration or other lower limb injury; current use of over-the-counter or custom-made foot orthoses or shoe insoles; previous history of lower limb or partial foot amputation, Charcot Arthropathy, other neurological diseases or cardiorespiratory conditions that limit ambulation; unstable psychiatric condition (defined by a qualified health professional, eg, general practitioner) or cognitive impairment (Short Form Mini-Mental State Examination Score &lt;24).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> All participants will initially be screened via telephone interview, prior to attending face-to-face assessments.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Participants will be randomised to either the textured (intervention) insole or smooth (control) insole group. The concealed, computer-generated block randomisation schedule will be managed by an independent offsite investigator who is not involved in the enrolment or assessment of participants. Consecutively numbered, opaque envelopes, containing group allocation (in a 1:1 ratio), will be opened after the baseline assessment by the study podiatrist (JNM) who is solely responsible for fitting and issuing the insoles. All other investigators and research assistants, responsible for enroling and assessing participants, will remain blind to the group allocation. Following baseline assessment, the first and second research assistants will leave the gait laboratory to ensure blinding to the insole condition. The podiatrist will then customise and fit the participant with their allocated insole, and provide advice regarding the frequency of wear, completion of insole wear and falls diaries. Participants will be instructed not to divulge their insole allocation. The second research assistant will be responsible for maintaining the within-session insole condition randomisation schedule and coding, and for fitting the different insoles and shoes during assessments. During baseline assessment and post intervention assessment, the first research assistant will remain blinded to the order of testing of insole conditions. Due to the nature of the insole material being used, it is not possible to blind participants to their allocated group (ie, those in the intervention group may perceive the textured surface against their foot or visibly see the geometric pattern on the upper surface of the insole), therefore, the identity of the intervention insole will not be concealed. Participants will not be informed which insole condition is intended to provide enhanced plantar sensory feedback or is under investigation for its capacity to alter balance performance. Debriefing of participants will occur on completion of the trial. Additionally, participant coding will not refer to group allocation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Two different shoe insoles will be investigated in this randomised controlled trial: textured (intervention) insoles and smooth (control) insoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Importantly, both insoles have been implemented in previous research strategies,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and incorporate materials typically used for insoles prescribed to people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The insoles will be custom-made to each participant’s foot and shoe length. The textured insole will be constructed from 3.2 mm Poron (Poron 4000, Algeos, VIC, Australia), covered with 100% polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material which has raised pyramidal nodules (Techno PVC covering, Black Tech, Algeos, VIC, Australia) with centre-to-centre distances of 9 mm. The PVC material will be adhered to the Poron base using contact adhesive (Selley’s Kwik Grip Crystal Clear, DeluxGroup, VIC, Australia). The textured zone will extend from the heel to the proximal aspect of the first–fifth metatarsal heads, to avoid excessive friction at the forefoot.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> To minimise increased pressure that could lead to skin damage at the exposed edge of the textured material, a forefoot extension (1 mm, Poron 4000) will be adhered to the Poron base, extending proximal to the metatarsal heads to the distal end of the insole. This forefoot extension will be bevelled to create a smooth transition from the textured zone. The length of the textured zone and forefoot extension will be customised to each participant, by the podiatrist (JNM) at the baseline assessment. The smooth insole will only comprise the 3.2 mm Poron (with no PVC top cover). All edges of the textured and control insoles will be smoothed and shaped to fit the intended footwear using an orthopaedic grinder prior to dispense. Participants will be instructed to wear their allocated insoles, in their own shoes, as much as possible (when indoors and outdoors): wear time will be gradually increased. Assessments of balance and gait will be conducted with participants wearing standard shoes (following a 5 min familiarisation period) used in our previous work,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 29</xref> comprising a basic construct rubber-soled shankless shoe with a soft canvas upper (Volley International Canvas, Volley, China), into which the insoles will be inserted. This standardisation will control for any possible insole/shoe interactions which could influence the findings. The shoes will be available in a range of sizes. Participants in both groups will be advised to continue with their usual care, and that athletic socks are the thickest permitted to be worn, over the intervention period.</p>

                  <p>The primary outcome measure will be CoP velocity (mm.s<sup>– 1</sup>) during bilateral standing, providing a measure of unperturbed balance control. CoP velocity represents the speed at which the body’s centre of mass is moving, with a higher value indicating more rapid and potentially unstable movement.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Participants will stand on an AMTI force platform (sampling rate 1000 Hz), using standardised foot positioning (heels placed 1/10th participants height apart and angled to 14°),<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> with arms hanging by their sides,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> for 30 s. Standing balance will be performed on a firm and foam (50×41×15 cm foam block, placed directly on top of the force platform) surface, with eyes open and eyes closed, each while barefoot, wearing standard shoes only, and when wearing two different insoles (textured, smooth) within standard shoes (three trials per condition). The effects of texture may be more clearly identified during challenging tests of balance, which include the use of unstable surfaces such as foam.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> During eyes open trials, participants will be instructed to look straight ahead at a black, circular visual target (15 cm diameter), located 2.5 m from the centre of the force platform and adjusted to each participants’ eye level. The test sequence (shoe condition, surface and vision) will be randomised. Where a participant overbalances or moves out of the standardised positioning, the trial will be discarded and repeated.</p>

                <p>In our previous studies of textured shoe insoles, we received feedback from patients about their experiences and perceptions of wearing our insoles and completing the assessment procedures, which guided the design of the current study and development of the intervention. Patients were not involved in the development of the research question, outcome measures or the recruitment of participants. We will assess the burden of the insole intervention on patients by collecting information about adverse events and the number of hours the insoles were worn.

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants prior to enrolment.</p>
                <p>There are minimal risks associated with this study. The textured and smooth insoles will be constructed from materials used in standard insoles traditionally issued to people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The allocated insole will not be fitted if it is markedly uncomfortable for the participant to wear, to minimise any adverse reactions.</p>
                <p>Exposure to a new insole could lead to dermatological, musculoskeletal or sensory changes to the feet, or issues related to insole-fit and durability. Subsequently, all participants will receive contact details for podiatry care, and an insole advice leaflet. Participants who develop adverse foot events (eg, ulceration) will be withdrawn from the trial. Similarly, should wearing insoles increase the prevalence of falls experienced during the intervention period (relative to the frequency of falls experienced in the previous 12 months), all participants to whom this concerns will be withdrawn from the study, and their general practitioner notified. All adverse events will be reported in line with university ethical governance standards.</p>
                <p>During balance and walking tests, while wearing unfamiliar shoes and insoles, participants could experience a change in their stability. Therefore, participants will be closely supervised by the investigators. As part of the screening assessment, participants will be required to report on personal pain, disease and injury. This may require disclosure of the cause of impairment, or recollection of traumatic events (eg, injurious fall), which could be a potential cause of distress. Participants will be advised that they can choose not to answer any questionnaire items, and that this decision will not affect their involvement in the trial.</p>
                <p>The findings will be disseminated at national and international conferences and through peer-reviewed journals. Patients, healthcare professionals and the public will be informed of the findings via workshops, local meetings and social media.</p>

                <p><bold>Contributors:</bold> ALH led the conception, design and writing of the study protocol with substantial contributions to the design, writing, critical review of intellectual content and final manuscript approval from EMG, JNM, JB, JP, GK and KR. All authors agree to be accountable for their work. As principal investigator, ALH takes overall responsibility for the work. EMG made substantial contributions (as the first research assistant) to participant recruitment and data collection strategies in the development and initial stages of the study and protocol. JNM (as the study podiatrist), provided specific expertise in the development and construction of the textured and smooth insoles, dispensing the insoles and providing clinical support to participants over the intervention period. JB, JP, KR and GK made substantial contributions to the trial design and statistical analysis strategy. JP and KR were also responsible for providing expertise concerning the clinical management of diabetic feet. GK provided expertise in all biomechanical testing procedures and outcome measures.</p>
