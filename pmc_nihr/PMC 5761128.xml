                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A new model of care is required to meet the changing needs of people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly in low and middle-income countries, where prevalence is highest. We evaluated a palliative care intervention for PLWH in Mombasa, Kenya. Although we found no effect on pain (primary outcome), there was a positive effect on mental health (secondary outcome) in the intervention group. To inform replication and implementation, we have determined the active ingredients of the intervention and their mechanisms of action.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with qualitative exit interviews in HIV clinic attenders. The intervention was delivered over 5 months, with a minimum of 7 clinical contacts. Longitudinal quantitative data on components of care received were analysed using area under the curve and logistic regression. Qualitative data were analysed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Quantitative data analysis identified that intervention patients received more weak opioid, laxatives, discussion about spiritual worries, emotional support from staff for themselves and their families, time to talk about worries, discussion about future and planning ahead. Qualitative data analysis found that patients reported that having time to talk, appropriate pain medication and effective health education was of therapeutic value for their psychological well-being. Integration of mixed method findings suggest that positive effect in quantitative measures of mental health and well-being are attributable to the active ingredients of: appropriate medication, effective health education and counselling, and having time to talk in clinical encounters. Mechanisms of action include symptom relief, improved understanding of illness and treatment, and support focused on articulated concerns.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Routine care must provide opportunities and means for existing clinical staff to make routine appointments more person-centred. This approach enabled staff to identify and manage multidimensional problems and provide tailored health education and counselling.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Due to treatment advances, HIV has been transformed from an acute infection to a chronic condition for those with access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in resource-constrained settings where the disease burden is greatest, a paradigm shift is needed for health systems and providers to provide an adequate, sustainable response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The current model of HIV care is delivered in overstretched systems with weak infrastructure and high numbers of patients, and these challenges have been associated with attrition from ART programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to the efforts made to meet the UNAIDS 90–90–90 targets, these problems will be exacerbated by the projected increases in people living with HIV (PLWH) accessing ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">HIV outpatients in low and middle income settings have a high burden of psychosocial and physical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], evident from the point of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and persisting alongside ART use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These problems negatively affect patients’ ability to maintain ART adherence and their engagement with and retention in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which potentially leads to viral resistance and its associated clinical and public health implications. A potentially appropriate model to address these challenges is palliative care. This holistic, person-centred approach has been shown to effectively reduce distress in people living with HIV, but the evidence primarily relates to the end of life, predates the development of highly active ART, and is from high income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par21">We conducted a parallel, two-arm, pragmatic open-label RCT with qualitative exit interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The RCT found that, compared to standard care, a nurse-led palliative care intervention was of benefit in terms of the mental health dimension of quality of life, psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial problems, but not physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. During the trial, we conducted a mixed methods evaluation to determine how these effects were achieved, by identifying active ingredients of the intervention and their mechanisms of action. We report the results here. The methodology of the RCT, details of the intervention and trial findings are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The trial was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01608802).</p>
                <p id="Par22">PLWH at an HIV clinic in Mombasa, Kenya, were screened according to the following eligibility criteria: adults on ART for at least 1 month, with a pain or symptom score of 3–5 (from a possible range of 0 (best) to 5 (worst)) on the African Palliative Care Association Palliative Outcome Scale (APOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Exclusion criteria were pain and symptoms caused entirely by an acute problem (duration &lt;2 weeks), receiving ART for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, and not speaking Swahili or English. Following baseline data collection, participants were block-randomised to either intervention or control. The trial was un-blinded to participants and researchers, but blinded to the data analyst.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Qualitative exit interviews were conducted with 20 participants from the intervention group. A sample of 20 was judged as likely to achieve thematic saturation while allowing in-depth interrogation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Sampling was in line with an explanatory sequential mixed methods design: we purposively selected participants to achieve a maximum variation sample based on individuals’ quantitative clinical response to the intervention. Clinical response was measured using a locally-validated, disease-specific measure of quality of life, the Mental Health Summary Score (MHSS) from the Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV), in which a change of 10 points across a scale of 100 is considered clinically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Participants were classed as “improving” if the study exit MHSS was more than 10 points higher than the baseline score, “deteriorating” if the MHSS at study exit was more than 10 points lower than the baseline score, and “static” otherwise.</p>

                <p id="Par24">Each measure was used to collect quantitative data at five monthly interviews throughout the study period of 4 months (0,1, 2, 3, 4 months). We used an adapted version of the 22-item version of the Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to measure the components of care patients received during the study period. This generated a binary outcome of whether a component of care had been received during the study period or not. We created a variable to indicate whether the client had ever received each component of care throughout the study. This variable was used in analysis. As described, we used the mental health sub scale of the MOS-HIV (MHSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to measure clinical response to the intervention. The MOS-HIV is a 35 item questionnaire that has been culturally adapted to African settings and HIV populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">The same researcher who collected the quantitative data conducted qualitative interviews. Interviews were conducted between two to 6 months after exiting the trial, in a private location in the participant’s language of choice – Swahili or English – and digitally recorded. The topic guide explored physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects of participants’ experiences of living with HIV before, during and after the intervention, and their experiences of the intervention. Participants were also shown a line graph of their psychological well-being throughout the study, measured at five time points at monthly intervals (T0-T4) using the MOS-HIV MHSS. This was used to prompt discussion about their experiences during the study. If they could remember, they were asked what was happening when their well-being visibly changed on the graph. Experienced translators transcribed the interviews verbatim and, where needed, translated them into English. The translations were quality-checked against the interview recordings by the bilingual interviewer.</p>

The quantitative data were analysed to detect differences in components of care received by the intervention and control groups, and to identify associations between components of care and improvement in mental health in the intervention group. A Bonferroni correction for the 22 tests to be performed during this analysis indicated that a threshold for significance of 0.002 would be a conservative indication of a statistically significant association.

A hierarchy of major themes and sub-themes was created based on salience and conceptual coherence. The preliminary coding frame created by KL was reviewed, discussed and refined by the project team to ensure conceptual integrity, prior to application of the final coding frame to all transcripts (KL). To explore barriers to effectiveness of the intervention, deviant case analysis focused on qualitative data from the participants who remained static (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and the one participant in the intervention arm who deteriorated.

                  <p id="Par54">The third active ingredient was having time to talk. The clinic reported that an appointment in standard care took less than 8 min, compared with approximately 45 min in the intervention appointments; the qualitative data reflected this. In their meetings with the intervention nurses, participants had time dedicated to talking through their problems and concerns, and help articulating their needs:<disp-quote><p id="Par55"><italic>I am better because I was listened to; I was helped.

Advice and care planning could therefore focus on effectively addressing the root causes of their primary concerns:<disp-quote><p id="Par58"><italic>There is a difference, because here you have a lot of time to be with the doctor, to talk to him/her and to have them instruct you. But on the other side [in the standard care clinic], not that the nurses are unwilling, but you personally feel… “Ah there are others who are waiting to come in”.

                <title>Integration of findings</title>
                <p id="Par61">Participants in the intervention arm received more emotional support for themselves and their family, and had more time to talk about their worries (including spiritual concerns) and discuss the future. Their families also received more support with planning. Patients who received the intervention also received more weak opioids (codeine) and laxatives than those allocated to the control arm. Mental health improvement over the study period in the intervention group was significantly associated with receipt of spiritual discussions, paracetamol and anti-emetics, and negatively associated with receipt of morphine.</p>
                <p id="Par62">The qualitative and quantitative findings converge strongly, suggesting that appropriate and effective medication, effective health education and counselling, and increased time to talk in clinical encounters are associated with improvements in psychological well-being. Barriers to the effectiveness of the intervention were perceived intractable physical, social or psychological problems. The importance of holistic care is reflected in patient descriptions of benefit across physical, psychological and social domains.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par63">This study is an important contribution to our understanding of interventions to improve mental health and long term coping amongst PLWH, and of the value of mixed method approaches in the evaluation of complex interventions. Our findings strongly suggest that increased time taken in the structured intervention clinical encounter enabled the participants to talk about their problems in a way they had previously been unable to do. In addition, improved health education meant that medications were better understood and regimens therefore better adhered to.</p>
              <p id="Par64">Whilst effective medication, health education and counseling, and having time to talk were identified as active ingredients of the intervention, it is possible that the effects of medication and health education and counseling were mediated by having time to talk. This hypothesis suggests that the intervention offered opportunities for patients to reflect and gain health information, increasing insight and understanding, as well as to describe their symptoms in more detail, enabling healthcare providers to prescribe more accurately and effectively and hence provide better symptom relief. Our data suggested that a structured holistic approach with adequate time to deliver these integrated components is needed to ensure they are effectively delivered in a person-centred and participatory way.</p>
              <p id="Par65">Time to talk is often seen as unfeasible in busy clinics where the number of clients is rising due to the increasing life expectancy of PLWH and earlier initiation of ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, elsewhere, initial evaluation shows the use of peer mentors, expert clients or other trained health workers to alleviate common mental disorders holds promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This task-shifting approach frees up nurse contact time, whilst maintaining gains in psychological well-being. On the other hand, initial time to talk may be a time saving process, even in a busy clinic, as the benefits might prevent more time-intensive needs in the future. It is interesting that participants receiving usual care in this study also reported improvements in mental health, and attributed this to their interactions with the researcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par66">Our findings also highlight the benefits of conducting mixed-method explorations of process data alongside RCTs of complex interventions. A sole focus on the quantitative outcomes would not have identified the mechanisms through which the intervention was effective. The qualitative data also identified further therapeutic benefits attributed to the research process itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This exemplifies and supports the MRC guidance on process evaluation as an essential component of the evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The findings presented here improve our understanding of which components of this intervention should be implemented in clinical practice and studied in future research.</p>
              <p id="Par67">A limitation of the study is that it is not possible to clarify from the data the extent to which therapeutic benefit is attributable to either the content or the duration of the appointments with the intervention nurses. However, the qualitative data suggest that they cannot be mutually exclusive; effective intervention requires a structured person-centred approach with adequate time for delivery. There is also potential for our findings to be affected by recall bias as participants were asked to describe events from previous months. The exact nature of the discussions that were described as therapeutic by the intervention group and which contributed to the active ingredient of time to talk is not currently known. While both control and intervention groups received discussions about pain and symptoms, only the intervention group described these discussions as therapeutically beneficial.</p>
              <p id="Par68">Our findings indicate directions for further research to improve HIV care in resource-constrained settings. Research should further develop and evaluate sustainable and feasible models of care for PLWH in these settings, testing the effects of implementing the active ingredients we have identified and their applicability in other contexts. The effects on retention and adherence to treatment of integrating palliative care into routine services should also be evaluated. Should the active ingredients we have found effective be implemented, outcomes should be compared when it is delivered by staff with higher and lower qualifications, to evaluate whether it is in fact time saving in the long term to task shift.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par69">Based on our findings, we recommend a person-centred approach to routine outpatient care for people on ART, including implementation of sufficient time to talk, effective health education and counselling, and access to appropriate medication for PLWH to manage pain and symptoms. Integrating time to talk into the clinical encounter is particularly important given its potential mediating role, and could be provided by non-medical staff, in line with recommendations for improving retention and adherence in HIV care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This model may enable a more holistic approach to care in resource-constrained settings and relieve the psychological, physical and social burden experienced by PLWH.</p>
