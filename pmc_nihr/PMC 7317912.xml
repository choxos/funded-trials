              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has demonstrated clinical improvements in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), including signs, symptoms, and quality of life, and was generally well tolerated in the phase 3, randomized Psoriatic Arthritis Long‐term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE) 1, 2, and 3 studies <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Because apremilast is 1 of many therapies available for the treatment of PsA, a need exists to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to achieve optimal outcomes with apremilast treatment to help guide clinical practice. To address this, it is important to determine which patients are more likely to achieve treatment targets of remission or low disease activity (LDA) with apremilast.<boxed-text position="anchor" content-type="box" id="acr24134-blkfxd-0001" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance &amp; Innovations</title></caption><p><list list-type="bullet" id="acr24134-list-0001"><list-item><p>This study identified patients with moderate disease activity as having a higher probability of achieving and maintaining the Clinical Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (cDAPSA) treatment targets with apremilast compared with those with high disease activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Among patients with moderate disease activity at baseline, early and partial responses to apremilast were associated with a high probability of achieving treatment targets.</p></list-item><list-item><p>At a mean level, achievement of cDAPSA treatment targets with apremilast was associated with control of musculoskeletal (arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease) and nonmusculoskeletal domains and physical function.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text>
</p>
              <p>Treatment‐to‐target recommendations stipulate that the treatment target should be clinical remission or inactive disease of musculoskeletal (arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease) and nonmusculoskeletal domains of PsA <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. An alternative treatment target may be LDA or minimal disease activity. It is recommended that patients be offered regular evaluations and treatment adjustments if they are not achieving treatment targets associated with desirable long‐term outcomes <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. In addition, therapeutic decisions should be individualized and should account for complications from untreated active disease and from therapy <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>.</p>
              <p>A fundamental question that remains is how to identify the most appropriate instruments to monitor disease activity in patients with PsA who may have multiple manifestations in clinical practice. In this regard, treatment‐to‐target and American College of Rheumatology recommendations for PsA support the use of the Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) as a valid instrument to monitor the achievement of treatment targets among other treatment targets <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. A potential, inherent limitation associated with the DAPSA relates to its focus on articular features. The DAPSA uses a composite score based on swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), patient assessment of pain (PAP), patient global assessment of disease activity (PtGA), and C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels. A related measure, the Clinical DAPSA (cDAPSA), which excludes the CRP measurement, has been used in clinical practice <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Because the cDAPSA mainly focuses on articular manifestations, it remains to be determined whether patients who achieve these disease targets with apremilast could achieve comprehensive disease control across a wider range of disease manifestations that are not included in this measure, such as skin involvement, enthesitis, or dactylitis.</p>
              <p>In this study, we aimed to identify patients who are more likely to achieve the cDAPSA treatment targets of remission or LDA with apremilast using a pooled analysis of the PALACE 1, 2, and 3 studies. We also assessed the performance of the cDAPSA as an instrument to monitor the achievement of treatment goals by evaluating the extent of musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal disease control among patients achieving cDAPSA treatment targets with apremilast.</p>

Briefly, the studies enrolled adult patients (≥18 years of age at the time of consent) with active PsA of ≥6 months duration who met the Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis Study Group criteria and had ≥3 swollen and ≥3 tender joints despite treatment with prior conventional disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or biologics (prior therapeutic failure with tumor necrosis factor blockers was limited to ≤10% of enrolled patients). In PALACE 3, patients were also required to have active skin disease with ≥1 plaque psoriasis skin lesion that was ≥2 cm in size. Patients were excluded from the studies if they had experienced therapeutic failure of &gt;3 conventional DMARDs or biologic agents or &gt;1 tumor necrosis factor blocker therapy. The PALACE 1, 2, and 3 studies were approved by the institutional review boards at each investigational site and conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, as described in International Conference on Harmonisation guideline E6, and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>

                  <p>PALACE 1, 2, and 3 (NCT01172938, NCT01212757, and NCT01212770) were phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical trials with similar study designs, which have been previously described in detail <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. Briefly, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive apremilast 30 mg twice a day, apremilast 20 mg twice a day, or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to current DMARD use (yes/no) in all 3 studies and by psoriasis‐involved body surface area (&lt;3%/≥3%) in PALACE 3. Patients whose SJC and TJC had not improved by at least 20% at week 16 were considered nonresponders and either continued on the original apremilast dose or were re‐randomized from placebo to receive apremilast 30 mg twice a day or apremilast 20 mg twice a day. At week 24, all remaining placebo patients were re‐randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg twice a day or 20 mg twice a day, and double‐blind treatment continued to week 52. Upon completion of the 52‐week double‐blind treatment phase, patients were eligible to participate in a long‐term treatment extension phase (for up to 5 years of total follow‐up). Herein, we report the results from analyses of pooled data from PALACE studies 1, 2, and 3 that included patients who were randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg twice a day at baseline and who had available cDAPSA components to calculate responses.</p>

                  <p>The probability of achieving cDAPSA categories at week 52 was evaluated on the basis of baseline and week 16 cDAPSA categories. The cDAPSA was calculated as a composite score including SJC, TJC, PAP, and PtGA, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 154 <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. The cDAPSA disease activity categories were defined as follows: remission ≤4; LDA &gt;4 to ≤13; moderate disease activity &gt;13 to ≤27; and high disease activity (HDA) &gt;27 <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. To determine the extent of changes from baseline to week 16 in cDAPSA values associated with achieving the cDAPSA categories at week 52, mean changes in the cDAPSA values over time were assessed, and individual probabilities of treatment success were calculated.</p>
                  <p>To assess the value of the cDAPSA as an indicator of comprehensive clinical responses with apremilast, patients were grouped according to the cDAPSA categories achieved at week 52. Musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal domains of PsA were longitudinally assessed at baseline and at weeks 16, 24, 40, and 52 according to cDAPSA categories achieved at week 52. These domains included the cDAPSA and its core components (SJC [0–66], TJC [0–68]), the PAP visual analog scale (VAS) (0–100 mm) and PtGA VAS (0–100 mm), other musculoskeletal domains (enthesitis assessment, Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score [MASES; range 0–13], and dactylitis count [0–20]) and nonmusculoskeletal domains (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score [range 0–72]), as well as the physician global assessment of disease activity (PhGA) VAS (0–100 mm) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (range 0–3) assessments.</p>

                  <p>For the probability analyses, the cDAPSA shift categories and longitudinal data were analyzed in patients who had cDAPSA components available at baseline, following multiple imputations to account for those who discontinued or had missing values. Multiple imputations were repeated 30 times, each time with continuous cDAPSA missing data imputed and categorized, and shifts of cDAPSA categories from baseline to week 52 were averaged more than 30 times of multiple imputation. The multiple imputation and categorization procedures were repeated for shifts of cDAPSA categories from week 16 to week 52, separately for patients with moderate disease activity and with HDA at baseline. As a subset analysis to see the probability of achieving treatment target at week 52 for patients who showed partial response at an early time point, the procedure was repeated for patients who had ≥30% improvement in cDAPSA at week 16.</p>

Mean age, body mass index, and concomitant treatment with conventional DMARDs were generally similar for patients in all cDAPSA categories at week 52, and the percentage of female patients was lowest among those in remission at week 52 and highest among patients with HDA at week 52. Overall, patients across all cDAPSA categories at week 52 had moderate‐to‐severe disease at baseline, as defined by mean cDAPSA values.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The current analysis suggests that patients with moderate disease activity at baseline were more likely to achieve cDAPSA treatment targets of remission or LDA with apremilast 30 mg twice a day than patients with HDA scores at baseline. Approximately twice as many patients (46.9% versus 24.9%) who started with moderate disease activity at baseline achieved treatment targets compared with patients who started with HDA. Baseline characteristics provided limited discriminative ability to differentiate patients who were more likely to achieve treatment targets from those who were not. Importantly, an early and partial response by week 16 (cDAPSA improvement of ≥30%) was associated with a greater likelihood of achieving treatment targets by week 52. As a result, the absence of treatment response by week 16 would reinforce the need for a treatment adjustment. Taken together, these findings provide a framework of reference for the selection and monitoring of patients with the highest likelihood of achieving optimal treatment responses with apremilast in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>Another important objective of this analysis was to assess the relevance of the cDAPSA as an indicator of comprehensive treatment responses to apremilast. Because the cDAPSA includes SJC, TJC, PAP, and PtGA, whether achievement of cDAPSA treatment targets also represents achievement of control in other manifestations of PsA has not previously been fully examined. In this study, patients receiving apremilast who achieved cDAPSA treatment targets by week 52 also experienced improvements in musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal domains that are not directly captured by the cDAPSA. In fact, patients who achieved remission or LDA with apremilast had absent or mild musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal manifestations of PsA by week 52. This finding has important implications in validating the cDAPSA as a tool to monitor patients treated with apremilast in routine practice. Indeed, this suggests that for patients receiving apremilast, domains not measured by the cDAPSA follow a more comparable course of improvements than that included in the cDAPSA formula.</p>
              <p>This study is limited by the use of MASES to assess enthesitis because, unlike other enthesitis assessments (i.e., Leeds Enthesitis Index, Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Index), MASES only measures 1 peripheral enthesitis site, the Achilles tendon <xref rid="acr24134-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. In our study, it is possible that peripheral enthesitis may have been indirectly accounted for through the cDAPSA, which, by including the PAP and PtGA, constitutes an overall assessment of the disease presentation.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that patients with moderate disease activity at baseline have a higher likelihood of achieving optimal outcomes with apremilast compared with those with HDA at baseline. Early and partial responses by week 16 were associated with achieving long‐term treatment targets. Finally, the results support the use of the cDAPSA to monitor patients treated with apremilast given that domains not captured by the cDAPSA traveled in the same direction as the cDAPSA. At a population level, patients who achieved cDAPSA remission or LDA also had no or mild musculoskeletal and nonmusculoskeletal disease manifestations.</p>
