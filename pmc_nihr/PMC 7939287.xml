                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Delayed graft function (DGF) following renal transplantation is a manifestation of acute kidney injury (AKI) leading to poor long-term outcome. Current treatments have limited effectiveness in preventing DGF. Interleukin-18 (IL18), a biomarker of AKI, induces interferon-γ expression and immune activation. GSK1070806, an anti-IL18 monoclonal antibody, neutralizes activated (mature) IL18 released from damaged cells following inflammasome activation. This phase IIa, single-arm trial assessed the effect of a single dose of GSK1070806 on DGF occurrence post donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplantation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The 3 mg/kg intravenous dose was selected based on prior studies and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, indicating the high likelihood of a rapid and high level of IL18 target engagement when administered prior to kidney allograft reperfusion. Utilization of a Bayesian sequential design with a background standard-of-care DGF rate of 50% based on literature, and confirmed via extensive registry data analyses, enabled a statistical efficacy assessment with a minimal sample size. The primary endpoint was DGF frequency, defined as dialysis requirement ≤7 days post transplantation (except for hyperkalemia). Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>GSK1070806 administration was associated with IL18-GSK1070806 complex detection and increased total serum IL18 levels due to IL18 half-life prolongation induced by GSK1070806 binding. Interferon-γ−induced chemokine levels declined or remained unchanged in most patients. Although the study was concluded prior to the Bayesian-defined stopping point, 4/7 enrolled patients (57%) had DGF, exceeding the 50% standard-of-care rate, and an additional two patients, although not reaching the protocol-defined DGF definition, demonstrated poor graft function. Six of seven patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), including two treatment-related SAEs.</p>

                  <p>Overall, using a Bayesian design and extensive PBPK dose modeling with only a small sample size, it was deemed unlikely that GSK1070806 would be efficacious in preventing DGF in the enrolled DCD transplant population.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates 8–18% of hospital admissions, and an increasing body of evidence shows that these acute insults are associated with short- and long-term increases in healthcare cost, morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Delayed graft function (DGF), a consequence of AKI, is defined as the failure of a transplanted kidney to function immediately after transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and is associated with a long-term increased risk of kidney graft failure [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The rate of DGF in kidney transplant recipients varies between approximately 25% and 50% depending on the presence of risk factors, including donor age, cold ischemic time, and the cause of donor death [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. DGF is thought to occur as a result of ischemic renal injury associated with cellular hypoxia (depletion of adenosine triphosphate, loss of membrane potentials) and subsequent reperfusion, which initiates inflammatory cascades (formation of reactive oxygen species, immune cell stimulation, cytokine release and complement activation) [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The inflammasome can also be activated, leading to production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL18) that is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IL18, acting on its receptors, then induces synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFNγ), thereby mediating inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Clinical studies have shown that increases in urinary IL18 levels within the first few hours after cardiac surgery or kidney transplantation are associated with a higher risk of AKI development in native [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and transplanted [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] kidneys, respectively. Furthermore, elevated urinary IL18 levels are associated with long-term allograft dysfunction and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. More causal evidence of the role of IL18 in AKI comes from experimental rodent models of renal ischemic injury, in which IL18 neutralization and gene deletion are protective [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. IL18 induction may also play a role in acute rejection, as suggested by data showing that elevated levels of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines, IFNγ-induced protein 10 kD (IP10) and monokine induced by IFNγ (MIG), are predictive of acute rejection episodes [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indeed, IL18 was constitutively expressed in renal biopsies and serum IL18 was elevated in patients experiencing acute allograft rejection [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although machine perfusion or cooling of the donor have been suggested to provided reductions in the rate of DGF [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], there are no approved medicines for DGF treatment or prevention [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the rate of DGF following kidney transplant remains high at 25–50% [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As such, development of new therapies for the prevention of DGF remains a key unmet need. GSK1070806 is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody that binds with high affinity (Kd 46.0 pM) to neutralize the function of mature IL18 [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A single infusion of GSK1070806 was well tolerated up to the highest doses tested (10 mg/kg in healthy individuals and 3 mg/kg in obese individuals), where GSK1070806 treatment inhibited ex vivo stimulation of IFNγ production and natural killer surface marker expression in whole blood assays [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. GSK1070806 was also well tolerated in a phase II study in patients with type 2 diabetes, in which two doses of GSK1070806 were administered 28 days apart [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here we used a Bayesian sequential statistical methodology, in conjunction with a comprehensive contemporary renal transplantation dataset from the UK Transplant Registry, to design a small, single-arm study evaluating the potential for the anti-IL18 monoclonal antibody GSK1070806 to reduce DGF in donation after circulatory death (DCD) transplanted kidneys. Additionally, using a three-pillar approach [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we have applied detailed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling with associated sensitivity analyses to predict GSK1070806 plasma and tissue exposure, and the extent of target engagement at the sites of action considered relevant for the contribution of IL18 to DGF.</p>

                <p>The primary endpoint was incidence of DGF, defined by a requirement for dialysis within the first 7 days post transplantation (except for hyperkalemia during the first 24 hours). Secondary endpoints included assessments of graft function/survival (as measured by serum creatinine, urine output, dialysis events), acute rejection (biopsy-proven, rejection biomarkers), safety and tolerability of GSK1070806 in renal transplantation, and GSK1070806 PK/pharmacodynamics (PD).</p>

                <p>The DGF rate in DCD transplanted kidneys was established previously at approximately 50% [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and this was confirmed with contemporary registry data held by the UK National Health Service Blood and Transplant.

                <p>A Bayesian sequential analysis of efficacy data was planned to allow for the possibility of stopping early for success or failure in this single-arm study. The statistical impact of various sample sizes on type I error rates was explored for a background DGF rate of 50%, along with the power for detecting a targeted 35% DGF rate with the GSK1070806 experimental therapy. This represents a 30% relative reduction in DGF from the 50% background rate (<bold>S5 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>), is deemed to be clinically meaningful and predictive of a significant impact on clinical outcomes in any subsequent larger, late-stage clinical trials. Given the desire to minimize the number of patients in this proof-of-concept study, it was planned with a maximum number of 30 patients, which was considered a feasible sample size that could be recruited at a small number of clinical sites over a reasonable time period.</p>
                <p>Although a maximum cohort size of 30 was selected for this study, the actual number was determined based on patients’ sequential DGF outcomes. The sample size and decision criteria were selected to be adequately powered to detect the prespecified treatment effect and so there was a reasonable type 1 error rate in the event treatment was ineffective. The design yielded the probability of an erroneous “Go” decision of 0.139 when the GSK1070806 DGF rate is 50% (i.e., null hypothesis), and a probability of an appropriate “Go” decision of 0.659 if a DGF rate of 35% occurs <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g002">Fig 2A</xref>; S5 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref>)</bold>.</p>

                    <p>(A) Probability of a Go decision by DGF rate* (B) Sequential Go/No Go/Continue rule<sup>†</sup>. *At a maximum of 30 patients, this design yields the probability of a Go decision of 0.139 when the GSK1070806 DGF rate is 50% (i.e., null hypothesis) and 0.69 at what has been a clinically impactful GSK1070806 DGF rate of 35%. <sup>†</sup>The number in the first column indicates the number of patients who have completed study treatment. A sequential Go/No Go/Continue rule is based on the predictive probability of success. A high predictive probability (PP) of success means that GSK1070806 is likely to be efficacious by the end of the study given the observed data, whereas a low PP suggests that the treatment may not have sufficient activity. If the PP value &lt;2% (red region) the alternative hypothesis is rejected. If the PP is &gt;92% (green), the conclusion may be made that GSK1070806 has better efficacy than the standard of care. If the PP is 2–92% (white region), the trial will continue to the next interim or until reaching 30 completed patients. The sequential path observed in the study is represented by the orange line. Although the pathway ends in the white region, the decision to terminate the study was made as only 1 of the 7 patients completing study treatment was not on dialysis and had creatine &lt;400 μmol/L; this suggested that it was unlikely that GSK1070806 3 mg/kg reduced the risk of DGF.

                <p>“Success” at full enrolment was defined as 11 or fewer DGF events in 30 patients (&lt;37% DGF rate) with the outcome of the study depending on the DGF rate in the presence of GSK1070806 administration. With patient DGF status evaluated sequentially as each patient reached 7 days post transplantation, early success on the primary endpoint would be declared if the predictive probability of success was &gt;0.92 (i.e., 92% probability the eventual number of DGF events would be 11 or fewer if the study continued to full enrolment) and a failure would be declared on the primary endpoint if the predictive probability of success was &lt;0.02. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold> illustrates which events may trigger an early Go (success) decision as the predictive probability of success is &gt;0.92 (green box), and a No Go (failure) decision as the predictive probability of success is &lt;0.02 (red box).</p>

                <p>A PBPK modeling approach was used to estimate an appropriate IV dose of GSK1070806 [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in renal transplant recipients. Briefly, this technique uses physiological volumes (vascular, extracellular, and endosomal) and fluid flows (lymph/plasma) combined with mechanistic calculations of extravasation, binding, and neonatal Fc Receptor recycling to predict drug distribution and elimination. As part of the validation, verification was conducted in which, model-simulated plasma PK parameters were compared with measured PK from healthy volunteers, showing good agreement (<bold>S4 Supplementary Material, and S3 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>).</p>
                <p>The kidney interstitium was considered the critical site of action, as IL18 signaling on the basolateral receptors of the renal tubular epithelial cells is thought to mediate apoptotic signaling [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To simulate a worst-case scenario for achieving target suppression, all IL18 synthesis was assigned to the kidney interstitium as a zero-order reaction and was carried to plasma by lymphatics, and to a lesser extent diffusion into capillaries. The IL18 generation rate was adjusted to produce an IL18 plasma concentration of 835 pg/mL, which is consistent with the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of patients with DGF [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The degradation rate was set to achieve an IL18 half-life of 35 hours [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. GSK1070806 doses of 0.1–10 mg/kg were modeled (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s004">S1 Fig</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>) with the goal of identifying dose levels to achieve a &gt;90% reduction versus baseline in free IL18 levels in the kidney interstitium within 1–2 hours of kidney reperfusion post transplantation.</p>
                <p>Simulations of the 3 mg/kg dose indicated a rapid and robust decrease in free IL18 levels in the kidney interstitial space with &gt;80% reduction by 1 hour and &gt;90% achieved 2 hours post dose (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref></bold>). Maximum knockdown in free IL18 levels in the kidney of 96% was expected approximately 43 hours post dose, inhibition &gt;90% was maintained for 7 days (period of assessing the DGF primary endpoint), and &gt;85% target engagement was sustained through the simulated 28-day time course (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref></bold>). Use of the single 3 mg/kg dose provided a &gt;99% reduction in circulating (plasma) levels of free IL18 within minutes post dose and sustained over the following 28 days (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s004">S1 Fig</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>). The kidney interstitium is considered a difficult tissue to penetrate, so the extensive penetration modeled for the kidney suggests that GSK1070806 exposure should also be sufficient in other tissues if they are relevant for IL18 DGF pathophysiology.</p>

                <p>Of the seven patients enrolled, four exhibited DGF (<bold><xref rid="pone.0247972.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>). This outcome (57% DGF rate, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 25–90%) exceeded the 50% expected standard-of-care rate. The sequential path in <bold><xref rid="pone.0247972.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,</bold> represented by the orange line in the grid in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g002">Fig 2B</xref>,</bold> was as follows (note that patients were not evaluated in the same order as they were enrolled): no DGF (Patient 1), DGF (Patient 2), no DGF (Patient 3), DGF (Patient 5), no DGF (Patient 6), DGF (Patient 4), and DGF (Patient 7), with Patient 6 receiving dialysis for hyperkalemia. Only one of the seven patients (Patient 1) had creatinine levels &lt;400 μmol/L and did not require dialysis over the first 4 days. The posterior probability that &lt;30% of patients would experience DGF was 7% (95% CrI: 0–100%), and the posterior probability that &lt;50% of patients would experience DGF was 34% (95% CrI: 0–100%).</p>
                <p>Serum creatinine was elevated at baseline in all patients, ranging between 448 μmol/L and 996 μmol/L, and generally remained elevated over 6 days post transplantation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Overall, serum creatinine had decreased at 12 months in all patients, irrespective of the presence of DGF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and S4 Fig in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>).

There was some variability between patients in timeframe and extent of data collection: Patient 1, no data collected for Days 5 and 6; Patient 5, urine output was negligible during this period; Patient 7, urine output not recorded due to patient undergoing continued dialysis during this period. Any event occurring at any time within a calendar day was charted at that study day, e.g., for Patient 4, dialysis at Day 1 as shown on the chart may have occurred at any time point during Day 1. DGF, delayed graft function.</p>

                <p>Six (86%) patients experienced a total of 17 serious adverse events (SAEs) (<bold>S6 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>). The seventh patient enrolled developed an SAE of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest (non-fatal) intra-operatively. This event was considered unrelated to GSK1070806, as the patient had multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease and had been experiencing chest pain prior to transplantation. Subsequently, this patient also developed an SAE of visceral leishmaniasis not considered related to study treatment. Another patient experienced two SAEs, pneumonia and respiratory arrest, considered related to study treatment. In a further patient, an SAE of acute cellular rejection was observed at Day 57 and was considered unrelated to treatment, with a biopsy at Day 59 showing a borderline rejection result. All SAEs were resolved and no fatal SAEs occurred.</p>
                <p>All patients experienced ≥1 AE, most frequently anemia (5/7; 71%), constipation (4/7; 57%), diarrhea (3/7; 43%), and urinary tract infection (3/7; 43%). No AEs led to study withdrawal. Five patients experienced AEs considered related to GSK1070806 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0247972.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref></bold>), most commonly anemia (4/7; 57%), as well as several infections, including urinary tract infections, bacterial disease carrier, nail infection, pharyngotonsillitis, postoperative wound infection, purulent discharge, acute pyelonephritis, influenza, and lower respiratory tract infection. With the exception of the SAE of cardiac arrest, there were no clinically significant electrocardiography abnormalities during the study. While other clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were recorded during the study, they were as expected for this patient population.</p>

                <p>Histological assessments of biopsies taken approximately 45 minutes post reperfusion showed varying degrees of pre-existing pathology that may have contributed to the attenuated allograft function observed in this study.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, neutralization of IL18 with GSK1070806 was evaluated for the prevention of DGF following renal transplantation using a single-arm Bayesian sequential design. Four of seven patients (57%) satisfied the definition of DGF. Two further patients had high creatinine levels in the postoperative period, one of whom required dialysis for hyperkalemia, leaving only one of seven patients who was not on dialysis and with creatine &lt;400 μmol/L. Collectively, these data suggested that it was unlikely that GSK1070806 3 mg/kg reduced the risk of DGF. Based on this evidence, the trial was terminated.</p>
              <p>Several clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of novel investigational medicines on the incidence of DGF. These studies have been largely unsuccessful and require the recruitment of large numbers of patients using placebo comparator designs to evaluate efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Utilizing a Bayesian approach to minimize sample size reduces investment barriers to evaluating new therapies (both clinical trial resource and funding), exposes fewer patients to investigational medicines with limited safety profiles, and enables efficient decision making. Indeed, the novel Bayesian sequential approach in this study, using the background DGF rate determined from literature and confirmed with registry data formed the Go/No Go design, allowed for fewer patient exposures and avoided the need for a control arm. Each patient enrolled in this study had a varied risk for DGF at baseline based on their individual characteristics. This was accounted for as closely as possible when confirming the background DGF rate using registry data, in which only patients meeting the current clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria and treated at recruiting sites were used to confirm the 50% DGF background rate. From a development perspective, if this initial proof-of-concept study had indicated that there was the potential for GSK1070806 to reduce DGF, the results would have been confirmed in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.</p>
              <p>Consistent with the poor renal function in 6/7 patients in the study, urinary levels of NGAL and KIM1 were elevated post-transplant in all six patients for whom data were available. Urinary IL18 levels were low, except in two patients, whose elevated levels were observed immediately following or within 2 days post-transplantation. One possible explanation for the overall lower levels of urinary IL18 could be sequestration of IL18 within the kidney or circulation via formation of IL18-GSK1070806 complexes. Furthermore, urinary IL18 levels appear non-correlated with postoperative graft function, as the patient with the highest urinary IL18 level did not experience DGF.</p>
              <p>PD analyses showed serum levels of total IL18 and IL18-GSK1070806 complexes climbed rapidly following transplantation and remained high for a prolonged period, reflecting peripheral blood IL18 target engagement with GSK1070806 enhancing IL18 half-life. This is consistent with the first-in human study [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, serum levels of total IL18 in this study showed large variation between patients, especially by the end of the study. This is perhaps not surprising, given that the first-in-human study included relatively healthy participants, whereas the present study comprised a complex patient population. Extraneous factors may have been involved in the observed IL18 variability, such as visceral leishmaniosis infection in Patient 7 and pyelonephritis and rejection events in Patient 4.</p>
              <p>Although acute allograft rejection was not assessed directly in this study (e.g., via surveillance biopsies), an exploratory evaluation of the potential impact of GSK1070806 on acute allograft rejection was performed by measuring serum levels of IFNγ and IFNγ-inducible chemokines, IP10 and MIG, which are predictive of acute rejection episodes [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Levels of MIG in most patients were unchanged over the study and levels of IFNγ and IP10 initially declined in most patients following treatment, consistent with antagonism of IFNγ−induced Th1 cytokine responses and predicting a low probability of acute rejection occurrence. One case of acute rejection occurred (Patient 4; event considered unrelated to study treatment) with elevated levels of IP10, MIG and total IL18 corresponding to the rejection event. No rejection was observed in Patient 7 despite steady increases in IP-10 and MIG throughout the study, suggesting their elevated levels were associated with a different mechanism (e.g., long-term sequelae of visceral leishmaniasis).</p>
              <p>While these data indicate engagement in the circulation, they may not reflect GSK1070806 activity in the kidney interstitium, which could be the relevant site of action. By IHC of kidney biopsies, we were able to identify the presence of GSK1070806 outside of the renal vasculature, indicating that GSK1070806 did penetrate the transplanted kidney tissue. GSK1070806 selectively binds human mature IL18 with a high affinity (Kd = 46.0 pM at 37°C) and neutralizes its function [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but GSK1070806 has a much lower affinity for pro-IL18 (Kd = 46.7 nM at 37°C) (<bold>S7 Supplementary Material, S4 Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247972.s002">S1 File</xref></bold>). Therefore, we would not expect GSK1070806 to bind pro-IL18 at the anticipated GSK1070806 exposures in vivo. The IL18 antibody used for IHC labeling in renal biopsies from patients treated with GSK1070806 in this study does not differentiate between pro and mature IL18, so the observed staining results potentially include both forms. With just one post-dose biopsy from each patient, we are unable to eliminate the possibility of regional differences in drug distribution. Additional confounding factors include the small sample size, inter- and intra-sample variation, and the type of biopsy collected (3 wedge and 2 needle). Therefore, the IHC findings should be interpreted with caution: solely based on the IHC data we cannot conclude whether therapeutically relevant exposure was achieved within the kidney during acute reperfusion (as predicted by the PBPK modeling); we can conclude only that GSK1070806 was present along with pro and/or mature IL18.</p>
              <p>Achieving exposure within the interstitium of the kidney with sufficient rapidity to inhibit IL18 after kidney reperfusion was deemed of potentially critical importance in this study and triggered substantial modeling efforts prior to dose selection. Extensive sensitivity analyses completed using the PBPK modeling approach allowed us to confidently select the single GSK1070806 3 mg/kg IV dose level evaluated here for its ability to reduce the occurrence of DGF. Dose escalation to 10 mg/kg was considered following the lack of efficacy observed in this study. However, the PBPK modeling results predicted substantial IL18 inhibition in the first hours following transplantation at the 3 mg/kg dose, and it was considered unlikely that increasing exposure with the maximum dose previously tested (10 mg/kg) would improve efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247972.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Although the renal interstitium was hypothesized as the site of action for GSK1070806, if neutralization was only required in the circulation GSK1070806 at the 3 mg/kg dose was predicted to achieve &gt;99% IL18 suppression within minutes of administration. Note, plasma PK in this study was in line with that observed in the first-in-human study following administration of a single 3 mg/kg dose [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and a phase II study assessing GSK1070806 in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that IL18 neutralization occurred too late in the pathological process of DGF. Although we hypothesized that injury occurs upon reperfusion, it is possible that it occurs prior to transplantation, which could be an explanation for the lack of efficacy observed in this study. While it is possible that IL18 inhibition in donors prior to kidney removal or during organ transport (e.g., through a normothermic perfusion/preservation circuit) would have been beneficial in reducing risk of DGF, ethical and operational issues make these hypotheses difficult to evaluate and no such studies are planned.</p>
              <p>All patients reported AEs, and 6 of the 7 patients enrolled experienced SAEs; all SAEs were resolved and there were no fatalities. Overall, the AEs recorded were as expected for patients undergoing kidney transplantation; indeed, all patients had multiple comorbidities and suboptimal kidney function. Although most patients reported SAEs consistent with an unwell transplant population, only two of the SAEs, both occurring in one patient, were considered related to GSK1070806 (pneumonia and respiratory arrest). Relatedness was indicated due to the potential of the study drug to magnify immunosuppression. In addition to the drug-related SAE of pneumonia, other non-serious infections considered related to GSK1070806 occurred. One patient experienced a cardiac event, which was deemed unrelated to study treatment. This patient was found to have critical coronary stenoses on post-operative angiography, which suggested a chronic cause of cardiac complications. End-stage renal disease is associated with two-fold increase in risk of death from cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and, in the post renal transplant setting, cardiovascular disease is reported to be the leading cause of death with graft function (36.1%) [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In previous studies, GSK1070806 was well tolerated with no reported cardiac complications [<xref rid="pone.0247972.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247972.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, we cannot completely rule out a possible effect of the study drug in the observed cardiac event.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study does not provide data supporting efficacy of GSK1070806 in preventing DGF after DCD renal transplantation in the recruited this patient population. However, utilization of the novel Bayesian sequential study design enabled rapid decision making to not proceed further with the development of GSK1070806 for renal transplantation, and hence avoided excess exposure of patients to the investigational drug. Although we were not able to measure target engagement directly in the kidney interstitium, based on PBPK modeling and associated sensitivity analyses, we are compelled to think that the 3 mg/kg dose provided sufficient exposure in these patients; and that our negative clinical findings are due to a lack of efficacy in response to IL18 neutralization at the time of reperfusion, rather than poor exposure/target engagement with GSK1070806.</p>
