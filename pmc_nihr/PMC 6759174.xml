                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Suicide prevention is a global priority. Psychiatric hospitalization presents an opportunity to intervene positively with, for example, psychological therapies. However, evidenced-based suicide-prevention psychological treatments are rarely available on in-patient wards. Understanding staff engagement with research investigating suicide-prevention psychological treatments is crucial for their effective, efficacious, and pragmatic implementation. A pilot randomised control trial and feasibility study of Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy provided the opportunity for a qualitative investigation of staff experiences and views of a psychological intervention for people with suicidal experiences on psychiatric in-patient wards.</p>

                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>To investigate staff acceptability of Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy for psychiatric inpatients based on their perceptions of their experiences during the conduct of a clinical trial.</p>

                  <p>Transcribed audio-recordings of qualitative interviews and a focus group (n = 19) of purposively sampled staff from eight psychiatric wards were analysed using inductive Thematic Analysis.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Facilitators and barriers were identified for: i) the conduct of the research, and, ii) the suicide-prevention intervention (Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy). Research-related barriers comprised communication difficulties between staff and researchers, and increased staff workload. Research-related facilitators included effective staff/researcher relationships, and alignment of the intervention with organisational goals. Suicide-prevention intervention-related barriers comprised staffs’ negative beliefs about suicide which impacted on their referral of inpatients to the clinical trial, and staff perceptions of insufficient information and unfulfilled expectations for involvement in the therapy. Facilitators included staff beliefs that the therapy was beneficial for inpatients, the service and their own clinical practice.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Staff beliefs that ‘suicide-talk’ could precipitate suicidal behaviour resulted in covert gatekeeping and restricted referral of only inpatients judged as stable or likely to engage in therapy, which may not be those who could most benefit. Such threats to sample representativeness have implications for future therapy research design. The findings provide novel information for researchers and practitioners regarding the conduct of psychological treatment and research in psychiatric units.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Psychiatric inpatient fatalities account for between 3–5% of all suicide fatalities worldwide equating to 250 per 100,000 inpatient admissions [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Inpatient death by suicide is considered the most preventable of all suicides due to the 24 hour staff contact time with inpatients [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite this intensive contact time, 8% of UK patient suicides occur during psychiatric hospitalization, which can double to 16% within three months of discharge [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hence, there is an urgent need for evidence-based treatments to prevent avoidable suicide deaths among psychiatric inpatients. This is of the highest priority for policy makers, service providers, clinicians, service users and carers both globally [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and within the UK [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The primary function of mental health wards is purported to be the maintenance of inpatient safety by assessing and treating mental health problems [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main criteria for admission is risk of harm to self or others [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, suicidal behaviour is common in psychiatric wards where self-harm rates of up to 68.8% of inpatients has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Psychological therapy has an established evidence base for suicide prevention [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for the treatment of individuals who have suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours. However, provision of psychological treatment in inpatient settings is uncommon within the UK, where it is more likely to be offered post-discharge [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Within mental healthcare there is increasing awareness of the unsatisfactory gap between the existence of evidence-based treatments and their timely implementation into usual practice [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Paradoxically, psychiatric treatments lacking rigorous evaluation are delivered [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while treatments with demonstrated efficacy fail to be implemented [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Ingrained organisational cultures of resistance to change [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] that operate across all levels of mental health services [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] contribute to the difficulties of implementation of evidence-based treatments thereby preventing access by service users most in need [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>It is recognized that avoidance of failure to achieve translation of evidence-based treatments into clinical practice requires consideration during the initial planning stages of early feasibility / acceptability research [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is particularly important regarding ‘complex interventions’ such as psychological therapy treatments [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>One of the most important issues in translating the results of psychological treatment trials into clinical practice is that research trials may not reflect the real world environment of service users and clinicians. For example, research samples may be too homogenous [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; manualised protocols used in trials may not be applicable to everyday settings [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; and statistical significance may not equate to clinical significance [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>Clinicians’ perceptions that research lacks clinical credibility can be a barrier to implementation of evidence-based treatments [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] highlighting the importance of investigating staff acceptability during the development of new treatments [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This is especially important within psychiatric wards where complex contextual challenges exist [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Inpatient safety is of paramount importance to ward staff who are accountable for the care of large numbers of suicidal inpatients [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is especially important to investigate ward staff views and perspectives regarding implementation of a clinical trial of suicide-prevention psychological therapy because, i) changes to staff’s usual working practices are necessary regarding their essential co-operation with participant recruitment procedures and facilitation of therapy delivery, and ii) evidence of adversarial attitudes and beliefs around caring for suicidal inpatients has been documented [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Mixed-method research designs incorporating qualitative and quantitative research [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are recommended for the study of contextual factors [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We therefore conducted the INSITE study (Inpatient Suicide Intervention and Therapy Evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] comprising a pilot Randomised Clinical Trial (RCT) with nested qualitative work-streams to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a suicide-prevention psychological treatment (Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention therapy[<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] [CBSP]) for suicidal inpatients.</p>

Ward staff, as key stakeholders, are likely to be highly influential in terms of constraining or facilitating treatment innovation [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Accordingly, the qualitative study reported here aimed to investigate and understand the views of ward staff during the conduct of the INSITE pilot RCT that was carried out in eight mental health wards within a large NHS mental health trust in the North West of England, UK [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There were two goals: First, to understand staffs’ perceptions of their experiences during the conduct of a clinical trial in the complex and challenging setting of acute psychiatric wards. Second, to investigate staff views regarding acceptability of the provision of a suicide-prevention psychological therapy for suicidal inpatients.</p>

Information about this qualitative study was presented by the first author (YA) at ward meetings, via posters on information boards, and through existing staff email systems. Those interested were provided with further verbal and written information and allowed a minimum of 24 hours to consider participation. Written informed consent was provided prior to participation. All researchers involved in recruitment and data collection were trained in qualitative research, research governance, ethics, and adhered to study standard operating procedures. Ethical approval was granted from the National Research Ethics Service Committee, Lancaster, North West England, UK (13/NW/0504).</p>

Individual interviews were conducted by YA (n = 6) and KM (n = 4). The focus group was moderated by YA with assistance from KM and CH. All data collection occurred in private rooms in the participant’s workplace. Questions were designed to elicit information about staff expectations, views about provision of study information, and relationships and interactions with research staff. We also asked staff about their views of providing suicide-prevention psychological therapy for suicidal inpatients and invited views of any impact on inpatients who had received CBSP. Perceptions of how the research procedures and delivery of therapy had impacted on usual ward routines and workload were also sought. Staff were encouraged to suggest solutions to any challenges discussed and to freely introduce additional relevant topics that were not pre-defined in the interview schedule.</p>
                <p>Field notes detailing relevant contextual issues were made to aide later analysis.

                  <p>It was reported to be vital that ward staff could trust researchers and therapists to inform them of any heightened risk identified during research interviews or therapy. This was especially important as some staff were concerned that talking about suicide with researchers might increase inpatients’ suicide risk. Confidence that researchers and therapists would share any risk information with staff was viewed as an indicator of the quality of working relationships:</p>

                  <p>Researchers and therapists visited the ward to attend meetings, discuss participant recruitment, conduct research assessments or see inpatients for therapy. Despite that staff sometimes perceived this to be an intrusion, they, nevertheless, tolerated this understanding that such interactions were necessary. The manner by which researchers and therapists demonstrated empathy and understanding of the pressures facing ward staff during occasions when they were unable to make time for liaison was appreciated and perceived to be influential in maintaining constructive relationships:</p>

                  <title>(a) Gatekeeping to protect inpatients from harm</title>
                  <p>Researchers sought to recruit inpatients who met the study inclusion criteria of being aged 18 years or older; having mental capacity to provide consent; and experience of suicidal thoughts or behaviours during the past three months. However, during the qualitative investigations it became apparent that staffs’ referral decisions were based on a range of other factors external to the study eligibility criteria.</p>

                  <p>Staffs’ decisions regarding referral of inpatients to the study were influenced by their own views and judgements of who might benefit from therapy and who might become distressed or be de-stabilized by therapy rather than the study eligibility criteria. These included diagnosis, level of psychiatric symptom acuity and predictions of which inpatients would be interested and willing to engage in therapy;</p>

                  <p>Psychological therapy had not previously been available to inpatients in the wards where this study took place. Hence, beliefs that therapy was essentially a community treatment and was unsuitable for acutely unwell inpatients were evident:</p>

                  <p>When ‘suicide-talk’ was instigated by an inpatient, staffs’ usual practice comprised conversational techniques to distract and curtail such talk;</p>

                  <p>Therapy for suicide prevention was recognised to fulfil an unmet need in current service provision for suicidal inpatients.

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>This is the first study to present a detailed analysis of psychiatric ward staff experiences and perspectives of delivery of a suicide-prevention psychological therapy for suicidal inpatients (CBSP). Our results advance new knowledge of value to psychological therapy researchers, practitioners and policy makers of: 1) the particular contextual factors that can inhibit or enable the successful conduct of psychological intervention research in acute psychiatric ward settings, and 2) how the role, beliefs and priorities of ward staff can impact to either facilitate or impede the provision of suicide-prevention psychological therapy for suicidal inpatients.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec048">
                <title>Staff role and beliefs</title>
                <p>Staff perceive working with suicidal inpatients as stressful, with some having experienced considerable distress and trauma following experiences of inpatient suicide [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is, therefore, understandable that staff behaved risk-aversely in referring only those inpatients judged as stable and less likely to engage in suicidal behaviour to the INSITE trial. Reticence to initiate conversations about suicide may also have deterred some staff from providing initial information to suicidal inpatients about the INSITE study.</p>
                <p>Initiatives requiring staff to change their behaviour, as required for implementation of a novel psychological therapy, will be affected by their expectations of the value of the novel intervention [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, it was important to examine staff views regarding the expected value of CBSP. We found mixed views. Some staff, whilst initially sceptical, became impressed following observed improvements in patients who were receiving CBSP. For others, the secondary effects from their interactions with the therapist led to positive expectations of the value of CBSP. Staff perceived that interactions with the therapist enabled them to acquire a greater understanding of the idiosyncratic psychological influences underpinning the suicidal behaviour of inpatients under their care. Such psychological formulation based insights thereby empowered staff to engage in more professionally rewarding and meaningful interactions with inpatients.</p>
                <p>However, our results also revealed negative views of the expected value of CBSP as some ward staff feared that talking about suicide could ‘trigger’ suicidal behaviour. Similarly, staffs’ concerns of increased workload should inpatients experience post-therapy distress may also have contributed to negative expectations of the consequences of CBSP. Such views have previously been documented[<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and may explain staff gatekeeping resulting in restricted referral behaviour due to their concerns that CBSP may cause distress and provoke relapse. This is consistent with prior research purporting gatekeeping to be motivated by attempts to shield vulnerable patients from exposure to the perceived threats of a research intervention that clinicians lack confidence in [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
                <p>Staff accounts also described perceptions of inadequate knowledge of the structure and process of CBSP, which may also have impacted on their ability to make informed judgements of its expected value. Potentially then, intuitive beliefs may have dominated resulting in reluctance to refer inpatients to the trial to avoid exposing vulnerable suicidal inpatients to an intervention which staff knew little about and believed could increase suicide risk.</p>
                <p>Inpatient nursing activity is largely defined by pressures and events beyond the control of the staff [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] who, despite being charged with the serious responsibility of caring for suicidal inpatients, have limited control over ward life. Our research protocol required that staff initiate discussions with inpatients to provide information about INSITE and gain consent for researchers to meet them to give further information about the trial. However, situations characterised by organisationally defined priorities with inadequate staffing and unpredictable workloads would suggest challenges to staffs’ perceptions of control regarding their ability to find the time and the confidence to talk with inpatients about suicide. Similarly, staffs’ fears that inpatients could become distressed following therapy and subsequently require additional support may have triggered concerns related to staffing resources and skill deficits.</p>
                <p>Staff imposition of unofficial additional eligibility criteria could potentially have threatened the external validity of results if this had continued undiscovered in a definitive trial. However, paradoxically a sample more closely reflective of those inpatients that clinicians’ would deem suitable to receive the intervention (i.e., a ‘real-world’ population) could more closely resonate with clinical practice [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is because, had access to the therapy been delivered in the context of a commissioned service, rather than as a research intervention, referral of inpatients would occur at ward team meetings where broader discussion of service resource use and individual patient factors may be justified.</p>
                <p>Consistent with our ‘contextualist’ [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] assumptions the results of the current study confirmed a commitment by staff to improving the treatment of suicidal inpatients, which was a fundamental facilitator for our study. An unexpected positive consequence was that some staff instigated changes to individual and ward level practices based on ideas arising from the study. For example, liaison with INSITE researchers and therapists, who were confident and comfortable to talk about suicide, provided a positive ‘modelling’ effect leading to staff emulating the more direct questioning style used by researchers to ask about suicidal thoughts or behaviour when conducting risk assessments.</p>

                <title>Impact of ward culture</title>
                <p>It is important that researchers understand the real-world contextual challenges specific to conducting research in psychiatric wards which are typically chaotic and unpredictable environments [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] Workforce instability is cited as a barrier to implementation of psychological approaches in psychiatric settings [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and rapid staff turnover certainly inhibited our ability to form sustainable relationships with key clinicians.</p>
                <p>Staff are accustomed to working in ‘fire-fighting’ mode to get themselves and the inpatients safely through their present shift [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Whilst appreciating the complex personal, environmental and organisational challenges experienced by ward staff, such ‘short-termism’ presents challenges to conducting inpatient psychological therapy research and to improving the quality and efficacy of current treatments for suicidal inpatients.</p>
                <p>Working in such stressful unstable conditions, staff understandably, prioritised ward management before the needs of researchers. However, as our results demonstrated, it was possible to negotiate and agree workable research procedures with staff, although ward preferences were idiosyncratic rather than global.</p>

                <title>Psychological therapy and inpatient settings</title>
                <p>The difficulties of integrating psychological approaches into usual psychiatric ward practice has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, our results revealed surprisingly high levels of staff support for the introduction of CBSP, which could have been expected to challenge some traditionally held beliefs and practices. For example, ward purpose and culture prioritises rapid discharge achieved by containment and stabilisation of acute symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] rather than longer duration approaches (e.g., psychological therapy) to address the generic drivers of hospitalization. Distress is typically suppressed by sedative medication as opposed to psychological approaches enabling inpatients to discuss and find meaning from their experiences [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Psychological therapy is not commonly provided in acute psychiatric wards, although such therapies may be suggested for post-discharge referral [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, little is known about how staff would make decisions about referral to ward-based psychological therapy. In community settings the referral decisions of General Practitioners were found to be influenced by the clinician’s judgement of patient factors including the patient’s demand, motivation, insight, ‘psychological mindedness’, intelligence, education and the clinician’s prediction of the patient’s reliability of attending sessions [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Further research to investigate referral decision pathways for psychological therapy by inpatient staff is indicated.</p>
                <p>Compatibility of a novel intervention with the organisation’s values and performance targets is recognised to be beneficial to staff uptake [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The compatibility of CBSP with local suicide prevention strategies may have been a contributory factor to staff engagement with the research, as despite additional workload pressures, staff generally welcomed and showed enthusiasm for CBSP.</p>
                <p>Similarly, staff perceptions of positive collegial relationships with researchers and therapists appeared to be associated with the shared ‘burden’ of negotiating the challenges of preventing inpatient suicide. This may have exerted a buffering effect in countering some of the effects of increased staff workload. Staff accounts alluded to flaws in current models of suicidal inpatient treatment, valuing the involvement of the therapist, which provided some reassurance that therapy-arm suicidal inpatient participants’ were receiving a specific suicide prevention treatment not otherwise available.</p>

              <sec id="sec051">
                <title>Real world clinical practice versus research practice</title>
                <p>Staff discussed how their custodial role inhibited inpatients from disclosing suicidal thoughts or behaviours to them. This is corroborated by research of suicidal inpatients’ perspectives depicting their fears that disclosure of suicidality would prevent their desired discharge [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Hence, the combined impact of staff reluctance to engage in discussion about suicide and with suicidal inpatients’ reluctance to disclose suicidal thoughts to staff, suggests that staff are unlikely to be fully aware of which inpatients are suicidal. This highlights the need to consider participant recruitment procedures that do not rely solely on referral by ward staff. Under-recruitment to suicide intervention research is problematic [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and when compounded by clinician gatekeeping [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] raises concerns about the external validity of some existing suicide intervention research where such factors may not have been considered.</p>
                <p>Staff misinterpretation of their role by referring inpatient participants based on their own professional concerns rather than the research protocol defined criteria has serious implications for scientific rigour and is another example of the challenges of implementing standard RCT design for psychological therapy research in psychiatric ward settings [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We may have overestimated staff’s understanding of how the research processes necessary to maintain the parameters of a single-blind RCT of a novel treatment differ from those applicable when introducing a new commissioned service.</p>
                <p>By striving to uphold the scientific principles of RCT design [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] that required controlling conditions so that outcomes could be confidently attributed to intervention effects, contact between the therapist and ward staff was limited to essential communication of disclosure of suicide risk. An unintended consequence was that staff desires for collaboration and active involvement in therapy patients’ treatment was thwarted. So, although staff desire to be actively involved in the therapy was a positive <italic>facilitator</italic>, paradoxically, the resultant unfulfilled expectations became a <italic>barrier</italic> to staff acceptance of the intervention. This may also have compounded staff perceptions of lack of control to fulfil their responsibility to maintain inpatients’ safe yet feeling excluded from a potentially ‘risky’ suicide-prevention treatment.</p>
                <p>Similarly, whilst it was positive that staff were interested and requested training about psychological approaches to suicide prevention, this was withheld during the conduct of the trial to avoid confounding influences on trial outcomes. Arguably, additional training and any resulting changes in staff behaviour could confuse interpretation of whether RCT outcomes were attributable to CBSP, or to a ‘whole systems’ intervention comprising CBSP plus staff training. The latter may actually be a better approach for generating research, which, by more closely emulating real-world practice, is more likely to achieve translation into practice [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. A potential solution to such challenges may be to consider alternative research designs for future ward-based psychological therapy research. In psychiatric research where standard RCT design was impractical, or threatened by contamination effects, pragmatic and standard cluster randomised controlled trials have been successfully implemented [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] including in inpatient settings [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p>This is the first study involving an in-depth investigation into how the role, perceptions and practices of psychiatric ward staff impact on the acceptability of introduction of a suicide-focused psychological treatment for suicidal inpatients. Our results, by illuminating the key barriers and facilitators, offer psychological interventionist researchers / clinicians specific guidance regarding the development and delivery of psychological interventions within psychiatric inpatient settings, which has hitherto been lacking. Flexibility within our research design by offering the choice of attendance at an individual interview or focus group facilitated good recruitment from ward staff whose clinical demands presented challenges to uptake. In addition to the pragmatic benefits, choice of interview mode also allowed for staffs’ idiosyncratic preferences of enhanced confidentiality within 1:1 interviews, or for the peer support and group cohesion found in focus groups which can facilitate revelation of contentious views [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>At the time when this study was conducted the host psychiatric facility served populations from the geographical area with the highest suicide rate in UK [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and the fourth most socio-economically deprived area in England UK [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Population and service complexity may suggest that the views and perspectives of staff in this study which was confined to one NHS mental health facility could differ from those in other organizations with lower concentrations of suicidal patients, more stable workforces and different contextual factors.</p>
                <p>All three interviewers were female and interviewees mainly comprised female nurses, therefore the views expressed may be influenced by gender and professional orientations. However, nurses are arguably the most influential stakeholder group regarding the introduction and evaluation of ward-based innovations and the participant sample reflected the typical ward workforce. Psychiatrists, who hold particular status in seniority and authority within wards, were underrepresented, hence it would be important to ensure greater inclusion in future research. As staff self-selected it is possible that those who participated held more positive views than others not represented, therefore the barriers to introduction of CBSP may be underestimated.</p>
                <p>A further limitation is that this study was conducted by the researchers who were conducting the trial which may have inhibited staff from divulging their genuine views. Similarly, it is possible that our affiliation with the trial may have biased our interpretations of the data. However, we did explicitly encourage staff to give feedback of negative experiences and to suggest improvements and this strategy was successful as staff did inform us about many barriers.</p>

                <title>Recommendations</title>
                <p>In terms of staffs’ referral of inpatients to the RCT, and based on their views that they were not given sufficient information about CBSP, it would have been beneficial to invest greater resources in provision of information about the therapy to improve staffs’ knowledge and confidence in the intervention. The provision of information about the therapy, qualifications and skills of therapists, and also of the extensive safety protocols built around therapy delivery should be included in discussions as this may offer staff more confidence to refer in accordance with the study eligibility criteria. Further, an explicit negotiated protocol regarding sharing of risk-pertinent information between staff and researchers may be of mutual benefit. Discussions with ward staff should take a proactive stance to exploring potential fears about increasing suicidal inpatients’ risk by talking about suicide as this opens the opportunity to counter such concerns with research evidence [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].</p>
                <p>As provision of psychological therapy is uncommon within inpatient settings little is known of how ward staff make decisions regarding referral of inpatients. This would therefore be an important area to study in the future.</p>
                <p>In terms of research practice in psychiatric wards the potential for contamination effects and the challenges of recruitment strategies that rely solely on ward staff to refer participants indicates the need for careful choice of appropriate research methods and designs. It is also important to be aware that clinical staff may be unfamiliar with research practice. Therefore, provision of information should include explanations of the need to obtain a representative sample strictly in accordance with specified eligibility criteria.</p>
                <p>Staff suggested some solutions to improve communication and liaison practices including adoption of existing approaches used by other visiting professionals comprising advance booking of regular meeting dates. Other suggestions included attendance at weekly multi-disciplinary ward meetings by researchers, and liaising with the inpatient’s ‘named-nurse’ rather than any nurse available. However, our experience indicated extensive variations of preferred approaches across wards, therefore further research is required to find effective methods of communicating with large numbers of constantly changing staff populations across several locations.</p>
                <p>Staffs’ essential role within the INSITE trial required their willingness, motivation and ability to change their usual work behaviours to support the recruitment and care of research participants. This study did not set out to examine staff change behaviour from a behaviour change theory perspective, however on post-hoc reflection it appears that some findings may map onto concepts within theories such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222482.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], which has previously been applied within suicide research [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p>
                <p>The TPB [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] suggests the importance of an individual’s normative beliefs regarding the expectations of important others (i.e., their managers). In this respect it may have been beneficial if staff had experienced greater support and encouragement from their senior managers to make explicit the organization’s formal commitment to the study, including their investment of significant funds in support of the study. Potentially, this may have encouraged staff cooperation by legitimizing use of their time for research related activity. However, this may have had limited impact if not practically supported by provision of additional staffing resources. It may be helpful to consider a more detailed examination of behavioural change factors in future studies.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study aimed to understand ward staffs’ perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to introduction of ward-based CBSP therapy in the context of a clinical trial. Our results illuminated the real-world contextual challenges that impact on: i) the conduct of psychological research in psychiatric wards, and ii) staff acceptability of delivery of ward-based CBSP. Conducting a pilot clinical trial in psychiatric wards was achievable although was hampered by staffs’ reluctance / inability to find time to engage with researchers. This may be reflective of the lack of a research culture, as despite NHS rhetoric purporting the importance of clinical research [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], staff viewed research as somewhat divorced from clinical practice. Overall, our findings indicated that despite concerns regarding potential workload challenges, and the philosophical opposition of some ward staff, the introduction of CBSP therapy was generally welcomed. The scale and depth of such highly impactful data gained from this qualitative study confirms the value of conducting acceptability / feasibility studies prior to definitive trials of novel interventions [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As researchers we cannot rectify the reality of the unpredictable, often chaotic nature of everyday life in psychiatric wards, however, the results of this qualitative study have provided us with knowledge of the modifiable challenges that can be pre-empted and addressed in future research.</p>
              <p>The beliefs of some staff that talking about suicide is harmful reflect systemic failings fuelled by inadequate educational preparation of mental health staff and resource deficient service delivery models. Such organisationally driven ward practices neither value nor resource staff time to talk with suicidal inpatients. The prevailing organisational goals within psychiatric wards of stabilisation of acute distress and rapid discharge are neither clinically nor cost effective, as repetition of suicidality is common, often necessitating re-admission and / or more intensive community services. The escalation of post-discharge suicide rates and the displacement of numerical statistics, but not actual suicide deaths, from inpatient settings to community crisis-intervention services [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] mainly illuminates the difficulties of preventing suicide in community settings rather than the increased success of treating suicidal inpatients. Effective interventions are urgently needed and psychological treatments, which are currently underexploited, demonstrate potential warranting further research [<xref rid="pone.0222482.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p>
