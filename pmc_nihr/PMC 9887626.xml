                  <p>To analyze the impact of modern glucose-monitoring strategies on glycemic and patient-related outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and recent myocardial infarction (MI) and assess cost effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>LIBERATES was a multicenter two-arm randomized trial comparing self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM), also known as flash CGM, in individuals with T2D and recent MI, treated with insulin and/or a sulphonylurea before hospital admission. The primary outcome measure was time in range (TIR) (glucose 3.9–10 mmol/L/day) on days 76–90 post-randomization. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included time in hypoglycemia, hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), clinical outcome, quality of life (QOL), and cost effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Of 141 participants randomly assigned (median age 63 years; interquartile range 53, 70), 73% of whom were men, isCGM was associated with increased TIR by 17 min/day (95% credible interval −105 to +153 min/day), with 59% probability of benefit. Users of isCGM showed lower hypoglycemic exposure (&lt;3.9 mmol/L) at days 76–90 (−80 min/day; 95% CI −118, −43), also evident at days 16–30 (−28 min/day; 95% CI −92, 2). Compared with baseline, HbA<sub>1c</sub> showed similar reductions of 7 mmol/mol at 3 months in both study arms. Combined glycemic emergencies and mortality occurred in four isCGM and seven SMBG study participants. QOL measures marginally favored isCGM, and the intervention proved to be cost effective.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>Compared with SMBG, isCGM in T2D individuals with MI marginally increases TIR and significantly reduces hypoglycemic exposure while equally improving HbA<sub>1c</sub>, explaining its cost effectiveness. Studies are required to understand whether these glycemic differences translate into longer-term clinical benefit.</p>

              <p>Cardiovascular disease remains the main cause of mortality in patients with diabetes, and these individuals have worse prognosis after myocardial infarction (MI) than patients with normal glucose metabolism (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The observed inferior clinical outcome in diabetes is particularly pronounced in insulin-treated patients (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>After a coronary event, short- and medium-term glycemic targets in patients with diabetes are not clear, which was highlighted as a knowledge gap in both the 2015 and 2020 combined European Society of Cardiology/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The more recent guideline further added the importance of avoiding hypoglycemia, while acknowledging that more work in this area is needed.</p>
              <p>In patients with MI, hyperglycemia is associated with worse prognosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The DIGAMI-1 (Diabetes Mellitus Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction-1) study demonstrated that intensive glucose control after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with reduction in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and significantly lower mortality (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, DIGAMI-2, investigating different treatment regimens, failed to show significant differences between study arms (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although not statistically significant, there were numerically more deaths in the intervention arms, particularly in insulin-treated patients, raising an early concern over the potentially detrimental effect of hypoglycemia.</p>
              <p>Glycemic outcome studies in MI patients have usually relied on HbA<sub>1c</sub> for assessment of glycemic control, but hypoglycemia, which HbA<sub>1c</sub> fails to detect, is also associated with adverse vascular outcome (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Moreover, hypoglycemia can cause significant distress to patients, impairing quality of life (QOL) and compromising daily activities (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have shown associations with increased thrombosis potential, manifesting as impaired fibrinolysis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), an important marker of adverse outcomes after ACS (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These findings provide mechanistic explanations for the adverse clinical outcomes observed with extremes of blood glucose.</p>
              <p>In order to optimize glycemic control in diabetes, individuals are asked to regularly perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). However, this is inconvenient and may lead to anxiety and impaired QOL (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), particularly in the stressful post-MI period. Another approach to monitoring glycemia relies on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), but the cost effectiveness of rolling this out across the entire type 2 diabetes (T2D) population has not been demonstrated (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>We hypothesized that a modern glycemic-monitoring strategy optimizes glucose control in individuals with T2D after MI and improves QOL. Therefore, the LIBERATES (Improving Glucose Control in Patients With Diabetes Following Myocardial Infarction: Role of a Novel Glycaemic Monitoring Strategy) trial was designed to investigate the effects of intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM), also known as flash CGM, on glycemic control and QOL measures in patients with T2D after acute MI, while also analyzing the cost effectiveness of this strategy. Given the association between low glucose and adverse vascular outcome, T2D individuals at increased hypoglycemic risk were studied.</p>

                <p>LIBERATES was a phase 2 parallel-group open-label, randomized controlled trial investigating the role of isCGM compared with standard SMBG in glycemic control and QOL in individuals with acute MI and T2D who were already receiving therapies that may result in hypoglycemia. Favorable ethical approval for the trial was received in June 2017 (Integrated Research Application System 223768; Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, Leeds, U.K.). The study design was previously published (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Briefly, inclusion criteria were: adult patients age ≥18 years, with preadmission diagnosis of T2D receiving treatment with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin (in addition to or without other hypoglycemic agents); MI was defined as symptoms of cardiac ischemia associated with a typical rise in troponin levels using the 99th percentile threshold (individuals with ST-elevation MI and non–ST-elevation MI were eligible). Exclusion criteria were active malignancy, other than localized squamous cell or basal cell skin carcinoma, known pregnancy, renal dialysis, inability to follow study instructions, or considered unsuitable for trial participation by the treating clinician/nurse. Patients with a permanent pacemaker were initially excluded but were subsequently allowed to participate after an ethics amendment (April 2019).</p>

                <title>Statistical Considerations</title>
                <p>Given the absence of CGM studies in individuals with diabetes and recent MI, the LIBERATES trial adopted a probability-based likelihood, Bayesian approach (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which allows decisions to be made based on prespecified levels of the probability of therapeutic activity. The probability that the mean difference in TIR per day (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) between isCGM and SMBG is greater than zero was calculated from the posterior probability distribution, under a prespecified range of prior distributions. A recommendation for isCGM was based on achieving at least 80% posterior probability, approved by members of the independent trial oversight committee.</p>
                <p>Simulations assumed 9- and 14-day availability of complete data on patient/sensor, a mean TIR of 13.3 h in the control group, with intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.75 for time per day within participants and within and between participant variances of 10.97 and 32.90, respectively, based mainly on previously published data in individuals with T2D with no recent MI (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). SEs of the treatment comparison and the mean of the posterior probabilities of a positive effect (conditional on a true increase of 1.5, 1, or 0.5 h in favor of the intervention) were obtained from multilevel random effects mixed models in 1,000 simulated data sets.</p>
                <p>Simulations demonstrated that, with 75 participants per arm providing complete data, the expected posterior probability of the intervention arm being better than control would be 95.8%, under an uninformative prior. With 20% loss to follow-up, the expected posterior probability would be 93.9%, with the same distribution and assumed true difference.</p>
                <p>Statistical analyses followed a prespecified analysis plan in line with published guidance (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The primary outcome measure, TIR each day during days 76–90, was analyzed and interpreted within the Bayesian framework. The primary analysis used uninformative prior distributions for all parameters in the model, with sensitivity analyses considered a range of more informative priors, based on published data. The primary analysis was conducted on day measurements that had at least 80% of sensor readings complete (equivalent to 19 of 24 h recorded). Sensitivity analyses relaxed this to include day measurements with at least 65% of sensor readings (equivalent to 16 of 24 h recorded).</p>
                <p>Analyses were conducted using a hierarchical longitudinal model, comprising random intercepts for participants and centers and random slopes for time, as well as fixed effects for intervention arm, insulin use, and time. The mean TIR for each patient was obtained and included in a linear regression model, adjusting for fixed effects of insulin and mean baseline glucose level and random intercept effects for randomizing center to allow comparison with other published trials using this approach.</p>
                <p>For secondary glycemic outcome measures, including hypoglycemia (days 16–30 and 76–90) and TIR (days 16–30), hierarchical longitudinal linear regression models were constructed as detailed above. Analyses of secondary outcome measures based on a single measurement at day 91 (HbA<sub>1c</sub>, blood pressure, weight, and patient-reported outcome measures) were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted for baseline values, randomizing center, and baseline insulin use. Safety outcomes were assessed using summary statistics because of the lower-than-expected frequency of events.</p>

                <title>Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Plan</title>
                <p>For estimation of long-term cost effectiveness, two different models were used. The first used the previously developed UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) economic outcomes (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), which fail to take into account hypoglycemic exposure. Therefore, we also used the Markov model, which allows the inclusion of hypoglycemia; as per international guidance, a hypoglycemic event captures the impact of nonsevere hypoglycemia (level 1 [&lt;3.9 mmol/L] and level 2 [&lt;3.0 mmol/L]) as well as severe hypoglycemia requiring third-party intervention (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), in terms of cost and QOL. Cost effectiveness was estimated by combining the UKPDS and Markov models.</p>
                <p>In terms of expenditure, the UKPDS model estimates long-term costs of diabetes; costs of hypoglycemic events were obtained from Health and Social Care, including the Personal Social Services Research Unit, and device costs were provided by the manufacturer. Costs were updated to 2020 using the Office of National Statistics gross domestic product deflator index. The UKPDS model estimates long-term quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on an initial utility value, estimated in the trial. Utility losses resulting from hypoglycemic events were obtained from the literature (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p>
                <p>The base case scenario assumes that isCGM is used continuously during the first 3 months (trial duration), after which patients will use three sensors per year (one every 3 months) for life, while using SMBG testing outside these periods. Cost effectiveness was determined based on an assumption of £20,000 per QALY gained using 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations to account for the uncertainty of the parameter values and estimate the net monetary benefit (NMB) (NMB = QALYs ∗ £20,000 in costs). Cost effectiveness was determined via the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the incremental NMB, with the latter being used when a particular intervention dominated (more effective and less costly).</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to investigate an alternative glucose-testing strategy in individuals with T2D after acute MI. The planned analysis was novel because glucose traces were analyzed as individual patient-level daily readings, allowing for more detailed and robust analysis. The work shows that isCGM use was associated with a marginal increase in TIR compared with SMBG, mainly related to significantly lower hypoglycemic exposure. Both isCGM and SMBG were associated with a meaningful reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, but isCGM achieved this with less hypoglycemia both early and late after MI, explaining its cost effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Despite the high stress level after ACS, our trial shows that patients with T2D and recent MI are ready to embrace new glycemic monitoring strategies, with a relatively high retention rate of 83%, which is close to previously published results in T2D without an acute medical illness (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Moreover, there was a high level of engagement supported by good and consistent glucose scanning frequency, which was only marginally lower than that in the T2D group without a recent acute vascular event (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
              <p>Using a stringent 80% coverage of glucose data per day, the primary outcome measure, TIR during days 76–90, showed an average 17-min difference between the isCGM group and SMBG group. When criteria were relaxed to include glucose coverage of 65% per day, the difference between study arms increased to 28 min in favor of isCGM. Neither of these two planned analyses reached the predefined posterior probability cutoff of 80%, suggesting a marginal effect for the intervention on TIR. However, a prespecified secondary outcome, TIR at the earlier time point of 16–30 days, suggested an advantage of the intervention over standard SMBG, mainly seen in those receiving insulin therapy at baseline. Therefore, isCGM seems to offer the possibility of rapid improvement in glycemia after ACS, which may have two important clinical implications. First, evidence shows an association between elevated glucose level immediately after ACS and adverse clinical outcome (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, early improvement in glycemia, particularly if hypoglycemia is avoided, has the potential advantage of improving outcomes in this high-risk population. Second, patients with ACS and diabetes who require surgical intervention for their coronary disease may benefit from isCGM to quickly optimize glycemia before surgery, with the potential to improve postsurgical outcomes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Studies have linked hypoglycemia to adverse clinical outcomes (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), explaining the recent emphasis on avoidance of low-glucose levels, particularly in patients with diabetes at high vascular risk (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). We found a difference of &gt;1 h/day in hypoglycemic exposure (defined as glucose &lt;3.9 mmol/L) comparing trial arms at days 76–90, which is highly likely to be clinically important (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)), particularly given guidance suggesting minimizing hypoglycemia in such populations to less than 15 min/day (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). This was also evident at days 16–30, and therefore, the beneficial effect of isCGM on hypoglycemia is both an early and sustained finding and applies to those receiving a sulphonylurea or insulin at enrollment.</p>
              <p>Both groups showed a clinically meaningful absolute drop in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7 mmol/mol comparing baseline with 3 months. Previous studies in insulin-treated patients with T2D and no recent history of vascular ischemia showed either a minor reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 3 mmol/mol with isCGM over 6 months (An Evaluation of a Novel Glucose Sensing Technology in Type 2 Diabetes [REPLACE] trial) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) or a more impressive reduction of 9 mmol/mol with isCGM over 2 months (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). However, our population included acutely unwell individuals receiving insulin and noninsulin therapies, which makes comparisons with the other two studies problematic.</p>
              <p>Taken together, our trial data indicate that both isCGM and SMBG are effective at reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> in individuals with T2D and recent MI. Importantly, however, isCGM seems to reduce HbA<sub>1c</sub> safely by minimizing hypoglycemic exposure, unlike SMBG. It should be noted that hypoglycemia creates a prothrombotic milieu, which can last up to 1 week after the hypoglycemic event (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and is best avoided in an ACS population, particularly because hypoglycemic exposure is associated with high cardiovascular mortality (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>Mortality in our trial population was low, and severe hypoglycemia and MACEs occurred in a minority. A much larger study will be required to draw conclusions on the effects of isCGM on MACEs. Reassuringly, the glucose sensor was well tolerated, with only mild to moderate local reactions, with none resulting in discontinuation. Also, the sensor had a positive effect on some QOL measures, although these did not always reach statistical significance, and therefore, the effects seem to be modest.</p>
              <p>The economic evaluation combined two different models to account for both the hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic effects of glucose-monitoring strategies, and this showed isCGM to be cost effective if used for 3 months after MI and intermittently thereafter (one sensor every 4 months).</p>
              <p>The study has several strengths to be highlighted. This is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the use of isCGM in individuals with T2D and recent MI. Moreover, the trial included individuals receiving oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin therapies, broadening the clinical applicability of the work. Methodologically, the choice of randomization and analysis methods allowed unbiased estimates of the treatment effect (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The analysis was planned to use longitudinal, individual daily glucose readings, avoiding simplification and averaging while also providing ICC, important for the design of future cluster trials. Moreover, data were analyzed using a combination of Bayesian and frequentist statistical methods, which has not been adopted previously in trials of glucose monitoring. There are, however, limitations to be acknowledged. The subgroup analysis of individuals receiving a sulphonylurea or insulin should be interpreted with caution and can only be regarded as preliminary. Furthermore, the duration of glycemic monitoring part of the trial was short at 3 months, and it is unclear hether a longer period would have had a greater effect, particularly because 6 months of isCGM may be required to show a difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in non–insulin-treated individuals with T2D (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Also, the majority of the population studied were Caucasian, and therefore, it is unclear whether the intervention has the same effect in other ethnic groups. Also, it remains unclear whether individuals with T2D and MI who are not receiving insulin and/or a sulphonyurea benefit from isCGM. Finally, as a glycemic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, the work lacks power to investigate the effects of isCGM on vascular outcomes.</p>
              <p>In summary, patients with T2D with recent ACS are receptive to the use of novel technology and alternative glucose-testing strategies. Our trial shows that isCGM is safe in this population, optimizes glycemia faster than SMBG, and results in clinically meaningful reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> while limiting hypoglycemic exposure, in contrast to SMBG (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.2337/figshare.21496824" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table 5</ext-link> summarizes main study findings). Large-scale longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the effects of isCGM on long-term cardiac outcome in individuals with diabetes and recent MI.</p>
