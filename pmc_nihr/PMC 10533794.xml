                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Despite of recent advancement in the burns wound management, burn wound infection (BWI) is still one of the major cause of burns mortality. Patients who survive their burns injury still suffers from BWI related complication like delayed wound healing and poor scarring. BWI has been treated by application of topical antimicrobial agents or systemic antibiotics. Due to the global risk of developing systemic antibiotics resistance, medical research focuses on identifying single topical agent which has effective antimicrobial activity, easily available and cost effective. One such agent is acetic acid (AA). AA has been used as a topical antibacterial agent for the treatment of burns wounds for many years and has shown to have activity against gram-negative organisms including <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. So far there has been no consensus on optimal concentration that has effective antimicrobial activity, frequency of application, duration of treatment and most importantly good patient’s tolerability. A randomised control study is required to answer all these questions.</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Primary outcome</italic>: Efficacy will be assessed by measuring the bacterial load from microbiology wound swabs for three consecutive days.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Secondary outcomes</italic>: (1) The assessment of antimicrobial activity of AA and the minimum inhibitory concentrations. (2) Patient’s tolerance by assessing Visual Analogue Scale pain score. (3) Time to 95% wound healing of treatment area. (4) Patient’s perceived treatment allocation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Burns wound infection (BWI) is a serious complication following burn injury. It is reported that BWI accounts approximately 9%–17% of all burn injury related complications.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Pruitt <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported that invasive wound infection represents 5% of all the infections that occurred in patients admitted with severe burn injuries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is very concerning that morbidity and mortality of burn patients are highly correlated to the incidence of wound infection and its sequelae.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Other complications include delayed wound healing, poor scarring. Hence, the medical community aim to effectively manage BWI to improve patient’s prognosis.</p>
              <p>Invasive BWI are classically treated with systemic antibiotics. However, excessive use of antibiotics has been associated with antimicrobial resistance. Alternative antimicrobial regimes are currently needed to minimise the antimicrobial resistance, as per WHO recommendations.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A wide range of topical treatments to manage BWI are available. This includes but not limited to, silver nitrate, povidone-iodine and acetic acid (AA). To date, there is no consensus in regards to effectiveness and efficiency of various topical management regimes for BWI.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Ideal topical regime for treating BWI needs to have potent antimicrobial properties, readily available and cost effective. One such treatment is topical AA (vinegar). The antimicrobial properties of AA have been well-known for centuries. AA is included on the WHO list of essential medicines published in 2019, a list of the safest and most effective medicines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>AA has been used as a topical agent in burn care for decades.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> It has been used for wound management in WW1 when Taylor observed the elimination of <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus pyocyaneus</italic> on using 1% AA solution.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It has been shown to be effective against multi-drug resistant organisms and biofilms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p>
              <p>Since then, a number of studies has been conducted to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of AA in management of BWI.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref></p>
              <p>In vitro studies, diluted AA (1%–5%) has shown potential to reduce or eradicate bacterial load, specifically <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AA has been studied in vitro both before and after evaporation and exposure to gauze. These showed that the methicillin-susceptible strain of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> had an MIC of 0.312% and a methicillin-resistant strain was less susceptible to MIC of 0.625%. Strains of <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> also had an MIC of 0.312% and all strains of <italic toggle="yes">P. aeruginosa</italic> were susceptible to MIC of 0.166%.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Different concentrations of AA has been studied to treat BWI.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> Patient’s tolerability to topical agent is also very important. Patients usually complain of stinging and pain on application of AA to wounds, particularly at higher concentrations, for example, strength of 5% or more.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> In another study, 3% concentration was used with better pain tolerance and less itching.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In a recently published survey of burn centres in UK, six centres (32%), routinely use AA topically as gauze soaked with 2.5%–3.0%. This high concentration was reported to be well tolerated.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>Despite of all the previous studies, question still remains to find a good balance between AA concentration which has efficient antimicrobial activity, low toxicity and better patient’s tolerability. Hence, a randomised controlled clinical trial is warranted to answer all these questions.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This is a double-blinded, prospective, controlled and randomised pilot trial, where 20 patients will be randomised to receive treatment with either 0.5% or 2% AA (10 patients in each treatment arm) to treat the bacterial load in colonised burn wounds. The burn wounds will be required to be colonised with a specifically identifiable bacteria (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>), this wound will then be treated two times a day with AA dressings for two consecutive days then once on the third day of treatment. On days 1 and 2, the trial focuses on comparing the effectiveness of AA 0.5% and AA 2% in reducing bacterial load and evaluating patient’s tolerability to justify a larger scale, randomised, controlled trial. The anticipated sample size is small as this is a pilot trial with no placebo arm. The trial will be double blinded to minimise bias in the assessment of the outcome measures.</p>

                <p>This is a single site trial, in which the cohort will be generated from patients admitted to the Burns Centre or Critical Care Unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK (QEHB) with a colonised burn wound. The target population is patients with burns of ≥1% total body surface area (TBSA).</p>

                <title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
                <p>The trial will aim to recruit adult patients (age ≥16 years old) who sustained a ≥1% TBSA burn injury. At the start, the inclusion criteria was aged 18 years which was changed to 16 years, as in UK these patients are legally considered adults and this may increase the patient pool.</p>
                <p>There was an upper limit of TBSA 10% which has been removed and changed to minimum limit of burn injury TBSA ≥1%. These changes were made to cover wider spectrum of patients and severity of injury. However, the total burn wound to be treated with AA will remain&lt;10%.</p>
                <p>Initially, the patients who had the capacity to give informed consent were included in the trial. During the screening process, the clinical team discovered that a large number of otherwise eligible patients could not be approached and hence recruited as they were admitted to intensive care unit and so lacked capacity to give informed consent. Changes were made in protocol to included patients who lacked capacity to give informed consent. The consent for these patients can be sought from a Professional or Personal Legal Representative.</p>
                <p>Prior to enrolment, the targeted burn wound has to be colonised with specifically identifiable bacteria. The recruited patients are anticipated to remain as inpatients for the trial duration (3 days). At first, the trial treatment period was 5 days, with two times a day dressing change on days 1, 2, 4, 5 and once a day dressing changes on day 3. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in the standard care pathways to minimise the exposure by reducing the inpatient stay, the treatment period was reduced to 3 days to avoid impact on recruitment process. This proposed change of the study design was also supported by interim analysis of 11 subjects as there was an increase in bacterial colonisation on day 4, compared with days 2 and 3. Now patients will get two times a day dressing change on days 1, 2 and once a day on day 3.</p>
                <p>Patients receiving systemic antibiotics for cellulitis were excluded initially. The clinical team suggested that these are the patients who may benefit most from topical antimicrobial treatment. In fact, AA (usually of higher concentrations) is part of routine therapy for these patients. Antibiotics are prescribed to control the systemic spread of infection and do not interfere with the wound microbial burden. Therefore, this exclusion point was removed to allow these patients the opportunity to receive 0.5% or 2% AA solution to treat their wounds. This should not affect the outcome of determining the difference in the microbial burden of the two different concentrations.</p>
                <p>Because of all the above changes, the study design is very simple with very broad inclusive criteria so the results can have worldwide potential impact. Only patients with severe burn injury or burn which require surgery will be excluded. There was no contraindication to include pregnant patients or who are breastfeeding as the IP has no systemic effects.</p>
                <p>Patients with burn TBSA &lt;1% and burns solely to the face and/or genital area will be excluded in addition to patients who have received AA as part of standard therapy on admission for this burn injury (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Recruitment eligibility and unsuitability will be checked by the trial investigators.</p>

                <p>The burn wounds will be required to be colonised with a specifically identifiable bacteria, this wound will then be treated two times a day for the first 2 days with AA dressings. This will allow determination of whether the AA is still active after 12 hours of being in contact with a colonised burn wound.

                <p>The swabbing procedure will be carried out prior to burn wound cleaning. The 10×10 cm<sup>2</sup> blue gauze will be removed from the burn wound and over this area a swab moistened in normal saline will be applied and while twisting the tip the area will be swept from left to right at 1 cm intervals. The swab will be transferred to a neutralising agent (containing 30 g/L Tween 80, 3 g/L lecithin, 1 g/L histidine, 5 g/L sodium thiosulphate, 8.5 g/L sodium chloride and 1 g/L tryptone) to nullify carry over of antimicrobial activity. Serial dilutions using diluent containing 8.5 g/L sodium chloride and 1 g/L tryptone will be made, and number of CFU/mL determined.</p>

                  <p>This trial is not powered to the primary endpoint. Rather, the sample size for AceticA has been selected based on what is feasible to be recruited at a single centre in a reasonable timeframe for this phase of clinical trial. It was thought that 10 evaluable patients per treatment arm, analysed using repeated measures methods, would provide the information needed to inform a larger, randomised controlled trial.</p>

                  <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>Secondary outcome measures include; (1) the antimicrobial activity of AA will be measured by extracting fluid from removed burns dressings and assessing the MICs to establish if active AA is still present; (2) tolerance will be assessed by measuring a patient’s pain scores with a VAS if the patient has capacity to provide scores; (3) time to 95% wound healing of the treated area of interest will obtained from patients’ records; (4) perceived treatment allocation will be assessed by asking patients after treatment completion which treatment they believed they received if they have capacity to do so.</p>
                  <p>Patient’s tolerability was changed from primary to secondary outcome anticipating few patients might be sedated and ventilated and unable to respond to visual analogue pain score. Second, ‘percentage of wound healed at day 21’ was changed to ‘time to 95% wound healing’. This amendment was done as some patients develop colonised burns wound and became eligible for recruitment after few weeks of injury. This measurement will be collected as part of burns patients’ standard care and can be obtained retrospectively from the patients’ medical notes.</p>

                <p>Full details will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP); however, an outline is given here. Analysis will use all patients whom are deemed to be evaluable. Patients are evaluable if all five dressing changes from the first 3 days of treatment are completed. Patients will be analysed in the groups that reflect the treatment they actually received. This is because the samples size is small, and the aim of a pilot trial is to inform a subsequent pivotal trial. Where frequentist tests are used, and unless specified otherwise, a significance level of 5% will be used to designate significance.</p>
                <p>It is possible that many wounds could be assessed within patients. If this happens, hierarchical models will be used for wound specific outcome measures to reflect the wound-within-patient structure of the data.</p>

                  <title>Efficacy</title>
                  <p>Burn wound swabs will be taken periodically from baseline and bacterial load will be quantified by microbiology as the number of colonies forming units. To maximise information, repeated measures methods will be used. The model assuming fixed effects for the mean bacterial load, the mean change in bacterial load from baseline, and the additional mean change that is associated with receiving 2% instead of 0.5% AA, with random effects adjusting for the mean bacterial load at baseline for each patient, will be compared with the analogous model without the adjustment for treatment received. A likelihood-ratio test of the nested models would yield inference on the treatment effects through time. As detailed earlier, hierarchical structures will be considered as necessitated by the observed data.</p>
                  <p>The dependent variable could be extremely fat-tailed so appropriate transforms (eg, log) will be considered. This model could also be re-specified to use fewer parameters if load is found to be well approximated by a smooth function of time, potentially using transformations or restricted cubic splines. In this case, equivalent adaptations would be made to each model so that the method of testing nested models to isolate treatment effect is valid.</p>
                  <p>The parameters in the full model will be reported with means and SEs.</p>
                  <p>There may be particular interest in the presence or absence of a particular set of bacteria. If this is the case, these will be identified in the SAP. The expectation is that the lower concentration will be non-inferior in terms of efficacy. This suggests a one-tailed comparison.</p>

                  <p>Pain scores will be collected at many points throughout the trial via the verbal pain intensity scale. Zor <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> collect scores in a similar manner and analyse them as numerical data, that is, they assume the scores to reflect order and scale. We initially propose to also analyse the pain scores as numerical variables. Explanatory variables will be included to reflect treatment allocation and we will present evidence on the extent to which reported pain is associated with treatment allocation.</p>
                  <p>The assumption that pain scores are numerical and not ordinal is potentially controversial. Supporting analysis may be provided that treats the scores as ordinal levels. Hierarchical structure similar to that described in the primary outcome would be used. Provision of this analysis is at least partially contingent on patients in the overwhelming majority of cases using the provided levels and not providing scores between levels. For instance, if patients frequently score pain experienced as 3.5 to convey ‘between 3 and 4’, then that would diminish the suitability of the described ordinal variable analysis. In that case, a re-codification of the ordinal levels, or reliance only on the analysis of the continuous data could be indicated.</p>

The MICs will be estimated by successively halving the concentration of retrieved acid and testing whether microbial growth occurs. MICs could be modelled as numerical (after appropriate transform) and/or ordinal data. Furthermore, group structure could be required as described above. Details of this are given in the SAP.</p>

              <p>BWI is correlated with higher mortality and morbidity following burn injury.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Hence, one of the most important aims in burns wound management is to prevent infection to prevent invasive BWI and sepsis. Multiple studies has shown effectiveness of AA in managing BWI.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10 14</xref> It is also known as an effective agent against biofilm producing micro-organisms which are notoriously difficult to decolonise, due to limited antimicrobial penetration and deactivation by biofilm matrix.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, as a weak acid with a pKa close to its pH, AA can kill bacteria without being toxic to human cells, a key consideration in wound healing.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It is also very cost effective and easily available agent.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> But there is not enough data to standardise its usage like effective strength, frequency, duration of treatment.</p>
              <p>This is a prospective interventional controlled trial with a very simple trial design. The results will have worldwide impact because of its generic inclusion criteria. This study will show the outcome in BWI treated with two different strengths of AA. 0.5% and 2%. It will help in establishing a balance between the effective strength of AA against BWI, frequency and duration of treatment and patient’s tolerability. As AA is very cost effective and easily available agent. The results of the study will have effects in both developed and developing countries with limited medical resources. This trial has a potential to have significant impact on development of future studies on burns wound management and treatment of BWI by incorporating AA in a dressing carrier as the active antibacterial agent.</p>
