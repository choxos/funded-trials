                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Physical activity is recommended for improving health among people with common chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis and low mood. One approach to promote physical activity is via primary care exercise referral schemes (ERS). However, there is limited support for the effectiveness of ERS for increasing long-term physical activity and additional interventions are needed to help patients overcome barriers to ERS uptake and adherence.</p>
                  <p>This study aims to determine whether augmenting usual ERS with web-based behavioural support, based on the LifeGuide platform, will increase long-term physical activity for patients with chronic physical and mental health conditions, and is cost-effective.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre parallel two-group randomised controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation to usual ERS alone (control) or usual ERS plus web-based behavioural support (intervention) with parallel economic and mixed methods process evaluations. Participants are low active adults with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis or a history of depression, referred to an ERS from primary care in the UK.</p>
                  <p>The primary outcome measure is the number of minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in ≥10 min bouts measured by accelerometer over 1 week at 12 months.</p>
                  <p>We plan to recruit 413 participants, with 88% power at a two-sided alpha of 5%, assuming 20% attrition, to demonstrate a between-group difference of 36–39 min of MVPA per week at 12 months. An improvement of this magnitude represents an important change in physical activity, particularly for inactive participants with chronic conditions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Physical inactivity was found to cost the National Health Service (NHS) £455 million in 2013–2014 according to data collected by Clinical Commissioning Groups in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Evidence-based guidelines recommend both aerobic and strength training for improving health markers and quality of life among those with common chronic metabolic conditions<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> and musculoskeletal conditions,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and mostly aerobic exercise for preventing and reducing depression.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Public health guidelines of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week are widely accepted but even small increases in physical activity and reduced sedentary time among the least active are likely to accrue health benefits.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
              <p>Patients with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and depression are less physically active than the general population,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and need greater support to overcome real and perceived barriers to increase physical activity. Increases in physical activity among the least active have the potential to provide the largest impact on health but any benefits dissipate without maintained levels of activity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A variety of initiatives have been explored to promote physical activity within primary care, including referring patients to ‘exercise on prescription’, that is, an exercise referral scheme (ERS). In the UK, ERS have been common for promoting physical activity, with an estimated 600 schemes involving up to 100 000 patients per year.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence from a meta-analysis of eight randomised trials involving 5190 participants eligible for ERS<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> indicated a small increase in the proportion of participants who achieved 90–150 min of physical activity of at least moderate intensity per week, compared with no exercise control at 6–12 months follow-up among at-risk individuals. But uncertainty remains regarding the effects for patients with specific medical conditions since no study assessed long-term physical activity objectively, and many of the eight studies reviewed had relatively small sample sizes.</p>
              <p>A systematic review<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> reported an average ERS uptake (attendance at the first ERS session) that ranged from 66% in observational studies to 81% in randomised controlled trials, and average levels of adherence from 49% in observational studies to 43% in randomised controlled trials. Predictors of uptake and adherence have rarely been explored but it has been reported that while women were more likely to begin an ERS, they were less likely to adhere to it than men; also, older people were more likely to begin and adhere to an ERS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> ERS may help patients become familiar with concepts such as exercise type, intensity, frequency and duration of exercise, matched to their medical condition, and target key processes of behaviour change. However, the following features of an ERS may reduce uptake and adherence: inconvenience, cost, limited sustainable physical activity support (eg, for 10 weeks) and low appeal for structured exercise and/or the medical model, that is, ‘exercise on prescription’, which may do little to provide autonomous support nor empower patients to develop self-determined behaviour to manage chronic medical conditions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 14</xref> It therefore appears that additional support may be needed which is accessible, low cost, can be tailored to support a wide range of individual needs and empowers patients to develop and use self-regulatory skills (eg, self-monitoring, goal setting) to self-manage their chronic conditions. A wide variety of online and mobile technologies have been developed and used to support changes in and maintenance of physical activity.</p>
              <p>There is considerable evidence on the effects of technology-based interventions for promotion of physical activity.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> These include studies with a wide range of interventions (from quite simple self-monitoring to interventions with complex multiple behaviour change components), targeted at different clinical groups with different baseline levels of physical activity, with various physical activity outcomes reported (very few using objective measures), and with mostly short-term follow-ups. Also, some comparisons are between intervention versus no intervention and others versus human contact, although none reports on the effects of adding web-based support to ERS. The impact for web-based and technology interventions on increasing physical activity is small to moderate (an effect size ≤0.4). However, there is evidence that more rigorous studies, interventions with more behaviour change components and ones targeted at less active populations are more effective.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> A systematic review<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> has highlighted the importance of maximising sustained engagement in web-based interventions for enhancing change in the target behaviour. A recent study<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> confirmed that self-monitoring of physical activity and tailored feedback were important to increase engagement, and periodic communications helped to maintain participant engagement.</p>
              <p>The LifeGuide platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.LifeGuideonline.org/">www.LifeGuideonline.org/</ext-link>) has been extensively used to develop and evaluate acceptability and impact of online behaviour change and self-management interventions with a variety of clinical groups, including in primary care.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> For example, adding online LifeGuide support to face-to-face support showed a greater lasting reduction in obesity than face-to-face dietetic advice alone.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The LifeGuide platform provides a researcher-led tool to develop interventions drawn from theory and evidence of effective techniques<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> and provides the opportunity to understand engagement and utility of different behaviour change components.</p>
              <p>Following iterative development work and user group testing and involvement, drawing on some online modules used in other LifeGuide interventions,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we developed a bespoke intervention, called ‘e-coachER’ to support patients with chronic physical and mental health conditions who have been referred from primary care to an ERS to receive face-to-face support. Should the approach prove to be effective, there is considerable potential for the intervention to be scaled up for patients with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and risk of depression at probable low cost<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> and also extend it for patients with other chronic medical conditions (eg, low back pain, heart disease, cancer).</p>

                  <p>Patients will be identified as potentially eligible for the trial (i) by healthcare professionals in primary care at the point of being actively referred to an ERS or having been opportunistically found to be eligible for an ERS at a consultation with the primary care practitioner, (ii) via a search of patient databases at the participating GP practices (conducted by the local Primary Care Research Network team), (iii) via patient self-referral to the GP arising from community-based publicity for the trial, (iv) by the ERS programme administrator on receipt of an ERS referral form from a GP practice or (v) by exercise advisors at the ERS service at enrolment on the ERS (with the patient’s consent, the exercise advisor will provide the local researcher with the patient’s contact details for the purposes of the trial).</p>
                  <p>Potentially eligible patients will be approached by the primary care practitioner or the local researcher, depending on how the patient was identified, or patients may self-refer to the local researcher in response to publicity campaigns. These various means of identification and approach are designed to accommodate the variation in usual care referral pathways to ERS across the participating sites and individual GP practices.</p>
                  <p>Amenable patients will be offered a study-specific Participant Information Sheet, either by post, via email or by hand (the route used will largely depend on the preference of the participating GP practice or ERS service). Interested patients will be asked to communicate their expression of interest to the local researcher via a prepaid reply slip, by telephone or by email. On receipt of an expression of interest, the local researcher will contact the potential participant by telephone to discuss the trial, confirm eligibility and take informed consent.</p>

                <p>On receipt of the baseline accelerometer at the CTU after 1 week’s wear, participants will be randomised. Randomisation will be stratified by site with minimisation by the participant’s perceived reason for their referral to the ERS (ie, weight loss, diabetes control, reduce blood pressure, manage lower limb osteoarthritis symptoms, manage low mood/depression) and by self-reported IT literacy level on a visual analogue scale (ie, lower or higher confidence).

                <p>The ERS practitioners should be unaware of trial participants’ treatment allocations. Blinding of participants is not possible, given the nature of the intervention. Given that the primary outcome is an objective measure of physical activity recorded by accelerometer, and the secondary outcomes will be assessed by participant self-completion questionnaire, the risk of assessor bias is likely to be negligible in this study. However, to minimise any potential bias, the statistical analysis will be kept blinded and the code for group allocation not broken until the primary and secondary analyses have been completed.</p>

                <p>At 4 and 12 months post-randomisation, participants will be sent an accelerometer and questionnaire booklet by post, along with a simple instruction sheet on how to wear the accelerometer, and a prepaid envelope to return the items to the CTU.</p>
                <p>To maximise data completeness at follow-up assessments, participants will be sent standard letters/emails from the CTU: (i) 7 days before delivery of the accelerometer, (ii) 3 days into the 10-day recording window as a prompt for the participant to begin wearing the accelerometer (if not already doing so) and (iii) should the accelerometer not have been received at the CTU, at 3 and 5 weeks after issue as a reminder to post the accelerometer to the CTU. If the participant has not sent the accelerometer to the CTU after 6 weeks, the local researcher will telephone the participant to remind them to return the device. Participants who return the accelerometer to the CTU will receive an online/high street store voucher for £20 as a token ‘thank you’, to maximise response rates.</p>

                  <title>Intervention: web-based support plus ERS (e-coachER)</title>
                  <p>e-coachER is a web-based support package, which offers a range of interactive opportunities to enhance participants’ motivation to take up the ERS and to maintain a more physically active lifestyle, whether or not they engage with their local ERS. A logic model for the intervention is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p>
                  <p>e-coachER is primarily a self-delivered intervention and comprises the following components:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A mailed ‘Welcome Pack’ that contains a user guide and the participant’s unique user log-in; a simple pedometer (step-counter) and a notepad to record daily physical activity (appended to a magnet with study-specific branding). Participants are encouraged to make use of the pedometer and the activity record sheets for self-monitoring and goal setting in conjunction with the e-coachER website.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The e-coachER website (on the LifeGuide platform). At the core of e-coachER are seven ‘Steps to Health’ lasting approximately 5–10 min each, designed to: encourage participants to think about the benefits of physical activity (motivation); seek support from an ERS practitioner, friends/family and the internet (support/relatedness); set progressive goals; self-monitor physical activity with a pedometer and upload step counts or minutes of MVPA (self-regulation, building confidence/autonomy); find ways to increase physical activity more sustainably in the context of day-to-day life and deal with setbacks (building confidence). The sequential content, objectives and how this was implemented were mapped against a taxonomy for behaviour change techniques<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Self-determination theory underpins the intervention with core aims in every step and interaction with participants, aiming to build confidence, autonomy and relatedness.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Participants are encouraged to use the e-coachER support package as an interactive tool by using preset or user-defined reminders to promote ongoing use of functions such as recording weekly physical activity (minutes of MVPA) and goal setting, and receive messages of encouragement. Prompts are sent to remind participants to review their goals. An absence of engagement (eg, failure to review a goal, or not signing into the website for 1, 2 and 4 weeks) triggers reminder emails to the participant.</p><p>The website content will be locked prior to starting recruitment, with the exception of webpages displaying links to reputable generic websites for further information about the chronic conditions of interest and lifestyle, links to other websites and apps for self-monitoring health behaviour and health as well as modifiable listings of local opportunities to engage in physical activity.</p><p>An avatar is used throughout the content to avoid having to represent a range of individual characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. The avatar delivers brief narratives to normalise and support behaviour change and encourage use of the e-coachER support package.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To maximise accessibility and usage, a local researcher will provide technical support if requested. If a participant does not register on the e-coachER website within the first few weeks, the local researcher will contact the participant to offer support to register. If a participant requires technical support to resolve operational issues with the website (eg, requires a password to be reissued), participants will be referred to a centralised technician within the LifeGuide team.</p></list-item></list></p>

The focus of the interview questions will be linked to the phase of the intervention, and seek to identify the perceived value of the ‘Welcome Pack’ and contents in helping to access e-coachER, the overall web-based support and each of the Steps to Health, in terms of functionality and utility to support behaviour change. Participants will be asked to identify if and how they thought e-coachER provided support for their ERS, and maintaining physical activity in addition to and beyond the ERS support. Ideas for additions or revisions to e-coachER will be requested. Questions will also focus on the participants’ perceived development of self-regulatory skills (eg, self-monitoring, goal setting) and the extent to which the intervention enhanced a sense of competence, autonomy and relatedness, thereby linking back to the aims and guiding principles of the e-coachER intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The researchers will be asked to maintain field notes on any interactions with participants concerning engagement with the intervention, such as any difficulties faced with accessing the intervention website.

                <p>The primary analysis will compare complete case outcomes between intervention and control arms groups according to the principle of intention to treat (ie, according to original randomised allocation) at 12 months adjusting for baseline outcome values and stratification and minimisation variables (recruitment site and disease indication).</p>
                <p>Secondary analyses will be undertaken to compare groups at follow-up across all follow-up points (ie, 4 and 12 months) using a mixed effects repeated measures approach.

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>The research question was informed by patient and public involvement (PPI) over many years. Individual and group interviews were conducted with patients to identify the barriers and facilitators associated with ERS, and what additional support could help maintain physical activity for a variety of chronic conditions. Our extensive engagement with ERS practitioners allowed us to understand the individual variability and collective patient experience of ERS. This included one of the authors developing, delivering and adapting a training course for ERS practitioners based on their feedback.</p>
                <p>The LifeGuide team worked extensively with PPI representatives to develop the appropriate support, concluding that ERS patients would appreciate additional support from an ERS to help them to further develop the independent motivation to maintain physical activity, involving a broad range of active options. Also, patients widely indicated that the LifeGuide web-based system can provide appropriate support for making health behaviour changes. Typically ERS can increase health inequalities by limiting access to those who have limited disposable income or have restricting physical and mental health conditions. The e-coachER system was designed to support those with such restrictions.</p>
                <p>Patients were involved in the design of the study. A PPI group was involved in the initial development and refinement of the e-coachER web-based behavioural support. Patients with experience of being referred for an exercise programme, took part in focus groups and provided direct feedback on iterations of the e-coachER intervention during its development.</p>
                <p>We engaged with over 20 ERS patients who volunteered to pilot the e-coachER Welcome Pack and provide feedback on the e-coachER website. A PPI representative was available to provide opinions on the study protocol and patient-facing documentation (eg, Participant Information Sheet) during the set-up of the study.</p>
                <p>Patients are involved in the oversight of study progress and conduct via representation at periodic Project Management Group meetings and Trial Steering Committee meetings.</p>

                  <p>The recruitment rate during the internal pilot phase was lower than expected, due to limitations on the time primary care practitioners had available to approach potential participants; delayed start at one of the research sites; poor uptake when patients were approached via a postal mailshot; high ineligibility rate among patients who were identified via a primary care database. In response to poor recruitment, the following strategies to increase recruitment were introduced:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The inclusion criterion for BMI was aligned with the ERS entry (upper BMI limit for the trial was originally 35 and was raised to 40), and prediabetes was included as an inclusion criterion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Recruitment via the ERS service, which was already taking place at the site in Greater Glasgow, was adopted in the West Midlands and the South West in addition to recruitment via primary care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Incentive payments to participants (for returning an accelerometer) were increased from £10 to £20 per accelerometer.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p>Having implemented these measures, the conditions for progression in terms of recruitment rate and engagement with the intervention were not met by the end of the internal pilot phase, despite a 4-month extension period. A ‘recovery plan’ was developed in collaboration with the funders, based on amending the choice of primary outcome, and submitted in May 2016.</p>
                  <p>The original primary outcome was achievement of at least 150 min of MVPA measured objectively by accelerometer over 1 week at 12 months. This outcome was based on the findings of a systematic review of ERS<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 46</xref> demonstrating that trials had primarily reported their outcomes according to percentage of participants reaching the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for physical activity level, that is, 150 min of MVPA per week. We estimated that recruiting 700 participants per group would allow us to detect a difference at 12 months follow-up of at least 10% (intervention group: 53% vs control group: 43%), assuming an attrition rate of 20% and small effect of clustering (intracluster correlation coefficient ICC: 0.006) at 90% power and 5% alpha. Thus, the original sample size was 1400 participants, to be recruited over 16 months.</p>
                  <p>From the outset, the TSC and DMC had recommended that this dichotomous primary outcome measure be replaced with a continuous variable; total weekly minutes of MVPA. This was because:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>A continuous primary outcome measure would be more relevant in this study population, in terms of detecting a small but clinically significant increase in minutes of MVPA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Based on sample size calculations, this would offer greater statistical power than to the categorical assessment of whether participants reach a threshold of 150 min of MVPA. This would therefore afford a reduction in sample size.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p>The TSC and funders agreed these changes (in August 2016) and the original sample size was reduced in accordance with this new primary outcome measure and revised sample size calculation, from 1400 to 413 participants (to be recruited over 21 months). A similar reduction in sample size has been incorporated into the qualitative component of the process evaluation work.</p>
