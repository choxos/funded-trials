                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">STEPWISE is a theory-informed self-management education programme that was co-produced with service users, healthcare professionals and interventionists to support weight loss for people with schizophrenia. We report the process evaluation to inform understanding about the intervention and its effectiveness in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated its efficacy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Following the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions, we explored implementation quality. We considered causal mechanisms, unanticipated consequences and contextual factors associated with variation in actual and intended outcomes, and integrated treatment fidelity, using the programme theory and a pipeline logic model.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">We followed a modified version of Linnan and Steckler’s framework and single case design. Qualitative data from semi-structured telephone interviews with service-users (<italic>n</italic> = 24), healthcare professionals delivering the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and interventionists (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were triangulated with quantitative process and RCT outcome data and with observations by interventionists, to examine convergence within logic model components.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Training and course materials were available although lacked co-ordination in some trusts. Healthcare professionals gained knowledge and some contemplated changing their practice to reflect the (facilitative) ‘style’ of delivery. They were often responsible for administrative activities increasing the burden of delivery. Healthcare professionals recognised the need to address antipsychotic-induced weight gain and reported potential value from the intervention (subject to the RCT results). However, some doubted senior management commitment and sustainability post-trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Service-users found the intervention highly acceptable, especially being in a group of people with similar experiences. Service-users perceived weight loss and lifestyle benefits; however, session attendance varied with 23% (<italic>n</italic> = 47) attending all group-sessions and 17% (<italic>n</italic> = 36) attending none. Service-users who lost weight wanted closer monitoring and many healthcare professionals wanted to monitor outcomes (e.g. weight) but it was outside the intervention design. No clinical or cost benefit was demonstrated from the intermediate outcomes (RCT) and any changes in RCT outcomes were not due to the intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par6">This process evaluation provides a greater understanding of why STEPWISE was unsuccessful in promoting weight loss during the clinical trial. Further research is required to evaluate whether different levels of contact and objective monitoring can support people with schizophrenia to lose weight.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par27">Obesity and excessive weight gain pose a serious health concern for people with schizophrenia. The prevalence of obesity and rates of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are 2–3 times higher than in the general population and, weight gain is a key contributor to the excess morbidity and mortality with accelerated rates of obesity contributing to reduced life expectancy of between 10 and 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The impact of weight gain is not confined to poor physical health, but also may further add to the experience of distress and stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Susceptibility to weight gain for people with schizophrenia can be explained by many factors. As well as the impact of antipsychotic medication on weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], schizophrenia can affect neuro-endocrine functioning as well as impairing cognition and motivation to modify daily routines. The disease and treatment interact with environmental factors such as poor diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], social isolation, physical inactivity and poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Thus, the development of effective weight loss treatments to support people with schizophrenia must overcome challenges posed by a varied set of antecedent factors.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Complex interventions are those with “several interacting components” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The theory-informed STEPWISE programme was developed using the well-established approach to developing type 2 diabetes education - Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Diagnosed (DESMOND) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It involves interactions between healthcare professionals, service users and equipment. The multifaceted nature of STEPWISE can create problems when determining what affected outcomes and the extent to which the intervention could be standardised. Complex interventions tend to be more sensitive to features of the local context, with long and complex causal chains linking the intervention with the outcome. As such, they can be difficult to evaluate and it has been argued that RCTs may not be the best method of evaluation as they seek to remove variation between interventions, agents and contexts and how they interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">We conducted an RCT to assess the effectiveness of STEPWISE. The trial protocol and main results have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In brief, between 10 March 2015 and 31 March 2016, we recruited 414 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or first episode psychosis from ten mental health organisations in England. Participants were randomly allocated to the STEPWISE intervention or treatment as usual. The STEPWISE programme was a 12-month intervention which comprised a foundation course of four weekly 2.5-h sessions delivered by two trained healthcare professionals or associated staff; one-to-one support contact of ~ 10 min every two weeks, usually by telephone, and additional group-based sessions of 2.5 h scheduled at four, seven and 10 months post-randomisation. The intervention is described in full elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">We conducted a process evaluation, in line with MRC guidance alongside the RCT, to assess fidelity and quality of implementation, and sought to clarify causal mechanisms and identify contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p id="Par31">Qualitative research was undertaken alongside the RCT to explore implementation of the intervention. We sought to understand how service users and facilitators responded to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and potential causal pathways to success or failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The evaluation’s rationale was principally pragmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as we sought a basis for ‘organising future observations and experiences’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and investigating plausible real-world consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] of future decisions.</p>
                <p id="Par32">We used a modified version of Linnan and Steckler’s framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and a single case design with the unit of analysis at the service user (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and the intervention programme (<italic>n</italic> = 20 healthcare professionals; <italic>n</italic> = 7 interventionists) levels.</p>
                <p id="Par33">The World Health Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Functioning (ICF) for schizophrenia was used as a conceptual framework for describing ‘context’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Similar published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] informed a priori the topic guide for service user interviews. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), a model used to support implementation and evaluation of innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], formed the basis of the topic guide for healthcare professional interviews. To characterise stakeholder’s understanding of the intervention we used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), an approach to determine causes of behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. TDF codes were mapped post hoc to the theories underpinning the intervention, which were Leventhal’s Self-Regulation Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and Marlatt &amp; Gordon’s Relapse Prevention Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">We considered the programme components critical to successful replication of the intervention theory, along with potential causes of failure from these components interacting together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], to develop a logic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A summary of logical model components and intended outcomes is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

                <p id="Par41">Fidelity assessment of the intervention was assessed via direct observation using the STEPWISE Core Facilitator Behavioural Observation Sheet (CFBOS) which tests for the presence or absence of 35 behaviour domains relating to 9 items assessing behavioural change, planning and goal-setting. The DESMOND Observation Tool (DOT) also measured facilitator versus service user talk time using timed audio cues during a sample of sessions. There is evidence to indicate a link between more effective receipt of self-management education and less facilitator talk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Fidelity strategies are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Facilitator attrition was also recorded. A programme like STEPWISE would require national and local infrastructure for quality control and mentoring but was not available during our study; therefore, facilitators did not receive formal feedback nor could evaluation of these components take place.

                  <p id="Par82">Healthcare professionals reported that service users’ understanding of the intentions of the programme was not immediately or always understood. Some felt this was due to cognitive difficulties or services users being more familiar with a didactic, rather than, facilitative approach.<disp-quote><p id="Par83">“And their functioning is quite different, you know, there's really quite a high level functioning lady there who sort of understood the thing straight away, and another guy … it's very difficult to find out what his understanding actually is. Because he tends to talk in slightly psychotic terms.” (Facilitator S05/F02)</p><p id="Par84">“We do repeat, you know … it's a lifestyle choice... we're not saying that you've got to ban all bad food... they think they're going to go there, get weighed, and they'll go on a diet, we're going to give them a diet sheet. And for some people that would work, and for other people empowering them works... sometimes the like peer pressure and going to Weight Watchers and knowing that you know there's some expectation you've lost some weight, because it's been marked down, that works very well for some people but not others.” (Facilitator S01/F02)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Healthcare professionals could perform the tasks required by the intervention and universally complementary about the training and printed materials they received, although one noted:<disp-quote><p id="Par85">“It was a lot to take in just those three days initially … quite intense.” (Facilitator S08/03)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par86">Staff highlighted organisational challenges in some trusts including: key individuals not driving implementation, lack of commitment from senior leadership, under-resourced delivery and doubt regarding sustainability of the programme post-RCT.<disp-quote><p id="Par87">“If it works … it's going to become part of like the working practice for everybody.

                  <p>The extent to which healthcare professionals could access information about the intervention effects (e.g. weight) was limited.

                  <p id="Par89">Similarly, healthcare professionals reported finding it difficult to ensure services uses comprehended the course content and had sufficient cognitive skills to perform the necessary behaviour change. This was echoed by some service users who wanted more monitoring by others. Interventionists reported that (subjective) information about the extent to which service users understood the material could have been elicited by facilitators during sessions.<disp-quote><p id="Par90">“Sometimes it wasn’t explored to check understanding...

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par92">This process evaluation explored how context affected programme implementation and may help understand why the STEPWISE intervention was unsuccessful in supporting weight loss in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and first episode psychosis. The process evaluation found that the programme design required closer (objective) monitoring of service users’ progress towards their lifestyle goals, greater integration of the programme within the organisation, i.e. coordination of resources, supporting staff appropriately to run the programme, and consideration of the context and variation in symptoms for people living with schizophrenia to achieve the desired lifestyle change.</p>
              <p id="Par93">The evaluation identified poverty, under-resourced services and stigma associated with severe mental illness as important issues for providers of tailored weight management programmes, as have others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Service users valued the provision of (funded) transport and found patient-focused educational approach acceptable; however, healthcare professionals felt the level of resource employed would be unsustainable outside of the trial. If born out, ensuring adequate resources would be essential for successful implementation. Recent research conducted by McGinty and colleagues identified ways to adapt and scale up a severe mental illness weight loss intervention (ACHIEVE); including, building staff capacity, engaging leaders and organisational change and financial policy strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] which may overcome some of the perceived and actual resourcing and leadership challenges we found in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par94">We investigated intervention fidelity via direct observation of STEPWISE courses, which is considered the gold standard approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Observations were undertaken by interventionists; however, qualitative and quantitative process and implementation data were collected and analysed by evaluators (DH and RGW) with sufficient independence to critically observe stakeholders, as recommended in guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par95">We coded participant transcripts to the Behaviour Change Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] during analysis ‘after the event’, rather than integrating constructs within the interview schedule. Therefore, the subsequent analysis did not draw methodologically from these constructs rather it reflected service users’ patterns of attention. Programme infrastructure that would, if rolled out, be required to support training, provision of materials and ongoing quality assurance, was not in place and therefore could not be evaluated. In addition, in at least one trust facilitators were managed by the Research and Development department which meant greater control over resource management for intervention delivery.</p>

                <title>Implications</title>
                <p id="Par96">As the theory underpinning the intervention is sound, we have explored the intervention design and considered how it has been packaged (session content/timings), along with organisation issues (resources, lack of monitoring/tailoring for individuals) and the context of living with a severe mental illness to assist in understanding why the required behaviour change mechanisms have not been triggered. The process evaluation points to potential modifications which are highly likely to improve the design and organisation of this or similar interventions for this population (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par97">The triangulation of qualitative and quantitative findings of the STEPWISE intervention reveal barriers and facilitators that influenced programme delivery. System level infrastructure, local leadership and providing sufficient time and resources for adequate coordination and delivery are essential. There is demand from people with schizophrenia for this type of programme; and, the need for interventions to support weight loss is unlikely to reduce because few tailored programmes exist, and obesity rates generally are rising. Findings from our study suggest certain strategies may improve and support delivery in any future adaptions and in subsequent real-world implementation. Although further research is required to identify what type and format of interventions will best support people with schizophrenia to lose weight, and associated costs, our study found that close objective monitoring of desired outcomes to assess progress towards individual lifestyle goals (e.g. weight) and an adequately resourced programme at local (i.e. personnel, support tools, venues) and national (manual, training, quality assurance) levels are essential. Furthermore, consideration of the range of contextual factors, which vary in their applicability to, and impact on, people living with schizophrenia, will help ensure interventions are tailored and flexible; and therefore, more likely to achieve lifestyle changes which can reduce the health inequalities experienced by services users when compared to the general population.</p>
