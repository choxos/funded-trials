                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Melanoma is common; 15,906 people in the UK were diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 and incidence has increased fivefold in 30 years. Melanoma affects old and young people, with poor prognosis once metastatic. UK guidelines recommend people treated for cutaneous melanoma receive extended outpatient, hospital follow up to detect recurrence or new primaries. Such follow up of the growing population of melanoma survivors is burdensome for both individuals and health services. Follow up is important since approximately 20% of patients with early-stage melanoma experience a recurrence and 4–8% develop a new primary; the risk of either is highest in the first 5 years. Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare (ASICA) is a digital intervention to increase total-skin-self-examination (TSSE) by people treated for melanoma, with usual follow up.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We aim to recruit 240 adults with a previous first-stage 0-2C primary cutaneous melanoma, from secondary care in North-East Scotland and the East of England. Participants will be randomised to receive the ASICA intervention (a tablet-based digital intervention to prompt and support TSSE) or control group (treatment as usual). Patient-reported and clinical data will be collected at baseline, including the modified Melanoma Worry Scale (MWS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs), the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5 L), and questions about TSSE practice, intentions, self-efficacy and planning. Participants will be followed up by postal questionnaire at 3, 6 and 12 months following randomization, along with a 12-month review of clinical data. The primary timepoint for outcome analyses will be12 months after randomisation.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">If the ASICA intervention improves the practice of TSSE in those affected by melanoma, this may lead to improved psychological well-being and earlier detection of recurrent and new primary melanoma. This could impact both patients and National Health Service (NHS) resources. This study will determine if a full-scale randomised controlled trial can be undertaken in the UK NHS to provide the high-quality evidence needed to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. ASICA is a pilot study evaluating the effectiveness of the practice of digitally supported TSSE in those affected by melanoma.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par40">Melanoma is common; 15,906 people in the UK were diagnosed with melanoma in 2015 and incidence has increased fivefold in 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Melanoma disproportionately affects younger people with poor prognosis once metastatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. UK guidelines recommend people treated for cutaneous melanoma receive extended hospital follow up to detect recurrence or new primaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, delivering melanoma follow up to the growing population of melanoma survivors is burdensome for both individuals and health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Follow up is important, nonetheless, since approximately 20% of patients with early-stage melanoma experience a recurrence and 4–8% develop a new primary, the risk of either is highest in the first 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Melanoma can recur locally, regionally or with distant metastases, and new primaries can occur anywhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">It is important to detect new primary and recurrent melanoma as soon as possible. Successful treatment of recurrent melanoma with targeted and immunological treatments is leading to significant improvements in survival even in advanced melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Most recurrences and new primaries are detected by patients between scheduled follow-up visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, guidelines recommend patients conduct monthly total skin self-examination (TSSE) during follow up. An American randomised trial showed that increasing the practice of TSSE in the short-term results in significantly more skin surgery (i.e. in greater detection and tackling of potential melanoma) in people with increased melanoma risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">However, currently people treated for melanoma are possibly missing opportunities for early detection of new primary and recurrent melanoma by not practising regular TSSE or not conducting it effectively. A Scottish study suggests that people delay raising concerns about early recurrence until their next hospital follow-up appointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There is also evidence from the UK and elsewhere that the practice of TSSE is suboptimal and not practised monthly as recommended by UK guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Barriers to initiating and maintaining TSSE include lack of initial training, declining motivation and insufficient time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All of these barriers are tackled by the Achieving Self-directed Integrated Cancer Aftercare (ASICA) intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The ASICA digital intervention supports high-quality TSSE by people with cutaneous melanoma, and appropriate clinical responses when they raise a concern. It is rigorously developed, digitally supported and theoretically based, using specified behaviour-change techniques to prompt users to perform regular TSSE. As reported in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the intervention was designed to incorporate specific “behaviour change techniques” or BCTs (i.e. the active ingredients that make up an intervention and are required to change behaviour). The BCTs included aimed to develop users’ knowledge and skills about TSSE (e.g. demonstrating the behaviour, rehearsing/practising); enhance/maintain motivation to perform TSSE (e.g. providing information on health consequences of the behaviour, using a credible source for the information); enhance confidence to conduct TSSE successfully (e.g. mastering the skills necessary) and enable self-regulation of action over time (e.g. providing prompts and cues to act, planning when, where, and how to perform TSSE). ASICA may enable earlier treatment and improved outcomes for patients and the National Health Service (NHS) by enabling prompt recognition and treatment of recurrent and new primary melanomas. The ASICA intervention was developed within the Medical Research Council (MRC) complex intervention framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and includes BCTs selected to address constructs of the underpinning theories (information-motivation-behaviour (IMB)) model plus control theory and implementation intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Development was guided by an expert multi-disciplinary group through several stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A systematic literature review was conducted, followed by interviews with potential recipients and a facilitated co-design event where all key stakeholders participated in the development of a prototype by acting out a full simulation: a tablet-based digital intervention to prompt and support TSSE, comprising instructional videos and electronic reporting (including photographs) to a clinical nurse specialist in dermatology with subsequent clinical triage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par44">The prototype was further developed in a preliminary 8-month feasibility study to establish its acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nineteen people treated for melanoma stages 0-2C and who were receiving structured hospital-based follow-up were recruited from six general practices in North-east Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Users were prompted by email each month to undertake TSSE and provide electronic feedback of their findings to the clinical nurse specialist. Qualitative interviews were conducted with the participants after 8 months. Most participants were strongly positive and adhered well to the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 15/19), and seven participants reported symptoms. Two underwent surgery as a result of participating; one with recurrent melanoma, the second with a benign compound naevus. Intention and confidence to conduct monthly TSSE increased. Issues to improve usability were identified and implemented. We concluded that ASICA is acceptable, safe and effective and offers potential to improve psychological well-being and enable earlier diagnosis of new primary and recurrent melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the non-randomised pre-pilot-study gave limited information on recruitment, acceptability, compliance and retention at one site. Also, we collected data on anxiety and depression, but not melanoma worry, and there was wide variability in the scores at baseline and variability in both the magnitude and direction of effect at follow-up, raising the possibility of a bi-directional effect on psychological outcomes that requires further exploration. This study aims to demonstrate that ASICA has the potential to benefit people with melanoma and is feasible to deliver in the NHS.</p>

The ASICA intervention app and individual skin-maps will be incorporated within a password-protected individual tablet computer to ensure confidentiality. The app is Android-configured and designed to run on a Samsung Galaxy tablet. The ASICA app comprises (1) an instructional video demonstrating how to conduct a sequential TSSE; (2) a digital skin map of the patient’s own skin; (3) a digital camera and instructions about how to take photographs of skin lesions; (4) a structured electronic TSSE report form, which can be sent to a clinical nurse skin cancer specialist (CNS), which can include photographs of skin lesions that the patient is concerned about. All reports are managed within a secure encrypted server. Participants randomised to the ASICA intervention will be invited to receive their tablet computer at a 60-min group training session held at the local recruiting centre. At these sessions intervention group participants will be instructed how to use the tablet computer and ASICA app to guide themselves through TSSE and send the findings electronically to the study server. Participants will have the opportunity to familiarise themselves with their tablet for a short time before their first skin TSSE. All aspects of using the tablet, from ensuring the internet is connected, detailed step by step instruction, contact details, screen shots of the app to hints and tips on taking photographs with the tablet are contained in a booklet that will be issued to each participant.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">Prompting to use ASICA: the intervention group will be supported by a clinical nurse specialist in dermatology based in Aberdeen and each month they will be prompted (using the participant’s favoured method of contact (phone, email, text or mail) to conduct a TSSE.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Performing and reporting TSSE using ASICA: participants will be asked to follow the TSSE procedure outlined in the integral animated ASICA demonstration and respond using the electronic report form.

Our pilot study suggests many concerns will be successfully resolved at this early stage.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">Further clinical action: where discussion and review of clinical images has not fully resolved the concerns of the patient and/or clinical nurse specialist, the clinical nurse specialist will discuss the case and review any clinical images with the site’s lead dermatologist, and an urgent clinic appointment will be arranged.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par67">All participants (intervention and control) will continue to attend their usual structured melanoma follow up as determined by local guidelines throughout the trial. Usual structured melanoma follow up consists of regular (3-monthly or 6-monthly) review appointments with a specialist skin physician or nurse conducted at the secondary care hospital outpatient department. The schedule of appointments is determined by the clinical features of the participant’s primary melanoma.</p>

              <title>Sample size</title>
              <p id="Par87">A formal power calculation is not needed as this is a pilot trial. However, we have made a pragmatic choice to conduct a relatively large (<italic>n</italic> = 240) pilot study for several reasons. The non-randomised pilot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] of 19 patients gave limited information on recruitment, acceptability, compliance and retention at one site. We collected HADS (but not MWS) data at baseline and at 6-month follow up. There was wide variation in the scores at baseline and variability in both magnitude and direction of effect at follow up. The feasibility study has therefore raised the possibility of a bi-directional effect on psychological outcomes, with a possible gender interaction, which now needs further exploration in a sample of sufficient size to have representation across the spectra of anxiety and cancer worry scales in both sexes and we believe this will be captured amongst 240 individuals. We need to ensure that ASICA does not adversely affect psychological outcomes and that there will be good adherence to ASICA in most participants, thereby confirming that ASICA could work within the NHS, before proceeding to a definitive trial powered to evaluate harder clinical outcomes (e.g. rates of recurrence and new melanoma, both quantified in the current study). Pragmatically therefore, we believe a sample size of 240 will provide a sufficiently diverse group of participants to provide this information. Although our trial is not powered to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes between groups it will provide valuable information on trial processes and on psychological and clinical outcomes to inform a definitive trial.</p>

              <p id="Par88">The Medical Statistics Team at the University of Aberdeen will be responsible for the statistical aspects of the trial. Data from patient case-notes, on the use of ASICA and from participant questionnaires will be entered into a dedicated secure website. In accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, primary analysis will be intention to treat, with a per-protocol sensitivity analysis. No interim analysis is planned. Baseline comparability between the intervention and control group in demographic characteristics, MWS, HADS and EuroQuol EQ-5D-5 L scores, self-reported TSSE practice, intention, self-efficacy and plans and clinical data will be evaluated by examining summary statistics (mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous variables, dependent on distribution and number (percentage) for categorical variables). Confidence intervals of between-group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes will be estimated using a repeated measures mixed model, before and after adjustment for potential confounders (including centre, age, gender, deprivation, baseline performance). The confidence intervals generated from the model will subsequently inform a power calculation for a definitive trial. The primary timepoint for outcome analyses will be 12 months after randomisation. The 1-year rate of detection of new primary melanomas, melanomas in-situ, dysplastic melanocytic lesions and recurrent melanomas will be tabulated by randomisation group. Service use and cost data will be summarised by group and compared using a mixed model approach before and after adjustment for pre-specified confounders. The relationship between ASICA usage data, including TSSE trajectories, and outcomes within and between intervention group participants will be examined by multilevel modelling; predictors of usage (including demographic, questionnaire and early TSSE) will be examined in between-participant analyses. Effect sizes of the primary outcomes will be calculated and practical issues affecting the conduct of a definitive RCT summarised. A comprehensive statistical analysis plan will be agreed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) prior to any analysis.</p>

The totality of the data will enable costs, practical issues and effect sizes to be identified for a future definitive RCT of the ASICA intervention. Data collection in the trial will focus on estimating the costs of the intervention and the use of primary or secondary NHS care by study participants. Participant costs will comprise self-purchased healthcare (e.g. prescription and over-the-counter medication related to the skin). Information will be collected using the participant-completed baseline, 3, 6 and 12-month questionnaires. Participants will be asked for information about use of private healthcare. Health service costs incurred as a consequence of the intervention will be recorded. Information on non-protocol visits made to any primary or secondary care provider will be obtained from the questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months and from the secondary care medical record review.</p>

              <p id="Par91">A facilitated co-design event attended by multiple stakeholders and involving five healthy volunteers was conducted in 2015; this helped us to develop the research questions and outcomes for the trial. This was combined with a short feasibility study in which 19 people treated for melanoma used the prototype for 8 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients’ priorities, experience and preferences expressed during these exercises helped to form the research questions and outcome measures for the study. This exercise also helped determine the burden of the intervention for trial participants, with prototype users confirming the feasibility of the intervention. During this trial two patient participants will form part of the Trial Steering Committee; these participants have been consulted throughout the design and recruitment and will continue to meet, receive and discuss reports for the duration of the study.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par97">This study will determine the effectiveness of the ASICA intervention in evaluating the effectiveness of total skin self-examination practice in those affected by melanoma. The study is timely given the growing interest and research activity around digital healthcare interventions in modern health services. Good-quality evidence is needed to inform policy and best practice in the field. This research project will implement and evaluate a rigorously developed and theoretically based digital intervention with real potential to improve patient outcome and the efficiency of services. A relatively large randomised controlled pilot trial is proposed. This will afford the opportunity to establish overall feasibility and trial procedures; however, the sample will be big enough to enable insight into practical issues from the perspective of the different population groups that would take part in a definitive trial and amongst whom the intervention would ultimately be implemented. A further important aspect of digital interventions is the potential impact they could have on wider resource use - in this case there is the possibility of a large increase in the use of skin-related NHS contacts. For this reason, data are being collected to determine any major impact on NHS resources at the earliest possible stage in the evaluation of this intervention. Further, the trial is designed to capture how well potential recipients of a digital intervention can actually use it and to exclude any major psychological impacts in the short-to-medium term. The addition of a structured process evaluation will lend insight into the practical issues of instituting and delivering this intervention. This is especially important given the two proposed study sites. This comes closer to modelling the challenges of implementing digital healthcare intervention than many digital pilot trials and is likely to provide information of value to others conducting research in the field, which goes beyond the specifics of this trial.</p>

              <p id="Par100">This project received full approval from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee on 28 April 2017 ((17/NS/0040). Recruitment will not begin at centres until both ethical and local R&amp;D approvals are obtained. Written informed consent will be obtained from all study participants. The trial will be conducted according to the principles of good clinical practice provided by research governance guidelines. We believe this study does not pose any specific risks to individual participants, nor does it raise any extraordinary ethical issues.</p>
