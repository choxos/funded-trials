                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression. Self-directed online CBT interventions have made CBT more accessible at a lower cost. However, adherence is often poor and, in the absence of therapist support, effects are modest and short-term. Delivering CBT online using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective; however, most existing platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions, without the support of between-session “homework” activities. The INTERACT intervention integrates online CBT materials and ‘high-intensity’ therapist-led CBT, delivered remotely in real-time. The INTERACT trial will evaluate this novel integration in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to therapists and clients.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Pragmatic, two parallel-group multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, with 434 patients recruited from primary care practices in Bristol, London and York. Participants with depression will be identified via General Practitioner record searches and direct referrals. Inclusion criteria: aged ≥ 18 years; score ≥ 14 on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); meeting International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for depression. Exclusion criteria: alcohol or substance dependency in the past year; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; psychosis; dementia; currently under psychiatric care for depression (including those referred but not yet seen); cannot complete questionnaires unaided or requires an interpreter; currently receiving CBT/other psychotherapy; received high-intensity CBT in the past four years; participating in another intervention trial; unwilling/unable to receive CBT via computer/laptop/smartphone. Eligible participants will be randomised to integrated CBT or usual care. Integrated CBT utilises the standard Beckian intervention for depression and comprises nine live therapist-led sessions, with (up to) a further three if clinically appropriate. The first session is 60–90 min via videocall, with subsequent 50-min sessions delivered online, using instant messaging. Participants allocated integrated CBT can access integrated online CBT resources (worksheets/information sheets/videos) within and between sessions.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Outcome assessments at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score at 6 months (as a continuous variable). A nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation will be conducted.</p>

              <p id="Par47">Computerised CBT interventions (cCBT) were designed to make CBT more accessible and widely available at a lower cost. However, adherence to cCBT is often poor and, in the absence of therapist support, effects are modest and short-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, cCBT is often inflexible and does not allow identification of conditional beliefs or detailed formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], yet the latter are crucial elements of CBT.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Therapist-delivered online CBT for depression using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, most existing platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions only, without the support of “homework” activities between sessions. Moreover, they also depend on the access to online sessions via a desktop computer, which can be a barrier to those who do not have access to a computer or share one with relatives, partners or friends. Making the platform also available on mobile devices could address these barriers, especially given that the use of smartphones to access the internet has greatly increased over the last 15 years: as of 2021, the vast majority (88%) of UK adults owned a smartphone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, interventions that incorporate online resources accessed via mobile devices may reach more effectively into people’s lives, allowing more immediate recording of thoughts and experiences. Mobile devices may also enable discreet and convenient completion of worksheets (such as thought diaries) thereby addressing concerns about the risk of “getting caught” completing homework tasks in public [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Use of such devices may therefore increase engagement with CBT “homework” which is an important mediator of outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">The INTERACT study is an 8-year programme of research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research that aims to integrate online CBT materials and high-intensity therapist-led individual CBT, delivered remotely in real-time by an accredited therapist, to people with depression. If effective, this form of integrated CBT could reduce costs and increase availability of CBT for people with depression, including those for whom access is difficult (e.g. working full-time/living in remote areas/with caring responsibilities and hard-to-reach groups).</p>
              <p id="Par50">The INTERACT research programme brings together a large multi-disciplinary team, including mental health academics and practitioners, human–computer interaction researchers, software engineers and end users. It consists of three stages. The first stage focused on: identifying clinical and cost-effective components of CBT to inform the design of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] development of an online platform for delivering integrated high-intensity CBT for depression and gathering additional design ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and feedback from key stakeholders such as CBT therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and patients with experience of CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The second stage involved a pilot evaluation of the therapy platform — delivering CBT to 17 primary care patients with depression, using the platform, and gathering detailed qualitative and technical feedback from patients and the therapists delivering the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This led to further refinements of the online platform, the integrated CBT resources, and training materials for therapists who will deliver the integrated intervention. This novel integration, which blends high-intensity therapist-led CBT with innovative use of technology, now needs to be evaluated in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability, to inform policy and practice. Therefore, this third and final phase of the INTERACT programme is a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to fully evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of this integrated approach to CBT for depression. This protocol relates to the RCT evaluation.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Prior to the start of this programme, no registered trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] integrated online materials with therapist-led CBT for depression. An EU project (E-COMPARED) of ‘blended care’ (face-to-face CBT and self-help) for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] has some similarities but, in our model, therapist contact takes place in real-time via instant messaging rather than in-person, and the online materials (e.g. worksheets to help the patient gather information and try out what they are learning in practice) are an integral part of therapy. A new trial has been registered recently (ISRCTN11129335) that will investigate blended CBT for depression (in-person CBT supported by a smartphone app (Elona therapy)). However, the major difference compared with this study and E-COMPARED is that we will compare our intervention with usual GP care, which may include including referral to NHS Talking Therapies (formerly known as IAPT services) or antidepressant medication as appropriate. In contrast, E-COMPARED is a non-inferiority comparison between ‘blended care’ and in-person CBT, and the comparison group for the Elona therapy trial is also in-person CBT. Given the continued difficulty in accessing in-person individual CBT in the UK with less than one-third of those with depression being seen in IAPT services by 2023/24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], neither trial answers a pragmatic question for UK primary care. In addition, data from other countries may not generalise more widely and a UK trial will provide cost-effectiveness data, which are required to inform the provision of NHS services. If clinically and cost-effective, this model of integrated CBT could easily be introduced into existing psychological services, increasing access to, and equity of, CBT provision.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par52">To establish (1) the clinical effectiveness and (2) cost-effectiveness of an integrated approach to delivering CBT in reducing depressive symptoms and improving quality of life over 12 months (compared with usual care) for primary care patients with depression.</p>
                <p id="Par53">In addition, a nested qualitative study will allow us to (1) explore patients’, therapists’ and supervisors’ views and experiences of using an integrated approach to delivering CBT; (2) understand patients’ reasons for completing or not completing treatment; and (3) assess patients’, therapists’ and supervisors’ views on how this novel approach affects the therapist-patient relationship.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment</title>
                  <p id="Par59">The trial aims to recruit participants with depression from primary care. We will use two methods of recruitment — namely, record search and in-consultation recruitment. Practices will be given the option of displaying an INTERACT poster on their premises. Recruitment will take place in general practices linked to the three trial centres and will be supported by well-established local NIHR Clinical Research Networks (CRNs). The planned recruitment period is 21 months, with a target of approximately 8 participants randomised per centre per month.</p>

                    <title>Method 1: record search</title>
                    <p id="Par60">GP practices will conduct a search of their computerised records for potentially eligible patients (defined as those who are aged 18 years or over, who have been diagnosed with depression). Practices will be asked to exclude those who would be unsuitable due to the exclusion criteria. The record search will be conducted using primary care diagnostic codes. Practices will be given the opportunity to manually screen the resulting list.</p>
                    <p id="Par61">Potentially eligible patients will then be mailed an invitation to participate by the GP practice, asking for their permission to be contacted by the research team. Patients who have not responded after two weeks will be sent one reminder letter by the practice.</p>
                    <p id="Par62">Patients will be able to respond anonymously if they wish to decline participation, and will be able to provide a reason for declining. Decliners will be asked to indicate whether they are willing to be interviewed briefly over the telephone about their reasons for declining, and if so to add their contact details to the form. We will also ask practices to provide anonymised data for all patients identified by the record search (age, gender, reason for exclusion by practice). These data will be used to report the generalisability of results.</p>

                    <title>Method 2: in consultation</title>
                    <p id="Par63">General Practices (Participant Identification Centres) can identify patients in consultation that they think might be suitable for the trial. They will introduce the trial and ask the patient for their permission to be contacted by the research team (verbal consent can be taken during telephone and videocall consultations).</p>
                    <p id="Par64">Potential participants who agree to contact via either recruitment method (letter/in consultation) will be telephoned by the local research team and asked a few brief screening questions to confirm their suitability for a baseline appointment. Those meeting the telephone screening criteria would then be invited to an appointment with a researcher to explain the trial, perform the baseline assessment, establish eligibility and obtain written informed consent.</p>

                  <title>Telephone screening</title>
                  <p id="Par65">Primary care patients who have been referred, or expressed interest by returning their postal invitation reply form, will be telephoned by a researcher from the local site. The researcher will briefly explain the study, check that a patient information sheet has been received, and answer any questions the participant may have.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">With verbal consent, the researcher will then proceed with the telephone screening questionnaire. This will include questions about demographic information and the main exclusion criteria. The screening call is likely to take 10–15 min. If telephone screening is not practical for the participant (e.g. if they are hard of hearing) we will make adaptations where possible (e.g. offer screening via post/email). A list of study questionnaires is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (SPIRIT table).</p>
                  <p id="Par67">If a participant meets the screening criteria, they will be offered a detailed eligibility screening appointment (baseline assessment) with the researcher.</p>

                  <title>Baseline assessment</title>
                  <p id="Par68">This appointment will last 1–1.5 h and will take place in-person at the patient’s home, GP surgery, the recruiting University’s premises, or other mutually convenient location, where it is safe to do so. Alternatively, the appointment will take place remotely, with the patient completing online questionnaires on their own smartphone, tablet or computer, and the researcher providing support via telephone or videocall. The local researcher will explain the study in more detail, answer questions the participant may have, and obtain written informed consent. The researcher will check whether the participant’s circumstances have changed since they completed the screening questionnaire (for example if they have subsequently started to receive therapy or been referred to secondary care) to check they are still eligible for a baseline assessment.</p>
                  <p id="Par69">Potentially eligible participants will then be asked to complete a number of questionnaires. These will include the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (a brief measure of depressive symptoms), and the Clinical Interview Schedule – Revised version (CIS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], an in-depth self-assessment of psychiatric symptoms that establishes whether an ICD-10 diagnosis of depression is met. Sociodemographic questions will include age, gender, employment status, qualifications, ethnicity, housing and marital status. Participants will also be asked for relevant medical history including co-morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and history of depression and treatment including antidepressant medication and adherence. They will be asked if they are willing for their summary data to be passed to their GP.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">Participants who score 14 or more on the BDI-II and have an ICD-10 primary diagnosis of depression on the CIS-R will be told they are eligible to enter the trial. Eligible participants will be asked to complete further questionnaires including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which are brief measures of depression and anxiety used in psychological services; the EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], a simple measure of impairment in functioning. They will also be asked to complete: the Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI) neuroticism subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; a personality scale (SAPAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; and a measure of trauma (PC-PTSD-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Eligible participants will be asked further questions about their history of depression and whether they have ever been referred to a psychiatrist. Additional information will be collected on life events, financial stress, social support and alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par71">Arrangements for starting therapy will be discussed with those allocated to receive the intervention and these individuals will also be shown how to log onto the therapy platform. The researcher will provide a brief client handout which summarises policies regarding confidentiality, cancelling or rescheduling sessions, contacting the therapist between sessions, safety, contact for technical queries, and downloading materials from the platform.</p>

                  <p id="Par72">Patients who do not meet the eligibility criteria at telephone screen or baseline may be eligible for rescreening. For example, those who are currently receiving a course of therapy could be rescreened once this course has ended. Patients who do not meet the BDI-II or ICD-10 criteria at baseline could be offered a rescreen as long as one month had elapsed since their original baseline appointment and the study was still recruiting.</p>

                  <title>Informed consent for trial participation</title>
                  <p id="Par73">Prior to commencing the baseline assessment, the researcher will obtain written informed consent from the patient relating to their participation in the trial, including consent to be approached regarding a qualitative interview. Informed consent will be obtained either via an online consent ‘e-consent’ method (if the baseline assessment is being conducted remotely by telephone or videocall) or via paper-based informed consent if the researcher is meeting with the patient face-to-face. In either case, patients will be able to ask the researcher questions prior to consenting. Patients attending a face-to-face appointment will be given a copy of their written consent form to keep and patients completing the assessment remotely will receive an electronic copy of their e-consent form via email. A copy will also be sent to the patient’s GP if they are eligible to take part in the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par74">Participants will be reminded that they are free to withdraw from the trial at any time without giving reasons and without prejudicing their further treatment. We will seek consent to use data collected up to the point of withdrawal, and this will be explained in the information sheet. In addition, in line with open-access data requirements, information may also be used to support other research in the future and may be shared anonymously with other researchers. This will be explained in the information sheet.</p>

                <p id="Par77">Randomisation will be stratified by centre and minimised on gender (male/female), current antidepressant use (yes/no), and depression severity using BDI-II tertiles derived from the CoBalT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] baseline scores (BDI-II ≤ 25; 26–35; ≥ 36). If participants indicate a non-binary gender at baseline, we will use an unpredictable computer-generated code to randomly select a binary gender code, prior to randomising them to a treatment group in the usual way. (Details of self-reported gender will be given in full as part of the reporting process.) We will use minimisation with a probability weighting of 0.8 to reduce predictability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Stratifying by centre will ensure a balance in terms of local differences and also proportionate workload for therapists. The minimisation variables are important prognostic indicators on which we wish to ensure a balance between the two groups.</p>

                <title>Method of implementing the randomisation/allocation sequence</title>
                <p id="Par78">The randomisation scheme will be developed independently by the Bristol Trials Centre (BTC) on behalf of the study. BTC will use a computer-generated code to produce a 1:1 randomisation sequence. This will be unpredictable and concealed from the study team by use of an automated, remote randomisation service, which is accessible by telephone or online.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Once eligibility has been confirmed at the baseline assessment, the researcher will enter the patient’s details onto BTC’s secure, 24-h randomisation system, either by telephone or online.</p>
                <p id="Par80">Once the details required for randomisation have been confirmed, the remote system will immediately reveal the allocation (integrated CBT intervention or usual care) to the research team. The researcher will inform the patient of the allocation during the baseline appointment where possible, or by telephone/email shortly afterwards.</p>
                <p id="Par81">Confirmation of the patient’s treatment allocation will be automatically and immediately emailed to the coordinating centre. The allocation will be recorded on the trial database. The local research team will send written confirmation of the allocation to the patient’s GP.</p>

                <p id="Par82">It will not be possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation because of the nature of the intervention. To eliminate the potential for observer bias, we will use self-reported outcome measures (e.g. BDI-II) to assess outcomes. These outcomes have been widely used in previous depression trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We are not using clinician-based measures of outcomes, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], as maintaining blinding would be difficult and thus the outcome assessment would be at a higher risk of bias.</p>

                <p id="Par94">To ensure that the results of the trial apply to standard clinical settings, we will recruit CBT practitioners comparable to those working as high-intensity therapists within IAPT services. Hence, therapists will be mental health professionals with appropriate post-qualification CBT training (British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP) accreditation) or equivalent experience. All therapists will be employed by the study or seconded to the study from local NHS Trusts/Psychological Services, for the duration of the study. Therapists will start 1 month before the start of delivery of therapy in order for them to receive training in the use of the platform and study procedures, and to enable them to familiarise themselves with the range of resources available. During the study, therapists will receive weekly supervision from an experienced therapist. This arrangement mimics local NHS practice and meets the standards for clinical supervision set out by the BABCP. Therapists will be provided with detailed training manuals and SOPs, e.g. for risk assessment and management.</p>
                <p id="Par95">Prior to the start of therapy, the researcher will give the participant a brief demonstration of the platform and its key features. Participants will also be sent a brief handout which summarises policies regarding client confidentiality, cancelling or rescheduling sessions, contacting the therapist between sessions, safety, contact for technical queries, and downloading materials from the platform as well as a user guide to the platform, which outlines key features and tips for use. They will receive login details to the platform before the first session to enable them to create an account and familiarise themselves with the platform prior to this first session. They will also be asked to provide some brief details about the problems that bring them to therapy, previous treatment, depressive symptoms (using the PHQ-9) and to plan for their first session within the platform. The therapist will be able to answer any queries regarding the platform during the first session. Participants will be able to view the various psychoeducational resources (e.g. information sheets and short animations) within the platform once they log in but other worksheets/resources will be released as appropriate (tailored to the individual) by the therapist during treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par96">The first therapy session will take place face-to-face via videocall (independent of the INTERACT platform) and may take up to 90 min. This longer duration will enable the completion of history taking, introduction of the CBT model and other relevant psychoeducation. In addition, therapists will help the patient become familiar with the INTERACT platform.</p>
                <p id="Par97">Subsequent therapy sessions will take place online using the INTERACT platform and will usually last 50 min. The platform enables the patient and therapist to communicate online in real-time and to use a collaborative workspace to view, edit and discuss CBT resources within the platform. Online communication will take place using instant messaging and may also involve the telephone. As per standard in-person CBT, therapists and patients will agree tasks (“homework”) for the patient to try between therapy sessions. These tasks will utilise materials embedded within the INTERACT platform, such as interactive CBT worksheets which can be typed into, and other psychoeducational materials. Examples of completed worksheets are available to aid understanding. Patients will also be able to access transcripts of their online sessions.</p>
                <p id="Par98">The platform will allow patients to send their therapist a message between sessions, e.g. if they need to rearrange a session, or in relation to an agreed between-session task. Patients will be advised that therapists will address queries about tasks during the next scheduled session.</p>
                <p id="Par99">The expectation is that the first four therapy sessions will take place weekly. Later therapy sessions may be spaced at fortnightly or monthly intervals.</p>
                <p id="Par100">It is possible that patients and therapists may reach an ‘agreed end’ of therapy in less than nine sessions where clinically appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par101">In <italic>exceptional</italic> circumstances, it may be clinically appropriate for a therapist to offer a videocall or telephone session instead of an online instant messaging session and/or to offer an additional therapy session (e.g. to enable safeguarding issues to be adequately and sensitively addressed). The justification for additional sessions or face-to-face videocall or telephone contact time will be discussed with the Clinical Supervisor where possible, agreed with the Clinical Principal Investigator (PI), and logged in the clinical notes.</p>
                <p id="Par102">At the end of therapy, patients will be offered the opportunity to download materials (e.g. worksheets, information sheets and therapy session transcripts) from the platform for future use. The patient’s GP will be informed that they have completed therapy, if they withdraw from therapy, or are discharged for non-attendance.</p>

Anonymised platform usage data will be used to understand and describe the delivery of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par110">The platform will also record the content of therapy. This includes any editing of session preparation materials (agendas and depression questionnaires), online CBT worksheets and session notes (i.e. information added by therapists and patients) and therapy voice communication/instant messaging transcripts. Access to this information will be restricted to the patient, therapist, their clinical supervisor(s) and, where appropriate, the site clinical lead for the purposes of delivering the therapy. However, patients will be asked to provide additional (optional) written consent for this information to be shared with the wider research team. Where consent is given, this information will be used to understand how the therapy platform (including online CBT worksheets) is used, to inform improvements to the platform’s design, to monitor the quality of treatment provided, and look at the skill required to deliver integrated CBT.</p>

                  <title>Justification of sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par122">The NICE depression guidelines group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] suggested that 0.35SD represents a clinically important difference on our primary outcome, which is approximately 4–5 points on the BDI-II (IPCRESS/CoBalT: standard deviation 12.9/13.9). On this basis, 173 participants in each group give 90% power to detect a difference of 0.35 standard deviations on the BDI-II at a two-sided 5% significance level. Assuming 20% attrition at 6 months, we need to recruit 434 patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par123">However, given that referral to IAPT may be part of usual care for the comparator group, it is possible that this may affect the plausibility of the target difference between groups. While it is difficult to determine the impact of this, if the difference to be detected was reduced to 0.30 SD and we achieve a slightly higher follow-up rate (85%) in line with previous trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with a total sample size of 434 patients, we would still have adequate (&gt; 80%) power to detect such a difference (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> below).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sensitivity of sample size calculation to changes in plausible target difference between groups and variations in required power and attrition at 6 months</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"/><th align="left"><bold>Power</bold></th><th align="left" colspan="2"><bold>80% power</bold></th><th align="left" colspan="2"><bold>90% power</bold></th></tr><tr><th align="left">Attrition at 6 months</th><th align="left">15%</th><th align="left">20%</th><th align="left">15%</th><th align="left">20%</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><bold>Difference to be detected</bold></td><td align="left">0.35 SD</td><td align="left">306</td><td align="left">326</td><td align="left">408</td><td align="left">434</td></tr><tr><td align="left">0.30 SD</td><td align="left">414</td><td align="left">440</td><td align="left">554</td><td align="left">588</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par124">We have not inflated our sample size to account for clustering by therapist as there was little evidence of any therapist effects in our previous trials of CBT for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the continuous BDI outcome (adjusted for baseline BDI score) were very small for CoBalT (0.0027) and for IPCRESS, its precise value could not be estimated indicating it was almost zero. Hence, inflating the sample size to account for any potential clustering by therapist would be unduly conservative. Nevertheless, we will use established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] to obtain a fully heteroscedastic model to explore any potential therapist effects in secondary analyses.</p>

                  <p id="Par130">We will employ a traffic-light system to judge the success of our internal pilot. If we achieve at least 70% of our target for recruitment and engagement with the intervention and have commenced recruitment at other sites, then we will continue the study. However, if appropriate, we will explore the reasons for not achieving the target and whether any modifications to recruitment processes are required dependent on the emerging recruitment rate trajectory. If we achieve between 50 and 70% of our recruitment and engagement targets, and/or have not commenced recruitment at other sites, then we will discuss with our Trial Steering Committee whether we should make changes to the recruitment/therapy processes and whether we should continue. If we recruit less than 50% of our recruitment and engagement targets and have not commenced recruitment in other sites, then we would stop the trial. We believe that these progression criteria are realistic based on our experience and account for the fact that recruitment builds over the early months of a trial.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and account for the fact that two recruiting sites (London and Hull/York) will have had only a short period to commence recruitment. The second target is based on data from our previous CBT trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] in which 9–13% of those randomised to receive the intervention did not attend any sessions and a further 3–7% of participants only attended one session with a therapist, giving an overall percentage of 12–19% attending fewer than two sessions.</p>

Analyses of continuous secondary outcomes will be conducted in the same manner as the primary outcome and binary secondary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression adjusting for stratification/minimisation variables. We will undertake exploratory analyses using regression methods to examine the impact of process measures such as the extent of involvement in CBT/other interventions (including the use of the INTERACT platform), use of online materials, and therapeutic alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par135">In all analyses, we will present regression coefficients (for continuous outcomes) or odds ratios (OR) (for binary outcomes), with 95% confidence intervals and p values. Repeated measures analyses will incorporate outcomes over the 12 months.

Coding frames will be developed for each interview set, e.g., participants, therapists and supervisors, decliners and participants exiting the trial. Once a coding frame has been agreed upon, transcripts will be imported into the software package NVivo to allow electronic coding and data retrieval. Following this, data pertaining to each code will be summarised in tables using an approach based on Framework analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This will enable comparisons to be made within and across the interviews, to identify thematic patterns and deviant cases, highlighting the views participants hold toward specific issues, e.g. the value of the initial face-to-face videocall and the use of worksheets between sessions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par164">The INTERACT trial will be the first large multi-centre trial to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an integrated approach to delivering CBT in the UK over 12 months. The nested qualitative study provides insight into patients’, therapists’ and supervisors’ views and experiences of this approach to treating depression. Trial participants will be recruited from a wide range of primary care practices across the three study centres, based in urban and rural, affluent and deprived communities across the UK, thus maximising the generalisability of trial findings. Therapists will have a comparable experience to those working as high-intensity therapists within IAPT services, ensuring that the results of the trial apply to standard clinical settings in the UK.</p>
              <p id="Par165">INTERACT is a trial that is highly relevant to patients and the NHS, particularly in the context of increased levels of depression and anxiety in the community following the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for online delivery of psychological therapy is now widely recognised, yet there is very little evidence of the effectiveness of high-intensity online interventions. The results of the INTERACT trial will provide a robust estimate of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this novel approach to delivering CBT and hence the evidence base for the treatment of depression in UK primary care.</p>

                    <p id="Par171">The TSC is an independent, multidisciplinary group chaired by André Tylee (Professor of Primary Care Mental Health) until July 2021, by Sandra Eldridge (Professor of Biostatistics) until October 2021, and thereafter by Ed Watkins (Professor of Experimental and Applied Clinical Psychology). Other members are Shaun Lawson (Professor of Social Computing), Philip Pallmann (Deputy Director Research Design and Conduct Service and Research Fellow), Michael Moore (Professor of Primary Health Care Research), Marta Sawinska (patient representative), and Mark Tucker (patient representative). Their role is to provide independent oversight, progress monitoring, and expert advice during the conduct of the trial. TSC meetings are also attended by NW, DK, TP, SM and DT from the INTERACT team. Meetings take place at least annually and more frequently if judged necessary.</p>
                    <p id="Par172">This group has previously acted as the Programme Steering Committee for the INTERACT programme of research.</p>

                    <p id="Par173">The DMEC is an independent, multidisciplinary group whose role is to safeguard the interests of trial participants, monitor the safety and efficacy of the intervention, and monitor the overall conduct of the study. The DMEC will advise the TSC on whether there are any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should not continue. DMEC meetings will be held at least annually but more frequently if necessary. The DMEC comprises David Kingdon (DMEC Chair; Emeritus Professor of Mental Health Care Delivery), Chris Burton (Professor of Primary Medical Care), and Nikki Totton (Medical Statistician). A DMEC Charter outlines the role and responsibilities of the DMEC, and any competing interests.</p>
