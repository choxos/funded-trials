                </p>
                <p>‘Open Dialogue’ is a social network model of crisis and continuing mental healthcare which involves elements of service delivery such as immediate response and a style of therapeutic meeting called network meetings. Although there are indications from non-randomised studies that it may help people in their recovery from severe mental health crises and improve long-term outcomes, this has yet to be tested in a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This paper outlines the protocol for a multi-site cluster-randomised control trial assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Open Dialogue compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for individuals presenting in crisis to six mental health services in England. The primary outcome is time to relapse, with secondary outcomes including measures of recovery and service use. Participants will be followed-up for two years, with data collected from electronic medical records and researcher-led interviews. The analysis will compare outcomes between treatment groups as well as investigating potential mediators of effect: shared decision-making and social network quality and size. Carers of a subsample of participants will be asked about their experiences of shared decision-making, carer burden, and satisfaction.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0035">Mental health conditions often involve notable changes in behaviour, thinking and emotion associated with distress, functional impairment and reduced quality of life [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A mental health crisis in this study is defined as a mental health emergency, requiring an urgent response arising from a high risk of harm to self or others or a rapid increase in symptoms of psychosis or severe mood disorder, and which have a significant impact on personal or social functioning.</p>
              <p id="p0040">Those experiencing a mental health ‘crisis’, who are deemed to be at immediate risk to themselves (including suicide) or others or whose symptoms are rapidly worsening often require urgent specialist mental health support [<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the English system of state-funded healthcare, there are functionally distinct teams for treating those whose mental health needs are greater than can be met by primary care services [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Prompt access to care for those experiencing a crisis may lead to better long-term outcomes and reduced relapse [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the English mental health care system this led to the development of Crisis and Home Treatment Teams [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to provide short-term, intensive support as an alternative to hospital admission, alongside Community Mental Health Teams [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which could provide long-term care if needed.</p>
              <p id="p0045">However, the need to move between different services during what can be an isolating and disturbing experience for an individual and their family and carers [<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] has been criticised, with service-users reporting dissatisfaction with the quality of care they have received in the current system [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given that on-going relationships with professionals has been identified as fundamental to recovery for service users [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], it is not surprising that disruptions to continuity of care may result in poorer mental health outcomes [<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, there are questions around the effectiveness of these distinct teams and whether they are able to meet their specific functions, with a recent survey finding only 19% of service users reporting a ‘very good’ experience with their community mental health team [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and mixed evidence on whether crisis teams reduce the need for hospital admissions [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0050">Open Dialogue is a person-centred, social network model of crisis and continuing mental healthcare where continuity of care is a key organisational principle [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is both a therapeutic practice and a way of organizing a mental health service, and follows seven principles such as ‘immediate help’ and ‘psychological continuity’ [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The central means of intervention delivery is through ‘network meetings’: conversations between the service user, those important to them (such as family, formal and informal carers, and friends), and typically two Open Dialogue practitioners who remain with the same network throughout an episode of care [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These meetings encourage a shared understanding of the problems leading to a person's contact with the service and shared decision-making about any pharmacological, psychological, or social interventions [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is suggested that this may increase feelings of agency, and the ability to develop and maintain mutual supportive relationships in the longer term [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0055">Non-randomised studies have suggested that Open Dialogue may be associated with better mental health outcomes and reduced hospital admissions, ([<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, there is not yet the high-quality evidence for the clinical or cost effectiveness of Open Dialogue to support its widespread implementation [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This paper presents the design of and methods for a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, which seeks to provide this evidence for Open Dialogue teams implemented in the English National Health Service (NHS).</p>

                <title>Study setting and timeline</title>
                <p id="p0095">The trial takes place in six mental health services from inner and outer London, a large university town in the southeast of England and the surrounding suburban and rural communities, and a large costal conurbation in the south-west of England and its surrounding rural communities. The populations served vary considerably in the degree of social deprivation, available community resources and the structure of local mental health services. To commence recruitment, services must meet adequate fidelity to the model of care (see ‘monitoring intervention delivery’).</p>
                <p id="p0100">Participant recruitment commenced in the first site in June 2019, and all other sites were able to open to recruitment by January 2020. The protocol was registered during this set-up period (in December 2019). Recruitment was suspended in March 2020 (to reduce pressure on health services in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic) and restarted across the six sites from August 2020 to December 2020. Recruitment will stop in December 2021, the primary outcome will be available from December 2023, and data analysis will commence in early 2024.</p>

Inclusion criteria are as follows:<list list-type="simple" id="l0015"><list-item id="li0050"><label>•</label><p id="p0110">Each cluster must consist of two to four geographically co-terminous general practices (their catchment areas share a geographical boundary). There must be a clear and pre-existing shared referral pathway to a community mental health service, and a total of 65–75 patients per year referred to mental health crisis services.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0055"><label>•</label><p id="p0115">Each general practice within the cluster should refer only within the catchment area of the community mental health service, refer at least 10 people per year to mental health crisis services, and have 2000 or more patients registered with the practice.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="p0120">Once a mental health service has been recruited, GP practices within its catchment area are assessed and grouped into clusters in line with the cluster eligibility criteria. Relevant details of all the clusters from each catchment area are then sent to the trial statistician who randomly allocates in a 1:1 ratio to Open Dialogue or TAU. Cluster randomisation is stratified by catchment area of the local mental health services and restricted randomisation [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is used to balance two continuous aggregated cluster-level covariates ‘average GP list size’ and ‘average IMD deprivation rate 2015’ [<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] across the two trial arms and the strata. Where there are changes to general practices that form the basis of clusters (for example, two initially separate general practices merging to form a single practice) after cluster allocation, we aim to preserve selection of participants from the original clusters as far as possible.</p>

                  <p id="p0170">Thirty clusters, with 19 participants each, provide an initial sample size of 570 participants, with a projected 540 participants being observed during the follow-up period. Following Freedman's [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] formula, a total of 157 participants was calculated as being needed to relapse during the 24-month follow-up period to detect an HR = 0.589 or more, with 90% power using a log-rank test at the 5% significance level. Following a method by Rutterford, Copas, and Eldridge [<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], this number was inflated by our design effect (design effect = 1 + (obs.

This gives a requirement of 264 relapses during the 24-month follow-up period. Assuming an average relapse rate of 49%, this requires an effective sample size of 264/0.49 = 538 participants.</p>

                <p id="p0180">The primary outcome, time to relapse from recovery, will be analysed using Cox regression, where time to relapse will be the dependent variable, with fixed explanatory variables of trial arm, and stratification factor (catchment area of the mental health service), and cluster-level balancing variables of general practice list size, and Index of Multiple Deprivation. The model will also contain a random intercept that varies at the level of the catchment area to account for general practice cluster effects.</p>

Specifically, we will estimate the direct (non-mediated by networking) and indirect (mediated by networking) effects of Open Dialogue on time to relapse. For this purpose, social network quality, social network size, and shared decision-making at 6 months will be assessed as potential mediators. Confounders of the relationship between network quality and relapse (e.g. social network score or symptom severity at first research interview) will be measured and included in the mediation modelling. A complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will also be undertaken to estimate the effect of actually receiving the intervention using instrumental variables regression.</p>

              <title>Intervention delivery</title>
              <p id="p0210">Open Dialogue teams offer care from initial presentation in crisis through to discharge from the service, typically through ‘network meetings’ which include the service user, people they identify as important to them such as family members, and two or more Open Dialogue Practitioners. The agenda is set by the network, and there is a strong emphasis on service-user participation in any treatment decisions. Wherever possible, the same practitioners remain with the network throughout. Teams are multidisciplinary, typically including nurses, social workers, peer practitioners, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists, all of whom have undertaken an Open Dialogue training programme. Services are underpinned by the seven key principles of Open Dialogue: (1) Immediate Help; (2) A Social Network Perspective; (3) Flexibility and Mobility; (4) Responsibility; (5) Psychological Continuity; (6) Tolerance of Uncertainty; and (7) Dialogue and Polyphony [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. They are ‘needs-adapted’ and network meetings take place as little or often as required by the network, perhaps occurring twice weekly in the time immediately after referral, moving to weekly or fortnightly as treatment progresses, whilst also working flexibly in collaboration with other services [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. There is an ‘open discharge policy’, with service users able to ask for further network meetings at any point after discharge from the service, ideally with the same practitioners.</p>
              <p id="p0215">TAU is current routine crisis care and continuing community care, as delivered by English mental health services. This is based on a model which comprises a number of multi-disciplinary teams, the provision of care coordination, and a range of community and in-patient interventions and support.</p>
              <p id="p0220"> Participants in both trial arms may be offered any intervention they would ordinarily have access to individual psychological and pharmacological interventions, social, and housing support. The duration of contact is determined by each team, based on clinical need. Those with complex problems may receive continuing care for the duration of the study. Open Dialogue is not offered to those in the TAU arm. The provision of mental health services after the follow-up period has ended will be the responsibility of the participants' current mental healthcare provider.</p>
              <p id="p0225">All teams in the trial were required to deliver care adequately (according to adherence and fidelity criteria detailed below), and to produce a site-specific operational policy which described care pathways and met trial requirements for Open Dialogue services prior to recruitment of trial participants. All Open Dialogue trained staff are offered annual refresher training.</p>

                <title>Monitoring intervention delivery</title>
                <p id="p0230">The fidelity of service delivery in both the Open Dialogue and TAU teams is assessed to ensure that that the core structural components of services are delivered as intended. The ODDESSI fidelity measure [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] draws on an existing measure [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and is based on interviews with service staff and review of documentation. Four key aspects of service functioning are rated: (1) Team structure and culture, (2) Access and engagement, (3) Delivery of care, (4) External support. To meet fidelity services must score at least 2.4 of 4 on each of the above.</p>
                <p id="p0235">The extent the core therapeutic components of Open Dialogue are delivered within a network meeting is measured using the Open Dialogue Adherence scale [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which was developed from (and closely aligned with) a previous adherence measure [<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Audio recordings are assessed by trained raters and scored according to the key elements of dialogic practice [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and then rated as ‘acceptable’ or ‘unacceptable’. In ‘acceptable’ tapes at least two thirds of statements used by practitioners are dialogic (rather than monologic) and less than two statements are patronizing or disrespectful, and at least 10 out of 12 of the items based on the key elements of dialogic practice score ‘acceptable’.</p>
                <p id="p0240">All Open Dialogue and TAU teams are monitored prior to participant recruitment and at 6-monthly intervals throughout intervention delivery. Where fidelity or adherence is identified as falling below the pre-determined levels, remedial action is taken, and recruitment may be stopped locally in that cluster if the problem persists despite remedial action. Actual intervention or ‘dose’ received: the number, date, and mode of delivery of clinical meetings, is also recorded at a participant level.</p>

Follow-up interviews are undertaken at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months from baseline (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

Oversight is provided by a Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP), an independent Programme Steering Committee (PSC), and an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). All changes to trial protocol are reviewed and agreed by the PSC, and DMC if relevant, prior to implementation. Any protocol amendments are submitted to the Ethics Committee for review and if approved, circulated to trial sites and research staff.</p>

                <title>Changes to protocol</title>
                <p id="p0315">Our initial sample size was 644 participants: 28 clusters each with 23 participants. We subsequently exceeded our cluster recruitment target by 4 clusters, but 2 clusters (the 7th mental health service) withdrew prior to participant recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the pause to recruitment due to the pandemic in 2020 we reviewed the original sample size calculation and recalculated based on 30 clusters and a more accurate estimate of attrition (5% attrition as opposed to the 15% originally used). All other parameters in the sample size calculation remained the same.</p>
                <p id="p0320">The onset of the pandemic meant a rapid move to remote delivery of Open Dialogue and TAU. To assist with this, a Remote Working Guidance Group consisting of national and international experts in Open Dialogue, trial clinicians, services users, and carers collaborated on the development of a Remote Working Protocol [<xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] which was implemented alongside each site's local remote working protocols. The criteria for adherence and fidelity (detailed above) are equally applied to services before and after the onset of the pandemic.</p>
                <p id="p0325">Research procedures (such as baseline and follow-up participant interviews, attending meetings with the clinical teams, etc.) moved to primarily remote delivery. Additional data are collected on the mode of delivery of clinical meetings (i.e., face-to-face, telephone call, video conference, or a combination) to support an exploration of the impact this has on outcomes.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0330">This paper presents details of the trial design, intervention delivery, and research processes of the first large-scale multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial of Open Dialogue, a person-centred, social network model of crisis and continuing mental healthcare. In this trial, adults presenting in crisis to mental health services in six areas of England are offered either Open Dialogue, or treatment as usual, and their mental health and service use monitored over the subsequent two years.</p>
              <p id="p0335">The trial seeks to assess whether Open Dialogue is more effective in helping individuals with severe mental illness to reach a state of recovery which is robust against relapses than Treatment as Usual. The trial participants are identified on the basis of experiencing a mental health crisis and the need for specialist secondary mental health care, rather than a specific diagnosis. This is not typical of other Open Dialogue and related research (e.g. [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>]), but increases the generalisability of the results and the potential that Open Dialogue could provide an alternative to the functional team based model of mental healthcare [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In order to achieve this, exclusion criteria are kept to an absolute minimum. The inclusion of measures of cost, and a health economic analysis, will mean the economic viability of Open Dialogue as an alternative to usual care may also be established.</p>
              <p id="p0340">Monitoring of the delivery of Open Dialogue is an important part of this trial's design. The teams were established and deliver care within existing NHS service structures. For this reason the teams vary somewhat in their structure and relationship to existing services and are governed by different Trusts with different local policies and procedures, and varying care pathways. Adaptations to the model have been needed and were set out in operational requirements of an Open Dialogue Service within the NHS, and in particular to ensure that the intervention would be appropriate for those with depression, anxiety, eating disorders and personality disorders, as well as for those with psychotic disorders where much of the early work on Open Dialogue took place [<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Maintaining a high-quality Open Dialogue service in this context can be challenging, particularly where structural changes impact on, for example, the re-organization of in-patient services and the development of a single points of entry for crisis referrals.</p>
              <p id="p0345">The secondary outcomes will allow for an exploration of whether improvements in social networks or involvement in decision making about mental health treatment decisions mediates any treatment effect. It has been suggested that Open Dialogue may improve outcomes through increasing a sense of agency and the ability to develop and maintain mutual supportive relationships [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Shared decision-making and social network size and quality will be investigated as potential mediators of treatment effect.</p>
              <p id="p0350">We will publish the results of the trial in a peer-reviewed open access journal article (expected to be early 2024). Further dissemination of findings will include journal articles, conference presentations, patient and public involvement events, and a plain language summary of findings online [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. If Open Dialogue is found to be more clinically and cost-effective in preventing relapse and aiding recovery in this population, this will have important implications for the organization and delivery of mental health services in the UK and internationally.</p>
