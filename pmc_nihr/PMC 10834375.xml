                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Older adults were more likely to be socially isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased risk of depression and loneliness. We aimed to investigate whether a behavioural activation intervention delivered via telephone could mitigate depression and loneliness in at-risk older people during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>BASIL+ (Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation) was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial conducted among patients recruited from general practices in England and Wales, and was designed to assess the effectiveness of behavioural activation in mitigating depression and loneliness among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible participants were aged 65 years and older, socially isolated, with a score of 5 or higher on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and had multiple long-term conditions. Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (behavioural activation) or control groups by use of simple randomisation without stratification. Behavioural activation was delivered by telephone; participants were offered up to eight weekly sessions with trained BASIL+ Support Workers. Behavioural activation was adapted to maintain social connections and encourage socially reinforcing activities. Participants in the control group received usual care with existing COVID-19 wellbeing resources. The primary clinical outcome was self-reported depression severity, assessed by the PHQ-9, at 3 months. Outcomes were assessed masked to allocation and analysis was by treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN63034289).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 8, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022, 449 eligible participants were identified and 435 from 26 general practices were recruited and randomly assigned (1:1) to the behavioural activation intervention (n=218) or to the control group (usual care with signposting; n=217). The mean age of participants was 75·7 years (SD 6·7); 270 (62·1%) of 435 participants were female, and 418 (96·1%) were White. Participants in the intervention group attended an average of 5·2 (SD 2·9) of eight remote behavioural activation sessions. The adjusted mean difference in PHQ-9 scores between the control and intervention groups at 3 months was –1·65 (95% CI –2·54 to –0·75, p=0·0003). No adverse events were reported that were attributable to the behavioural activation intervention.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Behavioural activation is an effective and potentially scalable intervention that can reduce symptoms of depression and emotional loneliness in at-risk groups in the short term. The findings of this trial add to the range of strategies to improve the mental health of older adults with multiple long-term conditions. These results can be helpful to policy makers beyond the pandemic in reducing the global burden of depression and addressing the health impacts of loneliness, particularly in at-risk groups.</p>

              <p id="para10">The mental health of the population deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> People reported greater social isolation, and the incidence of depression and anxiety increased for older people and those with medical vulnerabilities.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> A plausible reason for this deterioration was that COVID-19 restrictions led to disruption of daily routines, loss of social contact, and heightened isolation and increased loneliness. Social isolation, social disconnectedness, perceived isolation, and loneliness are known to be linked to common mental health problems, such as depression in older people.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Loneliness is a risk factor for depression and seems detrimental to physical health and life expectancy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> It is recognised that strategies that maintain social connectedness could be important in ensuring the mental health of older people.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Behavioural activation is an evidence-based psychological treatment that explores how physical inactivity and low mood are linked to and result in a reduction of valued activities.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Within behavioural activation, the therapist and patient work together to develop a collaborative treatment plan to reinstate (or replace, if former activities are no longer possible) behaviours that connect people to sources of positive reinforcement (ie, meaningful activities), including social connectedness.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">Before designing the BASIL+ trial we updated reviews of behavioural activation. We searched key databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, CENTRAL, and DARE) for English language publications from database inception to June 1, 2020, for collaborative care studies and trials of behavioural activation, and independently extracted data. We used search terms relating to loneliness and social isolation (“[Loneliness” OR “Lonel* OR social isolat*]”), combined with terms for behavioural activation (“[exp behavior therapy/ OR exp behavior modification/ OR behavior change/ OR behavior contracting/behavioral activation system/]”) and collaborative care (“[exp Collaborative Care OR exp Shared Care OR exp Integrative Care]”). We included randomised controlled trials conducted in any country or care setting in adults and older adults with depression. We found no large-scale UK trials of collaborative care and no large-scale trials of behavioural activation (and no meta-analyses of trials) addressing loneliness in socially isolated older people in any setting.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">To the best of our knowledge, the BASIL+ trial is the first large-scale, fully powered trial of a brief psychological intervention to mitigate loneliness, alongside other common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. The findings of this trial demonstrate that it is feasible to deliver a behavioural activation intervention for older people with long-term conditions who were socially isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older people readily engaged with behavioural activation as a remotely delivered (via telephone) psychological intervention. The results of the BASIL+ trial contribute to the evidence base for behavioural or cognitive interventions.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Behavioural activation was a plausible intervention to mitigate depression and loneliness in at-risk older populations during the COVID-19 pandemic; this evidence will be useful to practitioners and policy makers beyond the pandemic in preventing loneliness in vulnerable populations.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para100">Behavioural activation is known to be effective in treating depression in older adults,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and small-scale trials of behavioural activation delivered to socially isolated older people have produced encouraging preliminary results,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> making this a credible candidate approach. In March–April, 2020, we adapted an ongoing programme of work into the role of behavioural activation in multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidities) to answer the following overarching question: can a brief behavioural intervention delivered via telephone mitigate depression and loneliness in at-risk older people during COVID-19 isolation?</p>
              <p id="para110">The results of an external pilot trial of the Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL+) intervention showed a significant effect in reducing loneliness at 3 months in the behavioural activation group compared with the control group (De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale: adjusted mean difference –0·87; 95% CI –1·56 to –0·18).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Evidence from a living systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021298788)<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> shows a growing evidence base of the clinical effectiveness of cognitive or behavioural approaches, or both, in mitigating the effects of loneliness (standardised mean difference [SMD] –0·48, 95% CI –0·70 to –0·27) and depression (SMD –0·31, 95% CI –0·51 to –0·11).</p>
              <p id="para120">The BASIL+ trial was a fully powered multicentre randomised controlled trial of manualised behavioural activation, adapted specifically to be delivered at scale and remotely (via telephone) to older adults who were at risk of social isolation as a consequence of COVID-19 restrictions (including in the post-pandemic period); we aimed to investigate whether this behavioural activation intervention could mitigate depression and loneliness in this population.</p>

                <p id="para150">Based on the definition of multimorbidity used by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> we recruited older adults (aged ≥65 years) with two or more physical long-term conditions from primary care registers in 26 general practices in England and Wales. Eligible participants had to have a score of 5 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), putting them at risk of clinical depression or indicating already established minor depressive symptoms. Eligible participants included those who were subject to UK Government guidelines about COVID-19 self-isolation, physical distancing, and shielding as relevant to their health conditions and age.</p>
                <p id="para160">We excluded older adults who had cognitive impairment, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or psychotic symptoms; alcohol or drug dependence; were in the palliative phase of illness; had active suicidal ideation; were receiving psychological therapy; or were unable to speak or understand English. Older adults living in residential or care homes were not excluded.</p>
                <p id="para170">Potentially eligible patients were identified and contacted via telephone by staff working at general practices. Interested patients could also complete an online consent form or contact the study team directly. Once eligibility had been ascertained, additional informed consent was obtained (where online consent had not already been provided). In response to the need to deliver the trial remotely, the informed consent process involved taking consent verbally via telephone.</p>
                <p id="para180">The BASIL+ trial received ethical approval from the Yorkshire and the Humber–Leeds West Research Ethics Committee on Dec 11, 2021 (Ref: 20/YH/0347). The sponsor for BASIL+ was Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust.</p>

Participants were then randomly assigned and informed of their group allocation (the BASIL+ intervention or usual care with signposting). Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio by use of simple randomisation without stratification. The allocation schedule was generated in Stata version 16 by York Trials Unit staff not otherwise involved in recruitment. Treatment allocation was concealed from study researchers at the point of recruitment by use of an automated computer data entry system, administered remotely by the York Trials Unit, UK. Owing to the nature of the intervention, participants, general practices, study clinicians, and BASIL+ Support Workers could not be masked to treatment allocation. Researchers facilitating the telephone-based outcome assessments were masked to treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para200">The behavioural activation intervention (within a collaborative care framework) was adapted for the purposes of the BASIL+ trial; a description of the adaptation for social isolation due to COVID-19 has been published previously.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The overall content and delivery of the intervention was informed by detailed qualitative preparatory work.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Briefly, behavioural activation is a structured, brief, simple psychotherapeutic approach designed to increase engagement in rewarding and adaptive activities, decrease engagement in activities that maintain depression, and solve problems that limit access to rewards or that maintain avoidance.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para210">Within the BASIL behavioural activation intervention, the therapist (the BASIL+ Support Worker) and participant worked together to develop a collaborative treatment plan to reinstate (or replace, if former activities were no longer possible because of social isolation or long-term conditions, or both) behaviours that connect participants to sources of positive reinforcement (ie, valued activities). Behavioural activation has the potential to address depression and loneliness in the presence of social isolation in this way and the simplicity of behavioural activation made it suitable for delivery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <p id="para220">In the intervention group, participants were offered up to eight weekly sessions by trained BASIL+ Support Workers, accompanied by participant materials: a BASIL+ behavioural activation booklet that was modified to take account of UK Government guidance about the need for social isolation or physical distancing and enforced isolation for those people most at risk (defined as clinically extremely vulnerable people). For example, the BASIL+ booklet discussed ways to replace activities that are no longer possible with ones that preserve physical distancing while helping participants stay connected with the activities and people important to them; illustrative patient stories included in the booklet were modified to take account of COVID-19 restrictions. Behavioural activation acknowledged the disruption to people's lives and usual routines, and encouraged the establishment of a balanced daily routine. Intervention sessions were delivered remotely via telephone. An additional offer of a video call was taken up by only three participants. The first session was scheduled as soon as convenient after randomisation, and was scheduled to last approximately 1 h, with subsequent sessions lasting approximately 30 min. The intervention could be extended to include involvement of a participant's informal caregiver or partner.</p>
                <p id="para230">Participants in the control group received usual care as provided by the UK National Health Service (NHS) or third sector providers, or both. Additionally, participants in the control group were signposted to reputable sources of self-help and information, including advice on how to keep mentally and physically well. Examples of such sources were Public Health England's guidance for the public on the mental health and wellbeing aspects of coronavirus (COVID-19)<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and Age UK.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>

We drew on data from our pilot trial<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to estimate 10% attrition (from mortality and loss to follow-up). Additionally, within the pilot trial, we calculated the correlation between the PHQ-9 score at baseline and the primary outcome timepoint to be 0·58 among participants who scored 5 or higher at baseline (which would be the sample eligible for the main trial). Assuming a correlation of at least 0·5,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> 90% power, two-sided 5% alpha, 0·3 effect size, and 10% attrition, we estimated that the BASIL+ trial needed to recruit and randomly assign 392 participants (power calculations were done in Stata version 15). In the original trial design, we did not incorporate a correlation between baseline and the primary outcome and we were able to revise our study sample size to incorporate these data as the results of the BASIL pilot emerged (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). The final statistical analysis plan was approved by the independent BASIL+ Trial Steering and Data Monitoring &amp; Ethics Committee on June 15, 2022.</p>
                <p id="para290">All analyses were conducted in Stata version 17 on a pseudo intention-to-treat basis (using available data, analysing participants in the groups to which they were randomly assigned) by use of two-sided tests at the 5% significance level. The trial is reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Baseline data are summarised descriptively by trial group both as randomised and as included in the primary analysis.</p>
                <p id="para300">The primary analysis compared the severity of depression as measured by the PHQ-9 between the two groups by use of a covariance pattern mixed-effects linear regression model, incorporating data from the 1-month and 3-month follow-up timepoints. Treatment group, timepoint, treatment-by-time interaction, and baseline PHQ-9 score were fixed effects, with participant nested within site as random effects. An exchangeable covariance pattern for the correlation between the observations for a participant over time was specified (based on minimising the Akaike's information criterion).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Estimates of the difference in total PHQ-9 score were extracted for each timepoint as an adjusted mean difference, with 95% CI, and p value.</p>
                <p id="para310">Model assumptions were checked as follows: the normality of the standardised residuals was checked with a QQ plot, and homoscedasticity was assessed by means of a scatter plot of the standardised residuals against fitted values.</p>
                <p id="para320">Intervention adherence, including the total number of behavioural activation sessions completed per participant and the average duration of sessions, is summarised descriptively. A complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> was done to assess the impact of compliance on the primary estimate, with a two-stage instrumental variable regression approach with randomised group as the instrumental variable, adjusting for baseline score and with robust standard errors to account for clustering within site. Compliance was defined in two ways: as a continuous measure of the number of behavioural activation sessions attended, and as a dichotomous measure to indicate that at least five sessions were attended. A pre-specified subgroup analysis exploring the effects of differential intervention depending on the baseline level of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score 5–9 [mild or subthreshold], or ≥10 [moderate to severe]) was conducted by repeating the primary analysis but including an indicator variable for whether the participant scored 5–9 or 10 or higher at baseline as a covariate (rather than the continuous score) plus an interaction term between treatment allocation and baseline PHQ-9 threshold.</p>
                <p id="para330">In light of an observed differential dropout between the trial groups, post-hoc analyses were conducted to investigate missing data. To investigate the effect of missing data on the treatment effect, any baseline variables associated with non-response at the 3-month follow-up (ie, no valid PHQ-9 score) were identified and included as covariates in the primary analysis model. Multiple imputation of the primary analysis was also conducted with chained equations<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> (20 imputations, burn-in=10) based on predictors: allocation, gender, age, ethnicity, number of comorbidities, academic degree, marital status, and baseline scores for PHQ-9 and all secondary outcomes.</p>

              <p id="para380">Approximately 11 900 study information packs were mailed out to potentially eligible participants registered at 27 general practices within England and Wales from Feb 8, 2021, to Dec 17, 2021. Randomisation took place between Feb 25, 2021, and Feb 28, 2022; participants were recruited from 26 general practices (one of the original 27 practices did not recruit any participants).</p>
              <p id="para390">Following receipt of a postal study pack, 1325 patients across 26 general practices expressed an interest in the study (1052 [79·4%] gave permission to be contacted, 194 [14·6%] were directly contacted, and 79 [6·0%] gave online consent), of whom 449 (33·9%) were identified as eligible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Of those who were eligible, 14 did not go on to complete a baseline assessment and were not recruited; therefore, 435 (96·9%) participants were recruited and randomly assigned (218 to the behavioural activation intervention and 217 to usual care, with signposting).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>PHQ-9=Patient Health Questionnaire-9. *Withdrawals and deaths are cumulative.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="para400">The mean age of participants was 75·7 years (SD 6·7); 270 (62·1%) of 435 participants were female, and 418 (96·1%) were White (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Cardiovascular conditions (288 [66·2%] of 435) and arthritis (186 [42·8%]) were the most frequently reported long-term health conditions. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Most participants (296 [68·0% of 435) were engaging in physical distancing and reported adhering to the UK Government's guidance in relation to COVID-19 restrictions. 200 (46·0%) of 435 participants reported living alone, and 364 (83·7%) had received one or both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine at the point of trial entry. A slightly lower proportion of participants in the intervention group had subthreshold depression (a PHQ-9 score of 5–9, as opposed to ≥10, which would indicate more severe depressive symptoms) at baseline than in the control group (115 [52·8%] of 218 <italic>vs</italic> 136 [62·7%] of 217).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para510">We conducted a randomised controlled trial within the primary care setting of a psychosocial intervention for older people with long-term conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This population was vulnerable to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 restrictions. Our main finding is that behavioural activation, a brief telephone-delivered psychological intervention adapted to mitigate depression and loneliness, showed short-term positive psychological impact. There was evidence of an immediate benefit in terms of depression severity at 1 month, and this was evident at the primary trial endpoint of 3 months. The results of the BASIL+ trial were also in line with the effect size that is observed in meta-analyses of depression and loneliness outcomes for brief psychological interventions.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The results of the BASIL+ trial will be added to future updates of a prospectively registered living systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021298788).</p>
              <p id="para520">For important secondary outcome measures, behavioural activation reduced levels of emotional loneliness (but not social loneliness) and also improved quality of life relating to mental health (but not physical health). There was some evidence that behavioural activation reduced levels of anxiety, although the findings were not significant. The psychological benefit was greatest for those with more severe depression and among people who engaged with five or more behavioural activation sessions.</p>
              <p id="para530">The BASIL+ trial followed a developmental phase where behavioural activation was first adapted to meet the needs of socially isolated older adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was tested in an external pilot trial.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The BASIL+ trial was co-produced and supported by a specially convened COVID-19 research prioritisation and delivery mechanism that focused mainly (although not exclusively) on the roll-out of randomised trials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The BASIL+ trial was one of only two trials of psychosocial interventions designed to address unmet psychological needs during this unprecedented time.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The BASIL+ trial was also designed to mitigate levels of loneliness in a vulnerable population, and a novel finding from BASIL+ is that a scalable behavioural intervention reduces levels of emotional loneliness. Trials of psychosocial interventions targeting loneliness, to date, have been small-scale studies and the BASIL+ trial is, by some margin, the largest trial of a behavioural intervention conducted to mitigate loneliness. The need for scalable psychological solutions to social isolation and loneliness was identified as an important research priority at the start of the pandemic,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and the findings of the BASIL+ trial help to fill this evidence gap.</p>
              <p id="para540">The BASIL+ trial had various limitations. The first limitation is that there was differential attrition. Although follow-up rates were high (and in line with predicted rates of retention based on our pilot), we noted some differential rates of attrition between the intervention and control groups. However, findings for the primary outcome were robust to post-hoc sensitivity analyses investigating the effect of missing data. The second limitation is that we were unable to mask participants to trial allocation and we sought to mitigate this potential bias by ensuring that, where possible, the outcome was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocation. A further limitation is that our original proposed sample size was not feasible during the trial recruitment period. However, we were able to recruit slightly above the revised sample size target, which was calculated to account for correlation between baseline and follow-up measurements. Finally, we designed a pragmatic trial to assess the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention, but the choice of comparator of usual care does not allow the specific effects of behavioural approaches to be assumed. BASIL+ was designed as a two-arm trial with a usual care plus signposting comparator, and an alternative design might have been to add a third group with an attention control condition. We note that our control condition included signposting to ensure that participants were also offered a credible self-help option in line with best practice and policy recommendations during the pandemic. We also noted a dose–response effect from our CACE analysis, which supports the principle that engagement with the intervention maximised the effectiveness of behavioural activation.</p>
              <p id="para550">COVID-19 highlighted the importance of loneliness as a threat to population health, and it remains a clinically, socially, and economically important issue that is now increasingly recognised as a post-pandemic priority.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> There are several approaches that can be helpful to policy makers, but there are also important evidence gaps in terms of what works in preventing or mitigating loneliness.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> This is a rapidly advancing area and successful delivery of the BASIL+ trial during pandemic conditions contributes to an evolving evidence base in response to social isolation and the risk of psychological deterioration in at-risk groups. Looking to the future, behavioural activation could be used to mitigate depression and the risk of loneliness in the presence of shocks to health systems and populations, such as future pandemics or other shocks that could increase anxiety and depression among vulnerable groups, such as the climate emergency.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p>
