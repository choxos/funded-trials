              <abstract>
                <p>The growing recognition of diseases associated with dysfunction of mitochondria poses an urgent need for simple measures of mitochondrial function. Assessment of the kinetics of replenishment of the phosphocreatine pool after exercise using <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide an <italic>in vivo</italic> measure of mitochondrial function; however, the wider application of this technique appears limited by complex or expensive MR-compatible exercise equipment and protocols not easily tolerated by frail participants or those with reduced mental capacity. Here we describe a novel in-scanner exercise method which is patient-focused, inexpensive, remarkably simple and highly portable. The device exploits an MR-compatible high-density material (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) to form a weight which is attached directly to the ankle, and a one-minute dynamic knee extension protocol produced highly reproducible measurements of post-exercise PCr recovery kinetics in both healthy subjects and patients. As sophisticated exercise equipment is unnecessary for this measurement, our extremely simple design provides an effective and easy-to-implement apparatus that is readily translatable across sites. Its design, being tailored to the needs of the patient, makes it particularly well suited to clinical applications, and we argue the potential of this method for investigating <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial function in new cohorts of growing clinical interest.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognised as important in a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. <sup>31</sup>P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P-MRS) has long been used to assess skeletal muscle mitochondrial function <italic>in vivo</italic> by measuring the kinetics of replenishment of the phosphocreatine (PCr) pool after exercise, which relates directly to oxidative ATP synthesis (reviewed extensively in<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The non-invasive nature of this technique permits multiple measurements in longitudinal intervention trials and arguably offers a more representative assessment of muscle mitochondrial function as it reflects the effects of an integrated cardiorespiratory/vascular system and permits a larger sample size than muscle biopsy. The growing recognition of the contribution of mitochondrion-associated diseases to the public health burden makes the use of this technique in clinical trials more important than ever.</p>
            <p>A limitation to the wider application of the technique remains the need for MR-compatible exercise equipment suitable for use in clinical contexts. Commercial MR-compatible ergometers are increasingly available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, but these can be expensive and there is a long tradition of in-house construction of exercise equipment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Exercise may be static (isometric) or dynamic (isotonic); isometric exercise is conveniently scaled to maximum voluntary contraction <italic>in situ</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, but adjusting exercise intensity by interpreting force feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> can be challenging. Calibrated dynamic exercise typically requires complex resistance equipment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> or pulley systems to transfer the workload outside the bore<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, and in all systems participant posture is an important comfort consideration.</p>
            <p>PCr recovery kinetics following exercise in which cell pH does not change much is well-known to be first-order, characterized by an exponential rate constant (k<sub>PCr</sub>) that is independent of the degree of PCr depletion, and which is directly proportional to what may be physiologically regarded as functional mitochondrial capacity, generally insensitive to the details of the exercise perturbation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Thus to assess muscle mitochondrial function needs only a way of producing moderate PCr depletion, which can be achieved by simple exercise methods rather than requiring sophisticated equipment. Here we exploit this and set out to design a simple, patient-friendly MR exercise method that is inexpensive and permits measurements of <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial function easily in a clinical context where patients may have limited exercise tolerance and/or reduced mental capacity.</p>

                <p>26 (24 M, 2 F) participants with mean ± SEM age 34.9 ± 1.7 y undertook <sup>31</sup>P-MRS measurements on a Siemens MAGNETOM 3 T scanner. The participants consisted of one 30 y female control subject with a BMI of 21.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who undertook 2.5 minutes of exercise in a Siemens 3 T Trio scanner, one female 40 y lipodystrophic patient (BMI 20.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who performed the optimised exercise protocol in a Siemens 3 T Verio scanner, and 24 healthy non obese Caucasian male volunteers who underwent the optimised exercise protocol on two consecutive days in a Siemens 3 T Verio scanner.</p>
                <p>Each participant provided written informed consent and all studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee, United Kingdom (for the control subject dataset shown), by the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee, United Kingdom (patient dataset shown), and by Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee, United Kingdom (the 24 individuals who comprise the reproducibility statistics).</p>

                <title>Workload methodology</title>
                <p>This design exploits the high density of the MR-compatible material barium sulfate (BaSO<sub>4</sub>), whose specific gravity is 4.5 (cf. 1.0 for water and 1.5 for dry sand<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). This permits enough mass (workload) to be placed within the scanner bore and circumvents the need for complex and/or expensive resistance equipment or pulley systems. Barium sulfate is relatively inexpensive and although pure BaSO<sub>4</sub> is MR-safe, any purchased BaSO<sub>4</sub> that might contain magnetically susceptible impurities should be tested. To permit an individual-specific workload, the barium sulfate was placed in sealable freezer bags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) following relevant safety data sheet advice, to form bags of differing weights (e.g. 1.00, 0.50, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 kg).</p>

                <p>The participants were positioned in the comfortable feet-first supine position with their knees placed over a 14.5 cm diameter cylindrical foam and their feet placed in the resulting recess, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. This configuration minimizes axial surface coil orientations and provides a wide angle of rotation for knee extension exercise. The appropriate mass (see Section ‘Ankle weight calculation’) was placed over the participant’s right ankle using a custom made dual-pocket ‘bag’ made from non-stretchable cord denim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), with equal weights of BaSO<sub>4</sub> either side of the ankle. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B,C</xref> shows dimensions of the holder which can hold sufficient mass (up to ~9 kg), without the bag wrapping under the ankle. We found that the ankle weight did not move significantly relative to the leg during exercise.</p>

                <title>Exercise MRS protocol</title>
                <p>The exercise consisted of knee extensions of the right leg from the scanner table base to full knee extension, with the appropriate weight placed over the right ankle. This was performed at 0.5 Hz and gated such that, with subject compliance, the MR acquisition always occurred with the leg in the ‘down’ position. This was achieved using pre-recorded headphone instructions of up/down commands and warning of exercise onset and cessation. All participants were shown a training video prior to the scan to ensure they were familiar with the exercise protocol and undertook a brief practice before full entry to the scanner bore. One healthy female performed 2.5 minutes of this exercise and dynamic measurements of [PCr] and pH recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). From this an optimised exercise protocol was developed.</p>

                <title>Ankle weight calculation</title>
                <p>Volunteers’ maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was determined the previous day using a dynamometer chair set to knee extension from –45° to 0°, where 0° is knee extension without hyperextension (i.e. similar angles of exercise as in the scanner). Participants undertook an isokinetic protocol consisting of three knee extensions with gentle encouragement, and peak torque from their best repetition was recorded as their MVC. Standardisation of PCr depletion between participants was achieved by altering the ankle weight to a fraction of their MVC such that m = 0.131 MVC/(g.L), where m is the ankle weight in kg, MVC the torque in Nm, g is 9.81 ms<sup>−2</sup>, and L is the leg length in meters defined as the lateral femoral condyle to malleolus distance. In the study of 24 healthy non-obese male volunteers, who had height (mean ± SEM) 180.5 ± 1.5 cm, leg length was not measured and L was assumed to be 42 cm, thereby providing m = 0.0318 MVC. The target PCr depletion was 20–25% of basal [PCr] and more than 40% depletion was undesired.</p>

Bland-Altman analysis was performed and the mean difference (bias) between the two measures was calculated then tested against zero using a one sample t-test.

The individuals’ mean k<sub>PCr</sub> for both Day-1 and Day-2 were then used for an estimate of CV of reproducibility with the fasting intervention of the study (which was found to have no significant effect overall on PCr recovery); this is therefore an upper limit on CV without any intervention.</p>

It is not necessary to establish a stable PCr before measurement of PCr recovery as the interpretation of k<sub>PCr</sub> is independent of this<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In order to acquire two PCr recovery measurements which can then be averaged to improve precision, or allow two attempts at the measurement in patient groups who may be less tolerant or compliant of the exercise, the optimised protocol to measure <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial function consisted of two 1 minute exercise durations (total scan 12 mins consisting of 1 min rest, 1 min exercise and 4 mins recovery, which is then all repeated).</p>

                <p>Three individuals did not undertake the <sup>31</sup>P measurement on Day-2 and two <sup>31</sup>P scans were lost due to hardware failure (one each day). 92% of all exercise bouts were participant compliant.

Apparent slight increases in mean [PCr] at the start of exercise bout 1 and during exercise bout 2, may reflect incorrect exercise timing due to misinterpretation of the instructions in this cohort who did not have a prescan rehearsal to the timed instructions. This is not important when we only measure and fit the PCr kinetics of the resynthesis, and this method yielded highly consistent mean k<sub>PCr</sub> values of 2.47 ± 0.17 min<sup>−1</sup> and 2.44 ± 0.15 min<sup>−1</sup> for post-exercise recovery 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have described a novel and remarkably simple exercise design that allows efficient measurements of <italic>in vivo</italic> mitochondrial function in both healthy subjects and patients. This has been facilitated by exploiting the high density of the MR-compatible substance barium sulfate to apply load direct to the ankle, obviating the need for expensive and/or complex MR-compatible resistance or pulley equipment. The method produces well-controlled PCr depletion with patient compliance and permits highly reproducible measurements of post-exercise PCr recovery kinetics both within and between scan sessions, with coefficients of variation (5 and 8% respectively) that are comparable to the lowest reported values<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> despite the fairly low PCr depletion in our study.</p>
              <p>All exercise systems require a method to standardise PCr depletion between individuals and here we have done this using a measure of the volunteers’ maximal voluntary contraction assessed by a dynamometer chair, although alternative methods could be used such as a fraction of lean body mass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. The, on average, low fractional PCr depletion, and intersubject coefficient of variation of 30%, meant that the maximum percentage PCr depletion in visit 1 was only 33% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>), thus the exercise was of sufficiently low intensity and duration to not yield significant acidification, which is known to slow PCr recovery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This is important when using the PCr rate constant as a measure of mitochondrial function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, and may, in part, explain our high reproducibility values. Our ability to accurately measure the PCr kinetics post exercise at small PCr depletions is significantly aided by our high quality data (small PCr linewidths and small subcutaneous fat thicknesses in these volunteers), thus a target PCr depletion &gt;20% may be advised in other cohorts and/or with other MR surface coils or acquisition techniques, at a field strength of 3 T.</p>
              <p>One advantage of our exercise method is its easy-to-implement design that is readily translatable across sites and scanner models without mechanical alterations. The design does not require the participant to be strapped down to the scanner table and unlike most other procedures for exercising the quadriceps muscle <italic>in situ</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> it permits the volunteer to be in the supine position which is important for patient comfort; this, together with the short exercise duration, ensures the exercise is easily tolerated. The dynamic nature of the exercise makes it suitable for patients with cardiovascular disease where forceful isometric exercise is not always recommended<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and the set ankle weight circumvents the need to adjust exercise intensity by interpreting force feedback which can be challenging and particularly unsuitable for those with reduced mental capacity. The apparatus’ high portability permits straightforward pre-scanning rehearsal, which could make it effective for familiarisation in cohorts with, for example, learning difficulties. These factors adapt to the needs of the participant thereby aiding compliance and making this approach particularly well suited to clinical applications.</p>
              <p>The cost, complexity and physical demands of specialised MR-compatible ergometers appears to be limiting the wider application of <sup>31</sup>P-MRS in clinical research. While detailed studies of muscle response to exercise, particularly at high intensities, requires sophisticated equipment, the assessment of PCr recovery kinetics is much less demanding and only requires a simple method to deplete the PCr pool. Our exercise design is superior to previously reported simple exercise designs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> in that it easily permits an individual-specific workload by altering the ankle weight, does not place participants in an uncomfortable prone position, provides a more uniform workload over displacement, and is even easier to implement. The extremely simple method we have described here provides an inexpensive, patient-focused exercise design that is highly effective and suitable for frail participants or those with reduced mental capacity, offering the opportunity to implement measurements of muscle mitochondrial function more widely in a variety of clinical trial contexts.</p>
