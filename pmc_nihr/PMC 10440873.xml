                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1"> Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is the commonest endocrine cause of short stature and may occur in isolation (I-GHD) or combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Around 500 children are diagnosed with GHD every year in the UK, of whom 75% have I-GHD. Growth hormone (GH) therapy improves growth in children with GHD, with the goal of achieving a normal final height (FH). GH therapy is given as daily injections until adult FH is reached. However, in many children with I-GHD their condition reverses, with a normal peak GH detected in 64–82% when re-tested at FH. Therefore, at some point between diagnosis and FH, I-GHD must have reversed, possibly due to increase in sex hormones during puberty. Despite increasing evidence for frequent I-GHD reversal, daily GH injections are traditionally continued until FH is achieved.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Evidence suggests that I-GHD children who re-test normal in early puberty reach a FH comparable to that of children without GHD. The GHD Reversal study will include 138 children from routine endocrine clinics in twelve UK and five Austrian centres with I-GHD (original peak GH &lt; 6.7 mcg/L) whose deficiency has reversed on early re-testing. Children will be randomised to either continue or discontinue GH therapy. This phase III, international, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial (including an internal pilot study) will assess whether children with early I-GHD reversal who stop GH therapy achieve non-inferior near FH SDS (primary outcome; inferiority margin 0.55 SD), target height (TH) minus near FH, HRQoL, bone health index and lipid profiles (secondary outcomes) than those continuing GH. In addition, the study will assess cost-effectiveness of GH discontinuation in the early retesting scenario.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">If this study shows that a significant proportion of children with presumed I-GHD reversal generate enough GH naturally in puberty to achieve a near FH within the target range, then this new care pathway would rapidly improve national/international practice. An assumed 50% reversal rate would provide potential UK health service cost savings of £1.8–4.6 million (€2.05–5.24 million)/year in drug costs alone. This new care pathway would also prevent children from having unnecessary daily GH injections and consequent exposure to potential adverse effects.</p>

              <p id="Par55">Around 500 children are diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) every year in the UK, of whom 75% have idiopathic, isolated GHD (I-GHD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Children are treated with daily growth hormone (GH) injections until final height (FH) is reached, at an annual cost of £10,000–£23,000 per child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, when these children are re-tested after having reached their FH, between 64 and 82% are found to be producing sufficient endogenous GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], i.e. their GHD has reversed. Children with a normal pituitary on brain MRI and partial GHD are more likely to reverse. However, it is not unusual for children with structural abnormalities of the pituitary gland to also reverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The underlying reasons for this reversal are largely unknown but may be explained by (1) late maturation of the GH axis or (2) difficulties inherent in the original diagnostic process.</p>
              <p id="Par56">To make the diagnosis of I-GHD in a short child, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends at least two GH stimulation tests. These tests measure the peak GH concentration in the blood following an injection with a stimulating substance such as glucagon or insulin, and I-GHD is diagnosed if both show a peak GH &lt; 6.7 μg/L [formerly 20 mU/L] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, a large number of GH stimulation tests are used in routine practice, and there is no consensus as to which is optimal for either diagnosing GHD or predicting a later GHD reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Diagnostic test protocols also vary between institutions.</p>
              <p id="Par57">A number of studies have shown that sex steroid priming improves the response to provocative testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, sex steroid priming is by no means universally used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, studies have shown that the peak GH response is inversely correlated to weight within a cohort of normal weight children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This study by Stanley et al. suggested that even normal children with a weight of + 1SDS may show a blunted GH response. Given all of these variables, it may not be surprising that the GH stimulation test itself could be associated with a high false positive rate and that re-testing after a suitable period, or at the end of GH treatment, may produce normal results, implying a reversal of GHD. This may be due to an effect of sex steroid or perhaps even loss of weight and improved body mass index.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Although I-GHD is known to reverse in many children, traditional practice is to continue treatment with daily injections of GH until FH is achieved. Establishing normal GH status in early puberty would relieve patients from the diagnostic uncertainty of GHD persistence and may allow patients to stop GH therapy earlier whilst still reaching a normal FH. This would relieve them of the unpleasant and inconvenient burden of daily injections of an unnecessary medication and considerably reduce health care cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par59">This phase III, international, multi-centre, open label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial will assess the safety, efficacy, health-related quality of life, cost effectiveness, biochemical and bone health effects of discontinuing GH therapy in children who have a normal GH re-test in established puberty. The acceptability of the trial and treatment pathways to patients, parents and staff will be explored via a qualitative research sub-study.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative research</title>
                  <p id="Par66">We will conduct qualitative research with UK carers, children and staff participating in the internal pilot study. The main aim of the qualitative research is to ensure the feasibility and acceptability of the trial for patients, carers and clinicians, with a particular focus on recruitment processes. These data will provide useful insights into carers’ and children’s preferences for treatment and help optimise the main trial processes. This research will explore carers’ and children’s perceptions in relation to re-testing normal (i.e. GHD reversal), reasons for agreeing to or declining trial participation, reactions to treatment allocation and associated recruitment and retention during the internal pilot. Data collection will include audio-recordings of recruitment consultations and interviews with carers, children and staff.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">We will consent staff at UK recruiting sites and potential trial participants (children and carers) to audio-record recruitment consultations. Recording recruitment consultations will provide valuable data concerning how the trial and treatment groups are presented by staff and how this is received by potential participants and their carers. Following consent, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a sample of carers and children participating in both arms of the pilot study (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 20–24), as well as carers and patients who decline to take part in the trial (<italic>n</italic> ≈ 8–10). We will undertake interviews with site PIs and staff who are recruiting patients to the trial. These interviews will take place early in the pilot phase at all UK sites that are open to recruitment so that we can understand their perspectives on the trial and the GHD re-testing pathway and understand early experiences and perspectives regarding recruitment to the trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Children recruited to the pilot and their carers will be interviewed at two time points: T1—approximately 2 weeks after randomisation—and T2—approximately 6 months following randomisation. Where possible, interviews will be conducted at a time and place preferred by participants. Separate interviews will be conducted with the carers and the children themselves, unless children wish to be interviewed whilst their carers are present.</p>
                  <p id="Par69">T1 and decliner interviews will focus on the recruitment process, children’s motivations for taking part or not in the trial and specific barriers and facilitators to patient participation. In addition, T1 and decliner interviews will also explore children’s and carers’ experiences of GHD and its impact on their daily lives, their understanding and expectations of GHD testing and treatment options and their expectations for the trial. T2 interviews will explore children’s and their carers’ experience of the trial and treatment options and of related trial processes and procedures.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">Data collection and analysis will proceed iteratively until the research team judge that the data and sample size have sufficient depth and breadth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Analysis of audio-recordings will target key components of discussions regarding trial participation using thematic and conversation analysis techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A thematic analysis of interview content will be informed by the framework analytical approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par71">Children with I-GHD reversal under the care of a paediatric endocrinologist and/or a general paediatrician will be recruited from 12 UK and 5 Austrian centres. Administration of GH medication will be stopped for a minimum of 6 weeks prior to a GH re-test being performed in line with local protocols. If the patient is thought to be eligible after GH retesting, the clinical team will send the participant information sheet (PIS) to the patients’ parent/guardian, and they will be invited into clinic to discuss potential participation in the trial. It will be the responsibility of the principal investigator (PI) or their delegate to ensure written informed consent is obtained for each participant and/or parent/guardian prior to performing any trial-related procedures. The responsibility for obtaining consent may be delegated by the PI to another clinician as captured on the GHD Reversal Trial site signature and delegation log. If the potential participant and/or parent/guardian are willing to take part in the trial (and meet all of the eligibility criteria), they will be asked to sign and date the latest version of the GHD Reversal Trial informed consent form (ICF) and Assent Form if appropriate and the child will be randomised to one of the study arms. The participant and/or parent/guardian will give explicit consent for the regulatory authorities, members of the research team and or representatives of the sponsor to be given direct access to the participant’s medical records as required. This will be specified on the ICF.</p>
                <p id="Par72">We will request consent for review of participants’ medical records and for the collection of blood samples to assess serum IGF-1 and lipid profiles (fasting lipids − serum triglyceride and serum total cholesterol) and peak stimulated GH.</p>

Height, weight and Tanner stage will also be measured at baseline. All patients will have 6-monthly visits to measure height, weight, Tanner stage, serum IGF-1 (at 6 months and annually thereafter) as well as checking compliance with GH therapy and any concomitant medication and adverse event reporting. HRQoL will be measured using the CHU9D questionnaire at baseline and at each 6-monthly visit. A left hand X-ray will be conducted at enrolment and near FH, for central analysis using the BoneXpert software. Fasting lipids will be measured at baseline and near FH.</p>

These FH outcome options for comparison between the GH + and GH − groups were (1) the percentage of children reaching normal adult height (0 ± 2SD), (2) the percentage of children reaching mid-parental TH (0 ± 2SD) and (3) the near FH (in SDS/cm). Near-FH standard deviation score (near FH-SDS) was selected as the primary outcome.</p>
                  <p id="Par106">Whilst the percentage of children reaching mid-parental TH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was the most popular outcome amongst respondents, data were not available to inform a sample size calculation. However, all the above options to express FH will be analysed in this trial as secondary outcomes. Other secondary outcomes are HRQoL, lipid profile, cost-effectiveness, and the bone health index (assessing effect of GH + /GH − on bone accrual and bone age using BoneXpert software).</p>
                  <p id="Par107">For the primary outcome measure of near FH-SDS with a non-inferiority design comparing means and assuming equal variance, a non-inferiority margin of 0.55 near FH-SDS, a one-sided test with alpha = 0.025 and 90% power, a group size of 57 (total <italic>n</italic> = 114) would be needed (calculated using the SSI procedure in Stata 13). This calculation was based on a near FH-SDS (SD) of − 1.6 (0.9) using data from a population-based registry for patients with idiopathic GHD treated with GH and completing the scheduled treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The non-inferiority margin is based on clinical opinion. Additional observational studies gave consistent results. Using the LMS growth software, a 0.55 height SDS score (using British 1990 Growth Charts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) approximates to 3.8 cm for boys and 3.3 cm for girls at age 23. With 17% allowance for withdrawal and loss to follow-up, a total sample size of 138 is required.</p>

The primary comparison groups will be composed of those treated with GH (25–35 μg/kg/day) versus those not treated with GH. Non-inferiority outcomes will be analysed using both intention-to-treat (ITT) (i.e. all participants will be analysed in the treatment group to which they were randomised, irrespective of compliance or other protocol deviation) and per-protocol analyses (i.e. those participants who are considered adherent to their allocated intervention, as defined in the SAP). This is because an ITT analysis alone may bias results in favour of non-inferiority. Superiority outcomes will be analysed using ITT analyses only. For all primary and secondary outcome measures, summary statistics and differences between groups will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. Outcomes will be adjusted for the minimisation variables and baseline values where appropriate. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made.</p>

The adjusted mean difference in near FH-SDS will be presented alongside a 95% confidence interval. Non-inferiority for the primary outcome will only be concluded if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval limit is above − 0.55 for both the ITT and per-protocol analyses.</p>

                <title>Health economics analysis</title>
                <p id="Par138">The health economics analysis has two specific aims. The first is to assess the cost-effectiveness of GH discontinuation in the early re-testing scenario by estimating the cost per percentage of children achieving TH of GH − compared to GH + over a 12-month period, and the second is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the new care pathway (early re-testing) compared to traditional care (late re-testing).</p>
                <p id="Par139">To assess the cost-effectiveness of no GH therapy (GH −) compared to GH therapy (GH +) in patients with GHD reversal, a cost-consequence analysis will initially be reported, describing all the important results relating to resource use, costs and consequences. Subsequently a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken from an NHS/personal social services (PSS) perspective to determine the cost per percentage achieving TH of GH − compared to GH + over a 12-month period.</p>
                <p id="Par140">Resource use information will be obtained on all healthcare utilisation (primary care and secondary care) and will be obtained mainly from participant questionnaires. Unit costs will be obtained from standard sources and healthcare providers including the British National Formulary (BNF), PSSRU publication on Unit Costs of Health and Social Care and NHS Reference costs.</p>
                <p id="Par141">Mean costs and outcomes will be estimated for both the no GH therapy (GH −) and GH therapy (GH +) arms. Cost data are likely to be skewed; therefore, non-parametric comparison of means (e.g. bootstrapping) will be undertaken. Multiple imputation techniques will be used to deal with missing costs, in order to ensure that all eligible trial participants are included in the analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par142">Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be presented to estimate the probability that GH − is cost-effective for different willingness to pay thresholds.</p>
                <p id="Par143">The second objective of the health economics analysis is to determine the cost-effectiveness of the new care pathway (early re-testing) compared to traditional care (late re-testing) using a decision analytic modelling approach. The model will determine the cost per percentage achieving TH and cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the intervention (early re-testing) and usual care arm (late re-testing).</p>
                <p id="Par144">Data from the main trial and other published sources will be used to populate the model. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the cost per percentage achieving TH and an incremental cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to estimate the cost per QALY gained. Both analyses will be conducted from an NHS perspective. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to assess the impact of changing the values of key parameters. Uncertainty in the confidence to be placed on the results of the economic analysis will be explored by conducting a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p>

This process will be managed by the BCTU trials management team in conjunction with UCL as sponsor (the sponsor played no part in the study design; collection, management, analysis and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication). An independent DMC will ensure the safety and dignity of the study participants as well as the reliability of the results obtained. Information will be provided to parents and patients verbally and through parent and participant information sheets. The information sheets will clearly explain that participation in the trial is entirely voluntary with the option of withdrawing from the trial at any stage and that participation or non-participation will not affect the participant’s usual care which, for children who had ever been on GH would include monitoring to FH. Though all trials involving children require careful ethical consideration, we do not anticipate any specific ethical issues beyond those in randomised controlled trials within the paediatric population. There are no major concerns surrounding the withdrawal of GH in study patients with reversed I-GHD.</p>

              <title>Discussion and potential impact</title>
              <p id="Par165">Five previous studies have demonstrated reversal of GHD (mean 49%; range 19–95%) with earlier re-testing, before or during puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. One study found that children with GHD reversal confirmed during puberty reach their target height (TH) without further GH therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another study showed that children stopping GH 1.6 years before attaining FH achieve a similar FH to those who continue taking GH until they reach their FH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A GH stimulation test is usually performed when FH is attained to assess any requirement for adult GH therapy, and it is at this point that many patients are found to be no longer GH deficient. This study will test whether the near FH of those stopping GH treatment is not inferior to the near FH of those continuing and is thus the first study to our knowledge that is a randomised controlled trial. If this study shows that a significant proportion of children with I-GHD generate enough GH naturally in early puberty to reach a near FH within the target range, this new care pathway could rapidly improve practice; it would relieve patients from the diagnostic uncertainty of GHD persistence and may allow patients to stop GH therapy approximately 3 years earlier, and still reach a normal near FH without the burden of daily injections, and at considerably reduced health care cost. Based on published data, we can assume that on a 50% reversal rate, the potential cost savings for the NHS would be in the range of £1.8–4.6 million (€2.05–5.24 million)/year in drug costs alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is important to note that GH treatment is not without its problems. Previous studies have suggested rare side-effects including benign intracranial hypertension, diabetes and slipped femoral capital epiphysis in association with GH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, more recent data have suggested significant risks potentially associated with GH treatment. In those patients with normal GH secretion who were treated with high doses of GH, a higher incidence of bone tumours was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Additionally, further data from the SaGHe study have revealed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular events in patients who previously received GH treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, more recently, detailed registry reviews indicated no increased risk of strokes or cancer, once risk factors had been accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nonetheless, some controversy remains around safety of GH therapy, and it would be important to ensure that GH should only be considered in those patients who would benefit from its use, with a view to minimising any adverse effects.</p>
