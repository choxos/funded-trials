                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Cancer patients have a four- to fivefold greater risk of thrombosis than the
general population. Recommended treatment for cancer-associated thrombosis
is 3–6 months of low-molecular-weight heparin. The ‘select-d’ trial is an
open-label, randomised, multi-centre pilot trial in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis, utilising dalteparin (low-molecular-weight
heparin) versus rivaroxaban (a direct oral anticoagulant), to assess
effectiveness and safety.</p>

                  <title>Aim:</title>
                  <p>To explore patient and informal carers’ experiences of cancer-associated
thrombosis and their experience and understanding of the risk–benefit of
thrombosis treatment.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section3-0269216318815377">
                  <title>Design:</title>
                  <p>Qualitative substudy of the select-d trial, using semi-structured interviews.
Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using
Framework Analysis.</p>

                  <title>Participants:</title>
                  <p>Participants were purposively sampled (<italic>n</italic> = 37 patients; 46%
male; age 40–89; 9 with carer present).</p>

                <sec id="section5-0269216318815377">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Three themes were found: experience of cancer-associated thrombosis,
experience of anticoagulation and risk–benefit balance of the two modes of
administration. Some were shocked by their thrombosis diagnosis (most were
unaware of their risk), but others found it insignificant compared with
cancer. Most patients found tablets more convenient, but injections were
acceptable in the context of having cancer. While most were happy to follow
medical advice, others weighed preference on the basis of effectiveness.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section6-0269216318815377">
                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Lack of awareness of thrombosis risk is concerning; cancer patients must be
informed to enable prompt help-seeking. Tablets could provide a welcome
choice for patients if there is equivalent risk–benefit to injected
anticoagulants. Patients trust their clinicians to tailor their treatment.
Future research could explore the effect of routine information giving about
the risk of thrombosis.</p>

              <p>Despite high-quality evidence supporting cancer-associated thrombosis treatment,
there are few data about patient experience. A systematic review and synthesis<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> found only five studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr20-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> These showed poor knowledge of
the risk and symptoms of cancer-associated thrombosis, but challenges in relation to
thrombosis and its treatment added significantly to the life disruption caused by
the cancer. Despite concerns that daily injections were too invasive, these are
viewed by patients as an acceptable trade-off against a serious, life-threatening
condition.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A choice-based conjoint experiment study assessed preferences for anticoagulation in
people with cancer-associated thrombosis with no previous experience of direct oral anticoagulants.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Participants valued safety and effectiveness over route of administration,

              <p>The select-d trial (Anticoagulation Therapy in SELECTeD Cancer Patients at Risk of
Recurrence of Venous Thromboembolism (ISRCTN: 86712308)) is a 6-month randomised,
multi-centre pilot study comparing dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin) with
rivaroxaban (a direct oral anticoagulant). After 6 months, eligible participants
were re-randomised to either rivaroxaban or a placebo tablet for a further
6 months.</p>
              <p>This substudy aimed to explore patient and carer experience of cancer-associated

understanding, albeit accessible through the participants’ interpretations. Well
suited to analyses of qualitative data in a multidisciplinary team, and when the

                  <title>Reaction to diagnosis</title>
                  <p>Only 7/37 patient-participants had been aware of their increased
cancer-associated thrombosis risk, either informed by their healthcare team
or due to previous experience of venous thromboembolism in family members.
Most patient-participants were unaware and had attributed their symptoms to
side effects of cancer or its treatment which delayed presentation,
diagnosis and treatment for the cancer-associated thrombosis:<disp-quote><p>I’d been in pain with my leg for a good week or so but you just think
it’s part of the cancer. P2 (Group 1)</p><p>I was in sort of blissful ignorance, I was thinking ‘Oh maybe it’s
part and parcel of this cancer, maybe it’s the lymph nodes causing
the breathlessness’. P25 (Group 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Some participants, patients and carers, were distressed when they realised it
was life-threatening, confronted with the possibility of a sudden death from
something other than cancer:<disp-quote><p>I was utterly astounded, quite honestly … I thought ‘Wow, my God, it
could have killed me’. P3 (Group 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Some described it as ‘a bit of a blow’ (P22) on top of the cancer and found
it very worrying. However, not all patients reacted this way,
cancer-associated thrombosis viewed as ‘part and parcel’ (P23) of having
cancer and described feeling ‘laid back’ (P15) or even ‘sanguine’ (P2) about
the venous thromboembolism:<disp-quote><p>The fact I’d got a few tiny blood clots on my lungs was a minor
detail [laughter] to be honest. P25 (Group 2)</p><p>Quite honestly, it was a non-event. Having been through prostate …
After that really, on a scale of one to ten, it was about a two. It
was shrugged off, virtually. P24 (Group 1)</p><p>I don’t think I had a lot of time to think about it because I was far
more, I was concentrating far more, or feeling more affected by the
chemotherapy. P11 (Group 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>These views were expressed by both those with and those without symptomatic
venous thromboembolism, and by those with pulmonary embolism or a deep vein
thrombosis.</p>

                  <title>Impact of cancer-associated thrombosis on everyday life</title>
                  <p>Few patient-participants talked about the impact of cancer-associated
thrombosis on everyday life. Those with asymptomatic incidental pulmonary
embolism reported no impact on daily living. Some patient-participants with
symptomatic cancer-associated thrombosis described impact from initial
symptoms but resolving quickly with anticoagulation. They trusted in their
medical care and felt safe that the cancer-associated thrombosis was being treated:<disp-quote><p>At least it had been found and it was something that could be
treated. P20 (Group 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Some were worried about cancer-associated thrombosis recurrence, whereas
others, although aware of the possibility of recurrence, took a pragmatic
stance saving energy to deal with cancer treatment. Recurrence would be
faced if necessary knowing the warning symptoms to trigger early
help-seeking. Again, trust in their healthcare team eased their worries.</p>

                    <title>Experience of taking direct oral anticoagulants</title>
                    <p>The experience of taking direct oral anticoagulants was set within the
context of the many medications needed as part of cancer treatment.
Tablets were seen generally as being straightforward to take. As most
patients had an established routine for their cancer medication, the
direct oral anticoagulant fitted in relatively easily:<disp-quote><p>I felt quite relieved that there was something that was happening
every day to stop it happening again. C11 (Group 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
                    <p>However, some found the need to take it with food and at the same time
every day difficult.</p>

                    <title>Experience of having low-molecular-weight heparin</title>
                    <p>The experience of having low-molecular-weight heparin was also set within
the context of cancer treatment, which often involved injections and
other invasive treatments. There were unwanted effects with injected
low-molecular-weight heparin, but these were acceptable, and most found
it straightforward to self-inject appreciating that they were
contributing to their treatment by doing the injection. Like the direct
oral anticoagulant group, patients developed a routine:<disp-quote><p>It was just another injection that was happening. P4 (Group
1)</p><p>You’re just feeling that you’re actually doing something, it’s a
step forward. It’s contributing, me stomach’s not good at this
moment, but if I keep injecting me leg’s going down, I can see,
look, it’s turning back to what it were. P4 (Group 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
                    <p>Although some patient-participants had initial worries about their
ability to do the injections, they adjusted quickly and only one
patient-participant reported being unable to self-inject. In this case,
a community nurse was able to support the patient which was acceptable
despite causing inconvenience.</p>
                    <p>Carer-participants had mixed responses to being asked to help with
injections. Some felt unable to inject their loved one because they felt
too squeamish or did not want to hurt the patient, and one felt it would
be too big a commitment. However, several were happy to contribute and
helping in a difficult situation:<disp-quote><p>It’s difficult; I don’t know what to say sometimes. I suppose
when I’m giving the injections perhaps it was a way out for me
to think yeah, well at least I’m trying to do something. C35
(Group 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
                    <p>In these cases, the carers found the support from hospital staff
invaluable, and they developed a routine with the patient.</p>

                      <disp-quote>
                        <p>We’re always early in the morning so I make the tea, I take a cup
of tea up to (Patient name) she has a bit of tea, relax, and
then I inject her. C35 (Group 3)</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Patient-participants with experience of both injections and tablets
varied in their views of the relative merit of the two methods of
anticoagulation. Some were positive about the tablets compared to their
previous experience of injections, while others were ambivalent and
prepared to accept the injections despite the drawbacks.</p>

                      <disp-quote>
                        <p>I suppose taking a tablet is less problematic. But again, the
injections didn’t worry me at all. P32 (Group 3)</p>
                        <p>I prefer the tablets, but the injections didn’t bother me. P18

                  <title>Approaching the risk–benefit balance of two different ways of
anticoagulant administration</title>
                  <p>Many patients and carers seemed unaware of the relative effectiveness of the
two treatments and were happy to simply comply with their doctors’ instructions:<disp-quote><p>I just do as I was bid. I have no medical knowledge at all and I just
do as they say. P28 (Group 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Others weighed preference on the basis of effectiveness and adverse effects
such as bruising; these participants had an appreciation that rivaroxaban
was still being tested. The judgements were that a tablet would be easier
and preferable but only if equally effective and safe, if not, the
inconvenience associated with the injections was counteracted by the known
effectiveness of the injections:<disp-quote><p>If a tablet would serve the same purpose then I would certainly
sooner take a tablet, but … if the injections are an advantage then
it’s worth putting up with the discomfort. P11 (Group 1)</p><p>If given the choice of equality of effect I would be preferring pills
… If I was told that the pills would be less effective than the
injections would I inject myself? And the answer is probably ‘Yes’.
P31 (Group 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Overall, the feeling was that if the tablets and injections were equally
effective, then the tablets were more straightforward and therefore
preferable. However, if the injections were shown to be more effective, then
the drawbacks such as bruising were an acceptable trade-off and injections
would be preferable to the tablets.</p>

                <p>Most patients were unaware of their increased risk of cancer-associated
thrombosis and of the symptoms, resulting in misattribution of symptoms and
delayed help-seeking. Some patients were shocked or worried by their
cancer-associated thrombosis; however, many were philosophical in the context of
cancer. The reported impact of cancer-associated thrombosis was of a short-term
nature, quickly resolving with treatment.</p>
                <p>In the context of cancer, daily injections despite some drawbacks were not viewed
as onerous. Many were happy to simply follow medical advice, but some took
relative effectiveness into account. Tablets were considered to be easier to
take, but injections were acceptable if they were more effective.</p>

                <p>The lack of awareness of the increased risk and symptoms of cancer-associated
thrombosis is consistent with previous research<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and the All-Party
Parliamentary Thrombosis Group findings in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Misattribution of symptoms was also found by others.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Patients are not the only group to be suboptimally aware. A survey of
oncologists found a quarter of respon-dents did not recognise the risk of
cancer-associated thrombosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> This study emphasises further the need for raised awareness of the risk
and symptoms of cancer-associated thrombosis among clinicians and patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Our data support recommendations<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> that all people with
cancer be made aware of cancer-associated thrombosis risk and venous
thromboembolism symptoms, to aid timely help-seeking.</p>
                <p>Most patients in this sample took the experience of cancer-associated thrombosis
in their stride, although a few were shocked by it being consistent with some
previous findings;<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> two previous studies found that many patients responded negatively to
their cancer-associated thrombosis diagnosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This difference may be
because we recruited from a selected population already prepared to take part in
a trial.</p>
                <p>Research regarding thrombosis in patients without cancer found the experience to
be traumatic for many.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="bibr31-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr32-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>
Participants were young and considered themselves healthy before their
diagnosis. Our participants found cancer-associated thrombosis to be less
disruptive. This can be understood with reference to the theory of ‘biographical
disruption’ wherein illness produces a ‘fundamental re-thinking of the person’s
biography and self-concept’<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> (p. 169). For our sample, it may have been experienced as a ‘continuity’
of biography, rather than a disruption.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In other words, being diagnosed with a very serious illness and already
having made the transition into patient-hood was perhaps protective against the
impact of venous thromboembolism on identity and everyday life.</p>
                <p>Patients in our study found that injected low-molecular-weight heparin was
acceptable, as has been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our data showed that
injected anticoagulation therapy should be understood in the context of cancer.
Although self-injecting and developing a routine (which patients did for tablets
too) can be seen as forms of ‘illness work’,<sup><xref rid="bibr35-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> this work was perceived as minor in the context of the significant burden
of work involved in being a ‘cancer patient’.</p>
                <p>Most patient-participants trusted in the care of their clinicians and followed
their advice over choice of medication without taking into account the relative
effectiveness themselves. Therefore, the onus is on clinicians to know the
guidelines and to prescribe accordingly.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Presently, guidelines endorsed by the International Society on Thrombosis
and Haemostasis<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> recommend the use of low-molecular-weight heparin, but noting that some
patients may find injections burdensome. Some patients and carers have initial
worries over administering injections, but these can be assuaged with guidance
on how to do injections and information on likely discomforts and how to deal
with them. Others did not wish to self-inject but a carer may be prepared to, or
a community nurse can administer the injections.</p>
                <p>The preference for tablets shown by many of our participants is consistent with
previous research,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> but this preference is not without qualification.
Preference for oral administration is rated lower than the other factors, for
example, effectiveness and safety.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Therefore, while patients do generally prefer tablets, the route of
administration is only one consideration. Patients accepted injections, if they
were recommended by their clinician, or they understood them to be more
effective and safe.</p>
                <p>We support the recommendations of the All-Party Parliamentary Thrombosis Group<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> that all National Health Service (NHS) trusts develop a cancer-associated
thrombosis treatment policy based on the latest guidelines,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> taking into account the qualitative research demonstrating the
patient-acceptability of low-molecular-weight heparin.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Future research</title>
                <p>Future research could explore the effect of increasing cancer patients’ awareness
of cancer-associated thrombosis on help-seeking behaviour and experience. The
effects of giving information to patients and carers on how to do injections and
handle the likely drawbacks on the acceptability of low-molecular-weight heparin
could also be evaluated. Finally, contemporaneous data on oncologists’ awareness
of cancer-associated thrombosis and anticoagulation prescribing practice would
be useful.</p>
                <p>There are two key issues. First, are direct oral anticoagulants as effective in
cancer-associated thrombosis as low-molecular-weight heparin? The preliminary
findings of the select-d randomised trial have been presented at the 59th
American Society for Haematology meeting in Atlanta,<sup><xref rid="bibr36-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and another trial reported in full.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Data are promising in terms of effectiveness, although a careful
comparison of the study populations is needed with regard to stage of cancer:
those with more advanced or metastatic disease have a higher incidence of recurrence.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Most select-d participants had more advanced or metastatic disease and
recurrence was the same as low-molecular-weight heparin. However, in Raskob et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> recurrence rate was reduced in the direct oral anticoagulant arm, but
only half had metastatic disease and only third had recurrent cancer.</p>
                <p>Second, are direct oral anticoagulants as safe as low-molecular-weight heparin?
The emerging data show increased total bleeding, and in Raskob et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> the reduced recurrence rate appeared to be at the expense of increased
major bleeding (6.9% vs 4.0%). Although patient-participants in this substudy
expressed preference for equal effectiveness and reported
low-molecular-weight-heparin-related adverse effects, they mentioned little
about bleeding. This is in contrast to existing literature where bleeding is
described as a terrifying event. However, none of these patient-participants had
experienced a major bleed, and only a few had experienced minor bleeds;
therefore, it is unsurprising that few raised concerns about bleeding. They did,
however, talk a lot about other drawbacks of low-molecular-weight heparin
administration in the context of these being an acceptable payoff for an
effective treatment. We do not know what information they had been given about
risk of bleeding and they had little knowledge about the risk of
cancer-associated thrombosis. We therefore cannot conclude that
patient-participants were not worried about bleeding risk.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>

treated in many NHS sites. It is the first study to interview patients
<italic>and</italic> carers with experience of taking direct oral
anticoagulants.</p>
                <p>Many interviews were conducted by phone with the inherent inability to register
non-verbal cues such as body language. However, ‘non-visual paralinguistic cues’
can be just as useful as facial expressions and body language.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The method of interview does not appear to have influenced the content or
quality of the data. Patients and carers may have responded differently if
interviewed separately.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Conversely, interviewees may feel safe together and facilitate rapport-building.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0269216318815377" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The views of the carers could be included, and patients and carers could
reflect together on their experiences.</p>
                <p>Patient-participants had already consented to take part in a clinical trial, and
so this represents a pre-selected group who may not be fully representative. It
was difficult to recruit patients who had stopped their medication early, and so
their voices may not be fairly represented. All participants identified as White
British, and results may have included different opinions had we a more
ethnically diverse sample.</p>
                <p>The two interviewers (A.H. and S.R.) were non-clinicians with no investment or
clinical opinion on either drug. Nevertheless, the other researchers are
clinicians with biases from clinical experience, possibly seen in the
interpretation of the data. The chief investigator of the select-d trial (A.Y.)
was on the qualitative substudy team. However, the only members of the team
immersed in the data collection and analysis were A.H. and S.R. This study was
funded by Bayer; however, they had no input into the analysis and interpretation
of the data.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Patients’ lack of awareness of cancer-associated thrombosis is concerning. Cancer
patients should be informed of this risk and related symptoms to enable prompt
help-seeking. Most patients found tablets more convenient, but low-molecular-weight
heparin was acceptable in the context of cancer and its treatment despite drawbacks.
Oral anticoagulants could provide a welcome choice for patients preferring tablets,
once sufficient, robust data can inform the risk–benefit balance between
low-molecular-weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants.</p>
