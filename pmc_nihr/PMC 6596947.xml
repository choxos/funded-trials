              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Care home residents are at increased risk of infections due to weakened immunity, close-proximity living and multimorbidity and are prescribed antibiotics for an average of almost 20 days each year, far more than the general population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> High antibiotic use increases the risk of colonisation and infection with antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms that may then cycle within care homes and spread between hospitals and community. Infections in care home residents cost the NHS &gt;£54 million/year in hospitalisation alone<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and are the most common reason for residents to be hospitalised. AMR Gram-negative septicaemia and AMR urinary tract infection (UTI) are on the increase in the community, especially among older people.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Recent consumption of antibiotics is the greatest risk factor for carriage and infection with AMR bacteria even after controlling for age, comorbidity and other risk factors.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> AMR infections are generally more serious and are associated with longer hospital stays, increased costs and increased risk of poor outcomes including death, particularly in older people.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evidence-based interventions are needed to improve the quality of life through reducing the incidence of common infections and antibiotic use.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Other than vaccination and hygiene methods, there are few interventions proven to prevent infection in care homes, and even so-called ‘minor’ infections can have an important negative impact on health, well-being and dignity, especially for older, frail people.</p>
              <p>Probiotics are defined by the WHO as ‘live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host’.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> They may prevent infection by blocking pathogenic colonisation and enhancing gut-immune interaction, with influence on mucosal and systemic immunity, leading to enhanced natural killer cell activity and vaccine response<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in older people.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> A systematic review and meta-analysis found that probiotics reduced the risk of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and reduced antibiotic prescribing in adults and that side effects were minor.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the review noted poor allocation concealment in several studies and heterogeneity in findings and recommended that future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) should ‘focus on older people’. Meta-analysis indicates that probiotics can reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD), but more research is needed to determine which probiotics are associated with greatest efficacy and for which patients receiving which specific antibiotics.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Probiotics may also reduce AMR colonisation,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which could be important as most UTIs arise from autoinoculation with gut organisms.</p>
              <p>Effects of probiotics are thought to vary by strain due to differing resistance to gastric acid and bile, ability to colonise mucosa and susceptibility to antibiotics. <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic>, GG (LGG) is the most studied probiotic, including in elderly populations, and has been found to be safe. In a meta-analysis of RCTs involving 1805 children, LGG reduced the risk of otitis media, URTI and antibiotic use.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> LGG may act as an immune adjuvant to influenza vaccination<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and benefit oral health.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Many studies have utilised several strains of probiotic simultaneously (which may increase efficacy due to differing modes of action), and LGG and <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic>, BB-12 (BB-12) have been included in the same probiotic formulation.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> The combination probiotic reduced severity and duration of URTIs in 231 college students.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The combination probiotic, and BB-12 alone, have been shown to reduce URTIs and otitis media in infants<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> and to reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and stabilise bowel microbiota in adults.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, neither probiotic strain has been evaluated primarily in care home residents. Although probiotics are effective in preventing AAD,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 25</xref> evidence is lacking on the prevention of all-cause common infections and antibiotic prescribing in care homes.</p>

                <title>Informed consent</title>
                <p>Informed consent or a consultee declaration (see below) will be obtained prior to any trial procedures. Where there are concerns that a resident may have impaired mental capacity, a mental capacity assessment will be undertaken by a qualified research nurse (RN) in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Eligible residents may participate in the trial even if they (or their consultee) prefer to opt out from providing blood and/or stool and/or saliva samples. Residents who provide informed consent at trial entry will be asked to agree to remain in the study in the event of a loss of capacity. The PRINCESS RNs will be trained in how to assess capacity, and trial participants will be (re)assessed regularly.

If a consultee who has an unpaid or non-professional role in care cannot be identified, or is not willing to act, a nominated consultee will be appointed and consulted prior to including the resident in the trial. If a consultee themselves loses capacity or dies during the trial period, an alternative family member or friend will be contacted to act as consultee and a new consultee declaration form will be completed. If there is no one to represent the resident concerning the trial, they will be ineligible or withdrawn if already recruited. If agreement for the resident to participate is provided by a consultee due to lack of capacity and they regain capacity during the trial, the participant will be fully informed and consent to remain in the trial will be sought from the participant themselves. If a consultee is required and they cannot attend a face-to-face interview, the above documents may be sent from and returned to the care homes by post.</p>

                <p>Participants will be remotely randomised using an online system developed and hosted by the University of Oxford Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit (Sortition). Participants will be randomised to either probiotic or placebo in a 1:1 ratio using minimisation. Allocations will be balanced by care home and resident gender. A random component, set at 80%, will maintain integrity of the allocation process. As PRINCESS is a double-blind trial, the participants, care home staff, treating clinicians and trial team (including the trial statistician and RNs conducting all assessments) will be unaware of the group to which the participant has been allocated for the duration of the trial. If unblinding is needed, the procedure will be documented and performed by the independent statistician, and as a back-up the Centre for Trials Research (CTR) pharmacovigilance and safety team will also be trained to perform this function.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants will be asked to take an oral dose of probiotic (LGG and BB-12) or a matched placebo (containing maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and silicon dioxide) as a capsule once daily for up to 12 months. The manufacturer of study products is Chr. Hansen A/S, Bøge Alle 10–12, 2970 Hørsholm, Denmark. The dates of manufacture of study products are December 2015 (total cell count per capsule 1.6×10<sup>10</sup>) and March 2017 (total cell count per capsule 1.3×10<sup>10</sup>).</p>
                <p>The probiotic or placebo (referred to as study product) will be administered by the resident’s normal caregiver. The preferred route of administration will be as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The capsule swallowed whole with water.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Capsule will be emptied into a small amount of cold or lukewarm liquid and swallowed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Capsule contents will be sprinkled onto cold or lukewarm (not hot) food and eaten.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>The capsules will be suitable for vegans, are Halal and Kosher (Kosher dairy excluding Passover), will not contain any genetically modified organisms or raw materials and allergen labelling will not be required. The capsules will contain lactose. They will be stable at room temperature for 2 years and temperature monitoring will not be required for short-term (eg, 1 month) storage. Participants admitted to hospital will not be expected to continue taking study product during their hospital stay. Data regarding participants’ adherence to study product will be collected from several sources including medication administration record sheets and regular capsule counts (of unused study product). Stool culture will also be used to determine the presence of probiotic organisms in the bowel of participants who provide consent for these samples at baseline, 3 and up to 12 months. This will give an indication of adherence, survival of the probiotic in the large bowel and potential contamination in the placebo arm. Study product will be continued even when on antibiotics and other medications.</p>

                  <p>*Diarrhoea is defined as: ’the abnormal passing of loose or liquid stools, with increased frequency and/or increased volume' (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Knowledge Summaries). However, the norm for the participant will also considered when collecting this information as care home residents often have loose stools as a result of overflow or aperient use rather than an infective cause. Stool charts are kept in care homes that usually record stool consistency based on the Bristol Stool Chart, and our RNs will have access to these charts. We have trained our RNs to record the presence of loose stools. AAD will be defined as diarrhoea occurring following administration of antibiotics and up to 8 weeks after stopping antibiotic treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The original target for the PRINCESS trial was to randomise 330 participants from around 20 care homes in Wales and England for 90% power at the 5% level to demonstrate a 10% relative reduction in CAADs (assuming an average CAAD of 17.4 days and an absolute reduction in the probiotic arm to 15.6 days per resident-year). We consider that a 10% reduction is feasible and would be clinically important.</p>
                  <p>This sample size accounted for 30% of participants being lost to follow-up due to withdrawal or death during the study.</p>
                  <p>An interim assessment (to determine if we met the Stop/Go contractual criteria) of primary outcome ascertainment revealed that the mean percentage of days for which there are valid antibiotic administration data (ie, either no antibiotics administered or the number of days on which antibiotics have been administered in each week) is 77.4% or 283 days out of a possible 365 on average. This percentage varies depending on the length of time participants have been in the study. However, it remains high for participants in the study for over 6 months and does not consider other data sources that might be used (eg, hospital discharge summaries, medication administration records). This is likely therefore to underestimate availability of primary outcome data, but nevertheless is a more accurate reflection of the likely level of follow-up when compared with our original assumption.</p>
                  <p>Given slower than anticipated recruitment, and this new information regarding the trade-off between numbers of participants required and average length of follow-up, we will aim to randomise between 258 and 270 participants. Assuming a mean number of days for which primary outcome data will be available (ie, accounting for follow-up time and missing data) of approximately 250 days, this will provide at least 82% power to detect a 10% relative reduction in CAAD.</p>

                  <p>The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat and will consist of a between-group comparison of mean CAAD using Poisson regression.

Negative binomial regression will be used in the presence of overdispersed count data. For secondary outcomes, depending on the type of data, a mixture of two-level Poisson, linear, logistic and Cox models will be used to appropriately compare trial arms with respect to rates, means, proportions and time to events.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Interventions that reduce antibiotic use, incidence and severity of infections and antimicrobial resistance in care home residents have the potential to improve health, save costs and help preserve the efficacy of existing antibiotics. Currently, infections are the the most common reason for the hospitalisation of care home residents, and at a time when we are experiencing AMR because of antibiotic overuse, there is urgent need to investigate safe and effective alternatives for preventing infections and enhancing immunity. Probiotics are cheap, safe and have minimal side effects, and there are plausible mechanisms by which they may enhance resilience against infection in care home residents and thus reduce antibiotic use. This could lead in turn to containing antibiotic resistance and reduce the risk of side effects from antibiotics. However, empirical evidence is needed to determine whether care home residents should take probiotics to reduce antibiotic use and prevent infection. This study will also add to the evidence base about the influence of taking probiotic on measures of immunity, including response to seasonal influenza vaccine. The PRINCESS trial will determine the efficacy of probiotics to reduce antibiotic use and infections in care home residents with potential benefits to the community and healthcare delivery. A lay summary of the results and links to publications will be made available on the University trial website and will be given to the care home, the participant and/or their consultee.</p>
