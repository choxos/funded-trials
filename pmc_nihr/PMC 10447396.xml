                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Previous studies have reported an association between warm temperature and asthma hospitalisation. They have reported different sex-related and age-related vulnerabilities; nevertheless, little is known about how this effect has changed over time and how it varies in space. This study aims to evaluate the association between asthma hospitalisation and warm temperature and investigate vulnerabilities by age, sex, time and space.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We retrieved individual-level data on summer asthma hospitalisation at high temporal (daily) and spatial (postcodes) resolutions during 2002–2019 in England from the NHS Digital. Daily mean temperature at 1 km×1 km resolution was retrieved from the UK Met Office. We focused on lag 0–3 days. We employed a case–crossover study design and fitted Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models accounting for possible confounders (rainfall, relative humidity, wind speed and national holidays).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>After accounting for confounding, we found an increase of 1.11% (95% credible interval: 0.88% to 1.34%) in the asthma hospitalisation risk for every 1°C increase in the ambient summer temperature. The effect was highest for males aged 16–64 (2.10%, 1.59% to 2.61%) and during the early years of our analysis. We also found evidence of a decreasing linear trend of the effect over time. Populations in Yorkshire and the Humber and East and West Midlands were the most vulnerable.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This study provides evidence of an association between warm temperature and hospital admission for asthma. The effect has decreased over time with potential explanations including temporal differences in patterns of heat exposure, adaptive mechanisms, asthma management, lifestyle, comorbidities and occupation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Asthma is the second most prevalent chronic respiratory disease globally (3.6%) and the first in the Western world.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The prevalence of asthma in the UK is among the highest in the world with direct National Health Service (NHS) costs for managing asthma being estimated at £1 billion per annum with 12% of these costs being for hospital care.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Several risk factors, such as smoking, physical activity, medication, etc, have been known to trigger asthma symptoms.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In addition, environmental risk factors such as inhaling cold air, air pollutants and allergens can trigger asthma symptoms and exacerbations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> Previous studies have examined the role of warm temperatures on asthma hospitalisation, with the results being inconclusive.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–16</xref>
</p>
              <p>The impact of ambient warm temperature on asthma hospitalisation has received considerable attention recently.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–16</xref> Studies in Korea, Shanghai, China and the Los Angeles County, USA reported weak, if any, evidence of an association between increasing mean daily or maximum temperature and asthma hospitalisations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10 11</xref> In contrast, studies in Hong Kong, Himeji City, Japan, Taiwan, 1816 cities in Brazil, Maryland, USA, New York City, USA and Beijing, China reported an increased asthma hospitalisation risk with higher temperature especially during summer months.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 13 15–19</xref>
</p>
              <p>Some of the reasons contributing towards the above-mentioned discrepancies include decisions about the lags, temperature metrics, outcome definitions and selection of confounders, in addition to different adaptation mechanisms (eg, prevalence of air conditioning, building infrastructure, etc), population characteristics (eg, deprivation, age distribution, etc) and meteorology across the different countries. Methodological aspects might also limit the generalisability of previous studies. The temporal or geographical resolution in some of the previous studies is coarse leading to a less accurate exposure assignment; most studies examine daily hospitalisation with one study considering monthly hospitalisations,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and most previous studies assign exposure at the city level.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> Most studies with individual data were conducted in urban settings, which limits the generalisability of their results given that temperatures in urban settings are typically higher and less variable.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> One study was nationwide in Taiwan, but the geographical resolution was coarse and the exposure available only at 25 meteorological stations.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Previous studies have examined effect modification by age and sex,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17</xref> space<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11 16</xref> and by time,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> but none considered all these dimensions together.</p>
              <p>In this nationwide study in England, we examine the effect of ambient temperature on hospital admissions for asthma during 2002–2019. This study aims to address some of the limitations in previous studies by covering one of the largest temporal windows for asthma hospitalisations in the literature, using individual data and exploiting high geographical resolution to link outcome (~100 m) with the exposure (1 km). We account for different meteorological confounders and investigate how the effect of ambient temperature on asthma hospitalisations is modified by age and sex. We also examine how the effect is modified by time and region, as we expect the effect to have attenuated over time, for reasons including adaptation (including changes in behaviours, heat-health warnings, etc), improvement in asthma treatment and awareness of asthma management, etc, and to be different across space (due to factors that might also vary in space such as differences in green space, socioeconomic deprivation, etc).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref>

                <p>We retrieved all inpatient hospital admissions for asthma in England during 2002–2019 from NHS Digital Hospital Episode Statistics data held by the UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit. Age, postcode of residence at time of hospitalisation and date of hospitalisation were available for each record. We investigated the main diagnostic groups J45 (Asthma) and J46 (Status asthmaticus) according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10 as the main diagnosis of the hospitalisation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The analysis is restricted to June, July and August during which the highest temperatures are reached in England.

We calculated mean daily temperature taking the average of maximum daily and minimum daily temperatures during 2002–2009. We selected the mean as the metric to capture the average daily exposure to temperature, in contrast with the min, which reflects exposure at night, or the max, which reflects exposure at midday. To assign daily mean temperature to health records, the postcode centroids of each patient were spatially linked to the 1 km<italic toggle="yes">×</italic>1 km grid cell, applying a 100 m fuzziness to the postcode location to fulfil governance requirements.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> For the main analysis, we averaged the daily mean temperatures across the 3 days prior to the hospital admission (lags 0–3), as the delayed effect of heat exposure on health outcomes is expected to last a few days.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20 25</xref>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this nationwide study in England investigating the short-term effect of ambient summer temperature on asthma hospitalisations during 2002–2019, we find evidence of an increased risk of asthma hospitalisation associated with increasing temperature. The effect of ambient temperature exposure appears to be modified by sex and age, with males aged between 16 and 64 years being the most vulnerable population. When we assessed the change in magnitude of this effect over time, we found that the temperature-related asthma hospitalisation risk is largest during 2002–2007, whereas there is weak, if any, effect during 2008–2013 and 2014–2019. We also observed some spatial variation with populations living in the regions of Yorkshire and the Humber and East and West Midlands being most vulnerable.</p>
              <p>Our study is comparable with previous studies assessing asthma hospital admissions and ambient temperature during warmer months, rather than studies assessing heat waves and extreme temperatures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our study is in line with a time series study in Hong Kong using lag 0–3 mean temperature and accounting for relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, influenza and air pollution, which reported an increased asthma hospitalisation relative risk (1.19; 95% CI 1.06, 1.36) at 30°C compared with 27°C during the hot season.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The same study reported that the effect of temperature during the hot season was largest in adults aged between 15 and 59 years.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Our results are in contrast with those of a time series study in Shanghai, China, focusing on different temperature metrics and accounting for meteorology and air pollution, which reported no association between asthma hospitalisations and warm temperatures.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A case–crossover study in Brazil during 2000–2015 examined temperature variability and asthma hospitalisations and reported a higher effect in people aged 80 or older, with weak evidence of effect modification by sex.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In our study, there is weak evidence that people aged 65 or older were vulnerable, while we observed a strong effect modification by sex for temperature-related asthma hospitalisations.</p>
              <p>The age modification we observed might have multiple explanations. People aged between 5 and 64 years are likely to be exposed more to environmental triggers in comparison to the older subgroup who stay mostly at home, do not work and have a less active social life. The adult population could also be more vulnerable due to the higher prevalence of smoking in the adult population resulting in a more severe airway inflammation and lower lung function, which potentially could lead to increased vulnerability to higher temperatures.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 37</xref> The above suggests engaging patients and carers to raise awareness of the adverse effects of temperature. The weak observed effect in the older population could also reflect outcome misclassification (non-differential) due to the multiple comorbidities that this population is suffering from.</p>
              <p>We observed that the effect of ambient temperature on asthma hospitalisations has attenuated over time. Potential explanations of this trend include adaptive mechanisms to heat exposure over time,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> such as more consistent adherence to medication over time, effectiveness of the heat alerts (they were introduced in 2004), infrastructure changes and improved healthcare. Based on the period analysis, the effect is most prominent in males aged 15–65 years, which could also point towards sex-related differences in exposure due to differences in behaviours, lifestyle and occupation, but also could imply differences in the prevalence of other comorbid chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Nevertheless, we cannot rule out potential residual confounding due to data availability or due to differences in the exposure (duration of heat period, changes in maximum/minimum temperatures) across the years. The decreasing trend should be further monitored and re-examined in the future considering future changes in the climate, factors influenced by these changes (eg, allergen concentration) and the increasing burden of asthma.</p>
              <p>In line with our study, previous studies in Taiwan and Brazil have reported effect modification by space.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 16</xref> We observed that populations in the regions of Yorkshire and the Humber and East Midlands are the most vulnerable. Potential explanations include spatial effect modifiers that are most prominent in these regions, such as allergen concentration, higher air pollution levels (particulate matter) and higher prevalence of smoking. Nevertheless, we should iterate that the evidence for heterogeneity in the effect by space is weak as the CrIs of the effects overlap with the CrIs of the effects nationwide.</p>
              <p>The observed discrepancies with some previous studies can have multiple explanations. The choice of confounding adjustment can impact the results. In addition, the temperature metrics and lags used across the studies are not consistent. Apart from min, mean, max and range of temperature, a couple of studies have used temperature variation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 39</xref> In our study we used the mean, as we were interested in the overall effect of the temperature during the day and were not interested in the impact of night temperatures (using min) or extreme heat during midday (using max). It is hard, nevertheless, to predict how this choice could impact the results, as the different temperature metrics point towards different exposure windows. Previous studies had available coarser geographical resolution (city or county level), which can lead to misclassification of the exposure and inadequate confounding adjustment. In addition, most previous studies are focused on urban settings,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 12 15–17</xref> whereas our study provides nationwide estimates. Last, resources for healthcare setting, health promotion and infrastructure across the different countries could contribute to the observed discrepancies.</p>
              <p>The main strength of our study is the availability of high geographical resolution of the outcome. This allows us to link the outcome with the exposure and confounders with very high precision minimising potential misclassification. As hospitalisations were retrieved from NHS Digital (nationwide central data on hospital admissions), we expect to cover most of the asthma hospitalisation burden in England, minimising any selection bias. We used individual-level data, which allows us to examine individual-level vulnerabilities, for example, related to age and sex, and to avoid ecological bias.</p>
              <p>We assigned temperature exposure using the residential address of the cases and used this as a proxy for individual exposure to temperature. This proxy is expected to be more accurate for adults aged 65 years or older who are expected to stay longer at home or somewhere in the direct proximity. In addition to this, we used the outdoor temperature which is expected to be different from the temperature inside the house. The misclassification induced by this is not expected to be differential and to lead to bias. Data for relative humidity and wind speed were only available at coarse geographical resolution, namely at 11 km×11 km, which likely misses the localised trends in these covariates and could potentially lead to inadequate adjustment for confounding. The results depend on the assumption that air pollution is a mediator and not a confounder. We could not check the validity of this assumption, as data for air pollution are available only after 2008, when the effect of temperature on asthma hospital admissions is weak.</p>
              <p>The direct biological mechanism by which higher temperatures trigger asthma exacerbations is unclear. Warm temperatures can aggravate the respiratory system-related burden, as they can affect the electrolyte balance.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> High temperatures may activate the c-fibre nerve and enhance bronchoconstriction leading to higher morbidity.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, warmer temperatures can increase allergen or air pollution (in particular O<sub>3</sub>) concentrations, or help the reproduction and spread of viruses and bacteria causing or aggravating respiratory diseases.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>This study provides evidence of an association between warm temperatures and asthma exacerbations in England. More studies in counties with different climate, healthcare and social behaviours are needed to further understand the generalisability of the results. The effect of warm temperatures on asthma hospitalisation has attenuated over time suggesting potential adaptive mechanisms to heat exposure or differences in behaviours, lifestyle, comorbid conditions, other environmental exposures and occupation over time.</p>
