For professional CGM technology to be viable in primary care, implementation must be straightforward with glucose data reports that can be rapidly generated and interpreted to aide communication with patients and therapy adjustments.

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We used a blinded professional sensor-based glucose monitoring system to perform retrospective glucose data analysis (FreeStyle Libre Pro™; Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, Oxon, UK). The sensor, worn on the upper arm, is factory calibrated and requires no participant or healthcare professional intervention during the 14-day wear. The pro-reader is retained by the healthcare professional and data are not visible to participants or investigators during sensor wear. The sensor automatically captures and stores glucose data every 15 min (96 glucose readings/day). At follow-up visits, scanning the sensor will wirelessly transfer glucose data to the pro-reader. Summary glucose reports (including ambulatory glucose profile) for review and analysis by the healthcare professional are generated using the system software.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>This pilot, prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted at 18 general primary healthcare centres and five secondary care diabetes centres in England (total centres n = 23). Eligible participants were ⩾18 years of age with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin therapy for at least 6 months and an HbA1c level between 58 and 108 mmol/mol (7.5%–12.0%). Exclusion criteria included use of animal insulin, total daily dose of insulin (TDD) &gt; 1.75 iu/kg on study entry, insulin pump therapy, CGM use in the last 6 months (including professional CGM), steroid therapy for any condition, pregnant or planning pregnancy, allergy to medical grade adhesives or considered unsuitable to participate by the investigator.</p>
                <p>Ethics Committee approval was granted prior to the study and all procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013. Informed, written consent was obtained from all participants in the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02434315).</p>

                <p>Following consent, screening and enrolment, all participants had a professional flash sensor applied to the upper arm for the 14-day baseline period. Glucose management was supported by their usual regimen of SMBG using their personal device. During each sensor wear, participants were asked to record SMBG results, meals, insulin doses and any physical activity in a diary. Participants with baseline sensor data of ⩾500 sensor glucose readings were randomised to one of the three study groups detailed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164119827456">Figure 1</xref>). Post randomisation, sensor glucose data were uploaded for intervention participants (group B and group C) and glucose reports (e.g. the ambulatory glucose report) were generated using the system software.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This information was used by the healthcare professional to support an individualised glucose management plan while participants continued SMBG testing during the treatment phase.

                <p>Differences within group, including the primary endpoint analysis, were assessed by a paired t-test. Missing values were imputed by last observation carried forward.

Differences between groups were considered by analysis of covariance on the baseline values with site as a covariate. Confidence intervals were calculated for the group least squares mean of each measure and the difference between group least squares means.

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial investigating the role of Libre Pro in modulating glycaemia in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes managed in both primary and secondary care settings.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="bibr22-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr23-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although the primary endpoint of change in TIR was not achieved, the study showed a significant reduction in HbA1c in the intervention arm associated with improved quality of life measures. The reduction in HbA1c was evident within and between group analyses, suggesting this is not a spurious finding. As sensor glycaemic readings, patterns and trends could not be seen by any participant in the present study and given they were aware their glucose data were monitored, the likely explanation for the discrepancy between TIR and HbA1c is behaviour modification of study participants while wearing the sensor during the baseline phase. Thus, the decreasing trend in TIR over the study duration for participants randomised to the control arm was likely due to these participants returning to their usual lifestyle/behaviours after the baseline phase was completed and not having a sensor glucose data review included in subsequent clinic visits. The extent of the fall in TIR (i.e. worsening glycaemic control) for the control group was unexpected and more than previously observed in a similar population further supporting the notion of a ‘study effect’.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The blinded nature of the study, possibly giving participants less incentive to continue, may have been a factor in the participant drop-out rate of 18%. Although this was slightly higher than observed in studies using unblinded sensors in type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> it was accounted for in our power calculations (which were based on 20% drop-out rate).</p>
              <p>It is documented that lifestyle modification can markedly influence TIR regardless of monitoring technology.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> As an isolated clinical marker, TIR has the advantage of reflecting intra and inter-day glycaemic changes<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> but may be misleading when individuals modify their lifestyle over a short period of time.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Therefore, having HbA1c as an additional glycaemic marker gives invaluable data as to whether failing to improve TIR is indicative of a lack of effect for the intervention.</p>
              <p>Type 2 diabetes disease progression is marked by escalating therapies and deteriorating glycaemic control<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> which may not respond to intensification of insulin regimens.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Studies using professional continuous monitoring in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes have generally failed to report improvement in HbA1c.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The clinically significant reduction in HbA1c documented in this study, without increasing hypoglycaemic exposure, is a key finding. Moreover, this was achieved in patients treated in both secondary and primary care settings, supporting generalizability of the results. In particular, the large proportion of participants from primary care sites, who had improvement in HbA1c, supports the use of modern glucose monitoring strategies outside secondary care settings.</p>
              <p>There was no change in TDD, however, smaller insulin dose changes may have occurred without any noticeable overall change in total insulin.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> As sensor glucose data were not visible in real-time, the fall in time in hyperglycaemia is likely a direct result of reviewing and discussing retrospective sensor data with the healthcare professional.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The intrinsic value and advantage of clinical dialogue between patient and clinician supported by ‘pictorial’ examples of glycaemic issues and improvements shown in the glucose reports is the least measurable factor. The benefit of this was evident by improved treatment satisfaction supporting the intermittent use of real-time CGM. In contrast, Beck et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> found no improvement in treatment satisfaction in a similar population using real-time-CGM over 6 months. The difference between the two studies may be related to easier application of flash technology compared with CGM or may simply be due to differences in study design and population investigated.</p>
              <p>To date, the number of days of professional or intermittent glucose sensor wear for studies in insulin-treated type 2 has been varied and is usually less than seven days.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Our findings add to the body of evidence for CGM use in type 2 diabetes and recommendations that 14 days of CGM data is effective at providing enough glucose data to enable review of glucose control to target lowering of HbA1c.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="bibr30-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr31-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>With regard to safety, the few events relating to sensor insertion or wear were typical of medical adhesive use and similar to those observed in other cohorts.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1479164119827456" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This was a pilot study and it has a number of strengths that should be highlighted. First, the choice of study population adds to the limited published evidence on the use of CGM in type 2 diabetes. Second, this is the first piece of work to include patients from primary and secondary care settings, therefore, study findings are not limited to a particular group of health care professionals. Third, ‘real-world’ glucose management was used regardless of location of care and there was no mandated treatment protocol. This lack of more directed glucose management may have also been a limitation as glycaemic benefits might have been observed earlier and with fewer sensor wears had an insulin titration algorithm been in place. It is possible that the observed changes in HbA1c for group C may have been due to additional clinical contact and dialogue alone and the changes observed were not related to Libre Pro use. However, this is unlikely to be the case given that these patients were recruited because of poor glycaemic control with previous clinical intervention failing to improve glucose levels.</p>
              <p>Other limitations include the apparent strong study effect observed in the control group which is a concern, although it is unclear how best to tackle this in future professional CGM studies. Moreover, non-blinding of either participants or clinicians can be regarded as a drawback and is a recognised issue with device studies. Finally, the choice of TIR as the primary endpoint, may not have been ideal given the study effect and HbA1c is possibly a better overall glycaemic marker as it is less affected by short-term behavioural modifications.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>To summarise, use of professional flash technology in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes managed within primary and secondary care sites was associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c level and improved satisfaction with treatment. TIR and time in hypoglycaemia were unaffected. These data suggest that this novel professional flash sensor-based glucose monitoring technology has the ability to introduce clinically meaningful changes in HbA1c with a favourable safety profile when used in primary and secondary care settings.</p>
