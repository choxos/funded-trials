                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Digital interventions can change patients’ experiences of managing their health, either creating additional burden or improving their experience of healthcare. This qualitative study aimed to explore perceived burdens and benefits for patients using a digital self-management intervention for reducing high blood pressure. A secondary aim was to further our understanding of how best to capture burdens and benefits when evaluating health interventions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Seven themes were developed which reflected perceived burdens and benefits of using the intervention, including worry about health, uncertainty about self-monitoring and reassurance. The analysis showed how beliefs about their condition and treatment appeared to influence participants’ appraisal of the value of the intervention. This suggested that considering illness and treatment perceptions in Burden of Treatment theory could further our understanding of how individuals appraise the personal costs and benefits of self-managing their health.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Patients’ appraisal of the burden or benefit of using a complex self-management intervention seemed to be influenced by experiences within the intervention (such as perceived availability of support) and beliefs about their condition and treatment (such as perceived control and risk of side effects). Developing our ability to adequately capture these salient burdens and benefits for patients could help enhance evaluation of self-management interventions in the future. Many participants perceived important benefits from using the intervention, highlighting the need for theory to recognise that engaging in self-management can include positive as well as negative aspects.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The work involved in looking after one’s health when living with a chronic condition can include complex tasks such as organising and adhering to treatment regimens, interacting with healthcare professionals (HCP), regular monitoring of health indicators and making health-related decisions, all of which can accumulate into a considerable burden.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Digital self-management interventions are often developed to improve health outcomes, but these interventions could also either increase or minimise the burden of the healthcare process for patients. Developing our understanding of the burdens of self-management can help to better optimise the delivery of healthcare to improve adherence and well-being.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Burden of Treatment (BoT) theory provides a mechanism for understanding these experiences in the context of patients’ personal capacity to cope, with emphasis on the role of wider healthcare systems and social networks available to the patient.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Health economic evaluations also focus on understanding the impact of healthcare on patients, seeking to weigh up the resources used against the health outcomes in order to better inform decision-making. Recent guidelines for economic evaluations in health and medicine recommend adopting a societal perspective such that all relevant outcomes are evaluated, rather than focusing only on formal healthcare costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In particular, personal costs such as time spent in self-care should be included. Consequently, BoT theory and health economic evaluations share an interest in adequately capturing the wider burdens or personal costs of engaging with healthcare. For consistency in terminology in this paper, negative outcomes/personal costs of healthcare will be referred to as ‘burdens’.</p>
              <p>BoT theory considers patients’ time as a resource that is used by the healthcare system, while health economic evaluation counts time as an ‘opportunity cost’ where the patient ‘spends’ time that could have been spent on something other than healthcare. However, subjective experiences of time spent on digital interventions may be varied and complex. Heterogeneity in the relative value placed on the outcomes of the intervention<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> may mean that for some participants the time spent engaging with elements of an intervention is not perceived as a burden but rather as a benefit, either because it is interesting, pleasant or meaningful in and of itself or because of the positive outcomes it can lead to. In other words, some people may actually like engaging with healthcare. The value of exploring the personal benefits of intervention participation has not received as much focus as understanding the costs, such as treatment burden. McNamee <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> proposed that the health research guidelines for economic analysis may need to be adjusted for digital health interventions to ensure we can fully capture the heterogeneous costs and benefits arising when complex interventions are implemented in complex systems.</p>
              <p>To further our understanding of how patients perceive benefits and burdens when using digital health interventions, we carried out a qualitative process study.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The digital Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP) intervention was developed based on best practice recommendations to help improve hypertension in poorly controlled patients by facilitating self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP) at home and prompting appropriate intensification of medication by HCPs.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This intervention could help minimise the treatment burden of hypertension by providing an online healthcare system in which HCPs have sight of patients’ home readings, streamlining the process for finding the most effective medication without the need for attending the general practitioner (GP) surgery. However, HOME BP is a complex, interactive multicomponent intervention, which creates potential diversity in the perceived burden and benefits for participants using it. The contexts in which the intervention is embedded may also be diverse, and factors such as individual differences in patients’ health status, beliefs about medication and risks of high BP, availability of time and resources, and access to support may influence how the intervention is perceived and valued. The HOME BP intervention was developed using the person-based approach<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which emphasises the importance of understanding participants’ unique perspectives and different situations when developing and implementing digital interventions. Adopting a more granular approach to the evaluation of benefit and burden is consistent with the person-based approach, and with the BoT approach of fully understanding the participants’ perspective.</p>
              <p>The present study aimed to explore the perceived burden and benefits of using a digital health intervention for self-managing BP using qualitative process interviews with intervention and usual care participants taking part in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This paper seeks to interpret the implications for optimising the capture of perceived costs and benefits in health economic evaluations and evaluating the burden of treatment.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The HOME BP programme supported participants to self-manage their high BP, primarily via home self-monitoring of BP and making changes to dose/drug type when recommended by the HCP. Lifestyle change modules were also available, but optional as the key target behaviours for the intervention were self-monitoring and medication change adherence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11</xref> Participants using HOME BP were supported by a ‘prescriber’ (GP or nurse prescriber responsible for changing medication) and a ‘supporter’ (nurse or healthcare assistant who supported participants in self-monitoring and choosing lifestyle changes).</p>
                <p>Participants were invited to use the online programme by their GP and were randomised to usual care or intervention after completing baseline measures online. Those randomised to the intervention group completed two online training sessions which sought to overcome concerns about variability in readings and changing medication. Participants were encouraged to monitor their BP in the mornings, but the programme allowed flexibility as it was most important that people found a time of day that suited them to monitor their BP. Both intervention and usual care participants were followed up at 6 and 12 months after randomisation.</p>

                <p>Patients were eligible to take part in the HOME BP trial if they had uncontrolled hypertension managed in Primary Care (mean BP reading of 140/90 mm Hg or more at baseline taken at the GP surgery using a validated electronic automated sphygmomanometer (BP TRU BPM-200)). In addition, they needed to be prescribed one to three antihypertensive medications at baseline, and aged over 18 (full inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the protocol<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
                <p>Both intervention and usual care participants were invited to take part in interviews as we felt that obtaining an understanding of managing BP in usual care would aid interpretation of the perceived burden and benefits of the intervention. We aimed to speak to participants at a range of time-points during the 12-month trial from 10 weeks onwards as this gave participants the opportunity to become familiar with HOME BP. No new intervention content was introduced after the lifestyle sessions became available at 9 weeks.</p>

                <p>A subsample of RCT participants were invited by email to provide feedback on their experiences of managing their BP (n=78 of 622 patients in the RCT). Informed consent was taken by post or online, depending on participant preference. Recruitment was initially opportunistic, but subsequently a purposive approach was adopted to target younger participants, low engagers and those with recent uncontrolled self-monitored BP readings, informed by the concurrent analysis. Recruitment was stopped once the researchers agreed that data saturation had been reached and no new burdens or benefits were arising.</p>
                <p>Semistructured interview schedules were codeveloped by experts in health psychology (KM, KB, RJB, LY, LD), health economics (JR) and sociology (CM). Open, inductive questions were carefully selected to elicit data about the burden and benefits of BP management perceived as most salient by the participants (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary file 2</xref> for interview schedules). The interviews were conducted by telephone to minimise the burden on participants, except in one case where the participant asked to meet face-to-face due to struggling with hearing on the telephone. The interviews took place between February 2016 and February 2017. Each participant was given a £10 gift voucher to thank them for their time.</p>

                    <title>Reassurance from keeping an eye on BP</title>
                    <p>Most participants liked having an increased focus on their BP through regular monitoring and found it interesting to compare their readings over time. However, one participant perceived that taking BP regularly could encourage too much attention on your health, which was a potential burden of the intervention for her (Intervention p28, BP control unknown as did not enter BP readings on HOME BP). This participant had low concern about her BP generally, and was not motivated to engage in self-management.</p>
                    <p>Even when participants had poorly controlled readings, many felt a benefit from the intervention as it enabled them to regularly check their BP and detect any problems instantly rather than carrying on unaware.</p>
                    <disp-quote>
                      <p>I think it’s helping me to know where my blood pressure stands because it’s a regular thing every month. (Intervention p24, poorly controlled)</p>
                    </disp-quote>
                    <p>The knowledge that home readings were shared with the prescriber reassured participants as they knew that any problems would be detected and dealt with at the time, making them feel well cared for. This contrasted with the perceived burden of managing BP in usual care where some participants felt concerned that their GP did not change their medication when their home readings were too high, or would have liked more regular contact with their GP surgery to check their BP and medication.</p>
                    <disp-quote>
                      <p>It would be nice to have it checked, I guess, you know, every three months or whatever. How—however often. I mean, how do they know that everything is working? (Usual care p4)</p>
                    </disp-quote>
                    <p>This shows that although participants in usual care gained reassurance from seeing low readings when they monitored at home, the lack of interaction with the GP surgery could cause concern when readings were high or when patients did not regularly monitor BP at home of their own accord.</p>

                    <p>Perceptions about the causes of high BP also influenced how anxious people felt about seeing high readings. Those who felt that high readings held serious implications for their health tended to feel frightened. Some even felt apprehensive <italic>before</italic> self-monitoring in case their readings were out of range, as they did not want to see evidence that their BP was too high or low.</p>

                    </disp-quote>
                    <p>Other people were able to dismiss one-off high readings without feeling anxious as they attributed high readings to less threatening explanations such as feeling stressed, not sitting still for long enough, positioning of the cuff or held a prior expectation of it being normal for BP to fluctuate. In these cases, the high readings had less negative emotional impact as they were not interpreted as indicating a serious underlying health issue.</p>

Anxiety about future health could over-ride concerns about medication side effects or dependency as the behaviour was evaluated as beneficial in order to bring BP down, although sometimes participants still experienced conflict between the perceived benefit and burden.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This qualitative study has identified diverse perceived burdens and benefits of using a self-management digital intervention for high BP. In support of the BoT theory,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the HOME BP intervention appeared to reduce the burden on patients to self-manage their condition by improving access to regular HCP support and facilitating better understanding of their condition, but in some cases there was a burden of worry about health or changing medication. How much benefit a patient perceived from the intervention compared with burden seemed to be influenced by the dynamics of the patient–HCP interaction (described as ‘Improving Cooperation’ in BoT theory) and the patient’s own resources to manage their condition and cope with medication (described as ‘Capacity’).</p>
              <p>Another important factor relating to the burden experienced was personal beliefs about BP and treatment. Those who recognised that their BP was too high and did not have concerns about side effects or taking medication appeared to have more positive experiences of the intervention, perceiving self-monitoring as more worthwhile and feeling less anxious about seeing high readings or changing medication. This is consistent with the necessity-concerns framework.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> BoT theory states that people who are better equipped with resources and are more resilient may cope better with the burden imposed by healthcare,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> but the importance of an individual’s personal conceptualisation of their condition in how burdensome they find self-care is not strongly represented. This beliefs system may be partly encompassed by the ‘Relational Integration’ aspect of BoT theory, which refers to the extent to which patients trust the tasks they do for healthcare (eg, self-monitoring BP), and feel confident in the outcomes of these tasks (eg, changing medication). However, illness and treatment perceptions<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> are not explicitly covered by the theory and it may be helpful to consider them as additional factors which might influence the experience of treatment burden.</p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Implications for measurement of benefit and burden</title>
                <p>The present study demonstrates the value of collecting in-depth qualitative data to develop a detailed understanding of the burden of treatment, and to discover perceptions specific to the context in which the intervention was implemented. The important psychosocial outcomes discovered using qualitative research can inform the selection or development of relevant quantitative measures to capture these factors in further evaluation.</p>
                <p>Quantitative measures have been developed to appraise the structural aspects of burden of treatment,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> but these are not intended to assess psychosocial factors such as reassurance, anxiety or uncertainty which this study suggests can influence the extent to which using an intervention is experienced subjectively as a burden.</p>
                <p>Future research could explore how best to capture the perceived burden or benefit of an intervention. One approach might be to simply ask participants to quantify the net subjective burden or benefit of interventions. However, it could be challenging for participants to weigh complex heterogeneous psychosocial outcomes against one another and decide overall whether an intervention was more burdensome or beneficial. Capturing the extent to which patients experience positive or negative psychosocial outcomes might better assess how beneficial or burdensome the intervention was perceived to be. Although this would not produce a single outcome measure, cost-consequence analysis can be used to inform decision-making when an intervention has multiple relevant outcomes which cannot be aggregated into one value.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Coast <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> discuss whether a multidimensional approach is more informative for economic analysis or if a single aggregated value is more pragmatic.</p>
                <p>Extending the evaluation of outcomes beyond health is in line with the capability approach,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> which focuses on broader aspects of subjective well-being which are not assessed by generic measures such as the EQ-5D (five items for assessing standardised health status).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Tools used to capture perceived capability (such as the ICECAP, a capability measure for use in economic evaluation<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and ASCOT, a tool for evaluating social-care related quality of life)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> are gaining support as holistic measures of economic evaluation, but do not assess the more specific psychosocial burdens and benefits of healthcare raised by participants in this study. Process utility emphasises the need to quantitatively measure the value that people attach to healthcare delivery. This approach might be relevant for evaluating how much value people perceive in the process of using digital health interventions and the capability this achieves.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It has been argued that process utility measures should also ask about the reasons behind patients’ valuations, to better inform the decision-maker.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This would help capture the individual differences found in this study in how people appraise the personal value of a digital intervention, informed by their underlying illness and treatment beliefs.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>A strength of the study was that we used relatively open questions formulated by a multidisciplinary team which enabled us to elicit and explore a wide range of perceived burdens and benefits, some of which were not anticipated at the outset of research. We are aware of the lead researcher’s potential influence on the data analysis, which we strived to minimise by transparent memoing of decisions and regular team meetings to discuss the emerging themes. Participants were sent newsletters to describe the findings of the study, but were not invited to provide feedback on the analysis.</p>
                <p>We succeeded in speaking to well-controlled and poorly controlled hypertensive participants at different points in the intervention, and there was a wide range of demographics in terms of age, education level and gender in the sample. However, the uptake rate from those invited to interviews was not high, particularly in the usual care group. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was difficult to recruit low engagers in the intervention group, which could have helped reach theoretical saturation. In terms of wider applicability, we are aware that these findings may not be generalisable across other health conditions, as the lack of symptoms in hypertension and the stepped pathway for changing medication are quite unique features of this condition.</p>
                <p>Repeated interviews with the same participants may have offered more insights into the dynamic nature of perceived burdens and benefits over time, although more regular conversations about the target behaviour could have influenced participants’ BP management behaviour, therefore threatening the RCT conclusions. It has been noted that a key issue with process evaluations of interventions is the tendency for intervention content and impact to change over time,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> such that deciding the optimal point to collect evaluation data is challenging.</p>
                <p>Some of the burdens and benefits described by patients in this study were also found to a lesser extent in the qualitative development of the HOME BP intervention, such as reassurance from seeing well-controlled readings, and some concerns about side effects and high or variable readings (Bradbury <italic>et al</italic>, Submission, 2017). Others were novel and only arose when participants experienced the full HOME BP intervention during the RCT as opposed to a prototype, for example, the perceived health improvements from medication changes. This demonstrates the value of conducting inductive qualitative research to explore users’ perspectives at each stage of intervention development and evaluation, in line with the person-based approach.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In the context of this digital intervention, the study shows that participants’ appraisal of burdens and benefits appeared to be influenced by both intervention factors, such as BP readings and perceived availability of the HCP, and patient characteristics, such as perceptions of BP control, previous experience of side effects and comorbidities. This nuanced evaluation would be lost in a population-level analysis, demonstrating the advantage of a more individualised approach for better understanding participants’ perspectives of an intervention and how best to minimise the burden of treatment.</p>
              <p>The study develops the recommendations of McNamee <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> that complex digital health interventions warrant a wider perspective for measuring health outcomes, and discusses the implications of capturing broader psychosocial outcomes for BoT theory and health economic evaluations.</p>
              <p>The finding that some participants perceived personal benefits from using the intervention demonstrates that the process of healthcare can, in itself, be positive for some people, highlighting the importance of capturing transient short-term benefits to take these into account as well as the burden of self-management.</p>
