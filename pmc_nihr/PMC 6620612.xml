                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Loss of arm function is a common problem after stroke. Robot-assisted training might improve arm function and activities of daily living. We compared the clinical effectiveness of robot-assisted training using the MIT-Manus robotic gym with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme based on repetitive functional task practice and with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>RATULS was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial done at four UK centres. Stroke patients aged at least 18 years with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation, between 1 week and 5 years after their first stroke, were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive robot-assisted training, EULT, or usual care. Robot-assisted training and EULT were provided for 45 min, three times per week for 12 weeks. Randomisation was internet-based using permuted block sequences. Treatment allocation was masked from outcome assessors but not from participants or therapists. The primary outcome was upper limb function success (defined using the Action Research Arm Test [ARAT]) at 3 months. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN69371850.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 14, 2014, and April 30, 2018, 770 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either robot-assisted training (n=257), EULT (n=259), or usual care (n=254). The primary outcome of ARAT success was achieved by 103 (44%) of 232 patients in the robot-assisted training group, 118 (50%) of 234 in the EULT group, and 85 (42%) of 203 in the usual care group. Compared with usual care, robot-assisted training (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·17 [98·3% CI 0·70–1·96]) and EULT (aOR 1·51 [0·90–2·51]) did not improve upper limb function; the effects of robot-assisted training did not differ from EULT (aOR 0·78 [0·48–1·27]). More participants in the robot-assisted training group (39 [15%] of 257) and EULT group (33 [13%] of 259) had serious adverse events than in the usual care group (20 [8%] of 254), but none were attributable to the intervention.</p>

                  <p>Robot-assisted training and EULT did not improve upper limb function after stroke compared with usual care for patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation. These results do not support the use of robot-assisted training as provided in this trial in routine clinical practice.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Upper limb problems commonly occur after a stroke, comprising loss of movement, coordination, sensation, and dexterity, which lead to difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL) such as washing and dressing. About 80% of people with acute stroke have upper limb motor impairment, and of those with reduced arm function early after stroke, 50% still have problems after 4 years.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The strongest predictor of recovery is severity of initial neurological deficit; patients with severe initial upper limb impairment are unlikely to recover arm function, with clear impact upon their quality of life. Patients report that loss of arm function is one of the most distressing long-term consequences of stroke. Improving upper limb function has been identified as a top ten research priority by stroke survivors, carers, and clinicians.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">How to optimise stroke patients' upper limb recovery is unclear. Systematic reviews of therapy interventions suggest that patients benefit from therapy programmes in which they practise tasks directly rather than from interventions that focus on impairments.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Intensity of therapy is also important; a Cochrane overview<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> of systematic reviews found moderate quality Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations evidence that arm function after a stroke can be improved by the provision of at least 20 h of additional repetitive task training.</p>
              <p id="para30">Robot-assisted arm training has shown promise for improving ADL, arm function, and arm muscle strength after stroke.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, studies vary in patient characteristics, device used, duration and amount of training, control group, and outcome measures used. The benefits of robot-assisted arm training over conventional therapy of the same frequency and duration have not been shown.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Robot-assisted training enables stroke patients with moderate or severe upper limb impairment to perform repetitive tasks in a highly consistent manner, tailored to their motor abilities. A 2018 Cochrane review (45 trials, 1619 participants) reported that electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training improved arm function (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0·32 [95% CI 0·18–0·46]) and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (0·31 [0·09–0·50]). The clinical importance of these differences is unclear and the results should be interpreted with caution because of study heterogeneity and variation in the quality of the included studies. Another review found no difference in any of these outcomes when robot-assisted training was compared with the same duration or intensity of conventional therapy. Theories of neuroplasticity and motor learning support an approach to rehabilitation based on repetitive practice of functional tasks. A 2016 Cochrane review (33 trials, 1853 participants) found that repetitive functional task practice for patients who had a stroke was associated with improved arm function (SMD 0·25 [95% CI 0·01–0·49]), hand function (0·25 [0·00–0·51]), and ADL (0·28 [0·10–0·45]). Again, the clinical importance of these findings is unclear.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">RATULS is the first multicentre trial with adequate statistical power to compare robot-assisted training with both an evidence-based therapy programme of the same frequency and duration (45 min face-to-face therapy, three times per week, for 12 weeks) and usual care. We found no significant difference in our primary outcome of upper limb function at 3 months between stroke patients treated with robot-assisted training, an enhanced upper limb therapy programme (EULT), or usual care. Although some improvements for robot-assisted training were observed in upper limb impairment compared with usual care, these did not translate into improvement in upper limb function or ADL. EULT resulted in less upper limb impairment, better mobility, and better ADL at 3 months compared with usual care. Furthermore, EULT was superior to robot-assisted training for ADL at 3 months.</p>
                  <p id="para90">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">The results of the RATULS trial do not support the routine use of robot-assisted training (MIT-Manus robotic gym) for patients with moderate or severe upper limb functional limitation resulting from stroke. Our findings will inform guidelines about the use of robot-assisted training and EULT in clinical practice. Further research is needed to find ways to translate the improvements in upper limb impairment seen with robot-assisted training into improvements in upper limb function and ADL. This might involve combining robot-assisted training with more functionally orientated therapy strategies. The RATULS trial provides evidence of the potential benefit of EULT, although as delivered in this trial, it is unlikely to be cost-effective. Innovations to make enhanced rehabilitation programmes more clinically effective and cost-effective are needed.</p>

              <p id="para110">This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to establish whether robot-assisted training improved upper limb function after a stroke compared with an enhanced upper limb therapy (EULT) programme of the same frequency and duration and usual care alone. Robot-assisted training and EULT involved repetitive task practice and were provided in addition to usual care.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">Robot-assisted training and EULT programmes were delivered at the same frequency and duration: 45 min of face-to-face therapy, three times per week for 12 weeks. The same therapists and therapy assistants delivered both interventions at each centre. A detailed description of robot-assisted training and EULT using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist is available.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Robot-assisted training and EULT were delivered in addition to usual post-stroke care.</p>
                <p id="para160">The robot-assisted training programme integrated training with all three modules of the MIT-Manus robotic gym (shoulder–elbow module, wrist module, hand module integrated on to the shoulder–elbow module). The EULT programme was designed to reflect best practice using repetitive functional task practice to work towards participant-centred goals.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therapists recorded data on the content of EULT sessions; the MIT-Manus robotic gym recorded data on the robot-assisted training sessions content.</p>
                <p id="para170">Participants assigned to usual care received usual NHS care, which was provided by their local clinical service. The English national quality standard is that patients with stroke should be offered a minimum of 45 min of each appropriate therapy that is required, for a minimum of 5 days per week, at a level that enables the patient to meet their rehabilitation goals for as long as they are continuing to benefit from therapy and as long as they are able to tolerate it. Many stroke units achieve this target for physiotherapy and occupational therapy, but considerable variation exists in service provision after discharge.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Participants in all three groups received an arm rehabilitation therapy log to record any upper limb rehabilitation received during the trial and any self-practice arm exercises done. The schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments can be found in the protocol.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para180">Assessments included the ARAT,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> which assesses upper limb function by scoring the ability to complete a range of functional tasks within four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement), with a total score from zero (no function) to 57 (normal function); Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA);<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Barthel ADL Index;<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), version 3.0;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and measurement of upper limb pain on a numerical rating scale (score 0–10). For all the scores except the upper limb pain scale, a higher score denotes better performance. The total upper extremity FMA scale assesses upper limb impairment by incorporating the motor, sensory, range of motion, and joint pain subscales (score 0–126). The FMA motor subscale is frequently used as a primary outcome in trials of robot-assisted training (score 0–66). The Barthel ADL Index consists of ten activities, together scored from 0 to 20. The SIS is a self-completion, stroke-specific questionnaire to measure quality of life. There are nine dimensions (strength, hand function, mobility, ADL, emotion, memory, communication, social participation, and stroke recovery). The dimension scores range from 0 to 100. All adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded in accordance with National Research Ethics Service Committee guidance for trials that are not assessing an investigational medicinal product.</p>
                <p id="para190">Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from participant responses to the EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> questionnaire, which was completed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The primary outcome was upper limb function success (defined using ARAT)<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> at 3 months after randomisation—ie, at the end of the intervention period. The definition of success differed depending on baseline severity: baseline ARAT score 0–7 required an improvement of 3 points or more; baseline ARAT 8–13 required an improvement of 4 points or more; baseline ARAT 14–19 required an improvement of 5 points or more; baseline ARAT 20–39 required an improvement of 6 points or more. A stepped approach was used, because although the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the ARAT is 10% of its range (6 points), a smaller treatment effect might still be clinically beneficial for those with severely reduced initial upper limb function, who are likely to improve less than those with more moderate reductions in function.</p>
                <p id="para210">Secondary outcomes were upper limb function (ARAT)<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> success at 6 months; ARAT score; upper limb impairment (FMA);<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> ADL (Barthel ADL Index);<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> quality of life (SIS, version 3.0);<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and upper limb pain (numerical rating scale).

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para220">The target sample size was 762 participants (254 participants per group). Responses from 216 participants in each group were required to provide 80% power (significance level of 1·7% because of multiple comparisons) to detect a 15% difference in successful outcome between each of the three pairs of treatments (robot-assisted training, EULT, and usual care). The baseline estimate of success was estimated as 30% from the BoTULS trial<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and a difference between 30% and 45% corresponds to an odds ratio (OR) of 1·9. The sample size requirement was increased from 720 after protocol publication to allow for 15% rather than 10% attrition. Reasons for loss from the trial were recorded.</p>
                <p id="para230">The primary outcome of upper limb function success at 3 months is reported descriptively by group and overall as a proportion. Logistic regression was used to compare success between the three groups at 3 months, adjusting for time since stroke, baseline ARAT score, and centre. We considered the possibility of partial nesting due to participants sharing therapists in the robot-assisted training and EULT groups but not in the usual care group. This did not change the model estimates or improve model fit and so the simpler models without partial nesting were used. The secondary outcomes of success at 6 months and binary coding of ARAT subscales (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) were analysed as for the primary outcome. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population of all participants, in the group to which they were assigned, who did not have missing data after simple imputation. Preplanned sensitivity analyses were done for ARAT success at 3 months and 6 months. The first sensitivity analysis excluded participants who attended their outcome assessment outside of the 3 month ± 14 days, and 6 month ± 28 days windows. The second sensitivity analysis excluded participants with an ARAT score of zero at baseline. In a per-protocol analysis, we compared ARAT success at 3 months and 6 months for robot-assisted training versus EULT for participants who had attended at least 20 therapy sessions.</p>
                <p id="para240">All numerical secondary outcomes were reported at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months descriptively by group as mean (SD). These secondary outcomes were analysed separately at 3 months and 6 months using linear regression adjusting for time since stroke, baseline score, and centre. The baseline score used to adjust the analysis was the same scale for that outcome—eg, baseline ARAT was used in the model for ARAT at follow-up. Bias-corrected and accelerated CIs (100 000 bootstrap intervals) have been presented for all numerical secondary outcomes because of the distribution of the data. Three preplanned subgroup analyses explored the relationship between ARAT score at 3 months and centre, time since stroke (&lt;3 months, 3–12 months, and &gt;12 months), and baseline ARAT scores (0, 1–7, 8–13, 14–19, and 20–39).</p>
                <p id="para250">Simple imputation was used in the calculation of the scales.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Missing values contributing to a scale or subscale total were calculated using the median value of the respondent-specific completed responses on the rest of the scale or subscale to replace missing items, if no more than 20% of items were missing. The exception was the SIS, where we used the scale developers' rules (for a particular participant, if &lt;50% of items are missing in a dimension then the mean of the non-missing items is used in the formula for the final score; final score=25 × [mean of non-missing items–1]). For all analyses, the best fitting transformation of time since stroke was chosen on the basis of a significant reduction in model deviance. The coverage of the CIs was adjusted to account for the three paired comparisons between the groups. Because the study was powered on a significance level of 1·7%, we report 98·3% CIs. All CIs beyond the primary outcome were exploratory because no allowance was made for multiplicity of outcomes. Statistical analyses were done using Stata, version 14. Independent trial steering and data monitoring committees had oversight throughout the trial and convened annually.</p>
                <p id="para260">A cost-utility analysis was done to assess the incremental cost per QALY gained. The analysis took the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para390">We found no difference in upper limb function, defined as ARAT success, between stroke patients treated with robot-assisted training using the MIT-Manus robotic gym, a EULT programme, or usual care. All groups improved on this measure from baseline to 3 months, which was maintained at 6 months. Some differences in secondary outcomes suggest potential benefits for EULT and robot-assisted training that might have implications for clinical practice and future research. We found no safety concerns for either intervention. Neither robot-assisted training nor EULT, when delivered with a one-to-one patient-to-therapist ratio, would be considered cost-effective at the UK current level of willingness to pay per QALY (£20 000–30 000).</p>
              <p id="para400">Of the many preplanned comparisons of the secondary outcomes, some indicated differences that are likely to be clinically important, because the MCID is within the 98·3% CI. Robot-assisted training improved upper limb impairment as measured by the FMA motor subscale at 3 months compared with usual care and this difference was maintained at 6 months. However, this improvement did not translate into improvement in either upper limb function or ADL. Indeed, robot-assisted training participants did less well in ADL at 3 months than those who received EULT. EULT led to improvements in upper limb impairment, mobility, and ADL compared with usual care at 3 months. No clinically important differences were found between EULT and usual care or robot-assisted training and EULT at 6 months on any outcome measure.</p>
              <p id="para410">Although there was no significant difference between EULT and usual care in ARAT success, the absolute difference was 8% at 3 months and 10% at 6 months in favour of EULT. This difference might be considered important by some patients and clinicians, but the trial did not have the statistical power to detect a difference of this size.</p>
              <p id="para420">The RATULS trial has a number of strengths and weaknesses. The risk of bias was low. As the study progressed, we abandoned the screening log because this became a disincentive for clinical teams to refer potential participants. Randomisation was by an independent service with allocation concealment. The outcome measures are widely used in stroke rehabilitation trials and have been shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to change.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, the primary outcome, derived from the ARAT, was developed specifically for the RATULS trial and further validation is needed. All outcomes were analysed according to statistical and health economic analysis plans. There were low levels of missing data for all assessments. Overall attrition rates were acceptable but were higher in the usual care group (20%) than in the robot-assisted training and EULT groups (both 10%), and differential attrition is a potential source of bias. Most of the withdrawals before 3 months in usual care were due to disappointment with treatment allocation.</p>
              <p id="para430">There was robust development of robot-assisted training and EULT programmes, and efforts to promote fidelity. Robot-assisted training was compared to an upper limb therapy programme of the same frequency and duration based on best evidence and best practice. Experts in both robot-assisted training and EULT were involved in designing and delivering the training programmes. Both interventions have been described according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication, enabling them to be replicated in further research or clinical practice.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Robot-assisted training was provided as it would be in clinical practice, while EULT was provided as a centralised rather than a local service for logistical reasons. Intervention delivery was monitored throughout the trial with high levels of compliance.</p>
              <p id="para440">RATULS was a pragmatic trial and therefore usual care was chosen as a comparator. Obtaining accurate information about the usual care that patients receive is a challenge for this type of study and the assumption that usual care is uniformly provided is rarely true. Although UK guidelines suggest the amount of therapy that a stroke patient should receive, they refer to contact time with a therapist rather than specifying the focus or intensity.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Disappointment about group allocation might have resulted in some usual care participants seeking or being provided with additional therapy, or increasing the amount of self-practice exercises they did, thereby introducing a competitive therapy bias. We did consider offering either robot-assisted training or EULT to usual care participants after the 6-month outcome assessment, but this was not feasible.</p>
              <p id="para450">The 2018 Cochrane systematic review of electromechanical and robot-assisted arm training (45 trials, 1619 participants) reported significantly improved ADL scores (standardised mean difference [SMD] 0·31 [95% CI 0·09–0·50] and arm function (SMD 0·32 [95% CI 0·18–0·46]) at the end of the intervention period.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although this review described improvement in arm function, the FMA motor subscale, a measure of upper limb impairment, was reported as the most commonly used arm function outcome measure.</p>
              <p id="para460">The robot-assisted training programme was provided at the same frequency and duration as intended in the VA Robotics Trial,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> which also assessed the MIT-Manus robotic gym. The VA Robotics Trial also found that robot-assisted training improved upper limb impairment (FMA motor subscale) compared with usual care, but the impairment advantage did translate into significant upper limb functional improvements (Wolf Motor Function Test) and benefit in the SIS.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The intensive comparative therapy in the VA Robotics trial sought to replicate the form and intensity of upper limb movements provided by MIT-Manus, and there were no significant differences between this and the robot-assisted training group. A strength of the RATULS trial is that robot-assisted training was compared to an upper limb therapy programme, based on best evidence and best practice, of the same frequency and duration. The VA Robotics Trial reported that the average total cost of treatment over the intervention period was US$5152 for robot-assisted training and $7382 for intensive comparison therapy (p=0·001). In the VA Robotics Trial, the base-case analysis assumed that the MIT-Manus robotic gym was used by two patients simultaneously. At 36 weeks, the total health-care costs were similar for all three groups.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The REM-AVC trial<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> assigned participants to receive robot-assisted training with an Armeo Spring device or self-rehabilitation of the same frequency and duration, and found no difference between groups for the FMA.</p>
              <p id="para470">It is important to consider why the improvements in impairment seen with robot-assisted training in the RATULS trial did not translate into improved function. The RATULS trial provided integrated training with all three modules of the MIT-Manus robotic gym (shoulder–elbow module; wrist module; and hand module), which adapts to participants' abilities (providing more or less assistance as required). The robot-assisted training programme did not include grip or pinch activities. Participants trained specific movements of their affected arm in a spatially controlled manner, but it is possible that these were not considered meaningful by participants and there might have been insufficient guidance for participants about making the best use of any reduction in impairment in day-to-day activities. Many daily activities involve both upper limbs in bilateral (eg, opening a drawer) or bimanual (eg, making a sandwich) coordinated action. This could explain why robot-assisted training resulted in less favourable outcomes in self-reported ADL compared with EULT, in which training specifically focused on daily activities and functional tasks. The improvement in mobility seen after EULT would also support this theory, because EULT included tasks involving the upper limbs in balance and sit-to-stand activities, which were not components of robot-assisted training.</p>
              <p id="para480">The EULT programme was based on goal-orientated repetitive functional task practice, which resulted in some potentially clinically important benefits over usual care and improvements in upper limb impairments that were translated into improvement in ADL. This supports the conclusions of the 2016 Cochrane review (33 trials, 1853 participants), which found that repetitive functional task practice improved arm function (SMD 0·25 [95% CI 0·01–0·49]), ADL (SMD 0·28, [0·10–0·45]), and hand function (SMD 0·25 [0·00–0·51]).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The review did not include the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP) trial,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> which found significant improvements in upper limb function, grip strength, and upper limb use in daily activities. Participants in the RATULS trial had more severe upper limb impairment than those in the GRASP trial. Delivering EULT as group or classroom therapy would lead to a reduction in costs. However, the impact of this change on QALYs is unknown and should be explored.</p>
              <p id="para490">It is likely that the pragmatic inclusion criteria led to the recruitment of some participants who had little prospect of recovery. Approaches that stratify patients into groups with differing probabilities of upper limb recovery, such as advanced neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have been developed and should be considered in future trials to improve the targeting of therapies towards participants with the most potential to respond.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Ongoing biomarker research might help in patient selection or treatment monitoring of future stroke rehabilitation trials.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Further research is needed to see how improvements in upper limb impairment, seen with robot-assisted training, can translate into functional gain.</p>
              <p id="para500">We recruited patients with acute, subacute, and chronic stroke in our trial because there was no evidence to exclude patients at any stage of recovery. The Cochrane systematic review on repetitive task training also found no influence of time since stroke on functional outcomes.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Subgroup analyses of the RATULS trial showed no clear effect of time since stroke on the effectiveness of the interventions.</p>
              <p id="para510">There is converging evidence that more therapy might result in better outcomes,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> but in future, adequately powered dose-finding studies of promising interventions, tailored to targeted subgroups, are needed, which also take into account potential cost-effectiveness. Future trials might wish to consider having a co-primary outcome measure of a patient-reported outcome measure—eg, SIS—as well as one of the standard measures of impairment and functional limitation.</p>
              <p id="para520">In summary, the RATULS trial did not find evidence that a robot-assisted training programme using the MIT-Manus robotic gym improved upper limb function (measured by ARAT success) after a stroke when compared with an EULT programme of the same frequency and duration, or usual care. Robot-assisted training led to improvement in upper limb impairment (FMA motor subscale) compared with usual care but not improvements in upper limb function or ADL. EULT led to improvements in upper limb impairment (FMA motor subscale), mobility (SIS), and ADL (SIS) compared with usual care at the end of the intervention period (at 3 months). Neither robot-assisted training nor EULT was cost-effective.</p>
