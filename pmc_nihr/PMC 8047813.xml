                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Valproate is a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalised or difficult to classify epilepsy, but not for women of child-bearing potential because of teratogenicity. Levetiracetam is increasingly prescribed for these patient populations despite scarcity of evidence of clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam compared with valproate in participants with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassifiable epilepsy.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial to compare levetiracetam with valproate as first-line treatment for patients with generalised or unclassified epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services (69 centres overall) across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked generalised or unclassifiable seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either levetiracetam or valproate, using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factors. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment allocation. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for levetiracetam and valproate, and for children aged 5â€“12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. All drugs were administered orally. SANAD II was designed to assess the non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1Â·314, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on valproate. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Per-protocol (PP) analyses excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analyses included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>520 participants were recruited between April 30, 2013, and Aug 2, 2016, and followed up for a further 2 years. 260 participants were randomly allocated to receive levetiracetam and 260 participants to receive valproate. The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 255 participants randomly allocated to valproate and 254 randomly allocated to levetiracetam. Median age of participants was 13Â·9 years (range 5Â·0â€“94Â·4), 65% were male and 35% were female, 397 participants had generalised epilepsy, and 123 unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission (HR 1Â·19 [95% CI 0Â·96â€“1Â·47]); non-inferiority margin 1Â·314. The PP analysis showed that the 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam. There were two deaths, one in each group, that were unrelated to trial treatments. Adverse reactions were reported by 96 (37%) participants randomly assigned to valproate and 107 (42%) participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam. Levetiracetam was dominated by valproate in the cost-utility analysis, with a negative incremental net health benefit of âˆ’0Â·040 (95% central range âˆ’0Â·175 to 0Â·037) and a probability of 0Â·17 of being cost-effectiveness at a threshold of Â£20â€ˆ000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and quality-adjusted life-years.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Compared with valproate, levetiracetam was found to be neither clinically effective nor cost-effective. For girls and women of child-bearing potential, these results inform discussions about benefit and harm of avoiding valproate.</p>

                  <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para30">At the time of the design of this trial (SANAD II), valproate was recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed generalised epilepsy, which includes syndromes such as absence epilepsies, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and generalised epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures on waking, and for unclassified epilepsy. The evidence base from randomised controlled trials to support this recommendation was scarce, partly because valproate became accepted as a first-line treatment in an era before rigorous trials were undertaken. The first SANAD trial (published in 2007) identified valproate as a clinically effective and cost-effective first-line treatment compared with lamotrigine and topiramate. Prognostic modelling of data from SANAD also found similar treatment responses in the differing epilepsy types. A 14-week double-blind randomised trial in patients with absence epilepsies found valproate and ethosuximide superior to lamotrigine for treatment failure. A Cochrane review identified possible confounding in previous studies due to misclassification of focal epilepsy as generalised epilepsy. That review included an individual participant network meta-analysis, which found no evidence of superiority of valproate over other treatments for seizure control, but valproate was superior to carbamazepine, topiramate, and phenobarbital for treatment failure.</p>
                <p id="para40">Valproate had also been identified as teratogenic and is associated with around a 10% major malformations rate and with around a third of children exposed to valproate in utero having a significant reduction in IQ. During the conduct of SANAD II, the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines for Healthcare Regulatory Authority implemented a pregnancy prevention programme. Treatment decisions are now particularly difficult for women and girls with generalised epilepsy, which typically starts during childhood and adolescence. The main alternatives to valproate are lamotrigine, which is less effective than valproate, and levetiracetam, which previously had unknown effectiveness compared with valproate as no head-to-head randomised trials had been undertaken.</p>
                <p id="para50">
                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para60">To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomised controlled trial to compare the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam versus valproate for patients with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassified epilepsy. The study is pragmatic in design and recruited a cohort of participants aged over 5 years from routine UK National Health Service clinics, and the results are relevant to every day clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="para70">Levetiracetam did not meet our definition of non-inferiority for time to 12-month remission compared with valproate and it was inferior for times to treatment failure, 2-year remission from seizures, and first subsequent seizure. In addition, levetiracetam was not found to be a cost-effective alternative.</p>
                <p id="para80">
                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para90">For people with generalised epilepsies, the available evidence identifies valproate as more clinically effective and cost-effective than lamotrigine and levetiracetam. Ethosuximide and valproate have similar efficacy for absence epilepsies but ethosuximide is inefficacious for other seizure types (ie, generalised tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonic seizures). For men, valproate should remain a first-line treatment for generalised epilepsies. For women, there should now be further debate to inform practice and policy about avoiding the most effective treatment to minimise the potential risk of harm in future pregnancies.</p>

              <p id="para110">Around a third of people with epilepsy have idiopathic generalised epilepsy, also referred to as genetic generalised epilepsy, which includes several syndromes classified according to seizure types and age of onset, such as childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Although differing syndromes are recognised, prognostic modelling of data from the first Standard And New Antiepileptic Drug (SANAD I)<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> study indicates that relative treatment responses are consistent across syndromes. Also, at the time of diagnosis, some people cannot be classified as having either a focal or generalised epilepsy, although for many a syndromic diagnosis can be made, usually following further investigation or as more seizures are witnessed.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p id="para120">Valproate is currently recommended as a first-line treatment for generalised and for unclassifiable epilepsy as it has a broad spectrum of action,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> although there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support this recommendation.

                <p id="para160">SANAD-II was a phase 4, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial run in the UK National Health Service (NHS) adult neurology and paediatric services. 85 hospital centres were opened, of which 69 recruited participants to this trial. Participants were eligible for recruitment if they were aged 5 years or older, had a history of at least two unprovoked epileptic seizures requiring treatment, their clinical epilepsy diagnosis was a generalised epilepsy syndrome or was unclassifiable, and had never been treated with an anti-seizure medicine (except for emergency treatment in the 2 week period before enrolment). Exclusion criteria included having provoked or acute symptomatic seizures only, currently taking anti-seizure medicine treatment, and having known progressive neurological disease. Epileptic seizures and syndromes were classified according to International League Against Epilepsy classifications<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> on the basis of seizure semiology and electroencephalogram (EEG) results. Instances in which the precise idiopathic generalised epilepsy syndrome was uncertain (eg, for patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures and generalised spike and wave changes on their EEG), recruiting clinicians were able to classify such patients as having idiopathic generalised epilepsy not specified. SANAD II was granted ethics approval from the North West-Liverpool East Research Ethics Committee on June 7, 2012.

We used a secure, centrally controlled, 24h web-based facility to implement a minimisation program with a random element utilising factors, which were not made known to reduce the risk of predicting allocation. These factors were centre, sex (ie, male or female), and number of previous seizures (ie, 2, 3â€“5, 6+), which were not made known.

                <p id="para180">Trial treatments were prescribed as per routine NHS practice and dispensed by hospital and community pharmacies, and clinicians prescribed the formulation they considered most appropriate. The trial protocol provided guidance on initial drug titration and maintenance doses based on routine practice, although clinicians were able to tailor these as appropriate. All medications were taken orally. For participants aged 12 years or older, the initial advised maintenance doses were 500 mg twice per day for both levetiracetam and valproate. For children aged 5â€“12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were 25 mg/kg for valproate and 40 mg/kg for levetiracetam. Subsequent dose and treatment changes at follow-up visits were made on the basis of treatment response and in accordance with routine clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="para190">We aimed to complete recruitment over a 4Â·5 year period and to then follow up the trial cohort for a further 2 years, allowing a minimum follow-up of 2 years and maximum of 6Â·5 years. Patients were followed up according to clinical need, and minimum trial visits were expected at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. At visits, data were collected for seizures, anti-seizure medication, and adverse reactions. Participants continued in follow-up whether they were still taking their allocated treatment or not. When participants fell out of hospital follow-up, outcome data were sought from their general practitioner.</p>
                <p id="para200">For adults, QOL outcomes were assessed using subscales of the quality of life in newly diagnosed epilepsy battery (NEWQOL) and the Impact of Epilepsy Scale.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> For children and adolescents aged younger than 16 years, QOL assessment involved both patient and parent-based measures: children aged 8â€“15 years completed a generic health status measure validated for use in epilepsy, the KINDL;<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and the epilepsy impact and attitude to epilepsy subscales of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE-AD).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Parents of all children completed proxy QOL questionnaires.

                <p id="para220">The primary outcome was time to 12-month remission from seizures, calculated as days from randomisation to the first date at which a period of 12 months had elapsed without any seizures. The secondary seizure outcomes were time to 24-month remission and time to first subsequent seizure. There were three secondary outcomes for treatment failure: (1) time to treatment failure overall, defined as days from randomisation to a decision to withdraw the randomised drug or to add a new anti-seizure medication because of either inadequate seizure control or unacceptable adverse reactions; (2) time to treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control alone; and (3) time to treatment failure due to unacceptable adverse reactions alone. The other secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, QOL, and health economic outcomes based on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. At clinic visits, data were collected on adverse reactions reported by the patient and the investigators assessment stated whether the event was possibly, probably, or almost certainly related the anti-seizure medication. These adverse reactions were coded using the MedDRA dictionary.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para230">SANAD-II was designed to detect non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. The International League Against Epilepsy commission on antiepileptic drugs defined limits of equivalence of Â±10% for the primary outcome in antiepileptic drug monotherapy studies.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Calculations were informed by the SANAD I study,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> which estimated the 12-month remission free probability (at 24 months) as 0Â·31 (exponential hazard rate of 0Â·0488) for valproate. Assuming a 10% absolute difference in survival probability, the non-inferiority margin on the hazard ratio (HR) scale was ln(0Â·31)/ln(0Â·41)=1Â·314. Therefore, assuming a HR of 1, 80% power, and a one-sided alpha of 0Â·025, 260 patients were required in each of two treatment groups, allowing for 5% losses to follow-up, as occurred in SANAD-I (520 patients in total).</p>
                <p id="para240">Primary analyses were undertaken on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We used a 0Â·05 level of significance and 95% CIs throughout. The statistical and health economic analysis plans were developed before doing final analyses and are available in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1</xref> and <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2</xref>.

                <p id="para250">Time to event outcomes were summarised by Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment group and Cox proportional hazards regression models explored using two different models: (1) the primary analysis, including the treatment effect only; and (2) including the treatment together with gender (ie, male or female), number of seizures before randomisation (ie, 2, 3â€“5, 6+), and random effects for centre. Models were also fitted to include a stratification variable for epilepsy type (ie, generalised or unclassified epilepsy). The assumption of proportional hazards was investigated by examining Schoenfeld residual plots and incorporating time-dependent covariates in all models. If the assumption of proportional hazards was not valid, an additional extended Cox model with time-dependent covariates was used. Subgroup effects (for patients with absence epilepsies, other generalised epilepsies, or unclassified epilepsy) were explored in a post-hoc analysis by adding treatment-covariate interaction terms to the primary Cox model. All treatment effects were presented as a HR with a two-sided 95% CI of valproate compared with levetiracetam. For the primary outcome (ie, 12-month remission) non-inferiority hypothesis, the upper limit of the 95% CI needed to be less than 1Â·314 to conclude non-inferiority.</p>

              <p id="para350">The ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission did not find non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with valproate as the 95% CI for the HR (1Â·19 [95% CI 0Â·96â€“1Â·47] unadjusted, 1Â·23 [0Â·99â€“1Â·52] adjusted) includes the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 1Â·314. Consequently, the possibility of a clinically important difference could not be excluded. There is crossing of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>) and evidence of non-equality of hazard ratios across time (p=0Â·001), violating the assumption of proportional hazards.

The per-protocol analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with valproate than with levetiracetam; although this trial was powered for non-inferiority, it was also designed to show superiority.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para450">SANAD II found that levetiracetam is neither clinically effective nor cost-effective compared with valproate in patients with newly diagnosed generalised or unclassified epilepsy. This pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial was powered to assess non-inferiority of levetiracetam compared with standard treatment, valproate, in patients with newly diagnosed generalised and unclassified epilepsy. Levetiracetam did not meet our non-inferiority definition for time to 12-month remission from seizures. We found a 9% (95% CI 1â€“18) higher immediate 12-month remission rate with valproate (26% <italic>vs</italic> 36%), but the difference between treatment policies diminished over time as dose and treatment changes were made. Levetiracetam was inferior to valproate for time to treatment failure, time to 2 year remission, and time to first subsequent seizure. Treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control was more likely with levetiracetam than with valproate (HR 0Â·43 [0Â·30â€“0Â·63]). Inadequate seizure control leading to treatment change was the likely explanation for finding non-proportional hazards in the primary ITT 12-month remission analysis. The PP analysis, which took treatment failure into account, found valproate to be superior to levetiracetam (1Â·68 [1Â·30â€“2Â·15]). These results are particularly important when considering treatment choices for women of childbearing potential.</p>
              <p id="para460">To explore the treatment effects further, the cohort was split into three groups: participants with absence epilepsies, participants with other generalised epilepsies, and participants with unclassified epilepsy. For time to 12-month remission, our results indicated a meaningful advantage for starting valproate in the so-called other generalised epilepsy group, for which the difference in immediate remission rate was 19Â·1% (95% CI 6Â·6â€“31Â·7), whereas there was no clear advantage seen in the absence or unclassified epilepsy subgroups. Participants with other generalised epilepsies were mainly those with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, for whom seizure rates are low and many months of observation are typically required to record seizures and make incremental changes to dose and drug. Conversely, participants with absence seizures typically have a high seizure rate, enabling more rapid decisions about dose and drug changes to gain early seizure control.</p>
              <p id="para470">The number of female participants recruited (n=80) between the age of 12 and 50 years was lower than the number of men recruited (n=218) and the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency pregnancy prevention scheme was implemented following the commencement of the study and during most of its recruitment and follow-up period. There were ten pregnancies during the study, none of which were exposed to valproate, and only one of these women was randomly assigned to initiate valproate.</p>
              <p id="para480">Analysis of QOL outcomes did not indicate benefit for either drug, but the return rate of questionnaires was disappointingly low. The cost utility analysis found that levetiracetam was not cost-effective compared with valproate at thresholds of cost-effectiveness operating in the UK NHS. Levetiracetam was associated with fewer QALYs and higher costs than valproate. The finding of a negative incremental net health benefit for levetiracetam compared with valproate was consistent for both adult and children subgroups and was stable in most sensitivity analyses, apart from two that were limited by the missing data in NEWQOL-6D utilities and costs.</p>
              <p id="para490">This study has several important limitations. Data for the occurrence of seizures were collected using seizure diaries and reports at clinic visits and it is possible that seizures were missed or not reported. SANAD II was open-label, which might have influenced decisions about dose and treatment changes, thereby biasing results for time to treatment failure, seizure outcomes, and the reporting of adverse reactions. Although 397 (76%) participants were classified as having a generalised epilepsy, only 271 (52%) had generalised spike and wave changes on their EEG, indicating that some of the remaining 24% of participants might have been misclassified. It is not possible to state whether this factor might have increased or diminished the treatment effects observed, but it is interesting to note that in the subgroup analysis for 12-month remission the estimate in participants who were unclassified favoured levetiracetam. In addition, other than for participants with absence epilepsies, the number of participants classified with a specific generalised epilepsy syndrome at the time of random assignment was small, precluding subgroup analyses for syndromes, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.</p>
              <p id="para500">Additionally, more men than women were recruited (64Â·8% <italic>vs</italic> 35Â·2%), which could have introduced unintended bias into the study. Although there is no reason to expect important differences in clinical effectiveness by gender,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> differing approaches to dosing and treatment choices for men and some women could influence seizure remission rates, adverse events, and decisions about treatment failure. There was also a low return rate for questionnaires, which diminished our ability to identify QOL consequences and also affected the economic analysis. For costs, the use of free text questions might have introduced bias, as also the assumption that unanswered questions implied no use of resources. However, these issues were largely mitigated by more complete data for the costs of hospital care and anti-seizure medicines, which were more difficult to recall while also being the main cost drivers. For QALYs, this issue was mitigated by use of area under the curve methodology, in which QALYs could be calculated provided two or more EQ-5D questionnaires had been returned. Our use of the EQ-5D-3L-Y and proxy version of the EQ-5D-3L was limited by having to apply the adult tariff for estimating utilities from EQ-5D profiles. This requirement represents a weakness in many economic evaluations of interventions in paediatric populations,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> although a valuation of children's EQ-5D-3L-Y health states should soon be available.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para510">These results should be put into context with previous studies, although few studies have assessed the long term effectiveness of treatments for patients with generalised epilepsies. SANAD I<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> identified valproate as a first-line treatment as it was superior to lamotrigine for seizure control and superior to topiramate for treatment failure.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> An individual participant data network meta-analysis,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> which included data from SANAD I, failed to show superiority for 12-month remission in participants with generalised epilepsy of any drug among valproate, levetiracetam, gabapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, or phenobarbital, but the results were heavily confounded by classification errors and the possible inclusion of participants with focal epilepsy. Valproate was superior to carbamazepine, topiramate, and phenobarbital for treatment failure. A clinical trial<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> in participants with absence epilepsies found valproate and ethosuximide superior to lamotrigine for treatment failure. To the best of our knowledge, SANAD II is the only trial that provides much needed head-to-head data for the long term effectiveness of valproate versus levetiracetam.</p>
              <p id="para520">These results have important implications for clinical practice and research. For men with generalised onset seizures, valproate should continue as a first-line treatment. For women of childbearing potential, levetiracetam was inferior to valproate, as is lamotrigine,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> the other commonly prescribed alternative. Regulators, guideline developers, clinicians, and patient groups should now consider the benefit-to-risk ratio of each treatment. Some women might prefer a drug with greater efficacy notwithstanding the risk of teratogenicity, while others might prefer one that is safer in pregnancy despite lower efficacy, as indicated in a previous discrete choice experiment,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> which found that women would accept a 5% reduction in 12-month remission probability for a 1% reduction in fetal abnormality. For people with unclassified epilepsy, the subgroup analysis found no significant difference between treatments, but estimates favour levetiracetam. Future studies should not group generalised and unclassified epilepsy together and the international epilepsy community should identify a better strategy for assessing treatment policies in this common scenario.</p>
