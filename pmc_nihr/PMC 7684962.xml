                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure and multi-organ dysfunction in the mother. It is a leading contributor to maternal and perinatal mortality, with 99% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Whilst clear guidelines exist for management of early-onset (&lt; 34 weeks) and term (≥ 37 weeks) disease, the optimal timing of delivery in pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks is less clear. In a high-income setting, delivery may improve maternal outcomes without detriment to the baby, but this intervention is yet to be evaluated in LMIC.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The CRADLE-4 Trial is a non-masked, randomised controlled trial comparing planned early delivery (initiation of delivery within 48 h of randomisation) with routine care (expectant management) in women with pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation in India and Zambia. The primary objective is to establish whether a policy of planned early delivery can reduce adverse maternal outcomes, without increasing severe neonatal morbidity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The World Health Organization recommends delivery for all women with pre-eclampsia from 37 weeks onwards, based on evidence showing clear maternal benefit without increased neonatal risk. Before 34 weeks, watchful waiting is preferred, with delivery recommended only when there is severe maternal or fetal compromise, due to the neonatal risks associated with early preterm delivery. Currently, there is a lack of guidance for clinicians managing women with pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks. Early delivery benefits the mother but may increase the need for neonatal unit admission in the infant (albeit without serious morbidity at this gestation). On the other hand, waiting to deliver may increase the risk of stillbirth, fetal growth restriction and hypoxic brain injury in the neonate as a result of severe maternal complications. This is especially true for LMIC where there is a higher prevalence of adverse events. The balance of risks and benefits therefore needs to be carefully assessed before making firm recommendations. This is the first trial evaluating the optimal timing of delivery in pre-eclampsia in LMIC, where resources and disease burden are considerably different.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder which complicates 2–8% of pregnancies worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and up to 12% of pregnancies in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pre-eclampsia is responsible for 76,000 maternal deaths and 500,000 perinatal deaths each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] with the overwhelming majority (99%) of these occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system disorder. It arises due to inadequate perfusion of the uteroplacental unit, leading to hypoxic placental tissue and endothelial dysfunction. The resulting systemic vascular inflammation leads to widespread organ involvement in the mother as well as growth restriction and even stillbirth in the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Its clinical course is difficult to predict, and the development of symptoms is usually an indicator of end-stage organ damage. The only definitive management of pre-eclampsia is delivery of the dysfunctional placental unit—thereby ending the pregnancy. Given the progressive and unpredictable nature of the condition, timely intervention and delivery is key.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Delivery at 37 weeks onwards is recommended by the World Health Organization for all women with pre-eclampsia irrespective of disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Prior to 34 weeks (which is an important milestone for fetal lung maturity), expectant management is preferable due to the neonatal risks associated with early preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, delivery before 34 weeks’ gestation is usually only initiated if there are signs of severe maternal or fetal compromise.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Guidance on the optimal timing of delivery in late preterm pre-eclampsia (between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) is less clear and is likely to be context dependent. In different settings, the risks and benefits of delivery may vary according to the prevalence and character of serious adverse events and the facilities available to manage them.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Currently, a policy of close surveillance is pursued until either 37 weeks’ gestation is reached (at which point delivery is recommended) or an indication for immediate delivery (evidence of severe maternal or fetal compromise) develops. It is likely that planned early delivery would benefit the mother as this is the cure to the disease process; however, this must be balanced against any potential risks associated with late preterm delivery to the neonate.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In high-income settings, previous randomised controlled trials have shown that planned early delivery between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation in pre-eclampsia reduces the risk of severe complications in the woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An increase in neonatal unit admissions amongst infants in the planned delivery group has been reported, though serious neonatal morbidity remains uncommon at this gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Planned early delivery has only been shown to increase respiratory distress syndrome in the neonate when the study population included women with gestational hypertension with a longer time to delivery interval in the usual care arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This and the fact that antenatal corticosteroid use was less prevalent in this study may explain the difference in neonatal respiratory morbidity between the two arms.</p>
              <p id="Par24">This question is yet to be evaluated in a low- and middle-income setting. Planned early delivery at this gestation may increase risk to the neonate given the lack of neonatal intensive care facilities. In addition, the availability of antenatal corticosteroids and indeed their impact on neonatal outcomes is yet to be fully evaluated in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, in settings where the disease burden and incidence of serious complications (in particular eclampsia, renal insufficiency, abruption and stillbirth) are related, in part, to inadequate surveillance and delayed intervention, planned early delivery may in fact confer even greater benefit for the woman and the infant to that seen in a high-income setting. Severe disease in this setting implies time to delivery intervals will be shorter, and the benefit of removing maternal harm relatively greater than the risk of immaturity. Given the disproportionate number of maternal and perinatal deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries, it is imperative that interventions designed to reduce mortality and morbidity are developed and tested within these settings, where their impact may be considerably different.</p>
              <p id="Par25">There is therefore a need to compare a policy of planned early delivery to expectant management for late preterm pre-eclampsia in low- and middle-income settings. This trial aims to establish whether planned early delivery in women with pre-eclampsia between 34<sup>+ 0</sup> and 36<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes in India and Zambia.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par37">The trial will be conducted in five tertiary hospitals across India and Zambia, including their referring district healthcare facilities (sites listed on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10672137">http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10672137</ext-link>). An initial 6-month feasibility study was conducted across the proposed trial sites. This was a mixed-methods study consisting of semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of healthcare providers, focus group discussions with pregnant women and their relatives and a retrospective case notes audit evaluating gestation-specific maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with pre-eclampsia. The results of this feasibility study directly informed the development of the interventional phase protocol.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Recruitment is anticipated to take 22 months based on an assumption that approximately 45 participants will be recruited per month (across all sites), with some allowance for unforeseen events and centres recruiting slower than expected. Daily visits by the research team to the relevant clinical areas at each healthcare facility will ensure that all potentially eligible participants are screened. In addition to this, key personnel at each of the referring healthcare facilities will be provided with a basic mobile phone and airtime in order to facilitate referrals of potentially eligible participants. The development of culturally appropriate trial materials for both participants and key members of their household will help to engage and inform potential participants. Dissemination of trial posters and flowcharts will ensure that clinical staff are well informed and aware of trial procedures. If necessary, additional strategies to boost trial recruitment (such as additional sites or small financial incentives for clinical staff will be considered).</p>

Long-term follow-up will be considered by obtaining permission to contact participants later, but only after further ethical approval and governance has been ascertained. Both the maternal and neonatal short-term outcomes will be collected quickly as the time period from randomisation to outcome collection will not exceed 14 weeks (participants will be followed up until primary discharge of mother and baby post-delivery) and in many cases will be less. Outcome collection will end 42 days after the final participant has been recruited (or sooner if primary discharge of mother and baby occurs before this endpoint).

                <p id="Par48">At all stages, it will be made clear to the woman that she is free to withdraw from the trial at any time without the need to provide any reason or explanation. Participants will be made aware that this decision will have no impact on any aspect of their continuing care. For a woman allocated to the expectant management group, if clinical needs dictate delivery prior to 37 weeks’ gestation based on local criteria, this will not constitute withdrawal from the trial allocation. For a woman allocated to the planned delivery group, if the woman should decide that she does not wish to proceed with the planned delivery and instead chooses to be monitored by her attending clinician, this will not constitute withdrawal from the study.</p>

Use of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity will be at the discretion of the clinician, in accordance with local guidelines (confirmed as readily available across all facilities).

                <p id="Par92">The sample size for the CRADLE 4 study is calculated on the ability to detect a clinically important reduction in the primary maternal outcome: a short-term composite based on the presence of one or more of 22 maternal morbidities. Based on data acquired at the sites prior to start of the main trial, we anticipate an event rate of 80% for the primary maternal outcome in the expectant management arm. We have calculated that a sample size of 558 would provide 90% power to detect a 15% relative risk reduction. If the trial is recruiting well, we will continue to recruit 872 participants which would give 90% power to detect a 12.5% relative risk reduction and greater precision to detect secondary outcomes. The data monitoring committee (DMC) will review the primary event rate and usual safety data and make a recommendation to continue or stop. A one-sided non-inferiority analysis is planned for the primary neonatal composite. Our data acquired at the sites prior to starting the main trial showed an event rate of 24% for the primary neonatal outcome. Complete data on 480 women (240 per group) are required for 90% power to exclude a difference against planned delivery of 10% or more. To exclude a difference of 7.5%, 852 women (426 per group) are needed. The calculation uses a one-sided significance test and confidence interval and assumes that the true event rate is 24%. This is in line with the planned sample size as detailed above.</p>

The allocation ratio of intervention (planned early delivery) to control (expectant management) will be 1:1. Participants will be stratified by centre and minimised by parity (0 or ≥ 1), single/multi-fetal pregnancy (singleton or multi-fetal) and gestational age (34<sup>+ 0</sup>–34<sup>+ 6</sup>, 35<sup>+ 0</sup>–35<sup>+ 6</sup>, 36<sup>+ 0</sup>–36<sup>+ 6</sup>) at randomisation. MedSciNet will write the randomisation programme and hold the allocation code.

Women in the expectant management arm will frequently be delivered prior to 37 weeks of gestation due to clinical need and this will not be considered a protocol deviation.</p>
                <p id="Par146">The primary analysis for all perinatal and infant outcomes will be both an intention to treat and a per-protocol analysis, since the hypothesis under examination for these outcomes is a non-inferiority hypothesis.

If the model does not converge, logistic regression with robust variance estimation will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models.

                <p id="Par148">For the analysis of perinatal outcomes, we will treat all infants (singletons or multiples) separately, adjusting standard errors for clustering by mother. Pre-specified subgroup analyses will be undertaken for gestation at randomisation (test for trend) and for single vs. multi-fetal pregnancy, country and region (with a region being tertiary centre and referring healthcare facilities). The consistency of the effect of planned delivery vs. expectant management across subgroups will be assessed using a likelihood ratio test for interaction. Loss to follow-up is expected to be about 5% for the short-term outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par157">When possible, all anonymised data will be directly entered onto a secure, online database (MedSciNet). If the low-resource nature of the environments where we will be collecting the data means this is not possible, the local research team will be trained to accurately transfer any paper-based data onto MedSciNet, whilst maintaining confidentiality always.</p>
                <p id="Par158">Consent forms and source data where paper based will be kept in files in secure areas at each central site. Only healthcare providers involved in trial participants’ care, research assistants, the local trial coordinator and the UK-based trial manager will have access to these. All paper documents will be stored securely and kept in confidence in compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
                <p id="Par159">All data entered on the MedSciNet database in each facility will be automatically stored and backed up. Collection and storage of clinical data in the database will be governed by the UK Data Protection Act 1998. All participants will be given a unique trial identifier and no personal information will be entered into the clinical trial database or sample database. Personal contact information will be held on a local database kept in a locked environment, after gaining written informed consent from trial participants.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par162">Management of late preterm pre-eclampsia remains a challenging clinical scenario for clinicians around the world. Current evidence does not address those populations and contexts where the primary disease burden of pre-eclampsia lies. Whilst early-onset pre-eclampsia (before 34 weeks’ gestation) is typically regarded as a more ‘severe’ phenotype of the condition, pre-eclampsia at 34 weeks’ gestation onwards is responsible for significant maternal and perinatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This is particularly true in low-resource settings where delays in seeking appropriate care and suboptimal quality of care contribute to high rates of maternal and perinatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Planned early delivery beyond 34 weeks has the potential to reduce serious maternal complications (such as stroke, eclampsia and death) as well as poor perinatal outcomes (such as severe growth restriction and stillbirth). Designing a trial protocol to evaluate this research question in a robust manner, whilst taking into consideration the reality of the trial environment, is challenging and highlights many of the wider barriers to maternal health in low- and middle-income countries. The feasibility phase identified several key issues which informed the design of the main trial protocol, for example, a lack of availability of first trimester ultrasound scanning impacting upon gestational age assessment and lack of laboratory reagents for performing routine kidney and liver function tests. Diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia and outcome definitions required adapting to suit the local context, taking into account limited diagnostic resources (e.g. radiology services) and facilities (e.g. neonatal intensive care). Our intervention, if shown to be beneficial, must be reproducible and feasible to implement within a real-world scenario. The inclusion of two diverse countries (India and Zambia) will produce results that are generalisable to similar settings. Furthermore, ensuring that the trial protocol and procedures reflect the reality of maternity care in a low- and middle-income setting is essential in order to produce findings that will be of importance to local, national and international policy makers.</p>

              <p>King’s College London will coordinate dissemination of the results from this trial. All publications using data from this trial to undertake original analyses will be submitted to the Trial Steering Committee for review before release. The research will be published in high-impact, peer-reviewed, scientific journals. More general dissemination of the results will be achieved through publication of summary findings. There are no commercial or intellectual rights issues that would delay publication of results. A writing committee drawn from the co-investigators, trial coordinators and others substantially involved in execution, analysis and interpretation will be named authors on the principal publications arising from the trial provided they meet the authorship criteria used by most high-impact peer-reviewed journals (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org">http://www.icmje.org</ext-link>). No external professional writers will be used. Local principal investigators will be named formally as collaborators on the publication; other trial personnel with significant input to the running of the trial will be named in the Acknowledgements in publications. The Chief Investigator will nominate and agree appropriate authorship on all publications prior to commencement of writing. Participants will be sent a summary of trial publications if they wish, with a reference to the final paper. A copy of the journal article will be made available to them on request from the chief investigator. Given that the majority of participants in this trial will not speak English as a first language and may have limited literacy and computer literacy skills, extensive efforts will be made to disseminate key findings in local languages via community meetings at times convenient to trial participants and their families. To target the clinical community, the results of this research will be disseminated at conventional academic platforms, including presentations at prominent national and international conferences. Requests for the final dataset can be made through the chief investigator in accordance with the data-sharing policies of King’s College London, with input from the co-investigator group where applicable.</p>
