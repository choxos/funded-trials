                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disorder for which there is no known cure. Non-surgical management for people with mild-to-moderate hip OA focuses mainly on alleviating pain and maximising function via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended combination of education and advice, exercise, and, where appropriate, weight loss. The CHAIN (Cycling against Hip pAIN) intervention is a group cycling and education intervention conceived as a way of implementing the NICE guidance.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2"><bold>C</bold>yc<bold>L</bold>ing and <bold>E</bold>duc<bold>AT</bold>ion (CLEAT) is a pragmatic, two parallel arm, randomised controlled trial comparing CHAIN with standard physiotherapy care for the treatment of mild-to-moderate hip OA. We will recruit 256 participants referred to the local NHS physiotherapy department over a 24-month recruitment period. Participants diagnosed with hip OA according to NICE guidance and meeting the criteria for GP exercise referral will be eligible to participate. Primary outcome is the difference in Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) function, daily living subscale between those receiving CHAIN and standard physiotherapy care. Secondary outcomes include performance-based functional measures (40 m walking, 30s chair stand and stair climb tests), ability for patient to self-care (patient activation measure) and self-reported health-related resource use including primary and secondary care contacts. The primary economic endpoint is the number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at 24 weeks follow-up. The study is funded by the National Institute for Health Research, Research for Patient Benefit PB-PG-0816-20033.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The literature identifies a lack of high-quality trials which inform on the content and design of education and exercise in the treatment of patients with hip OA and explore cost-effectiveness. CLEAT is a pragmatic trial which seeks to build further evidence of the clinical benefits of the CHAIN intervention compared to standard physiotherapy care within a randomised, controlled trial setting, and examine its cost-effectiveness.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a long-term health condition for which there is no cure. Mechanical and systemic factors may result in joint pain leading to a reduction in quality of life and activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Data collected between 2003 and 2010 revealed that around 8.75 million people aged 45 years and over sought treatment for OA in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A 2017 assessment of the prevalence of joint-specific OA revealed that the hip is the second most common joint to be affected after the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The Musculoskeletal Calculator estimates that in England 10.9% of people aged 45 years and over have hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the risk of developing OA increases with age, a study of trends in incidence of OA between 2012 and 2018 showed a significant increase in the incidence of younger patients with hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Given its prevalence, OA represents a significant economic burden, due to the impact on people’s ability to work and their need for social care and welfare benefits as well as on-going healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], non-surgical management for people with mild-to-moderate hip OA involves education and advice, exercise (aerobic and local muscle strengthening), and, where appropriate, weight loss. The NICE guidelines do not, however, advise on specific types of exercise, exercise dose, or exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">A systematic and network meta-analysis review concluded that low impact single exercise interventions, such as aerobic exercise (e.g., swimming, cycling), were the most effective therapies for improving pain and function in hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, Goh et al. found that therapies consisting of mixed exercises were the least effective in improving pain and function. However, several systematic reviews have highlighted the need for further research into more intense, single-exercise interventions specifically for hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">A review of potential mechanisms underpinning the benefits of exercise therapy on pain and function in OA found that an increase in upper leg strength, a decrease of extension impairments, and an improvement in proprioception, were all possible mediators of the link between exercise and a decrease in OA symptoms in the lower limb; another review highlighted the need to address muscle weakness in people with hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Cycling has been found to improve balance and proprioception, induce muscle hypertrophy, directly improve muscle weakness and therefore upper leg strength, and (because it is non-weight-bearing) causes less stress on the joints than running or other impact sport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, longitudinal epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have shown that cycling can increase cardiorespiratory fitness and functional ability, and lead to significant risk reduction for all-cause and cancer mortality, cardiovascular disease, colon and breast cancer, and obesity morbidity in the middle-aged and elderly.</p>
              <p id="Par10">As a way of implementing the NICE guidelines for hip OA, a cycling and education intervention, the CHAIN (Cycling against Hip pAIN) programme, was developed in 2013 through discussions with local orthopaedic teams and physiotherapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and was updated following feedback from past CHAIN participants. The CHAIN intervention aims to equip participants with the confidence to self-manage their condition, to encourage joint mobility and reduce pain through an 8-week programme of education and static cycling sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The intervention has been designed to influence behaviour change and includes components to motivate, increase adherence, and reduce drop-out of participants.</p>

                <title>Aim and objectives</title>
                <p id="Par11">The primary clinical objective is to determine whether there is a difference in the change in self-reported function from baseline to post-treatment assessment between those receiving the 8 weeks cycling and education intervention compared to those who received routine physiotherapy care. Self-reported function is assessed using the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) function, daily living subscale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The primary economic endpoint is the cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) at 3 months post treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par12">The secondary objectives are to estimate cost-effectiveness of the CHAIN intervention by comparing health-resource use of the participants on the two arms of the study through completion of a questionnaire; and to compare changes between the groups in:</p>

Eligible participants will be contacted by telephone (or by letter if unable to contact by telephone) by a senior physiotherapist to introduce the study. If interested in receiving more information, an invitation letter and participant information sheet (see supplementary files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), will be sent by post. Eligible participants will receive a further telephone call a few days later to discuss the trial and answer any questions. If the participant is interested, they will be added to a waiting list. Once up to 30 participants are on the waiting list they will be invited for final screening and baseline assessment. Physiotherapy referral rates indicate that it will take less than 10 weeks to recruit 30 participants, which is less than the current waiting time for routine appointments at the trial site (currently 52 weeks).</p>

It will be explained that participation is voluntary, and they can withdraw at any time. During the telephone appointment, once verbal consent has been received, baseline data collection can commence.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Baseline assessments (Visit 2) will take place on the same day as randomisation. The participant will be asked to sign the informed consent form by the trial manager, or a delegated member of the research team, and the remaining baseline data will be collected by the trial assessors (see the Outcome measures section) and will include a review of participants’ medical history; physical measurements such as height, weight, body composition (measured with an electronic segmental body composition monitor (Tanita MC-780MA Multi Frequency Body Composition Analyser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fitech.uk/medical-class-scale-systems/47-tanita-mc-780ma-s-multi-frequency-body-comp-analyser-portable.html">https://fitech.uk/medical-class-scale-systems/47-tanita-mc-780ma-s-multi-frequency-body-comp-analyser-portable.html</ext-link>), blood pressure, resting heart rate and range of motion of both hips. Performance assessments as recommended by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) for core performance tests will be collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] :30 s chair stand test, stair climb test and 40 m walk test. Patient reported outcome measures will be collected through validated questionnaires: the HOOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; the EQ-5D-5 L and EQ-5D VAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; the Patient-Specific Functional Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the Patient Activation Measure [24}.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Assessments will be undertaken by qualified independent physiotherapists who have been trained by the trial investigators. A summary of the data to be collected at Baseline can be found in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par31">As part of baseline assessments, participants will also be asked to do an exercise tolerance test which involves riding a static cycle for up to 18 min, with heart rate, blood pressure and exertion rates tested at intervals. Any participant outside the expected parameters for these tests and judged by the physiotherapist assessors to be unfit for the cycling intervention, or anyone not wishing to take part in the cycling and education intervention, will not continue the study. Participants are enrolled on the study after baseline assessments have been completed and they have been randomised to receive either the CHAIN intervention or standard physiotherapy treatment. It is possible for Visit 1 and Visit 2 to be carried out on the same day as part of the baseline assessment. Treatment will commence within the following two weeks for both arms.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par34">Participants will be randomised using permuted blocks of size 2, 4 or 6 with parallel group randomisation in a 1:1 ratio to either CHAIN or standard physiotherapy treatment. Ideally the CHAIN intervention is run with 15 participants, so recruitment will be based on blocks of 30 eligible participants. However, the programme can proceed with fewer participants if necessary to prevent undue delays in treatment. With the use of block randomisation, we hope to achieve equal numbers of participants in each arm of the trial while maintaining treatment allocation concealment from the trial assessors.</p>
                <p id="Par35">A list of randomised allocations will be created for the whole study prior to the first person being recruited.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Once consent has been received and screening/baseline assessments completed, the trial manager (or delegated person) will randomise the participant, using the randomisation system incorporated within the trial database, to receive the next treatment allocation from the randomised list.

                          <td align="left">The rationale for the CHAIN intervention is based on the need to develop an effective model of care locally to deliver the nonsurgical interventions recommended by NICE (2014). It was conceived by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a physiotherapist in response to discussions locally with primary care providers suggesting that ‘standard care’ for patients reporting hip stiffness to their GP can be varied and inconsistent, ranging from general advice, advice on analgesia and/or physiotherapy and self -management. It was further developed through discussion with local orthopaedic teams and physiotherapists and in partnership with the local general hospital, the county commissioning group, general practitioner localities, the county sports partnership, the borough council and the university. The aim of the programme is to reduce pain and encourage mobility through a programme of education and static cycling sessions to equip participants with the confidence to self-manage their condition.</td>

                          <td align="left">CHAIN videos which will be shown to participants by the facilitator during the CHAIN sessions and can be accessed by the participants in their own time after the sessions. The cycling sessions were developed by senior physiotherapist and fitness instructors from the leisure centre to ensure that the sessions are the same in each cohort.

                            <p><bold><underline>Education</underline></bold>: For the first thirty minutes, participants will take part in an education class, facilitated by a qualified physiotherapist. The education sessions will be standardised through video recordings developed by the study team and based upon NICE guidelines, aiming to promote the effective on-going self-management of hip pain. The education classes also aim to motivate participants to exercise, reassure them that it is safe to do so, and facilitate positive lifestyle/activity change. At the end of the class, the physiotherapist will encourage group discussion so that participants can share their questions and experiences.</p>
                            <p><bold><underline>Cycling</underline></bold>: The education session will be followed by a 30 min indoor static cycling class (35 and 40 min for the last two sessions respectively), facilitated by a gym instructor trained in leading indoor cycling classes. On the first week, participants will be shown how to set up their bike. The intensity of the exercise class will increase on a weekly basis and will be clearly defined to ensure each cohort will be given the same programme. Each session will finish with a cool-down period which will include relevant stretches. Participants will be encouraged to work at a level that they are comfortable with and will be encouraged to increase their intensity progressively over the eight sessions.</p>
                            <p><bold><underline>Between sessions</underline></bold>: After completion of the class, the participants will receive a video of the education class and of the static cycling session, via text or email, to encourage exercise and compliance to behaviour change advice at home. A home exercise programme comprising of various ankle, knee and hip stretches will also be provided and participants will be encouraged to stretch regularly. Cycling between sessions will be encouraged but will not be mandatory. To encourage participants to increase their exercise activities, an activity diary will be provided so that progress at home can be recorded and monitored for the duration of the intervention, including planned pauses in the delivery of the intervention. Plans for lifestyle changes and on-going participation in community-based activities will also be discussed.</p>

It is not necessary for the intervention to be delivered in consecutive weeks and a short pause in delivery of the programme will be possible in the case of local facilities having to close, i.e., due to public holidays or other situations out of the study team’s control. However, if a participant misses a planned course, there will not be an opportunity to provide a catch-up session and the participant will be marked as absent from the session. Dosage received for each participant will be calculated based on sessions attended and length of those cycling sessions along with the recommended cycling intensity.</td>

                <title>Control arm: standard physiotherapy care</title>
                <p id="Par41">The Trust Physiotherapy Department will allocate treatment slots (within two weeks of randomisation) for participants in the control arm. Once randomised to this arm, at their baseline visit participants are given the next available date and time for their first treatment session. Thereafter the physiotherapy appointments are made between the participant and the Physiotherapy Department directly as per standard care. Over 8 weeks, participants in the control group will attend up to four one-to-one sessions of physiotherapy (as per NHS standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) for up to two hours. These visits may be face-to-face at the Trust Physiotherapy Department or by telephone depending on the physiotherapist’s standard care practice at the time of treatment. Treatment will be pragmatic and multimodal and may include exercise, education, manual therapy, and other physiotherapy techniques. Participants will also be encouraged to complete a series of home exercises as prescribed by their physiotherapist. The exact treatment received, and the duration and number of sessions delivered will be recorded by the physiotherapist providing the treatment in patient notes and the study proforma (Supplementary File <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This will enable the dosage of the intervention (type, intensity, and time) for participants in the control arm to be compared to that received by participants in the CHAIN arm. This arm will also complete activity diaries to record activities undertaken outside the physiotherapy sessions and physiotherapists will remind participants of their completion. It will be collected at the post-treatment Visit 4. In instances where it is not possible for the physiotherapy department to conduct all the required appointments within the 8 weeks treatment period (e.g. due to illness or capacity issues) an extension to complete appointments will be possible. However, participants will continue to be assessed within two weeks of the allocated 8-weeks study treatment period, and again 3 months later as per the protocol. Any treatment in the control arm outside of the 8 weeks period will be recorded as such.</p>

                <title>Follow-up (visit 4, visit 5)</title>
                <p id="Par42">There will be two follow up assessments, the first within 2 weeks of the end of the CHAIN intervention (or end of 8 weeks treatment period for the control arm) (Visit 4) and the second (Visit 5) occurring approximately 3 months after the post-treatment visit. Visit 4 will be undertaken by trained, qualified physiotherapists and will consist of the same physical and functional assessments performed at Visit 2, completion of patient questionnaires as well as a review of participants’ activity diaries and a feedback questionnaire for those participants that were randomised to the CHAIN intervention; Visit 5 consists of 5 patient questionnaires (Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS); Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS); Patient Activation Measure (PAM); EQ-5D-5 L; and resource use) sent to participants by email or post. Participants will be contacted by text/telephone/email to help ensure completion and return of questionnaires. Where this is difficult to achieve, we will prioritise collection of the primary outcome at Visit 4. The data to be collected at each of these follow-up appointments are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>

                <title>Adverse events</title>
                <p id="Par60">Hip OA is a non-life-threatening condition typified by on-going progression of symptoms and deterioration of function. From the time the participant signs the consent form until the day the participant has completed their post-treatment assessment (Visit 4), the only adverse events recorded will be those for which participants seek advice from a health care professional, such as an unplanned visit to a General Practitioner for an acute condition. Participants will be asked at the start of each CHAIN session or physiotherapy session whether they have had any adverse events, and they will be asked again at the assessment post-treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par61">Based on our feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as well as a case study of a participant with a number of co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the intervention is deemed low risk.

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p id="Par62">The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome measure, the physical function score from the HOOS function scale at Visit 4. This has identical items to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], with total score transformed to a percentage. Mean primary outcome will be compared between the intervention and control arms using baseline function score as a covariate. The literature mostly uses the WOMAC function score, so parameters for the sample size calculation are based on that, though we indicate the equivalent HOOS score where relevant. We will assume a correlation between pre and post exercise outcomes of 0.6 and take this into account in the calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This is a conservative estimate based on (a) our feasibility study data and Wallis <italic>et al’s</italic> study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], for which the lower limits of the 95% confidence interval were 0.75 and 0.69 respectively, and (b) Bennell et al.’s research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] that assumed a value of 0.6 for their sample size calculation. This will reduce the required sample size by a factor of 0.64. To allow for any clustering effects resulting from the group delivery of the CHAIN intervention, we have inflated the variance of this arm by a factor of 1.22, assuming a cluster size of 12 and intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.02 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Using a 5% two-sided significance test, an effect size (average of minimum clinically important difference found previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) of 5 points on WOMAC (equivalent to 7.4% on HOOS) and standard deviation (average taken from previous literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) of 13 on WOMAC (equivalent to 19.1 on HOOS) a sample size of 102 per arm would be required for 90% power. Allowing for a withdrawal and/or incomplete primary outcome data rate of 20% (for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) the recruitment target will be increased to 256 (9 clusters of size 14–15 in the intervention arm). The sample size calculation was partly conducted using NQuery Advisor software (San Diego, USA).</p>

The impact on cost-effectiveness results of taking participant and societal perspectives, which incorporate costs to patients, their families and wider society, will be explored in sensitivity analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Cost and outcome data will be synthesised to present incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) - the incremental cost per unit of additional outcome - for the primary outcome (cost per unit change on the HOOS measure) and the primary economic endpoint of policy relevance (cost per QALY).</p>
                <p id="Par67">Intervention resource requirements and costs (e.g., staff time, venue hire, educational materials, travel, communication, consumables) will be collected at an individual participant level, using case report forms. Resource use data (including primary and secondary healthcare, social care, and participant and carer-related resource use) will be collected at Visits 1/2, 4 and 5, using a self-report Resource Use Questionnaire. This questionnaire will draw on measures used with similar populations in the Database of Instruments for Resource Use Management (DIRUM) repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], alongside current practice and recent methodological developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and be honed to this specific population through discussion with the study Patient Advisory Group. QALYs will be derived from EQ-5D-5 L trial data, collected at Visits 1/2, 4 and 5.

Incremental costs and incremental Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 24 weeks will be used to estimate the cost-per-QALY of CHAIN versus usual physiotherapy care.</p>

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise costs (by type of service) and QALYs. Regression analyses will be used to adjust for any systematic differences between intervention and control arms at baseline that have not been accounted for by randomisation. If required, we will use multiple imputation to correct for bias that may result from data missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par76">The Cochrane Collaboration’s 2014 review of studies of exercise for hip OA found evidence supporting the use of exercise to reduce pain and improve physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment of early OA of the knee and hip with exercise has been shown to have cost benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, the most recent systematic review of physical therapy interventions for hip or knee OA resulted in only 9 eligible studies that included economic analysis, highlighting the need for more high-quality studies which can inform future clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The CLEAT trial seeks to build further evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the CHAIN intervention compared to standard physiotherapy care within a randomised, controlled trial setting.</p>
              <p id="Par77">This trial aims to generate findings that are directly applicable to routine hospital care, and as such the standard care arm is pragmatic representing a mixture of approaches in the treatment of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To compare the effectiveness of CHAIN versus standard care, the dosage of treatment given, in terms of type, intensity, and time, will be collected. Additionally, this will allow the comparison of the dose response of this study with other exercise interventions. Our inclusion criteria are broad, allowing for a wide range of participants to be recruited. For example, we will only exclude participants who have had hip surgery within 6 months of recruitment to the trial. The CHAIN intervention has been evaluated with a large number of participants previously and it has been shown that participants with multiple co-morbidities can safely take part in this type of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All participants will be encouraged to take part in additional exercise which will be recorded in trial exercise diaries with the aim to compare the type and duration of exercise undertaken between the two trial arms.</p>
              <p id="Par78">The trial takes place at a single high-volume site; this is mainly due to reducing the burden of travel for the participants in the CHAIN arm because the intervention will be delivered at a leisure centre with previous experience of hosting CHAIN, and to simplify the operational running of the study. Dorset Council has one of the oldest populations in the United Kingdom (29.6% over 65 years compared to the national average of 18.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]), and the University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust has some of the highest rates of hip surgery in the country (1091 primary hip replacements in Dorset NHS hospitals in 2019, 367 in independent hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]), thus making Dorset an ideal location for recruitment. A limitation to this trial is the limited long-term follow up, and therefore, determining the effect of the intervention on the time to surgery and other related disease specific health care costs beyond 3 months after treatment finishes will not be possible. We intend to seek further funding for longer term follow up of these trial participants in the coming months.</p>
