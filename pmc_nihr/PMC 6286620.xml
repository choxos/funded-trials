                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The STOPPIT-2 study aims to determine the clinical utility of the Arabin cervical pessary in preventing preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy and a short cervix, about which there is current uncertainty. STOPPIT-2 will resolve uncertainty around effectiveness for women with a twin pregnancy and a cervical length of 35 mm or less, define adverse effects, ascertain acceptability and estimate National Health Service costs and savings.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>STOPPIT-2 is a pragmatic multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial. Consenting women with twin pregnancy will have an transvaginal ultrasound scan of their cervical length performed between 18+0 and 20+6 weeks’ gestation by an accredited practitioner: women with a cervical length of ≤35 mm will be eligible for inclusion in the treatment phase of the study. The intervention by the insertion of the Arabin cervical pessary will be compared with standard treatment (no pessary).</p>
                  <p>The primary outcomes are (obstetric) spontaneous onset of labour for the mother leading to delivery before 34 weeks’ gestation and (neonatal) a composite of specific adverse outcomes or death occurring up to the end of the first 4 weeks after the estimated date of delivery to either or both babies.</p>
                  <p>We plan to recruit 500 women in the treatment phase of the study. Assuming a treatment effect of 0.6, and background rates of 35% and 18%, respectively, for each of the primary outcomes, our study has 85% power to detect a difference between the intervention and the control groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Preterm birth is common in twin pregnancy. The rate of twinning itself is increasing. Twinning is associated with significant death or serious morbidity for the babies, but there are no effective treatments. In 2010, 52.7% of multiple births were preterm, and there is a clear health need for prevention of preterm birth in twins. This excess of prematurity (compared with singletons) leads to neonatal and infant mortality rates of 14.2 and 18.8 per 1000 live births, respectively (over fivefold that of singletons). Progesterone appears ineffective in preventing preterm birth in twins,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and cerclage appears harmful.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Prematurity is thought to account for over 70% of twin neonatal deaths and adversely affects fetal survivors, with increased risks of future respiratory problems, motor and sensory impairment, learning difficulties and social and behavioural difficulties.</p>
              <p>The costs to the National Health Service (NHS) of prematurity in twins are considerable. Twins alone account for over 20% of neonatal unit cot stays, a significant excess given they comprise only 2% of all births. Together, the complications of preterm birth result in an estimated annual cost of £2.946 billion to the public purse in England and Wales (2006 prices).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Twins make a major contribution to this. There is a clear expressed need for innovative interventions to reduce preterm birth in both high-income and low-income countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The 2011 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Multiple Pregnancy Guideline Group noted that bed rest at home or in hospital, progesterone, cervical cerclage and oral tocolytics are all ineffective at preventing preterm birth in twins, concluding that alternative effective interventions are urgently required. The guideline predated the publication of studies on pessary to prevent preterm birth in twins, and there was no attempt to evaluate effectiveness. The Cochrane review on ‘cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth’<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> identified only one randomised trial (in singletons) that ‘showed the beneficial effect of the cervical pessary in preventing preterm birth’ and called for randomised trials to be performed in multiple pregnancy.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

              </fig>
              <p>Four randomised trials have reported efficacy of cervical pessaries to prevent preterm birth in twins. A summary forest plot on the efficacy of the pessary to prevent preterm birth (using the entire population randomised each study) is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The first trial to be published was the ProTwin study, which randomised 813 women with twin pregnancy to treatment with an Arabin pessary (inserted between 16 and 20 weeks’ gestation) or to standard treatment.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although the pessary did not reduce preterm birth or the primary neonatal composite outcome overall, both of these events were significantly reduced in the prespecified subgroup of women with a cervical length less than the 25th centile (n=143) with a relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of preterm birth before 32 weeks of 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.97) and RR (95% CI) of composite neonatal outcome of 0.42 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.91). A subsequent randomised study of 1180 unselected women showed no difference in the rate of the primary outcome of spontaneous birth &lt;34 weeks (13.6% vs 12.9%; relative risk 1.054, 95% CI 0.787 to 1.413; p=0.722).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A preplanned subgroup analysis of 214 women with a cervical length of ≤25 mm also showed no benefit of the pessary (HR 1.256; 95% CI 0.760 to 2.074; p=0.374). These data contrast with a smaller study published the same year, showing that, in women with a cervical length of ≤25 mm, spontaneous preterm birth was less common in the pessary group 11/68 (16.2%) compared with the expectant management group (26/66 (39.4%)).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Lastly, the Prevention of preterm birth with pessary in twins (PoPPT) study of women with twin pregnancy and a cervical length ≤30 mm at 18+0 to 27+6 weeks' gestation randomised 46 women and found no difference in the primary outcome of preterm birth &lt;34 weeks (39% vs 35%; relative risk, 1.13 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.40).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Taken together, these data suggest that the cervical pessary does not work in unselected women but may work in women with a short cervix (at higher risk of preterm birth); consequently, STOPPIT-2 will test the efficacy of the Arabin pessary in women with a short cervix. A cervical length threshold for recruitment of less than or equal to the 30th centile was chosen to maximise the number of women who could benefit. When planning the trial, it was thought that the 30th centile for cervical length would equate to a cervix of ≤30 mm in length, based on a large UK study.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, a meta-analysis published in the early phases of the pilot for STOPPIT-2,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and data from the first 20 women in STOPPIT-2 itself, suggested that the 30th centile of cervical length in twins at 18–21 weeks’ gestation is 35 mm. A cervical length threshold of ≤35 mm (which we assume to be the 30th centile) was therefore used for eligibility. The quality control measures of the Fetal Medicine Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fetalmedicine.com">http://www.fetalmedicine.com</ext-link>), or the Perinatal Quality Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clear.perinatalquality.org">https://clear.perinatalquality.org</ext-link>), are employed to ensure validity of cervical length measurements.</p>
              <p>Research priorities identified by NICE include randomised trials to determine ‘[effective interventions] in preventing spontaneous preterm birth in women with twin[s], especially in those at high risk of preterm birth’. Additionally, the Preterm Birth Clinical Study Group of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) identified ‘Efficacy of the Arabin pessary’ among its top five research priorities. We are aware of several other studies in active or planned recruitment comparing a cervical pessary with standard care for prevention of preterm birth or its consequences in women with a preterm birth including NCT03418311 (planned n=672), NCT03058536 (planned n=312), ACTRN12616000875404 (planned n=140), NCT02708264 (planned n=242), NCT02350231 (planned n=100) and NCT01334489 (planned n=352).</p>
              <p>After publication of STOPPIT-2 results, we plan to collaborate in subsequent individual patient data meta-analyses and update the economic decision model in light of new evidence. If the cervical pessary is effective in reducing preterm birth in twin pregnancy, it could make a major contribution to human health and ensure a more efficient allocation of resources in the UK NHS. However, we need to determine whether it is effective (and safe), since the evidence to date is not strong or robust enough to support its adoption as a first-line intervention.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>STOPPIT-2 is a multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial of the Arabin pessary (CE marked device) versus standard treatment in women with twin pregnancy recruited from NHS antenatal clinics. The study is in two phases: a screening phase, in which women with a short cervix (cervical length of ≤35 mm) are identified, and a treatment phase, in which women with a short cervix will be randomised to either treatment with Arabin pessary or standard treatment. An internal pilot will be performed to assess recruitment rates and to determine feasibility.</p>

                  <title>Primary objective</title>
                  <p>The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the Arabin cervical pessary reduces spontaneous preterm birth in women with a twin pregnancy and a short cervix (≤35 mm), reducing adverse neonatal outcomes and healthcare costs. We will also address the hypothesis that the pessary is acceptable to pregnant women. Subgroup analyses will determine effectiveness in women with a cervical length ≤25 mm and in women with a dichorionic pregnancy.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation to Arabin pessary or standard treatment is performed by the central randomisation facility at the study data centre using a web portal. The allocation sequence will be generated by computer. Participants will be assigned a unique study identifier, and staff will be required to enter minimal patient details prior to randomisation. Randomisation will be minimised with a random element rather than stratified given the properties of minimisation in ensuring comparability between the groups. Minimisation variables include booking hospital, cervical length and chorionicity (mono or dichorionic) but are not limited to these. The study is open (ie, not masked), so that both the participant and the investigator will know which treatment has been allocated. The investigator will inform the woman of treatment allocation after randomisation.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing intervention</title>
                <p>Participation is voluntary. A woman has the right to discontinue or withdraw at any time for any reason. The investigator also has the ability to discontinue a participant. The reason and circumstances will be documented in the eCRF. Unless a participant asks to completely withdraw from the study, those who discontinue treatment will be asked to continue to participate in study visits to facilitate analysis under the intention to treat principle.</p>
                <p>If treatment is suspended or stopped due to a serious adverse reaction, the local PI will arrange for follow-up visits or telephone calls until the event has resolved or stabilised or until the study has ended, whichever is sooner. In order to avoid bias and/or missing adverse events, outcome data will be collected (including data from the patient record) and used in the analysis.</p>
                <p>We will note whether participants have adhered to the treatment assignation. In the intervention arm, we will define adherence as women who have a pessary in situ at 28 weeks’ gestation (whether it has been out and been reinserted during that time). Women who deliver before 28 weeks will count as adherent if they had their pessary until 7 days before delivery. Those in the standard care arm will be considered adherent unless they had a pessary inserted.</p>

                <p>Study visits will be conducted at approximately 4 weekly intervals (plus or minus 1 week) following randomisation until 36 weeks, when the pessary will be removed. The study visits will be carried out on those randomised to the pessary and those undergoing standard treatment. Study visits could be face to face or by phone or other means of communication, for example, via letter or email. Pregnancy and fetal well-being will be reviewed at these visits. Additionally, we will collect the following outcomes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Any pregnancy complications (adverse events) including bleeding.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experience of the pessary during the previous 4 weeks (if applicable).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hospital admissions (serious adverse events) – reasons and duration.</p></list-item></list>

The participant will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about her experience and (if appropriate) of having the pessary. For those allocated to pessary treatment, a vaginal examination will be conducted, and the pessary will be removed. Information will be collected on the ease with which removal was achieved.

Women will be given information about the study by the investigator team at each study site, invited to consider participation and will be given adequate time (at least 24 hours) to read the information sheet. If the woman waives this opportunity but still wishes to participate, consent may be taken after a shorter time. Details of the consent process, including the name of the doctor confirming eligibility and the member of the study team taking consent will be recorded in the woman’s notes and in the eCRF. Women undergoing ultrasound measurement of the cervix will be asked to complete a consent form prior to the procedure, which will cover both screening and treatment phases of the study. This will minimise inconvenience to the women (reducing the number of visits required to the hospital) and minimise the time undergoing vaginal examination. We will seek permission for future long-term follow-up of the women and babies via record linkage into national databases (health, social and educational) although such follow-up is beyond the scope of the study described here.</p>

                <title>Data analysis (treatment phase data)</title>
                <p>The statistical analysis will be according to the intention to treat principle; all participants will remain in their allocated group for analysis. Statistical significance will be at the 5% level with corresponding 95% CIs derived. Randomised groups will be described at baseline and follow-up using mean (SD), median (IQR) and counts (with percentages) where appropriate.</p>
                <p>For the primary obstetric and neonatal outcomes, logistic regression with a fixed effect for the minimisation covariate chorionicity and a random effect for centre will be used to obtain the ORs of the treatment effect, along with the 95% CI and associated p value. In the case of the composite neonatal outcome, the components will also be reported individually to show which elements are driving the primary outcome. In the case of skewed recruitment resulting in small centres, a regional effect will be considered in place of a centre effect.</p>
                <p>Continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear regression, adjusting for chorionicity. Binary categorical secondary outcomes will be analysed using logistic regression as per the primary outcomes.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes with more than two categories will be analysed using multinomial logistic regression.</p>
                <p>Analysis of fetal outcomes will allow for clustering within twins by fitting mother as a random effect in a mixed effects logistic regression model.</p>
                <p>We will undertake predefined subgroup analyses of the primary outcome by monochorionicity, cervical length (≤25 mm and ≤28 mm). In the subgroup analyses, statistical significance will be at the 1% level with corresponding 99% CIs.</p>
                <p>It is not anticipated that primary outcome data will be missing. If data are missing, this is likely to be due to a miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal or maternal death and therefore it will not be imputed.</p>
                <p>A post hoc comparison will also be performed between participants who had membrane rupture and those who did not.</p>
                <p>A per-protocol analysis (including those in the intervention arm who are adherent, and excluding those in the control arm who have a pessary inserted) will also be performed.</p>

The eCRF has been developed in accordance with CHaRT software development standards at the University of Aberdeen. Data entry is carried out remotely by authorised study personnel. Accuracy of entry and the storage of source documentation is the responsibility of site study personnel. Validation checks will be set up and run in real time on the eCRF. Checks will include missing data, out of range values, illogical entries and invalid responses. Users will be informed of data issues when the eCRF page is saved providing users with the opportunity to correct the data immediately, where possible. The eCRF system will generate a missing data query for all items not completed at the time. Cross-form checks comparing data items across different forms will be created, where possible or written as reports.</p>

                <p>The economic component will consider the joint distribution of the cumulative hospital costs and the primary clinical outcome from the perspective of the UK NHS. Generalised linear models will be used to estimate the costs between the two treatment groups. The cost estimates and primary clinical outcome will be combined within a cost-effectiveness analysis to calculate the incremental cost per preterm birth prevented. The length of stay distributions will be valued using a per diem unit cost derived from NHS reference costs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Monetary values will be attached to the labour costs for healthcare practitioners associated with each treatment pathway using standard NHS pay and price estimates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> No discounting of hospital costs and clinical outcomes will be undertaken for the within-trial economic component. Flexible parametric regression models will be used to explore the dependency between cost and the primary clinical outcome as well as heterogeneous treatment effects within a sensitivity analysis to inform a decision-analytic model. A decision model will be developed to estimate the longer term resource consequences and health outcomes of preterm birth following twin pregnancy. Model parameter uncertainty will be addressed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis summarised using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve at differing willingness to pay thresholds.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>We plan to recruit 2500 women to the SCREENING phase and randomise 500 women in the treatment phase. We anticipate that around 58 sites (largely UK NHS sites) will be involved.</p>
                <p>Women with a short cervix are at higher risk of preterm birth and may benefit most from pessary treatment. We aim to treat women with a cervical length ≤35 mm, which we believe to be around the 30th centile. Assuming this to be correct, a sample size of 1850 screened was initially identified to generate 555 eligible for randomisation in the treatment phase. However, following reanalysis of data (masked to treatment allocation) in September 2017 after 29 months of screening (with data on 1214 women screened), we estimated that to randomise 550 women, the sample size of screening needed to increase to 2500. Although we will encourage women to participate in the screening phase only if they wish also to participate in the treatment phase, we have allowed for a further 10% drop out after screening, so that we now aim to randomise 500 women in the treatment phase.</p>
                <p>We plan to randomise 500 women (250 in each group). We assume a relative risk of the primary obstetric outcome (spontaneous preterm labour leading to preterm birth before 34 weeks) in the pessary group of 0.6. We believe our relative risk reduction is conservative, given a relative risk of 0.49 for delivery before 32 weeks<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and 0.47 for delivery before 34 weeks (21% vs 42%) (S Liem, personal communication, 2013) in the ProTwin study. We anticipate that 35% of women in the control group will deliver before 34 weeks. We believe that this is a conservative estimate, given that a systematic review indicated that 34.9% of women with a cervical length of 35 mm or less (when scanned at 20 weeks’ gestation) will deliver preterm before 32 weeks.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Assuming a baseline rate of 35% and a relative risk of 0.6, a sample size of 500 has 94% power to detect a difference at the 5% significance level. If the preterm birth rate before 34 weeks is only 30%, the power drops to 88%. Both allow for losses to follow-up and imperfect compliance.</p>
                <p>For the primary neonatal outcome, Liem showed an effect size of 0.42 at the child level and an incidence of 24% in the control group.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We have powered our study for a relative risk of 0.6 for the primary neonatal outcome. Assuming prevalence rates as in Liem, our study would have 97% power. In practice, our postscreening groups of women with cervical length ≤35 mm is probably a lower risk than in the Liem group (less than 38 mm), given comparisons of the rate of preterm delivery in each of the control groups. Hence, if we assume a lower rate of the neonatal primary outcome of (say) 18%, we still have 88.4% power to detect a relative risk of 0.6 in the Arabin pessary group. Such a calculation assumes analysis at the child level is appropriate for the neonatal outcome.</p>
                <p>For the subgroup of women with cervical length of ≤25 mm, the anticipated rate of the primary obstetric outcome in the control group is 82/159 (51%).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The study has 85% power to detect a relative risk of 0.6 in this group, with a sample size of 234 (25 mm was the 14th centile in the To <italic>et al</italic>).</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title>
                <p>The importance of the research question was identified by two major groups, both involving PPI.</p>
                <p>The first was the NICE guideline on multiple pregnancy, published in 2011, which had embedded PPI.</p>
                <p>The guideline generated the following research recommendation: ‘What interventions are effective in preventing spontaneous preterm birth in women with twin and triplet pregnancies, especially in those at high risk of preterm birth? The second group was the Clinical Study Group from the RCOG, which has extensive lay and patient involvement. ‘The use of the Arabin pessary for preventing preterm birth’ is one of five research priorities identified in late 2012.</p>
                <p>There was PPI in the development of the protocol at grant submission stage, including in choice of the outcome measures. Specifically, the CEO of a charity focusing on preterm birth (Jane Denton, Multiple Births Foundation) who was a coapplicant on this project was and involved in the study design.</p>
                <p>Patients and the public are also involved in the TSC for this study, which oversaw the conduct of the study: both through participation of individual patients and through participation of Keith Read from Tamba (The Twins and Multiple Births Association) and two individual patients. Although PPI were not directly involved in individual patient recruitment, they provided helpful comments on the patient information sheet used for this purpose. PPIs were members of the ethics committee who assessed the research burden associated with participating in this study.</p>
                <p>Individual study participants will be sent a summary of study findings, when the main study is published. We also make use of our connections with the charities Tommy’s, the Multiple Births Foundation and the Twins and Multiple Births Association to disseminate information.</p>
