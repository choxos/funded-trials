          <body>
            <p>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complex genetic neurobehavioral/metabolic disorder with an estimated birth incidence of 1:15 000 to 1:20 000 (<xref rid="dgad014-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="dgad014-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). PWS arises from lack of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13 caused by a paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15, or an imprinting center defect, resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction (<xref rid="dgad014-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Clinical features of PWS include hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy and sustained accumulation of excess body fat beginning in early childhood (<xref rid="dgad014-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Hyperphagia presents as food obsession, aggressive food seeking, and lack of satiety, with progression to severe obesity if energy intake is not restricted, and occurs around a mean age of 9 years (<xref rid="dgad014-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). PWS is also associated with intellectual disability, low muscle mass, neuroendocrine abnormalities including growth hormone and gonadotropin deficiency, behavioral problems including aggression, anxiety, and compulsivity, and elevated risk for early mortality (<xref rid="dgad014-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="dgad014-B5" ref-type="bibr">5-7</xref>). According to a 2014 survey of caregivers of PWS patients, reducing hunger and improving food-related behaviors were the most important unmet needs in PWS that should be addressed in the development of a new therapeutic (<xref rid="dgad014-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). There are no approved treatments for hyperphagia in PWS.</p>
            <p>Diazoxide is a potent activator of the adenosine triphosphate–sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel, and is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (<xref rid="dgad014-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Activating the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus results in reduced secretion of NPY and AgRP, potent endogenous appetite-stimulatory neuropeptides, potentially contributing to a reduction in hyperphagia (<xref rid="dgad014-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These actions of the drug are complemented by activating the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, pancreatic β cells, and adipocytes to reduce hyperinsulinemia and excess body fat, and improve insulin and leptin resistance, and satiety (<xref rid="dgad014-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These effects have been confirmed in animal models of hyperphagic obesity including a model of PWS (Magel-2 null mouse) (<xref rid="dgad014-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
            <p>The increased solubility of diazoxide choline and its slow release from the extended-release once-per-day tablet formulation, DCCR, results in stable plasma concentrations compared to those seen with diazoxide oral suspension, which is usually given 2 to 3 times daily. Target daily doses of DCCR evaluated in PWS may be better tolerated than those of diazoxide equivalent doses, and efficacy in PWS may be achievable at diazoxide equivalent doses in the low range of the labeled dose range.</p>
            <p>DCCR was tested in a phase 2 study (clinical study PC025) in participants with PWS in whom DCCR treatment significantly reduced hyperphagia, aggressive behavior, and body fat, and increased lean body mass (<xref rid="dgad014-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that in people with PWS, DCCR compared with placebo would reduce hyperphagia and aggressive behaviors, and improve body composition.</p>

              <title>Materials and Methods</title>
              <p>DESTINY PWS was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 study comparing DCCR to placebo in individuals with PWS. The study enrolled males and females with genetically confirmed PWS, aged 4 years and older with moderate to severe hyperphagia (Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [HQ-CT] score ≥ 13), weighing between 20 and 135 kg, in a stable care setting, at 29 sites in the United States and United Kingdom. The enrolled participants who continued to meet the inclusion criteria at the end of a 2-week single-blind, placebo run-in were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment with DCCR or matching placebo stratified by growth hormone treatment (currently treated, not currently treated) and baseline HQ-CT score (scores from 13-19 and from 20-36). Participants were included in 1 of 5 weight bands and titrated to target dose of 3.3 to 5.8 mg/kg within 6 weeks. Daily dose of DCCR ranged from 100 to 450 mg. Randomization codes were centrally generated and all study site staff, the sponsor and sponsor's on-site representatives, participants, and their caregivers were blinded until completion of the study. The primary end point was hyperphagia change from baseline through week 13 measured using the HQ-CT, a 9-item, validated questionnaire that assessed food-related behaviors associated with hyperphagia in people with PWS (range, 0-36) (<xref rid="dgad014-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Secondary end points included Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), Caregiver Global Impression of Change (GI-C), and body fat measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Exploratory end points included other body composition parameters, behavioral complications of PWS assessed using the Prader-Willi Syndrome Profile (PWSP) Questionnaire and the Developmental Behavior Checklist version 2 parent edition (DBC2-P), and hormones involved in appetite, satiety, and fat metabolism (leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and acylated ghrelin), all measured at a central laboratory. The PWSP is a 59-item caregiver-completed questionnaire designed to assess a participant's non–food-related behaviors across 6 domains: aggressive behaviors, anxiety, rigidity/irritability, compulsivity, depression, and disordered thinking. The DBC includes 96 items used to assess the behavior and emotional problems in people aged 4 and older with developmental and intellectual disabilities. The questionnaire includes a subscale associated with PWS and subscales encompassing disruptive behaviors, self-absorbed, communication disturbance, anxiety, and social relating. The Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using fasting insulin and glucose measurements from the central laboratory as [fasting insulin (μIU/mL) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5.</p>
              <p>The sample size was calculated using hyperphagia response data from the previous phase 2 study PC025, and the estimate of SD of HQ-CT change from a prior PWS obesity pharmacotherapy study (<xref rid="dgad014-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Based on the use of a 2-sided, 2-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test at α = .05 level of significance and a 2:1 randomization ratio, a total sample of 105 participants provided 90% power to detect an HQ-CT score difference of 5.0 between the groups. The primary end point was assessed as change from baseline at study week 4 (during titration to target dose) and at weeks 8 and 13 and was analyzed using a linear mixed model for repeated measurements including fixed effects for treatment group, time, the interaction between treatment and time, and the stratification variable (growth hormone use) using baseline HQ-CT score as a covariate and an unstructured covariance model. Hormonal, endocrine, and body composition parameters were analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with baseline as a covariate, and treatment group and the stratification variables as factors. CGI-I and Caregiver GI-C were compared between treatment groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel mean score test with modified ridit scores, stratified by the stratification variables. Changes in PWSP scores were tested using a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. If the primary end point was statistically significant, then each of the secondary end points was tested in order, with each subsequent analysis reported as significant only if the preceding analysis was significant. Consequently, no multiplicity adjustment was made to α and all analyses following the first nonsignificant ordered end point yielded nominal results. Data for most parameters are expressed as least-square means (LSmean) and standard errors (SEs).</p>
              <p>The primary analysis was conducted on the full dataset consisting of all data from randomized participants (intent-to-treat [ITT] population). Since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in considerable changes in environment and behavior for patients with PWS and their caregivers (<xref rid="dgad014-B14" ref-type="bibr">14-17</xref>), potentially affecting qualitative data such as hyperphagia and other behaviors, a post hoc pre-COVID analysis using the same statistical methods was conducted using windowed visits and including data for all participants obtained before March 1, 2020. Although the United States and World Health Organization had both declared COVID-19 a health emergency on January 31, 2020, the use of masks, social distancing, closures of schools and clinical sites, and supply chain issues and other disruptive events did not begin to occur until late February 2020. As a consequence, a date of March 1, 2020, was selected since it precedes the aspect of the pandemic that more markedly affected the lives of participants in the study.</p>
              <p>Post hoc exposure response analyses were conducted to explore trends in the relationship between circulating drug level and clinical end points using simple linear regression. Placebo recipients were included in the regression at a circulating drug concentration of 0 to anchor the regression.</p>

              <p>Prior to initation of the study, ethics committee review and approval of the protocol and study related materials was completed. Participants or their parents/guardians provided informed consent and, as appropriate, assent, prior to being enrolled in the study. From May 2018 until January 2020, 181 people with PWS were screened for the study, 158 of whom were enrolled; among these, 31 were not eligible for randomization because of failure to continue to meet inclusion criteria after the placebo run-in, and 127 were randomly assigned (<xref rid="dgad014-F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The ITT population consisted of 82 DCCR- and 42 placebo-treated participants who received study medication and had at least one postbaseline assessment of the primary end point (excluding 3 randomly assigned participants who either did not receive study medication or who lacked a postbaseline measurement of HQ-CT). Overall, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics (Table <xref rid="dgad014-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Pre-COVID Results</title>
                <p>The pre-COVID analysis included all data available before March 1, 2020. New procedures were implemented in the study in response to the COVID pandemic that provided for the collection of key questionnaire data in the absence of being able to conduct on-site visits. Some sites were closed for on-site visits before the new procedures were implemented, resulting in missing data. Because the primary end point was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures, it included 121 participants who had at least one postbaseline assessment of HQ-CT (n = 80 for DCCR and n = 41 for placebo), among whom 86 had completed treatment in the study before March 1, 2020 (n = 55 DCCR and n = 31 placebo). Statistically significant differences between DCCR and placebo were found for the primary, and all secondary end points, most of the objective exploratory end points, and nearly all the caregiver-assessed end points. DCCR treatment was associated with a significant reduction in HQ-CT score compared to placebo (see <xref rid="dgad014-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, LSmean [SE] −6.6 [1.0], n = 80 vs -3.5 [1.3] n = 41; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .037). A sensitivity analysis, distinct from the pre-COVID analysis of the aforementioned primary end point and shown in <xref rid="dgad014-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, was conducted using data only from participants who had completed the end of study visit before March 1, 2020. In the sensitivity analysis, there was a significant difference between the groups for HQ-CT change from baseline at 13 weeks (LSmean [SE] −6.54 [1.083] n = 53 vs −3.33 [1.375] n = 29 DCCR vs placebo; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .0451). Each of the secondary end points was significant (see <xref rid="dgad014-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; CGI-I <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .015; Caregiver GI-C <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .031, and fat mass <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .003). The pattern, magnitude, and significance of changes in body composition were similar in the analysis of the full data set and in the pre-COVID analysis (see <xref rid="dgad014-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), as were the changes in endocrine and hormonal markers, which were all significantly improved in the DCCR group vs placebo, with the exception of HOMA-IR. Significant improvements were also seen in 5 of 6 domains of the PWS-P in the DCCR group compared to placebo including aggressive behaviors (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .048), anxiety (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .018), compulsivity (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .008), rigidity/irritability (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .003), and disordered thinking (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .011). Similarly, significant behavioral improvements were seen in the DCCR group compared to placebo for DBC-2 total score (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .009) and the communication disturbance (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .003) and social-relating (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .008) subscales.</p>

                <p>Patients with PWS experience frequent complications and comorbidities. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 83.3% of participants in the DCCR group compared to 73.8% of the placebo group (Fisher exact test, NS, Table <xref rid="dgad014-T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Study drug–related TEAEs occurred in 63.1% of participants in the DCCR group compared to 52.4% of the placebo group (Fisher exact test, NS). Six participants experienced serious AEs in the study, all occurring in the DCCR group, which in only one participant was considered drug related (peripheral and pulmonary edema in the setting of an unrelated concurrent pneumonia). The most common TEAEs in the DCCR compared to the placebo group were hypertrichosis (35.7% vs 14.3%, Fisher exact test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05), peripheral edema (20.2% vs 9.5%, Fisher exact test; NS), and hyperglycemia (11.9% vs 0.0%, Fisher exact test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05) (Table <xref rid="dgad014-T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These TEAEs rarely resulted in discontinuation of study drug (1 discontinuation related to peripheral edema and 1 related to hyperglycemia), but occasionally required blinded dose adjustment or other intervention (6 in the DCCR group and 0 in placebo). Pyrexia, when it occurred, was typically associated with respiratory infection and was viewed in nearly all cases as not related to study medication. Headache, diarrhea, and viral infections were more frequent in the placebo than the DCCR group (14.3% vs 6.0%, 9.5% vs 1.2%, 7.1% vs 1.2%, respectively, for placebo vs DCCR; Fisher exact test; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .05 for diarrhea) as were AEs commonly associated with PWS, including aggression, intentional self-injury, and premature menarche (28.6% vs 14.3%, placebo vs DCCR; odds ratio 2.4; 95% CI, 0.97-5.94) (Table <xref rid="dgad014-T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Consistent with the observation of hyperglycemia as an AE, fasting glucose rose through week 6 (during titration) and stabilized thereafter through the end of blinded treatment at week 13 (DCCR mean ± SD 0.29 ± 1.07 mmol/L, median 0.10 mmol/L; placebo mean ± SD −0.01 ± 0.56 mmol/L, median -0.05 mmol/L). There was a small but significant increase from baseline in glycated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> in the DCCR group compared to placebo (DCCR mean ± SD 0.15 ± 0.61%, median 0.0%; placebo mean ± SD −0.09 ± 0.24%, median −0.1%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .023) consistent with the small rise in glucose concentration. Overall, DCCR was well tolerated with the majority of AEs being grade 1.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Hyperphagia, the hallmark of PWS, was improved significantly by DCCR among those with more severe hyperphagia and in the pre-COVID analysis, but not in the ITT population analysis. The observed improvement likely results from the combination of the direct effects of DCCR in NPY/AgRP neurons and from improvements in hyperinsulinemia and leptin resistance (<xref rid="dgad014-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The improvement seen with DCCR treatment in those with more severe hyperphagia at baseline was consistent with the results of the phase 2 study in PWS, in which those with more severe hyperphagia also had greater improvements (<xref rid="dgad014-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Individuals with more severe hyperphagia at baseline are likely to have more marked central insulin and leptin resistance and hence greater dysregulation of NPY/AgRP secretion, which consequently increases orexigenic signaling and impairs anorectic signaling through MC4R. DCCR treatment of these individuals reinforces the inhibitory action of insulin and leptin on NPY/AgRP secretion, which may have a greater impact in these individuals compared to those with less severe hyperphagia.</p>
              <p>The observed reductions in leptin and insulin concentrations are consistent with the proposed mode of action of DCCR. The decrease in leptin appears to be in excess of what would be predicted by loss of body fat alone and may suggest a direct effect of DCCR on leptin secretion, an improvement in leptin resistance, or a reduction in leptin secondary to a reduction in insulin concentration (<xref rid="dgad014-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="dgad014-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Adiponectin concentration is increased in patients with PWS (<xref rid="dgad014-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and the further increases in adiponectin associated with DCCR treatment may result in reduced systemic inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular health (<xref rid="dgad014-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Levels of acylated ghrelin decreased in the DCCR group, rather than increasing, which would be expected in PWS with loss of body fat and reduction of serum leptin and insulin levels (<xref rid="dgad014-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="dgad014-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Acylated ghrelin concentrations are higher in PWS compared to people without PWS (<xref rid="dgad014-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and the prevention of the rise in acylated ghrelin by DCCR may have contributed to the observed improvements in hyperphagia, though studies aimed at reducing ghrelin action have not confirmed the role of ghrelin for the hyperphagia of PWS. Improvements in hyperphagia have the potential to allow the person with PWS to focus their attention on activities rather than food and ease the burden of care on their caregiver, typically a parent. Once a person with PWS develops hyperphagia, access to food must be strictly controlled, and situations where food is present must be closely managed. Some of these constraints on access to food and the level of supervision around food may begin to be relaxed if the improvements in hyperphagia are sustained. Increases in muscle mass and reductions in body fat were viewed by parents and caregivers as important or very important responses to a new therapeutic (<xref rid="dgad014-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The loss of body fat, which was baseline fat mass dependent, the trend toward increased lean body mass, and the increases in the lean body mass/fat mass ratio were all consistent with the results from the phase 2 study of DCCR in PWS (<xref rid="dgad014-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>There was a clear linear relationship between circulating drug levels and key therapeutic responses to treatment including HQ-CT and leptin. These results further confirm the relationship between DCCR administration and responses to treatment that are viewed as important to PWS participants and their families.</p>
              <p>The effect on other behavioral aspects of the condition—anxiety, compulsivity, and rigidity/irritability—were more obvious in the pre-COVID analyses. Subjective end points, such as change from baseline in hyperphagia and characteristic PWS-associated behaviors, were significantly improved by DCCR in the pre-COVID analysis only, whereas objective end points such as change in body fat and various metabolic parameters remained positive regardless of the analysis data set. It may also be indicative of a strong placebo effect for these subjective measures, including the HQ-CT primary outcome measure, which decreased on average by more than 4 points in placebo-treated participants from baseline to final follow-up. The difference between pre-COVID analysis and the analysis of the full data set reflects the abrupt and extensive nature of the changes in routine associated with the onset of the pandemic, the challenges people with PWS generally face in adapting to changes in routine and environment, especially the lack of school routine, the elevated stress level of caregiver, participant, and the participant's family, and the fact that nearly all participants spent considerably more time with their caregiver(s) compared to the pre-COVID period. These effects have been confirmed by other studies typically showing worsening of characteristic symptoms but also improvements in some participants (<xref rid="dgad014-B14" ref-type="bibr">14-17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Further evidence of the broad-ranging effect of DCCR is supported by the AE profile, as participants on DCCR experienced AEs commonly considered as comorbidities of PWS (aggression, intentional self-injury, etc) at half the rate as those on placebo.</p>
              <p>The safety profile of DCCR in participants with PWS was consistent with that observed in prior studies and with the known safety profile of diazoxide. Three AEs were carefully surveilled and consistently assessed: hyperglycemia, including other related AE terms, peripheral edema, and hypertrichosis/hirsutism. There were assessments of hypertrichosis/hirsutism and peripheral edema at each site visit during the physical exam. Hyperglycemia tended to occur more frequently in older, obese participants who may have been predisposed to hyperglycemia, but also tended to receive higher DCCR doses and consequently had higher circulating drug levels. To effectively manage hyperglycemia, 3 participants received concomitant metformin and 3 individuals had dose reductions in DCCR.</p>
              <p>Although the primary efficacy outcome of this study (change in HQ-CT score at 13 weeks) was not statistically different in DCCR vs placebo in the entire cohort, DCCR reduced hyperphagia in those with more severe hyperphagia, and in the subset of data collected before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data also show improved body composition as well as adipokines, acylated ghrelin, and insulin, and suggest the potential for improvement of a range of behavioral difficulties in PWS. Many of these outcomes are aligned with what have been identified as the highest-priority unmet needs in the syndrome by parents and caregivers. If improvements in hyperphagia and other behaviors are sustained, they may result in improved quality of life for these patients and a reduced burden of care for their families and thereby may benefit people with PWS and their families.</p>
