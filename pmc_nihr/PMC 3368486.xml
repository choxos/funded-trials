                <p><bold>Objective</bold> To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of booklet based vestibular rehabilitation with and without telephone support for chronic dizziness, compared with routine care.</p>
                <p><bold>Design</bold> Single blind, parallel group, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial.</p>
                <p><bold>Setting</bold> 35 general practices across southern England between October 2008 and January 2011.</p>
                <p><bold>Participants</bold> Patients aged 18 years or over with chronic dizziness (mean duration &gt;five years) not attributable to non-vestibular causes (confirmed by general practitioner) and that could be aggravated by head movement (confirmed by patient).</p>
                <p><bold>Interventions</bold> Participants randomly allocated to receive routine medical care, booklet based vestibular rehabilitation only, or booklet based vestibular rehabilitation with telephone support. For the booklet approach, participants received self management booklets providing comprehensive advice on undertaking vestibular rehabilitation exercises at home daily for up to 12 weeks and using cognitive behavioural techniques to promote positive beliefs and treatment adherence. Participants receiving telephone support were offered up to three brief sessions of structured support from a vestibular therapist.</p>
                <p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Vertigo symptom scale-short form and total healthcare costs related to dizziness per quality adjusted life year (QALY).</p>
                <p><bold>Results</bold> Of 337 randomised participants, 276 (82%) completed all clinical measures at the primary endpoint, 12 weeks, and 263 (78%) at one year follow-up. We analysed clinical effectiveness by intention to treat, using analysis of covariance to compare groups after intervention, controlling for baseline symptom scores. At 12 weeks, scores on the vertigo symptom scale in the telephone support group did not differ significantly from those in the routine care group (adjusted mean difference â1.79 (95% confidence interval â3.69 tÎ¿ 0.11), P=0.064). At one year, both intervention groups improved significantly relative to routine care (telephone support â2.52 (â4.52 to â0.51), P=0.014; booklet only â2.43 (â4.27 to â0.60), P=0.010). Analysis of cost effectiveness acceptability curves showed that both interventions were highly cost effective; at very low QALY values, the booklet only approach was most likely to be cost effective, but the approach with additional telephone support was most likely to be cost effective at QALY values more than Â£1200 (â¬1488; $1932). Using the booklet approach with telephone support, five (three to 12) patients would need to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Booklet based vestibular rehabilitation for chronic dizziness is a simple and cost effective means of improving patient reported outcomes in primary care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dizziness associated with vestibular dysfunction is a very common condition, especially among older patients. In large population studies, up to 25% of adults report current dizziness,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and a screening test for poor balance due to vestibular dysfunction showed deficits in 35% of adults and 50% of those older than 60 years.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients might be unconcerned about mild dizziness or balance deficits, but more than one in ten people of working age<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and one in five people older than 60 years<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> currently has dizziness that causes considerable interference with daily activities, medical consultation, or medication use. Peripheral vestibular disorder is the most common cause of dizziness presenting in primary care, but anxiety or other psychiatric disturbance is also frequently present, and a multifactorial syndrome is often identified in older people.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Chronic dizziness associated with poor balance is a significant risk factor for falling and fear of falling,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which in turn results in substantial further limitation of activity, morbidity, and healthcare costs.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>There is now widespread consensus that an exercise based form of treatment known as âvestibular rehabilitationâ or âbalance retrainingâ is the most effective means of managing dizziness due to vestibular dysfunction.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The central element of vestibular rehabilitation is a programme of graded exercises, consisting of eye, head, and body movements designed to stimulate the vestibular system. Initially, these movements provoke dizziness, but repetition for many weeks promotes neurological adaptation and compensation processes resulting in partial or complete resolution of symptoms and balance problems.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The exercises can also help patients to overcome fear and avoidance of activities that elicit disorientation, and regain skill and confidence in balance.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>Vestibular rehabilitation has been recommended for a wide range of conditions, including peripheral vestibular disorder; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; MÃ©niÃ¨reâs disease (when spontaneous attacks are infrequent); multifactorial dizziness in older people; and dizziness associated with migraine, whiplash, or head injury.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Currently, only a small fraction of eligible patients with dizziness ever receive vestibular rehabilitation,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> even though rehabilitation exercises are relatively simple and can be done at home.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p>
              <p>In the only substantial trial of vestibular rehabilitation in primary care so far,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> just 3% (5/170) of participants had previously been offered rehabilitation, despite a mean duration of dizziness of eight years, yet two thirds of participants benefited from it in the trial. Typically, 80-90% of patients with dizziness are managed in primary care,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> chiefly by reassurance and treatment for symptomatic relief.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, no drug in current use has well established curative or prophylactic value or is suitable for palliative use in the long term.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Access to vestibular rehabilitation usually involves a costly and lengthy referral process to secondary care for assessment by a variety of specialties, often including imaging,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and locating suitable trained therapists to teach exercises to patients can be difficult.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Consequently, there is increasing pressure to explore alternative models of treatment delivery that can provide prompt and cost effective treatment to a larger proportion of patients.<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
              <p>Our previous trial of booklet based vestibular rehabilitation in primary care with support from trained practice nurses showed that this procedure could be a safe and effective mode of delivery,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> but primary care staff do not generally have the specialist skills and experience to diagnose and treat vestibular disorders and therefore could lack confidence to do so.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> This study therefore investigated other models of care that could be readily implemented and that do not need primary care staff to have additional training. One option is to consider using an existing pool of health professionals (including audiologists, physiotherapists, and hearing therapists) who have training and experience in vestibular rehabilitation, but these therapists are typically attached to specialist clinics rather than primary care. </p>
              <p>A potentially feasible and cost effective approach would be to give the rehabilitation booklets to patients in primary care and employ experienced therapists to provide structured remote support by telephone. If this model is implemented, it is first necessary to establish whether remote telephone support from an unfamiliar clinician can satisfactorily substitute the face-to-face support given by a familiar practice nurse that had proved effective in our previous trial. We also hypothesised that telephone support might prove unnecessary since the booklets were designed to give precise comprehensive support for patients to self manage their symptoms,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and needed no specific additional therapist input. Consequently, we aimed to determine whether booklet based vestibular rehabilitation with expert telephone support was an effective and cost effective alternative to routine care, and explore the benefits of such rehabilitation without telephone support.</p>

                <title>Participants and procedures</title>
                <p>We recruited patients between October 2008 and July 2009 from 35 general practices across southern England, including inner city, suburban, and rural practices. We used practice records to identify eligible patients 18 years or older with a complaint of dizziness during the past two years (box 1). Patients were reviewed by their general practitioner and excluded if the dizziness was attributed to non-vestibular causes or there were contraindications to treatment by vestibular rehabilitation. Patients identified as potentially suitable were sent invitation letters, and on return of their consent form to the research team, they were mailed the baseline questionnaire pack. On return of the baseline questionnaires, we excluded patients if their responses showed that they were no longer dizzy or their dizziness was not aggravated by rapid head movements (we used this item for screening because vestibular rehabilitation is designed primarily to treat dizziness provoked by movement).</p>

Within each randomisation block of nine patients, those randomised to receive telephone support were then allocated to one of the three therapists. The trial administrator informed participants which intervention group they had been allocated to, sent vestibular rehabilitation booklets to participants in the active treatment groups, and informed therapists of patients that had been allocated to them. Participants, therapists, and the trial administrator could not be blinded to treatment allocation but the researchers who assessed and analysed outcomes remained blinded.

Although we also intended to compare booklet self management only with routine care, we did not specifically power the trial for this comparison because we assumed that booklet self management only might have a smaller effect size and thus a larger trial would be needed to reliably detect this.</p>

The primary analysis compared symptom scores from the vertigo symptom scale-short form at 12 weeks between patients randomised to booklet self management with telephone support and those randomised to routine care using analysis of covariance, adjusting for the symptom score at baseline (the stratification variable). We also evaluated all other continuous outcomes using analysis of covariance, adjusting for the level of the relevant outcome variable at baseline as well as baseline symptom score (the stratification variable). Binary group outcomes were compared using logistic regression, also adjusting for baseline symptom score. All these analyses were repeated for outcomes at one year. We did sensitivity analyses on the vertigo symptom scale-short form to adjust for differences in baseline measures and increase the number of participants available for analysis by replacing missing data using multiple imputation. The web appendix shows details of the sensitivity and per protocol analyses.</p>

                <p>The principal economic evaluation was a cost utility study using cost per QALY, derived from EQ-5D scores at 0, 12 weeks, and one year after randomisation. We also estimated the cost per point change in the primary outcome (that is, the vertigo symptom scale-short form). Since our analysis was limited to the one year of follow-up, neither costs nor benefits were discounted. The perspective of the analysis was that of the UKâs health service. Our base case results only included patients for whom we had complete data for QALY scores, dizziness related costs, and therapist costs. We used bootstrapping, with 5000 samples, to estimate costs, QALYs (adjusted for baseline EQ-5D scores), and change in the vertigo symptom scale-short form. If one intervention was more effective and more costly than another, we calculated an incremental cost effectiveness ratio.<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> We also used the 5000 bootstrapped samples to estimate cost effectiveness acceptability curves. These curves show the probability of each study group being the most cost effective option at different values of a QALY. We included EQ-5D for the purpose of comparative cost effectiveness analyses based on QALYs; the study was not powered to detect between group differences in EQ-5D, which was expected to be relatively insensitive to improvement in dizziness (web appendix). We did analyses using PASW version 18, and Excel for bootstrapping analyses.</p>

                <p>We randomised 337 participants; at 12 weeks, 276 (82%) completed the follow-up questionnaires, including the primary outcome, whereas 312 (93%) responded to the single item assessment of subjective improvement. At 12 months, 263 participants (78%) completed the follow-up questionnaires and 295 (88%) completed the single item assessment of subjective improvement. Figure 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/> shows the flow of participants through the trial. Of 5223 patients sent an invitation, most did not reply (3250, 62%); but among the 1461 (28%) who completed the refusal slip, a large proportion (1052, 72%) reported that they were no longer dizzy. Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/> shows participantsâ characteristics at baseline. We observed baseline differences between study groups for sex, age when leaving school, duration of dizziness, consultation with a healthcare professional in the past year, and number of patients exceeding the threshold for anxiety or depression on the hospital anxiety and depression scale. As a result, we adjusted our sensitivity analysis for these imbalances (web appendix).</p>

                <p>The first telephone support session was delivered to 82 (73%) participants in the telephone support group, and 66 (59%) received all three support sessions. There was good agreement between therapist checklist ratings of delivery of target intervention components and independent ratings based on recorded sessions (Îº=0.82). Checklists indicated that most of the core intervention components (mean 12.0 components of 15, standard deviation 1.62) and optional components (14.2 components of 24, 3.12) were delivered.</p>
                <p>Adherence to the full programme of exercises was reported by 49 (44%) participants randomised to booklet self management with telephone support and 38 (34%) randomised to booklet self management only. This difference in proportions was not significant (95% confidence interval â3% to 22%, P=0.119), but exploratory retrospective analyses showed that patients in the telephone support group reported carrying out the exercises at a greater intensity than those in the group receiving booklet self management only (web appendix). Half the patients in the booklet treatment groups (n=113) reported using the exercises at some point after the end of the initial 12 week treatment period, with a third (n=75) reporting repeated use.</p>

                <p>At 12 weeks, all groups showed some improvement in the vertigo symptom scale-short form (table 2<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"/>). The increased improvement seen in participants allocated to receive booklet self management with telephone support, compared with the routine care group, failed to reach statistical significance. However, this comparison was significant (P=0.041) in a sensitivity analysis that adjusted for differences in baseline measures and replaced missing data using multiple imputation (web appendix). By one year, both treatment groups showed greater improvement in scores on the vertigo symptom scale-short form than the routine care group (table 3<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"/>). </p>

                <p>Subjective improvement was also reported by a larger proportion of the treatment groups than the routine care group, at both 12 week and one year follow-up (tables 2 and 3). For the primary comparison between booklet self management with telephone support and routine care, the point estimate for the absolute difference of 22.0% (95% confidence interval 7.3% to 36.8%) indicated that five (three to 12) patients would need to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year. More detailed examination of the pattern of subjective improvement indicated that 57 (60%) of 95 patients randomised to booklet self management with telephone support reported feeling much better or completely well at one year, compared with 33 (33%) of 99 in the usual care group (fig 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>). Fewer patients in this group (five (5%) of 95) than in the usual care group (15 (15%) of 99) reported worse symptoms at one year follow-up; outcomes for the group allocated to receive booklet self management only were intermediate.</p>

                <p>At 12 weeks, compared with routine care, the group allocated to receive booklet self management with telephone support improved on the autonomic anxiety subscale of the vertigo symptom scale. At one year, both treatment groups showed improvement on the autonomic anxiety subscale compared with the routine care group. We saw no group differences on the vertigo balance subscale at either time point. Scores for the dizziness handicap inventory improved significantly in both treatment groups relative to routine care at one year follow-up, although not at 12 weeks. At one year (but not 12 weeks), scores on the hospital anxiety and depression scale improved in the patients randomised to booklet self management with telephone support, but only relative to routine care. As expected, we saw no significant group differences in EQ-5D scores. Retrospective exploratory analyses comparing the two treatment groups showed similar outcomes for almost all measures (table 10 in web appendix).</p>

In the routine care group, no adverse events were reported (adverse reactions were not applicable). Patients who received booklet self management only did not report any adverse events or serious adverse reactions. However, they did report some adverse reactions caused by the exercises: worsened migraines (n=1), leg pain while standing (n=1), and neck discomfort (n=2). The group that received booklet self management with telephone support also reported no adverse events or serious adverse reactions, although one participant fell after feeling dizzy from performing the exercises, breaking a foot bone.</p>

                <p>We had complete data for 236 patients for QALY, dizziness related healthcare use, and booklet and therapist related costs. One case was excluded as an outlier because of an inpatient stay related to dizziness; since this case occurred in the control group, we considered this exclusion a conservative assumption, because including this case would have increased the average cost and hence would have favoured the treatment groups. Total costs were similar for the routine care and active treatment groups (table 4<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4"/>). The intervention for booklet self management with telephone support incurred the highest cost.</p>

                <p>Owing to the group differences in EQ-5D scores at baseline, we presented results after controlling for this baseline characteristic. Both QALYs and point change on the vertigo symptom scale-short form showed increased effectiveness relative to routine care with both active interventions. Booklet self management with telephone support was the most cost effective. Compared with booklet self management only, the group with additional telephone support generated QALYs and point changes on the vertigo symptom scale-short form at Â£1363 (â¬1690; $2194) and Â£129, respectively. Figure 3<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"/> shows the cost effectiveness acceptability curve for the cost-QALY analysis; the routine care group rapidly became the least likely approach to be cost effective. At lower QALY values, booklet self management only was most likely to be cost effective, but the booklet approach with additional telephone support was the most likely to be cost effective at QALY values greater than about Â£1200.</p>

              <p>We hypothesised that in patients with chronic dizziness, those receiving booklet self management for vestibular rehabilitation exercises with telephone support would report fewer symptoms than those receiving routine care at 12 weeks. This primary comparison failed to reach significance, but by one year follow-up, patients allocated booklet self management (with or without telephone support) clearly improved relative to those allocated routine care, by reporting greater subjective improvement, fewer symptoms related to dizziness, and a reduced handicap related to dizziness. Cost effectiveness analyses confirmed that at one year follow-up, both booklet interventions were highly cost effective.</p>
              <p>Currently, there is poor access to vestibular rehabilitation in primary care, which can result in prolonged symptomatology, elevated levels of handicap, and ultimately expensive and unnecessary referrals to secondary care.<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

This intervention could reduce the number of patients who need referral to secondary care for more intensive investigation and managementâparticularly since only a small minority of patients with dizziness are willing to attend secondary care for testing and rehabilitation.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p>
              <sec>
                <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
                <p>This study was unique in two major respects. Firstly, it evaluated a new model of treatment provision for chronic dizziness, by means of booklet based management in primary care with or without remote expert telephone support, and we have shown this intervention to be an acceptable and effective method of managing dizziness. This study illustrates the potential of a model of support for patient self management of long term conditions that has not yet been widely investigated,<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> but could well prove suitable for other chronic or relapsing conditions.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we examined the cost effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation. We have established that it is a cost effective treatment when provided using our inexpensive method of booklet based self management in primary care. Even with additional telephone support, the cost per QALY of this approach was less than a tenth of the NHS threshold for willingness to pay.<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> No previous trial of vestibular rehabilitation in secondary care has evaluated the cost effectiveness of this method of delivery. However, in our study, provision of booklet self management with telephone support cost only Â£25 more than routine care, which compares favourably with an average total healthcare cost of Â£196 for a patient with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo referred to secondary care.<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>
                <p>Furthermore, this study was much more substantial and methodologically rigorous than most trials of vestibular rehabilitation in secondary care have been.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We achieved good follow-up rates over an extended period of time, and confirmed all healthcare costs objectively by inspecting medical records for every patient. Although we did not use objective measures of balance, we considered these measures unnecessary because our previous trials<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> confirmed that subjective improvement from booklet based vestibular rehabilitation was accompanied by an improvement in objective outcomes (that is, improved postural control). Therefore, the focus of this study was on the cost effectiveness of achieving patient reported benefit.</p>
                <p>A potential limitation of the study was its low uptake rate (&lt;10% of patients invited to participate). However, nearly three quarters of patients who gave a reason for non-participation stated that they were no longer dizzy. This reason could also have been true of most non-respondents, since an 18 month follow-up of patients with dizziness in the community found that less than half had continued to experience significant dizziness.<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The proportion of participants in this community survey who were willing to attend secondary care for testing and rehabilitation was also less than 10%.<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Clearly, it is those patients with more persistent and distressing symptoms in primary care who could value and benefit from the provision of vestibular rehabilitation. The cost of providing the booklet is negligible and hence could prove cost effective even if only a minority of patients benefit, but telephone support might be neither necessary nor cost effective to offer to patients when they first consult for acute dizziness.</p>
                <p>It was not possible to blind participants to the intervention group that they were in, and patients in the routine care group might have been less likely to report subjective improvement if they felt that they had not received active treatment. Non-specific psychological effects of treatment, such as reassurance and positive outcome expectations, probably contribute to outcome in patients with dizziness,<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and were explicitly maximised by our booklet. However, many trials have shown that improvement in subjective outcomes after vestibular rehabilitation is accompanied by improvements in objective measures of balance function,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and therefore cannot be attributed entirely to psychological effects. </p>
                <p>A strength of the study was that inclusion criteria were broad, and the findings might be generalisable to a wide range of patients with dizziness in primary care. A potential limitation was that precise diagnoses were not obtained, and therefore outcomes cannot be related to patient diagnosis. However, achieving a definitive diagnosis in primary care is not often possible,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and a precise diagnosis might be unnecessary in view of the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation for various causes.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

                <title>Explanations and implications</title>
                <p>Although we expected, on the basis of previous trials, that improvement due to the intervention would be sustained, we did not anticipate that the longer term benefit would be greater than the short term benefit. Nevertheless, there are plausible explanations for the sustained and even improved benefit occurred at one year follow-up. Some other studies have reported better outcomes at longer follow-up time points<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>
<xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> and have recommended that vestibular rehabilitation be carried out in the longer term. Self management techniques could provide a useful long term coping strategy for patients with chronic symptoms (including those with recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or with fluctuating symptoms due to migraine or MÃ©niÃ¨reâs disease<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>

<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>
<xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) and could reduce anxiety about symptom recurrence. In our study, the mean duration of symptoms at baseline was over five years, and half the sample continued to use the exercises after the initial 12 week treatment period, consistent with a pattern of sustained management of chronic dizziness.</p>
                <p>The interventions clearly had psychological benefits, particularly the telephone support intervention, which resulted in considerable decreases in both anxiety and depression at one year follow-up. Strong evidence indicates that anxiety about symptoms has an important role in perpetuating handicap and distress in patients with dizziness, even if a vestibular rather than psychiatric origin for the dizziness is confirmed.<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>
<xref rid="ref69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
<xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> Shared, central neurological pathways might explain the commonly observed association between dizziness, anxiety, and migraine;<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>
<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> therefore, interventions should address the perpetuation and augmentation of symptoms by anxiety.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> Our vestibular rehabilitation package was designed to reduce anxiety by reassuring patients that their symptoms were benign, tolerable, and controllable, as well as create safe opportunities to habituate to them gradually.<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
                <p>Some inconclusive results indicated that expert telephone support might be more effective than self management for some patients. The group with additional telephone support had higher adherence to the exercises, significant improvement in anxiety and depression, and a higher probability of being the most cost effective treatment (except at low QALY values). Nevertheless, the differences between treatment groups were marginal and mainly not significant. Further research should establish the optimal level and mode of therapist support,<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref> which might vary for different subgroups of patients (more than a quarter of our participants did not take up the telephone support offered), and compare the effectiveness of support provided by different groups of health professionals (for example, audiologists, physiotherapists, or trained practice nurses).</p>

                <title>Conclusions and practice implications</title>
                <p>This trial has shown two simple and cost effective means of managing chronic dizziness in primary care for a group of patients who are currently very poorly served. At a minimum, the simple provision of a booklet explaining to patients how to self manage their symptoms using vestibular rehabilitation exercises seems to have lasting benefits, without incurring any additional resource use relative to routine care. This approach seems to benefit a substantial proportion of patients with chronic dizziness that is aggravated by head movement, in whom a non-vestibular cause has been excluded. To enhance the effects of this intervention, telephone support from a suitably trained therapist might be useful for patients who need and want the additional support. Although telephone support is a little more costly, the enhanced approach is highly cost effective, and would not be difficult to implement within the health service.</p>
