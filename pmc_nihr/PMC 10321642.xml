              <abstract>
                <p>Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available (e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged ≥16-years with an existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms (trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a self-guided app-based intervention—‘Molehill Mountain’. Primary (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary outcome measures and survey/ interview)–with both objectives further informed by a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition, characterised by core features of social communication/ social imagination difficulties, restricted and repetitive behaviours, and sensory processing differences, with a prevalence of approximately 1% [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Up to 50% of autistic people experience clinically relevant co-occurring anxiety by adulthood according to current estimates [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]–though true rates may be higher, given the known diagnostic challenges for identifying anxiety in the autistic population (e.g., diagnostic overshadowing, variability of anxiety presentation, lack of validated autism-specific assessment tools; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). This is important, since anxiety can have a significant impact on the lives of autistic people, including contributing to reduced quality of life and difficulties with daily functioning (e.g., at school or work), over and above core autism features [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that reduce anxiety has been indicated as a key priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, there are currently very few evidence-based intervention approaches available to support autistic people in managing anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In terms of pharmacological approaches, risperidone and aripiprazole are the only medications approved by regulators (European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration) for use in autism–but neither target anxiety (they both treat irritability) and both carry risk of unwanted side effects (e.g., fatigue, weight gain; please see [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram) are specifically recommended to treat anxiety, but evidence for their efficacy is largely based on research in typically developing groups [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is of concern because though pharmacological approaches are effective in reducing anxiety for some autistic people (e.g., see [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), autistic people are also at heightened risk of adverse side effects (including hyperactivity/ impulsivity, stereotypy, and insomnia; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). Furthermore, recent research has shown that the neurological response to serotonin-acting drugs in autistic people is very different to that of non-autistic people [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, evidence for the use of current pharmacological anxiety treatments that were developed in neurotypical populations, by autistic people, is very limited.</p>
              <p>It is also increasingly acknowledged that social and environmental factors disproportionately experienced by autistic people, such as exposure to societal stigma (and subsequent ‘masking’ of autism features) and overloading sensory environments, cause anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and interventions targeted at reducing social inequalities (e.g., Access to Work schemes; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) can thus have a supportive effect in reducing anxiety. In parallel, psychological/ psychosocial approaches that incorporate a focus on individual coping strategies for managing some of the social/ environmental contexts implicated in anxiety, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), are the most widely supported emerging evidence-based therapy for anxiety management in autism [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, sensory processing differences, alexithymia (difficulties identifying/ describing emotions), emotion dysregulation, and cognitive biases (e.g., intolerance of uncertainty, reduced cognitive flexibility) have all been implicated in anxiety in autism [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; and thus, implementing strategies directly targeting these causal/ maintenance factors may be critical for effective autism-adapted therapeutic approaches.</p>
              <p>Meta-analyses assessing the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety in autistic young people and adults have consistently reported moderate-to-large effect sizes for clinician-rated improvement pre- to post-intervention [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although these effects are encouraging, there is growing evidence that CBT <italic toggle="yes">needs</italic> to be tailored using autism-specific modifications to be more accessible and effective for autistic people [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Modifications may include a more concrete and structured approach to sessions in favour of excessive metaphor and hypotheticals (particularly around identifying and describing emotions), allowing for more processing time through regular breaks, and incorporating autistic strengths like special interests into the therapy to promote engagement [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These approaches should also acknowledge that the autistic experience (and presentation/ underpinning mechanisms) of anxiety may differ from the non-autistic experience in some respects, including heightened intolerance of uncertainty/ change and anxieties particularly linked to social and/ or sensory stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, studies directly comparing the impact of adapted vs. standard of practice CBT have identified stronger effects of adapted approaches on anxiety reduction in autistic groups [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, access to adapted CBT for autistic people remains limited in everyday clinical practice. This is partly due to severe pressures on health and social care services (exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), which means that resources are predominantly focused on acute mental health provision and so autistic people experiencing long-term mild-to-moderate anxiety often do not meet thresholds to access support (or face long wait times), despite the high impact of anxiety on their daily lives. There is also a lack of available training and support for therapists already delivering adapted CBT approaches [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, many mental health interventions are embedded in traditional ‘face to face’ clinic services (and increasingly now, telephone appointments) where it is known that autistic people experience barriers to access. These barriers include individual differences in communication needs and feeling misunderstood by healthcare providers–both resulting in feelings of reduced autonomy over care by the service user–as well as difficulties with transitions (e.g., changes in practitioner and/ or service) and sensory difficulties in the clinic environment [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Of note, all these factors may be exacerbated by the pre-existing anxiety that the individual is attending clinic services to target (see also [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).</p>
              <p>Novel digital approaches for delivering support and intervention, including app-based technologies, may address some of the challenges outlined above. Additionally, though digital tools should not be viewed as a replacement for in-person services, they may perform an important complementary role, in a way that is: a) (cost)-effective, with app-based interventions having potential to reduce waiting times to early support, including for those awaiting an autism diagnosis or who are self-diagnosed [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; b) timely, for both the clinic team and service user who can utilise an app-based intervention flexibly at any time and in any place; and c) readily available, with a high proportion of autistic people (especially adolescents and young adults) estimated to have access to a Smart device in the UK context [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. There is already a wide range of freely available mental health apps that meet Organisation for the Review of Health and Care Apps (ORCHA) digital health quality standards (e.g., SilverCloud; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), but none are specifically adapted for autistic people. In fact, we identified just one existing study of an app-based CBT program targeted to supporting autistic people to manage anxiety (‘HARU ASD’; available in Korean only), which demonstrated a significant decline in self-reported anxiety for those who used the app over 66 days <italic toggle="yes">(N</italic> = 15<italic toggle="yes">)</italic>, as compared to a waitlist control group (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 15) in a small community sample [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Thus, despite the potential of digital tools for use in mental health service delivery (please see [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]), there is a striking lack of research on the most inclusive, appropriate, and effective methods for implementing these tools [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
              <p>To address this unmet need, the current paper details the protocol for a feasibility study and non-randomised pilot trial of a novel app-based therapeutic approach (‘Molehill Mountain’) that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. The two overarching objectives for this feasibility study are: 1) to establish the acceptability/ useability and feasibility of the Molehill Mountain app in a real-world clinic setting; and 2) to establish the target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention to inform the design of a future randomised-controlled trial of Molehill Mountain.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>As this is a pilot study, we considered approximately 100 participants to be both a pragmatic (in terms of recruitment/ onboarding rate) and sufficient sample size to examine key feasibility targets—such as, establishing the proportion of those eligible who consent to take part, the proportion of participants who continue to use the app across the 13-week intervention period (and variation in app usage within this), and the proportion who complete each outcome measure at each timepoint (please see [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]).</p>
                <p>In further support of the proposed sample size, an indicative <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> power analysis using G*Power version 3.1.9.7 [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] demonstrated that a sample size of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 100 would achieve 80% power to detect a small effect size (0.11) at a significance criterion of α = .05 for a repeated measures ANOVA (within subjects). This would allow for the detection of small pre/post effects of intervention on the primary/ secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p>Participants will be recruited to this study from outpatient clinic services, existing research databases at King’s College London, and public advertising, all in the UK. To be included in the study, participants must have an existing autism diagnosis, be aged 16-years or above (to align with initial community validation of the app in ages 16+ and for the purposes of informed consent provided by participants), be experiencing mild-to-severe anxiety symptoms (as indicated by a score of at least 5 or above on the GAD-7 during screening), be able and willing to provide verbal and written informed consent to take part in the study, be fluent in verbal/ written English for the purposes of engaging with app materials (including with a support person), and be able and willing to use the mobile phone app. Recruitment to the study opened in September 2022 and is currently anticipated to close by June 2023, dependent on rate of participant onboarding.

                <p>Molehill Mountain consists of six key components to support app users to become more aware of the triggers and protective factors associated with their anxiety and begin to incorporate strategies to manage anxiety. These key components include: 1) reporting on daily anxiety and activities (e.g., how anxious the person has felt today, what they did, and what they have been worried about; <xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>); 2) an in-depth daily diary of experiences and emotions (<xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>); 3) a progress tracker (e.g., of anxiety over time, changes in worries over time, app usage; <xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>); 4) low-intensity anxiety management exercises (e.g., breathing and relaxation techniques; <xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>); 5) tips and tools for better understanding and better managing anxiety (based on adapted CBT principles of managing interconnected negative internal thoughts/ emotions, physical sensations and external situations/ actions; <xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>); and 6) signposting for emergency support (<xref rid="pone.0286792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>).</p>
                <p>Specific adaptations relevant to autism are embedded in the ‘tips and tools’ app component, each of which are sequentially unlocked with use of the app over time. These include, for example, psychoeducation on the triggers, presentation, and experiences of anxiety in autistic people and how these might differ from non-autistic populations, a focus on the physical sensations that may accompany emotions, a focus on alexithymia and emotional literacy, a focus on generalisation of strategies across situations and contexts, and a specific sensory and social anxiety branch. In addition, the mindfulness/ relaxation breathing exercises in the app are accompanied by visual aids.</p>
                <p>The Molehill Mountain programme is designed to last up to 3-months, with participants invited to utilise the app daily (i.e., up to once per day, if possible). On first use, app users are prompted to set up a password protected account/ profile to access the app. The daily ‘Check In’ function allows participants to rate their anxiety level today (from ‘Not anxious’ to ‘Very anxious’), record worries and activities, and add to their daily diary. Nevertheless, the intervention is self-guided by the participant, who will have complete autonomy over when, where, and for how long they engage with the app–also representing a key indicator of app acceptability.</p>

                <sec id="sec007">
                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome in this study will be anxiety symptom severity, as assessed using the self-report 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]); and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). The GAD-7 and HADS were chosen as they are two widely used anxiety assessment tools in UK clinic services for the target population.</p>
                  <p>The GAD-7 has been reported to be reliable and valid in the general population, with excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.92), good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation = 0.83) and maximal sensitivity/ specificity at a cut-off score of 10 or above–higher scores representing higher anxiety severity [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The HADS has also been shown to be reliable and valid for anxiety (and depression) assessment, including in autistic populations where recent reports suggest good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.83) and convergence with other validated measures of anxiety–again, with higher scores representing more anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec008">
                  <title>Secondary outcome</title>
                  <p>The secondary outcomes (also assessed at baseline, endpoint, follow ups 1–3) include individualised functional outcome, as assessed via self-report Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS; S1 Material in <xref rid="pone.0286792.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>; see also [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]) and assessment of medication/ service use.</p>
                  <p>The GAS utilised in this study was developed with the Molehill Mountain Advisory Group, whereby common anxieties associated with autism were discussed, formulated as personal goal statements, and then refined down to a final list of 20 goal statements (from an initial list of 38). Thus, GAS allows for each participant to select their own personal goals (a maximum of 4 goals in this study) to be achieved over the course of intervention, while the scoring of the importance of, and progress toward, each goal is standardised to support statistical interpretation. The GAS was included in this study, as its individualised nature and focus on daily functioning may be more sensitive in reflecting subtle (and significant) functional improvements with positive impact on wellbeing in response to intervention than symptom scales like the GAD-7/ HADS. For instance, it is possible that an individual may continue to <italic toggle="yes">feel</italic> anxious, while objectively being more able to engage in everyday activities (e.g., travelling on public transport), as they begin to employ more successful coping strategies for managing those anxious feelings. This is important, since subjective indices of wellbeing in everyday life are known to be meaningful to autistic people yet are a severely underrepresented as outcome measures in intervention research (likely in part due to challenges around standardisation; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0286792.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]).</p>
                  <p>Regarding medication and service use, we ask participants to report whether they are currently taking any medications or dietary supplements (name, dose, start/ end date, purpose), or are involved in any therapies or other interventions (name/ type, hours received, start/ end date, purpose). The purpose of this measure is to both differentiate potential effects of app use from other interventions and to establish whether app use interacts with other services in any way (e.g., means people use medications/ services more or less at endpoint than before they started using the app).</p>
                  <p>Lastly, self-reported autistic traits will be integrated into the baseline survey to characterise the sample and for use as a covariate to ascertain whether potential changes in anxiety over the course of intervention are associated with autistic features at baseline. Two existing validated measures of autistic traits are included, as preferred by the Molehill Mountain Advisory Group: the Adult Routines Inventory-Revised (ARI-R; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CAT-I; [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]).</p>

                  <title>App acceptability/ feasibility</title>
                  <p>Last, a main objective of this study is to establish the acceptability and feasibility of the Molehill Mountain app in a real-world clinic setting for future app optimisation. Thus, we will seek participant consent to download app usage data (and participants can further adjust their privacy and sharing preferences directly in the app itself via Settings). In addition, we will administer an in-depth app use experience survey (all participants) and conduct semi-structured qualitative app use experience interviews (subsample of participants). The structure and questions of these measures to gauge app user experience are being designed with the Molehill Mountain Advisory group.</p>
                  <p>Both approaches provide key indicators of 1) the association between variation in app usage and primary/ secondary outcomes (i.e., the impact of frequency/ duration/ nature of app use on outcomes); 2) reflections on the subjective impact of app use on anxiety and everyday functioning; 3) ease of app administration and use; 4) preferred/ non-preferred app features, content and structure; 5) app technical functionality; and 6) feedback to inform the design of a future randomised-controlled trial (e.g., preparedness of participants to be randomised).</p>
                  <p>App experience surveys/ interviews will be tailored, according to whether: a) the participant was offered the app but declined, to establish reasons for decline; b) the participant started the app but stopped using it after only a brief time, to establish reasons for loss of engagement (which could also include reduction in anxiety i.e., participants may specifically choose to use the app when feeling more anxious); or c) the participant started and continued to use the app, to establish factors associated with continued engagement.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>Full study procedures are provided in detail in the study protocol, which is also accessible via clinicaltrials.gov (Version 2, 18.08.2022; please see S2 Material in <xref rid="pone.0286792.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) and will be updated in the case of important protocol modifications.</p>
                <p>For participants recruited through outpatient clinics, clinic teams will identify prospective participants who have consented to be contacted about research and may be eligible and will send them information about the study. In parallel, the research team will coordinate recruitment externally from the clinic (e.g., via existing mailing lists, public advertisements). Subsequently, prospective participants who express interest in taking part in the study will be invited to contact the research team directly, who will provide further information (including the participant information sheet) and arrange/ conduct eligibility screening with those who express interest in taking part.</p>
                <p>Screening will be conducted by the research team via the participants’ preferred mode of communication (e.g., telephone, video call, live chat, email). Firstly, the researcher will check whether participants have the capacity to consent to taking part in the research (e.g., "Can you explain to me what you will be doing in this study?"), answer any questions about the study, and confirm that the prospective participant is comfortable to take part in each study component (e.g., filling questionnaires, using the app). Next, the researcher will ask questions relating to the inclusion/ exclusion criteria, including confirming participant age, existing autism diagnosis, any recent therapy/ medications, access to a device in order to use the app, and current anxiety according to the GAD-7. Eligible participants who wish to take part will be enrolled into the study (Week 0) and sent the consent form to complete and return online (via Qualtrics/ email) or by post. Participants who are not eligible or who decline to take part at this stage will be invited to complete a short exit survey online via Qualtrics (or the participants’ preferred communication method e.g., pen-and-paper, email, telephone), or interview (for a randomly selected subsample of participants who consent to this) including questions about demographics and reasons for decline (if applicable).</p>
                <p>Enrolled and consented participants will complete a baseline assessment administered by the research team using Qualtrics (or the participants’ preferred communication method), including questions about demographics, autistic traits, and primary and secondary outcomes (HADS, GAS, medication/ service use; Week 2 +/- 2). The GAD-7 will have already been collected at screening to ascertain eligibility for the study based on mild-to-severe anxiety symptom severity. Following the baseline assessment, the research team will support participants to download and initiate the Molehill Mountain app.</p>
                <p>Next, participants will undergo a 3-month intervention period engaging with the Molehill Mountain app (Weeks 2–15 +/- 2). The research team will check in with participants at 8-weeks to ensure there are no outstanding queries or concerns from participants and monitor engagement and any adverse events.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 3-month intervention period, participants will complete an endpoint assessment administered by the research team using Qualtrics (or the participants’ preferred communication method), including primary and secondary outcomes (GAD-7, HADS, GAS, medication/ service use; Week 15 +/- 2). At this stage, participants will also be sent a post-study app use experience survey, or interview for a randomly selected subsample of participants who consent. The endpoint survey/ interview was co-designed with the Molehill Mountain Advisory Group and includes questions about app usage and preferences, self-reported impact of the app on anxiety and related experiences, and experiences of taking part in the research study. Participants who discontinue the intervention prior to Week 15 will be asked whether they consent to complete the endpoint assessment early.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the live semi-structured interview component, which will be conducted by the research team in person or remotely, is to gather rich detail on the reasons underlying participant responses to the app use experience survey. Interviews will be conducted with a randomly selected subsample of participants who consent to this–initially 10 participants from each subgroup detailed above (participant declined app, participant stopped app after brief time, participant continued with app). If data saturation has not been reached, interviews will continue in multiples of 3 per subgroup until such time saturation is reached, or the sample for that subgroup exceeds the maximally optimal figure of approximately 30 participants (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]).</p>
                <p>Finally, participants will be invited to take part in three follow-up assessments (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4) where primary and secondary outcomes will be reassessed (GAD-7, HADS, GAS, medication/ service use).</p>
                <p>The study is designed to maximise accessibility—all parts are designed to be completed remotely as far as possible (e.g., online, by telephone, email, or by post) and preferred communication will be agreed with each participant at enrolment.</p>

                  <p>All research data provided by participants will be pseudonymised prior to analyses by the research team to ensure confidentiality. Data quality (also including format of measure administration, date/ time of administration, confirmation of data completeness, researcher rated data quality and comments, any other relevant study details, participant withdrawal record) will be recorded in the participant electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and checked by the research team against Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and scoring manuals for each measure. In any cases where data are scored manually (e.g., paper-and-pencil questionnaires), the research team will double code and double enter the data.</p>
                  <p>It is intended that the results of the study will be reported and disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Fully anonymised/ summary data will be posted in clinical trial registries and/ or open science repositories at the end of the study, only for participants who consent to this.

                  <title>Statistical analysis plan</title>
                  <p>A statistical analysis plan (SAP), co-designed with the Molehill Mountain Advisory Group, will be pre-registered prior to undertaking any inferential statistical analysis. All statistical analysis will be run using R. We will express results in effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals for all analyses to support interpretation. To handle cases of missing data, we will impute the (sub)scale score where no more than 20% of the data for that (sub)scale is missing, otherwise we will exclude the data point from analysis.</p>
                  <p>Results of analyses will be reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines extension for non-randomised trial design. Specifically, details of participant flow and recruitment will be reported, including the number of participants declined/ enrolled, receiving the intervention, analysed on primary/ secondary outcome(s), and losses/ exclusions. Important adverse events (AEs) will also be reported in an anonymised fashion (please see ‘monitoring and adverse events’ section below).</p>
                  <p>As this is a feasibility study, we will primarily elicit descriptive statistics (e.g., Mean, Standard Deviation, Range of responses) of participant demographics (baseline) and primary/ secondary outcome measures (baseline, endpoint, follow ups 1–3)—also demonstrating stability and/ or change in anxiety and related features over the course of intervention. We will assess the performance of our primary outcome measures (GAD-7/ HADS) and establish the impact of app use on change in our outcome measures using repeated measures ANOVA (within subjects). This will also inform the design (e.g., optimal outcome measure) for a future randomised-controlled trial and establish the optimal timing for endpoint/ follow-up assessments and interpretation of clinically meaningful reduction in anxiety, based on relationships between the GAD-7/ HADS and secondary outcome measures (GAS, medication/ service use).</p>
                  <p>Relationships between demographic factors (e.g., age, sex/ gender), autistic traits, objective app usage data, and primary/ secondary outcomes will be explored using simple correlations/ Chi-square to ascertain whether any additional covariates should be included in core analyses and/ or whether exploratory subgroup analyses should be performed. If there is sufficient range in the degree of baseline anxiety (e.g., mild vs. moderate/severe anxiety), we will also explore the impact of baseline anxiety on degree of improvement, covarying for other relevant factors. For instance, we predict that those with milder anxiety may benefit more from the app than those with more severe anxiety (due to their higher support needs).</p>
                  <p>Subjective app use experiences collected through app use experience surveys/ interviews will also be reported, including anonymised direct quotations from participants who consent. For qualitative data from interviews, thematic analysis will be performed via NVivo, using Braun and Clarke’s six-step method [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This paper describes one of the first ever acceptability/ feasibility study of an active app-based anxiety intervention (‘Molehill Mountain’), developed specifically for autistic people using NICE recommended adapted CBT approaches, and employing a participatory research design. This study will provide early-stage proof-of-concept for the preliminary effectiveness of app use on anxiety and related functional outcomes. Furthermore, objective app usage data and subjective app use experience surveys/ interviews will enable us to identify critical areas for further app optimisation–building an evidence-base to inform the design and implementation of a full-scale randomised-controlled trial.</p>
              <p>Future trial design will be developed in co-production with the Molehill Mountain stakeholder advisory group to ensure that the work and its outputs responds to the priorities of the autistic community. For instance, while the selected primary outcome measures (GAD-7, HADS) are currently among the most commonly used in primary and secondary mental health services, the extent to which they capture anxiety features as experienced by autistic people remains unclear. This is because already validated anxiety scales were developed with reference to the general population (though see [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] for initial validation results of the first anxiety measure adapted for autistic adults), however existing research suggests that many autistic people present with anxiety features that fall outside of traditional diagnostic criteria for anxiety. These diverse anxiety features include social anxieties without fear of negative social evaluation, specific phobias of so-called ‘unusual’ focus or of a sensory nature (e.g., a specific fear of people with beards, or hand dryers), anxiety focused on unknown or non-routine events, and anxieties of a ritualistic nature (e.g., all plug switches must be turned off) in the absence of intrusive thoughts or avoidance of a dreaded situation that would be indicative of obsessive-compulsive disorder [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, one key area of impact of the Molehill Mountain advisory group will be to establish the suitability of primary outcomes and their potential alternatives (if applicable), including emerging autism specific anxiety measures like the Anxiety Scale for Autism–Adults [<xref rid="pone.0286792.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
              <p>Through the approaches outlined here, the ultimate goal of this work is to better understand for whom an app-based support will most likely be most effective, as a first step to providing more personalised, evidence-based digital therapeutic tools to support some autistic people (particularly those who may find it most challenging to access existing in-person services) to manage anxiety symptoms.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Oakley,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Mar 23 2023 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>

              <p>Dear Authors,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting this manuscript for review. The topic is interesting and the protocol addresses a gap in the literature.</p>
              <p>However, I have some concerns about the protocol.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>1) Please elaborate on the main sources/reasons of anxiety in individuals with autism.</p>
              <p>Materials and methods</p>
              <p>1) The sample size calculation is unclear and there is no reference support. Please explain in details.</p>
              <p>2) Like 158: How to determine mild to severe anxiety?</p>
              <p>3) Please elaborate on the content and technical aspects of the mobile application (? password required/ Andriod or IOS/ layout).</p>
              <p>4) Please detail how the outcome measures will be evaluated (? In-app survey).</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>

              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses.

              <p>Reviewer #1: The study aims to establish the acceptability/ useability and feasibility of the Molehill Mountain app in a real-world clinic setting; and to establish the target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention to inform the design of a future randomised-controlled trial of Molehill Mountain.</p>
              <p>This study is quite interesting, however, the manuscript requires improvement.</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>Line 139 – 141, the statement ‘To address this unmet need, the current paper details the protocol for a feasibility study and single-arm pilot trial of a novel app-based therapeutic approach (‘Molehill Mountain’) that has been developed with’ requires revision and to align with the title.</p>
              <p>Materials and methods</p>
              <p>The location to conduct the study, recruitment, and study design employed is to be stated.</p>
              <p>Sample size calculation</p>
              <p>Line 152, the sample size calculation is unclear and requires more information e.g. to include/state clearly alpha 0.05, one-tailed or two-tailed test, the outcome variable used, and include the word effect size.</p>
              <p>Outcome measures</p>
              <p>Line 207-244, Line 245-251, Line 250-251, Line 294, Line 309-302, it is not clear how the inventories/questionnaires will be administered. How the inventories/questionnaires (self-report) will be given to subjects and how the participant completed the questionnaires/assessment in the study is to be clearly stated.</p>
              <p>It would be good to provide an outline of the final sample questionnaire/survey looks like when incorporating various questionnaires/questions that the participants will be receiving and indicate how long it will take for the participants to complete the questionnaire altogether.</p>
              <p>Procedure</p>
              <p>Line 273, 278, Line 301, more information on the screening process conducted, how the consent is obtained, how the subjects/participants will be invited and the method of the exit survey will be carried out is to be stated.</p>
              <p>Data quality and management</p>
              <p>Line 306, full name for CRF to be stated e.g. Case Report Form. The monitoring data quality is to be stated.</p>
              <p>Statistical analysis plan</p>
              <p>Line 320, 327, 330, 332, the sentence requires revision.</p>
              <p>A preliminary possible statistical test could be proposed in the analyses.</p>
              <p>Line 344, [50] to be placed after the word method.</p>
              <p>Line 346, apart from what were mentioned in the statistical analyses plan, information such as the method to conduct semi-structured interviews, the software to run the statistical analysis and qualitative analysis (if any), the level of accepted statistical significance, correction method (if any), missing data/handling, effect size, 95% CI etc to be stated.</p>
              <p>Figure 1, it would be good to add the mode of administration and how the assessment is done for those items highlighted and denoted in the footnote e.g. email, in-person, online etc</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a very exciting topic in a much-needed area of clinical research for this population.</p>
              <p>Participants:</p>
              <p>• The inclusion criteria are noted to include age, be experiencing anxiety, providing consent, English language fluency, and ability to use a mobile phone app, but there is no information regarding diagnostic status. Earlier in the introduction, it was noted that digital tools can be helpful for those waiting to receive a diagnosis or who are self-diagnosed. How is ASD diagnostic status confirmed or is it by self-report? Is participation based on presence of autistic traits, which are known to be commonly observed in the general population of individuals without an ASD diagnosis (please see Sasson &amp; Bottema-Beutel, 2022 "Studies of autistic traits in the general population are not studies of autism")? As recruitment is through public advertising or outpatient clinic services which may include individuals without an ASD diagnosis, how can the results be interpreted or related to autistic individuals? Could it just be that these ASD-specific modifications and digital app presentation are good for CBT in general and beneficial to anyone, not specifically those with ASD if diagnostic status is not confirmed?</p>
              <p>• While the exclusion criteria include things such as recent participation in CBT and recent psychotropic medication use at the start of the study, is there any data being collected from participants as they may start therapy or medication (or other supportive services) while using this app as that may also have an impact on interpretation of results?</p>
              <p>Intervention:</p>
              <p>• I was unable to find the “evidence-based adapted CBT principles” on the website provided. Please include those references in this manuscript as they provide the critical foundation upon which this app and its specific application for autistic individuals rests and is not provided. It is difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of the modifications and specificity to this population without knowing which evidence-based CBT principles are included in the app or the ASD-specific modifications (and support for them – unless you are referring to those in references 26-29). CBT may have many elements and it is difficult to know which ones are included in the app to evaluate the data and intervention effectiveness.</p>

              <p>Response to Editor Comments</p>
              <p>1. Introduction </p>
              <p>1) Please elaborate on the main sources/reasons of anxiety in individuals with autism.</p>
              <p>We agree that the candidate causal/ maintenance factors associated with anxiety in autism are important to address, given that several of these factors should represent key targets for intervention to reduce anxiety. </p>
              <p>Further evidence is required to elucidate the underpinning mechanisms for anxiety in autism and how they overlap and/or are distinct from those identified in non-autistic populations (acknowledged in new brief addition in brackets on Page 7, Line 118). Nevertheless, existing research would suggest that these mechanisms are multifaceted and include not only genetic/ neurobiological (e.g., autonomic dysregulation due to chronic stress – beyond the scope of this paper, but briefly now referenced on Page 6, Line 98), but also social/ environmental factors (e.g., stigma, social and sensory environmental pressures).</p>
              <p>In our resubmitted manuscript, we have particularly focused on adding an overview of factors implicated in anxiety in autism that are also incorporated into the app-based intervention used for this study (and as potentially useful additions to CBT and related approaches more broadly) and thus directly linked to the current research. These include, sensory processing differences, alexithymia (difficulties identifying/ describing emotions), emotion dysregulation, and cognitive biases (e.g., intolerance of uncertainty, reduced cognitive flexibility; please see Page 6, Lines 103-108) – experienced at higher rates in autistic, as compared to non-autistic, populations.</p>
              <p>2. Materials and methods</p>
              <p>1) The sample size calculation is unclear and there is no reference support. Please explain in details.</p>
              <p>As our study is a feasibility study, we based our original sample size on practicality/ feasibility for a 12-month recruitment window, and our best estimate of the available target participant pool (i.e., those on the waitlist) in local mental health services – following guidance on the sample size for pilot study designs as in Leon et al (2011; 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.10.008). This was to allow us to address key study feasibility targets, such as proportion who are eligible and consent, proportion who use the app over 13-weeks and complete outcome measures, ease of app administration and use, preferred and non-preferred app features, content, and structure, subjective reflections on the impact of app use on anxiety and everyday wellbeing/ functioning, and preparedness of participants to be randomised in a future trial.</p>
              <p>Following the recommendations of the Editors and Reviewers, we now also provide an indicative sample size calculation to further support our approach. We have updated this in the manuscript accordingly (Page 9, Line 175-185).</p>
              <p>Reflecting on the combination of guidance on pilot study sample size estimates, and the power calculation provided, we have revised our target sample size to approximately 100 participants.</p>
              <p>3. 2) Like 158: How to determine mild to severe anxiety?</p>
              <p>We have now specified that we establish this inclusion criteria as indicated by a score of at least 5 or above on the GAD-7 during screening (please see Page 10, Line 191-192) and we provide specifiers for all bands (mild, moderate severe) of the GAD-7 scoring cutoffs (please see Page 13, Lines 273-274) to provide more context on this use of the tool for the reader.</p>
              <p>3. 3) Please elaborate on the content and technical aspects of the mobile application (? password required/ Andriod or IOS/ layout).</p>
              <p>We agree that it would be helpful to the reader to provide some more detail on the content and technical aspects of the app. We now confirm in the main text of the manuscript that the app is compatible with both iOS and Android (please see Page 11, Line 228), that the app is accessed through a password protected individual user account/ profile (please see Page 12, Lines 257-258), that participants can adjust their privacy and sharing preferences directly in the app under Settings (please see Page 15, Lines 315-316), and more detail about the daily ‘Check In’ function (please see Page 12, Lines 257-260).</p>
              <p>Further technical details and development information about the app are provided on the Autistica website (Molehill Mountain | Autistica), which we also reference in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>4. 4) Please detail how the outcome measures will be evaluated (? In-app survey).</p>
              <p>We clarify this by adding that the baseline/ endpoint and follow up assessments (which incorporate the outcome measures used in this study) are administered by the research team via Qualtrics (please see Page 10, Figure 1 Legend; Page 16 Lines 353-354 and 355-356, 360; Page 17 Line 371), or the participants’ preferred communication method to enhance inclusivity of the study design (e.g., via email, post, over the telephone).</p>
              <p>Response to Reviewer Comments</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 Comments and Author Response: </p>
              <p>1. Introduction</p>
              <p>Line 139 – 141, the statement ‘To address this unmet need, the current paper details the protocol for a feasibility study and single-arm pilot trial of a novel app-based therapeutic approach (‘Molehill Mountain’) that has been developed with’ requires revision and to align with the title.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for flagging this discrepancy and have updated this statement in the Introduction accordingly to align with the title (please see Page 8, Lines 158-159).</p>
              <p>2. Materials and methods</p>
              <p>The location to conduct the study, recruitment, and study design employed is to be stated.</p>
              <p>Following the reviewers’ recommendation, we have added a new ‘Design’ section to the Materials and methods (please see Page 9, Lines 169-173), which also details the primary study location. Further details are also provided regarding recruitment locations on Page 9, Lines 186-187.</p>
              <p>3. Sample size calculation</p>
              <p>Line 152, the sample size calculation is unclear and requires more information e.g. to include/state clearly alpha 0.05, one-tailed or two-tailed test, the outcome variable used, and include the word effect size.</p>
              <p>We apologise for the lack of clarity on the sample size previously provided and have updated this section in the manuscript accordingly (Page 9, Line 175-185). For a full explanation, please see response to Editor Comments, comment and response #2, above.</p>
              <p>4. Outcome measures</p>
              <p>Line 207-244, Line 245-251, Line 250-251, Line 294, Line 309-302, it is not clear how the inventories/questionnaires will be administered. How the inventories/questionnaires (self-report) will be given to subjects and how the participant completed the questionnaires/assessment in the study is to be clearly stated.</p>
              <p>As also noted in response to Editor Comments, comment and response #4, we now clarify this by adding that the baseline/ endpoint and follow up assessments (which incorporate the outcome measures used in this study) are administered by the research team via Qualtrics (please see Page 10, Figure 1 Legend; Page 16 Lines 353-354 and 355-356, 360; Page 17 Line 371), or the participants’ preferred communication method to enhance inclusivity of the study design (e.g., via email, post, over the telephone).</p>
              <p>5. It would be good to provide an outline of the final sample questionnaire/survey looks like when incorporating various questionnaires/questions that the participants will be receiving and indicate how long it will take for the participants to complete the questionnaire altogether.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to provide an indication of how long it will take to complete the survey components of the study and we have now added this information into Figure 1, where we provide a full summary of which questionnaires are included per survey/ timepoint. </p>
              <p>6. Procedure</p>
              <p>Line 273, 278, Line 301, more information on the screening process conducted, how the consent is obtained, how the subjects/participants will be invited and the method of the exit survey will be carried out is to be stated.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer that more details and context would be helpful for the reader in the Procedures section and make the order of events in the study clearer. We therefore provide additional information regarding inviting participants (please see Page 16, Lines 336-338, 340-343), the screening process (please see Page 16, Lines 344-352), obtaining consent (please see Page 16, Lines 352-354), and exit survey administration (please see Page 16, Lines 354-358 and Figure 1 legend).</p>
              <p>7. Data quality and management</p>
              <p>Line 306, full name for CRF to be stated e.g. Case Report Form. The monitoring data quality is to be stated.</p>
              <p>We apologise for this oversight and have now corrected the acronym to the full term (please see Page 18, Line 401) and further detail added to this section (Page 18, Lines 398-401).</p>
              <p>8. Statistical analysis plan</p>
              <p>Line 320, 327, 330, 332, the sentence requires revision.</p>
              <p>We have followed the above recommendation of the reviewer by:</p>
              <p>• Clarifying that results with be reported according to CONSORT extension for non randomised trial design (Page 19, Lines 418-419).</p>
              <p>• Clarifying from which timepoints descriptive statistics will be reported on which measures (Page 19, Lines 425-428).</p>
              <p>• Clarifying that performance of outcome measures will inform the design (e.g., in terms of optimal assessments) for a future RCT (please see Page 428-435) and interpretation of changes in anxiety that may be meaningful (e.g., because they relate to other functional outcomes).</p>
              <p>A preliminary possible statistical test could be proposed in the analyses.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer that we should be more specific in this regard and have added some relevant examples (please see Page 19, Lines 425-426, 430-431, 437-438).</p>
              <p>Line 344, [50] to be placed after the word method.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this typo, and have updated accordingly (Page 20, Line 447).</p>
              <p>Line 346, apart from what were mentioned in the statistical analyses plan, information such as the method to conduct semi-structured interviews, the software to run the statistical analysis and qualitative analysis (if any), the level of accepted statistical significance, correction method (if any), missing data/handling, effect size, 95% CI etc to be stated.</p>
              <p>We have added further information on these aspects in the resubmitted manuscript, including our planned approach to statistical reporting and interpretation (please see Page 19, Lines 413-417), the software to be used (please see Page 19, Lines 413-414; Page 20, Line 447). We also provide a more detailed rationale for the app experience interview component on Page 17, Lines 375-388.</p>
              <p>9. Figure 1, it would be good to add the mode of administration and how the assessment is done for those items highlighted and denoted in the footnote e.g. email, in-person, online etc</p>
              <p>We now indicate the mode of administration for each assessment in the Figure legend (please see Page 10), also complementing our edits in response to Editor (comment and response #4) and Reviewer #1 (comment and response #4) queries regarding how the questionnaires are administered.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2 Comments and Author Response: </p>
              <p>1. Participants:</p>
              <p>• The inclusion criteria are noted to include age, be experiencing anxiety, providing consent, English language fluency, and ability to use a mobile phone app, but there is no information regarding diagnostic status. Earlier in the introduction, it was noted that digital tools can be helpful for those waiting to receive a diagnosis or who are self-diagnosed. How is ASD diagnostic status confirmed or is it by self-report? Is participation based on presence of autistic traits, which are known to be commonly observed in the general population of individuals without an ASD diagnosis (please see Sasson &amp; Bottema-Beutel, 2022 "Studies of autistic traits in the general population are not studies of autism")? As recruitment is through public advertising or outpatient clinic services which may include individuals without an ASD diagnosis, how can the results be interpreted or related to autistic individuals? Could it just be that these ASD-specific modifications and digital app presentation are good for CBT in general and beneficial to anyone, not specifically those with ASD if diagnostic status is not confirmed?</p>
              <p>We apologise that we were not clearer on this point and agree with the reviewer that this is an important clarification for us to make. We confirm that we do require participants to have an existing autism diagnosis to take part in the study. We had previously included reference to an existing diagnosis of autism along with information on the recruitment approach, which meant that this inclusion criteria was not obvious in our original submission. Therefore, we have now stated as part of the inclusion criteria that an autism diagnosis is required to take part in this study (please see Page 9, Line 188).</p>
              <p>We ascertain this information in two ways. For participants recruited through clinic services, the clinic team screen for potentially eligible participants and thus do not include those without an existing autism diagnosis (as per existing clinic records) in this process. For all participants, and particularly relevant to those recruited outside of clinic services, the research team also request confirmation of autism diagnosis (including the specific diagnosis if known e.g., ASD, Asperger’s, and who gave this diagnosis) during the screening process and we have added this information in brief to Page 16, Line 350-351.</p>
              <p>In terms of the later interpretation of findings, we also include two dimensional measures of autistic traits in our assessment battery (CAT-I, ARI) to enable us to ascertain whether baseline autistic traits influence app usage/ its impact on anxiety outcomes across the whole sample to identify potential individual variation in app acceptability/ effectiveness in autism.</p>
              <p>2. While the exclusion criteria include things such as recent participation in CBT and recent psychotropic medication use at the start of the study, is there any data being collected from participants as they may start therapy or medication (or other supportive services) while using this app as that may also have an impact on interpretation of results?</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting that we had inadvertently not provided details of our questionnaire on medication/ service use (secondary outcome measure) in the methods, which we now provide on Page 14, Lines 299-305.</p>
              <p>3. Intervention:</p>
              <p>• I was unable to find the “evidence-based adapted CBT principles” on the website provided. Please include those references in this manuscript as they provide the critical foundation upon which this app and its specific application for autistic individuals rests and is not provided. It is difficult to evaluate the appropriateness of the modifications and specificity to this population without knowing which evidence-based CBT principles are included in the app or the ASD-specific modifications (and support for them – unless you are referring to those in references 26-29). CBT may have many elements and it is difficult to know which ones are included in the app to evaluate the data and intervention effectiveness.</p>
              <p>We agree with the reviewer that the evidence-base for the features of the app are core to the study approach and interpretation. We have therefore added further detail about specific app components and their underlying evidence base on Page 12, Lines 248-255 and provide additional references, including from our team, to support this (please see Chew, Ozsivadjian, Hollocks and Magiati, 2022; Wood et al, 2020).</p>
