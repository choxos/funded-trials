                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. To improve outcomes, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ADHD guidelines recommend regular monitoring of symptoms when children commence medication. However, research suggests that routine monitoring rarely happens, and clinicians often rely on subjective information such as reports from parents and teachers to ascertain improvement. These sources can be unreliable and difficult to obtain. The addition of an objective test of attention and activity (QbTest) may improve the objectivity, reliability and speed of clinical decision-making and so reduce the time to identify the optimal medication dose. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a QbTest medication management protocol delivered in routine healthcare services for children with ADHD.</p>

                  <title>Method and analysis</title>
                  <p>This multisite feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) will recruit 60 young people (aged 6–17 years old), diagnosed with ADHD, and starting stimulant medication who are seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or Community Paediatric services. Participants will be randomised into one of two arms. In the experimental arm (QbTest protocol), the participant will complete a QbTest at baseline (prior to medication initiation), and two follow-up QbTests on medication (2–4 weeks and 8–10 weeks later). In the control arm, participants will receive treatment as usual, with at least two follow-up consultations. Measures of parent-, teacher- and clinician-rated symptoms and global functioning will be completed at each time point. Health economic measures will be completed. Clinicians will record treatment decision-making. Acceptability and feasibility of the protocol will be assessed alongside outcome measure completion rates. Qualitative interviews will be conducted.</p>

              <p>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects 3%–5% of children and young people under 18 years old.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The core symptoms include inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity leading to significant impairments in academic and social function and increased risk of substance misuse, unemployment, criminality and mental health problems.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Early treatment is crucial to improve symptoms and reduce the burden on the family and wider social and healthcare systems.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> With the increasing rates of diagnosis of ADHD, spending on ADHD medication has increased sevenfold between 1998 and 2005,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and expenditure on medication treatment costs in the UK is now estimated at £78 million per year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> This has placed increasing financial burden on health services and highlighted the need for more efficient and cost-effective services to diagnose and treat the condition. Indeed, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> emphasise the importance of young people with ADHD having access to the best evidence-based care in order to fulfil their potential and prevent poor outcome. However, in practice, delivery and quality of care is variable with little consistency in diagnosis or management.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Improving child and adolescent mental health services is a current government priority.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>NICE ADHD guidelines<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> recommend frequent monitoring of ADHD symptoms in children and young people prescribed medication to ensure first, that the best dose of medication is reached quickly for each child and second, that the effectiveness of this dose is monitored regularly, ensuring optimal outcomes are maintained with minimal side effects. The US National Institute of Mental Health Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD (MTA)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> showed that frequent symptom monitoring with careful adjustment of the dose significantly improved outcomes in ADHD. In this study, the proportion of children that experienced a clinically significant reduction in symptoms was almost 60% compared with only 25% for those not subjected to this careful monitoring procedure.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While treatments for ADHD are highly efficacious in carefully managed research settings,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> in standard community care careful monitoring is rarely possible and the outcome of treatment may be suboptimal. Audit data within the East Midlands showed that community care for ADHD falls well below the standards for titration and monitoring set out in the MTA and NICE guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Aside from delays in initiating treatment caused by diagnostic uncertainty, once on medication, children may not be reviewed sufficiently frequently for clinicians to detect non-response or partial response, or to establish the optimal dose for each child. Research has demonstrated that families are often unhappy with the length of time to attain reach an optimal dose of medication (up to 18 months), with very few participants reporting titration was achieved in the 6-week time frame advocated by NICE.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These issues mean that children may not experience the full benefits of medication and this has significant negative effects on their academic, social and psychological development. A further consequence of suboptimal treatment response in routine care is poor medication adherence. In the UK, 50% of patients have stopped ADHD medication after 18 months and 80% after 3 years.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Current methods to judge the effectiveness of medication rely on the clinician integrating various forms of subjective information, information such as clinical rating scales completed by parents and teachers, with their own observations. However, the information provided by these sources can be contradictory, partially completed or not returned in a timely manner leading to delays in treatment decisions. Adding more objective, computerised tests to clinical care for ADHD is one approach which has received increasing clinical and research recognition.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The continuous performance test (CPT) is a computerised neuropsychological test that measures the individual’s capacity to sustain attention (vigilance) and inhibit inappropriate responses (impulsivity). Several studies have noted improvement in CPT scores in children with ADHD on stimulant medication<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> indicating the potential utility of these tests to aid medication management in clinical practice. However, there is a need for further research on CPTs examining the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness using randomised controlled trials (RCTs).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Furthermore, a limitation of the CPT is that it does not measure the patients’ activity levels, which is a core symptom domain of ADHD. A recent systematic review<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> indicated that a combination of a CPT with objective direct measure of bodily activity during the test may be particularly useful as a clinical tool. One test that combines the CPT with a measure of activity is the ‘QbTest’ (Qbtech, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.qbtech.com">www.qbtech.com</ext-link>), a commercially available measure of ADHD symptoms approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Reference: K133382). The QbTest takes approximately 20 min to complete, during which time the child/young person is seated in front of a computer and is instructed to press a hand-held responder button each time a predesignated infrequent target stimulus appears on-screen, and to withhold the response to all other stimuli. These features of QbTest measure sustained and selective attention (target detection over 600 stimulus presentations), and impulsivity (withholding the response to a non-target). Simultaneously, an infrared camera tracks the movement of a marker attached to a headband worn during the test, to measure activity. All young people aged 6–17 years can sit the QbTest providing they do not have moderate/severe learning difficulty. The test provides a summary score relevant to each symptom domain (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) with reference to a large age-stratified and gender-stratified normative database.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The QbTest should not be used to reach a decision about diagnosis or medication without additional clinical information but aids decision-making by providing another source of information, reducing reliance on questionnaires.</p>
              <p>Recent research has investigated the use of the QbTest to aid in the clinical assessment of ADHD. QbTest can help differentiate ADHD from other conditions<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> and audit data suggests that QbTest can reduce the number of appointments needed to confirm a diagnosis of ADHD and result in cost savings to health services.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A recent RCT with health economic analysis further investigated whether the QbTest can reduce the number of appointments needed to make a diagnostic decision on ADHD.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Initial qualitative findings from this trial indicate that the QbTest is acceptable to children and families and feasible to implement in routine clinical settings.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Furthermore, the qualitative interviews revealed that some clinicians currently use QbTest to: improve confidence in diagnosis before initiating medication; reassure families, young people and schools of medication efficacy to improve adherence and review medication effects at follow-up to aid decisions around dose adjustment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of the QbTest in medication management. In support of this, other research has shown that QbTest is sensitive to the effects of stimulant medication<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and, in a placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine that performance improvements correlate with blinded observer ratings of ADHD symptoms.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> It has also shown some utility in identifying partial or non-responders after a single dose of methylphenidate.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Another study in adults with ADHD showed that the QbTest was more sensitive to medication effects than a standardised rating scale.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>Although promising, few of these previous studies were conducted in the UK. Moreover, although some clinics within the UK, Europe and the USA are using QbTest to aid medication management, there is no standard approach and most clinics still rely on traditional approaches of using rating scales and clinical judgement. There is a need to formally evaluate the role of the QbTest to aid medication management in ADHD and assess whether the test should be routinely incorporated in healthcare services. In line with the Medical Research Council guidance on evaluating complex interventions (interventions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.mrc.ac.uk/complexinterventionsguidance">www.mrc.ac.uk/complexinterventionsguidance</ext-link>), the aim of this ‘QbTest Utility for Optimising Treatment in ADHD’ (QUOTA) study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel QbTest medication management protocol in a parallel group, single-blind, feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative evaluation. To ascertain the clinical utility of the protocol in standard practice, treatment as usual (TAU) was the chosen comparator. The findings from this study will be used to inform the decision to conduct a fully powered, definitive RCT investigating whether QbTest can help reduce the time to reach an optimal, effective medication dose.</p>

A subsample of 10 in the control arm will be interviewed about their experiences of ADHD medication. The subsample will be chosen at random from each participating site, using a random number generator. All clinicians participating in the feasibility RCT will be interviewed, and asked to comment on any local factors that influenced delivery of the protocol at their site, providing early insight into factors that might influence delivery of the multisite RCT and future implementation of the protocol into the NHS. All interviews will take place after their duration in the RCT has been completed to avoid any impact on outcome measures. Interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed and analysed.

                <title>Sample size and justification</title>
                <p>The required sample is 60 participants, 30 per study arm. Participants will be families (parents/carers and children/young people) whose child/young person is about to commence stimulant medication for ADHD. These sample sizes are large enough to test the feasibility of the research procedures and to establish a mean and SD on each outcome measure (Hertzog; 2008). The study has an 8-month recruitment period, requiring 7.5 participants to be recruited into the study each month. Based on findings from the AQUA-Trial (which included the three sites used in this trial) this target is achievable. Recruitment rates and the final target will be used to inform the decision to proceed to a definitive RCT.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>After obtaining informed consent, participants will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio into either the QbTest medication arm (experimental arm) or TAU (control arm). Randomisation will take place via sealed opaque envelopes generated by our study statistician (BG). The sealed envelopes will be provided to the clinic sites and opened at the point of consent by the clinician.</p>
                <p>All participants will undergo the same research measures, with the exception of the QbTest, which will only be in the experimental arm. Outcome assessors for all measures will be blind to which arm the participant is in. There are no anticipated events in which participant unblinding would be necessary.</p>

                <title>Data analysis plan</title>
                <p>As a feasibility study, data analysis will be mainly descriptive, as recommended by Lancaster<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and Lancaster <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> All measures will be summarised by group across follow-up time with mean (SD) for normally distributed data, median (IQR) for skewed variable and frequency (percentage) for categorical measures. Together with site-level intraclass correlation coefficient, treatment effects and 95% CI will be derived using multilevel modelling. Recruitment rate and retention rate will also be calculated from the data. This information will be used to inform the future definitive RCT design. All statistical analysis will be conducted using STATA V.15. No interim analysis is planned.</p>
                <p>To inform the acceptability and feasibility of the study design the following indices will be recorded and analysed: (1) <italic>acceptability of randomisation</italic>—record of the number of patients who do not participate stating randomisation as the reason for non-participation, drop-out rates of randomisation, errors in randomisation per site; (2) <italic>acceptability of study design</italic>—record of the number of eligible participants at each site and the percentage that consent to take part in the study, number of withdrawals at each follow-up time point; (3) <italic>acceptability of outcome measures</italic>—record of completion rates for outcome measures, percentage of data collected online, via telephone or postal completion; (4) <italic>acceptability/feasibility of the protocol</italic>—record of non-adherence of healthcare professionals to the protocol. These reasons will be further explored in the qualitative interviews and (5) <italic>feasibility of a future definitive RCT</italic>—record an estimate of the hours per week spent conducting the RCT and estimate the number of researchers required and the time commitment for healthcare professionals in a future RCT.</p>
                <p>The qualitative interviews will shed light on contextual and other factors that might affect implementation of QbTest (both as part of the trial, and within the broader processes of care) and will be used to refine the RCT design (and QbTest implementation more broadly) if appropriate. The qualitative interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically following the guidelines of Braun and Clarke.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The quantitative and qualitative findings will be used to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the medication protocol and research study design, and inform the decision to proceed to a fully powered RCT.</p>

Only the research team will have access to the study data, which will be stored in secure locked files or password-protected databases. Data will be available for inspection by the ethics committee on request. Changes to the protocol will be communicated to the ethics committee and trial registries by the trial manager (CLH). The process for obtaining participant informed consent or assent and parent/guardian/ teacher informed consent will be in accordance with the ethical guidance and Good Clinical Practice. The investigator or their nominee and the participant or other legally authorised representative (such as the child’s parent) shall both sign and date the informed consent forms (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1 SP2">supplementary appendix A, B</xref>) before the person can participate in the study. Where the young person is 16 years and over, written consent will be required from the young person and parent alike. Where the young person is under 16 years, written parental consent will be required, alongside the young person’s written or verbal assent. Teachers will also be asked to sign a consent form (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">supplementary appendix C</xref>), if teachers do not sign consent the participant is still eligible for the study but no teacher measures will be collected. Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study are considered confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited unless warranted by an adverse event. Participant confidentiality will be further ensured by using identification code numbers to correspond to treatment data in the computer files. No post-trial care is required.</p>
