                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of demand in eye care services in the UK. With a large proportion of patients referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management, the referral process results in unnecessary referrals from erroneous diagnoses and delays in access to appropriate treatment. A potential solution is a teleophthalmology digital referral pathway linking community optometry and HES.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The HERMES study (Teleophthalmology-enabled and artificial intelligence-ready referral pathway for community optometry referrals of retinal disease: a cluster randomised superiority trial with a linked diagnostic accuracy study) is a cluster randomised clinical trial for evaluating the effectiveness of a teleophthalmology referral pathway between community optometry and HES for retinal diseases. Nested within HERMES is a diagnostic accuracy study, which assesses the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS) for automated diagnosis and referral recommendation. A postimplementation, observational substudy, a within-trial economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment will assess the feasibility of implementation of both digital technologies within a real-life setting. Patients with a suspicion of retinal disease, undergoing eye examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, will be recruited across 24 optometry practices in the UK. Optometry practices will be randomised to standard care or teleophthalmology. The primary outcome is the proportion of false-positive referrals (unnecessary HES visits) in the current referral pathway compared with the teleophthalmology referral pathway. OCT scans will be interpreted by the AI DSS, which provides a diagnosis and referral decision and the primary outcome for the AI diagnostic study is diagnostic accuracy of the referral decision made by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI system. Secondary outcomes relate to inappropriate referral rate, cost-effectiveness analyses and human–computer interaction (HCI) analyses.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Ophthalmology outpatient attendances account for 10% of all outpatient activities in the UK, more than any other individual medical specialty.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Modern ophthalmic practice in the UK is faced by the challenges of an ageing population, increasing prevalence of degenerative disease and emergent treatments that are revolutionary but dependent on timely diagnosis. This represents a huge strain on diagnostic services and adversely impacts on timely access to care. Concurrently, there have been exponential increases in computing power and artificial intelligence (AI), expansions in the strength and ubiquity of communications technologies and developments in imaging capabilities, including in the community optometry setting.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>In the UK, primary care for ophthalmology is delivered by community-based optometry practices (high street opticians). A large proportion of patients diagnosed with a suspicion of retinal disease, including common conditions such as neovascular (‘wet’) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are referred to Hospital Eye Services (HES) for diagnostics and disease management.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> The referral process results in unnecessary referrals (which can cause inconvenience and distress for patients), erroneous diagnoses, misclassification in terms of urgency, duplication of imaging tests and delays in access to treatment.</p>
              <p>An increase in 30% in eye clinic attendances has been observed within the last 5 years throughout the UK.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Further increases are likely because of the increasing availability of imaging technology, and especially optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is becoming ubiquitous in community optometry practices.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> OCT is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses light to generate micrometre-resolution three-dimensional images of the retina and provides the best way to diagnose a number of common retinal pathologies including wet AMD.</p>
              <p>This study focuses on two potentially complementary digital technologies that have the potential to revolutionise the interface between community optometrists and hospital-based eye clinics: the teleophthalmology platform and the Moorfields-DeepMind AI DSS. The technologies will be assessed through two complementary and linked quantitative studies:</p>

                <title>Cluster superiority randomised trial (RCT) of teleophthalmology pathway</title>
                <p>Telemedicine in ophthalmology can help face this challenge of provision of optimal and expert care to people attending for routine eye tests in community optometry practices, through a digital referral pathway relying on teleophthalmology links between community optometry and HES. This could optimise the referral process by allowing remote review of imaging and clinical data captured at the community level, by human experts based in HES. We will perform a cluster randomised superiority trial to assess the impact on service delivery metrics (such as proportion of unnecessary referrals and time from referral to treatment for urgent maculopathies) of a digital link between community optometry practices and HES using a teleophthalmology platform. We will use a device-agnostic, teleophthalmology platform to enable a digital referral pathway of patients with a suspicion of retinal disease. The pilot data produced by our research team have demonstrated the potential of teleophthalmology to drastically improve the efficiency of the referral pathway between community optometry and HES while reducing unnecessary referrals to HES<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and; hence, we propose a randomised trial powered to demonstrate superiority of the digital referral pathway against standard care.</p>

                <title>Diagnostic accuracy study of AI diagnosis support system</title>
                <p>AI DSSs have recently been developed and shown to have good diagnostic accuracy against human experts in interpreting ocular imaging tests, such as OCT scan.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The collaboration between Moorfields Eye Hospital and Google DeepMind produced the arguably most advanced deep learning DSS in ophthalmology, capable of interpreting OCT scans, providing diagnosis for retinal disease and suggesting urgency of referral. In silico analysis using retrospectively collected data has validated the tool against human experts for the diagnosis of retinal disease and referral recommendations, and it has been shown to be non-inferior.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The algorithm is uniquely and independently used in Moorfields Eye Hospital for research purposes. Thus, while such work has demonstrated promising results, a prospective study is required to demonstrate its value in practice.</p>
                <p>We will perform a prospective study to assess diagnostic (referral) accuracy of the Moorfields-DeepMind AI DSS when applied on the OCT scans collected in the context of the teleophthalmology RCT. This will allow maximum utilisation of collected data from the trial and will provide estimates and CIs of diagnostic (referral) accuracy. All cases included in the RCT will be reviewed by the Moorfields-DeepMind AI DSS within 48 hours of obtaining the OCT scans, and a referral decision (refer routinely, refer urgently, don’t refer) will be made by the algorithm for each case and recorded. The referral decisions made by the AI DSS will not be implemented in practice, yet data of the time required to obtain these decisions and any technical issues encountered with its use will be captured. These data will be incorporated into the implementation science models, including human–computer interaction (HCI) analysis, value-based economic evaluation and discrete choice experiment (DCE), to identify the potential opportunities and gaps in advancing the adoption of the Moorfields-DeepMind AI DSS.</p>

                <title>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: postimplementation observational pragmatic subtudy</title>
                <p>National Health Service (NHS) services underwent rapid and significant adjustments across the board in response to extreme challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes to healthcare services driven by necessity are not always underpinned by a robust evidence base for efficiency and safety. In ophthalmology, as a response to the need for social distancing and minimising unnecessary hospital visits, teleophthalmology pathways were commissioned recently in some areas of England using digital link to facilitate referrals between community optometry and HESs. Greater Manchester was an early adopter of this approach and a majority of the optometry practices in that area are now referring to NHS eye units via a teleophthalmology link. This local change in standard care provides a unique opportunity to examine whether teleophthalmology works under usual conditions within the NHS. This substudy will allow us to record and measure variation in quality of healthcare within a local region to inform our inferences from the RCT on how the teleophthalmology pathway will perform within a real-life setting. We will, thus, perform a pragmatic, observational, postimplementation study involving community optometry practices in the Greater Manchester area. This will also serve as a safety analysis allowing us to identify potential safety signals of the teleophthalmology pathways and adding granularity to the economic and qualitative evaluations of the RCT.</p>

Twelve clusters (each cluster is an optometry practice) will be randomised to standard care and 12 clusters to the intervention (teleophthalmology). This selection of sites includes urban, suburban and rural locations within the UK allowing the inferences made from this study to be applicable to more of the UK population. Two additional optometry practices (clusters) will be randomised (1:1) in a reserve capacity in case of a cluster drop-out or in order to accelerate the recruitment process (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>)</p>

                <p>In the superiority C-RCT of teleophthalmology pathway study, the primary analysis will be conducted following an intention-to-treat principle, where all randomised patients are analysed in their allocated group whether or not they receive their randomised management plan. The primary outcome is the proportion of false referrals, measured at the patient level. This will be compared between management groups using logistic regression adjusting for clustered centres. Outcomes will be reported as adjusted ORs.</p>

                  <title>Focus of analysis</title>
                  <p>The primary focus for analysis will be on facilitators and barriers to implementation of the teleophthalmology system and the introduction of AI decision support across clinical contexts, along with accounts of how it changes workflow and patient experience. Evaluation will be formative, so as to inform future implementations and also to contextualise the analyses of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. For the AI DSS, questions to be included in interviews will involve whether the AI is to be used as decision aid (eg, as a filter for disease/no disease) or as a completely independent decision-making tool, issues around trust in the technology, perceptions of medicolegal concerns (who is responsible for the decisions?), the optimal place in the care pathway for positioning the AI (high street optician or hospital-based eye services or both), concerns such as deskilling of practitioners (as diagnostic decisions may be devolved to AI), reduced employment opportunities, the need for a ‘safety net’/quality check to oversee and ‘sanity check’ the performance of the AI system and impersonal care for patients and perceived benefits such as more efficient and appropriate care, greater confidence in the process, etc. We will also particularly focus on the question of ‘interpretability’ of AI DSS and the ‘black box’ phenomenon and whether it influences trust and potential uptake of this technology. The ‘interpretability’ of AI DSS is a major factor in technology uptake and may influence the direction of AI DSS developers towards more interpretable technologies.</p>
                  <p>The data collected from sites with established teleophthalmology pathways (Greater Manchester) will be particularly valuable for identifying barriers to implementation in a real-life context that would not be picked up in the controlled environment of the RCT such as technical, staffing, training and human factors. Such barriers can be consequential with respect to patient safety as they have the potential to lead to delays in clinical review or missed cases and, therefore, the postimplementation substudy offers an opportunity to explore potential safety signals of the teleophthalmology pathways not typically observable in the context of RCT trials.</p>

                  <p>In order to capture patient and staff perspectives of teleophthalmology models of care as well as AI DSS, we will take a qualitative approach, conducting interviews and observations in both community optometry and HES. A full account on sampling, recruitment and analysis methods is provided in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>. We will compare people’s expectations (what they believe they will want and use) with their experiences when they have access to the relevant technology.

                    <title>Cost-consequence analysis</title>
                    <p>The economic evaluation will comprise a within trial cost-consequence analysis (CCA) directly comparing the teleophthalmology pathway with the current referral pathway. This analysis highlights the choices and trade-offs between the modalities of care provision without an explicit synthesis of data into a single measure of efficiency. The results for the CCA will be presented as a balance sheet, which will include point estimates and appropriate measures of variance. From an NHS perspective, costs such as hospital visits, medications and community General Practitioner (GP) visits will be costed. Unit costs for resource use will be derived from published sources, eg, NHS Reference Costs and Unit Costs of Health and Social Care.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When considering the addition of the community optometry perspective, the costs to purchase and maintain an OCT scanner will be considered. The costs of acquisition will be derived from market prices and converted into a cost per patient using standard economic methodology.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition to this, the costs of the Moorfields-DeepMind algorithm will be considered within trial analysis. We will base this cost on advice from the algorithm owners as well as consideration of analogous algorithms. We expect there to be considerable uncertainty around the price to the NHS as a market price is not available. Therefore, we will explore the impact on efficiency of a range of prices. This will help decision-makers consider the maximum price they might be willing to pay for this algorithm given the benefits it may provide. In addition to the costs of running the algorithm in terms of hardware, software and staff, required will be considered. This will be based on its use within the study and advice from members of the study. A sensitivity analysis will be carried out to explore how the adoption of different perspectives (ie, who is bearing the costs) will affect the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Outcomes which may be included in this CCA are false positives, false negatives, unnecessary hospital visits and duration of the time spent with an untreated macular disorder. These will be compared with the costs of provision and of the intervention and with the results of the DCE described below. Costs that will be included will be those that fall on the NHS and community optometry practices. Deterministic sensitivity analysis for example, variations in unit costs, will also be conducted. The consequences for each of the comparators will be based on a further consideration of outcomes (for example necessary referrals missed, correct referrals, individuals correctly not referred). The likelihood of these different outcomes (given as percentages) will be described.</p>
                    <p>To include insights derived from the pragmatic post-implementation study, the economic evaluation will also provide the following additional elements:</p>

As a safety analysis will be carried out as part of a sub-study, the cost and consequences of any unexpected adverse events that are recorded will be included in the cost consequence analysis. If any safety events become apparent during the design of the DCE then these may be used as the basis of different attributes and levels in the study design.</p>

                  <title>Discrete choice experiment</title>
                  <p>In addition to the CCA economic evaluation a DCE will be carried out to assess preferences of the general public about the teleophthalmology pathway. A DCE is an attribute-based survey method for measuring benefits. It offers participants at least two alternative choices, which vary across several attributes of interest. These can include several attributes of how the intervention is provided and its effect on health and other outcomes. Each of these attributes can vary over a range of levels. The choice of DCE attributes for this intervention will be informed from the existing literature on macular disease and provision of eye care service. The output of the qualitative study will also be examined for any attributes, which could affect the preferences of the users of the service. The DCE will also be used to value in monetary terms the relative importance of the different consequences included in the CCA. To do this, it will use methods previously successfully used in other NIHR-funded studies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> The results of this monetary value will be used to inform a further cost benefit analysis.</p>

                  <title>Cost-benefit analysis</title>
                  <p>The results of the DCE will be used to value the outcomes described in the CCA. Outcomes will be expressed as a net monetary benefit by combining the differences in each outcome by the willingness to pay (WTP) for a unit change in that outcome. These values are known as WTP values and will be derived from the DCE described above. Costs will be included as part of the attributes that participants consider so that participants can express their WTP values for a described outcome. The cost of providing the outcome will be derived from the unit costs described earlier. A net benefit in monetary terms for these outcomes will be derived be subtracting the cost of the outcome from the WTP value (including a negative net benefit).</p>
                  <p>The values for the cost attribute will be based on pilot work and reviews of prior studies in this area, for example, Burr <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> valued an intervention to monitor ocular hypertension to prevent glaucoma using a DCE. The range of values was between £15 and £70 (GBP 2012). Similarly, Shih <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> assessed the WTP for a diabetic retinopathy screening service and reported a narrower range of between US$4 and US$24 (USD 2007).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> After the attributes have been established, then the piloting stages will occur. A survey company will be utilised to gain a large enough sample (<ext-link xlink:href="www.researchnow.co.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.researchnow.co.uk</ext-link>). The participants will be offered a small incentive (£1–£2) to complete the survey. The overall sample will be representative as closely as possibly for factors such as age, sex and ethnic background for the UK population. Optimal sample size requirements for the limited dependent variable models estimated in DCEs depend on knowledge of the true choice probabilities, which are not known prior to undertaking this research. However, previous DCE studies have shown that robust choice models can be estimated from sample sizes between 50 and 100 respondents. As such, a small pilot sample of 100 participants will be used as a sample to monitor the rate of completion and to carry out preliminary analysis and change any parts of the survey that are necessary. After the preliminary analysis is carried out, then a further sample of 300 participants will be surveyed, which will be sample size comparable to other HTAs in this area. The results of the DCE will be analysed using conditional logit regression analysis, which will measure the direction and strength of the participant preferences. Subgroup analysis will also be carried out to see if factors such as age, sex or ethnic background have any effect on the resulting preferences. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses will be carried out to vary parameter uncertainty for both the costs and the effects. Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be presented as point estimates of net benefits, plots of costs and benefits net benefit curves, which show the likelihood of each intervention being most likely to have the highest net benefit.</p>

The OCT scans will be pseudoanonymised and no personal data will be included on the scans. No personal identifiers such as the patients’ name will be sent to the sponsor, and a unique identification code will be assigned to each OCT scan. This log of subject codes will be kept at each research site but not shared with the sponsor. Regarding data handling, the senior data manager in Moorfields Eye Hospital CRF will independently ask the IT application team to run missing data query and perform range check, logic check and data quality checks of the Electronic Database on a monthly basis. Active project data are stored in the dedicated secure Reading Centre drive with appropriate back up arrangements. Access to the drive is restricted only to Reading Centre staff with permission and access will be monitored, granted, revoked on a per user basis.
