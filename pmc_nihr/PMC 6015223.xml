                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Very late (aged ≥60 years) onset schizophrenia-like psychosis occurs frequently but no placebo-controlled, randomised trials have assessed the efficacy and risks of antipsychotic treatment. We investigated whether low-dose amisulpride (100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and whether any benefit is maintained by continuing treatment after 12 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The ATLAS double-blind controlled trial enrolled participants from 25 old age psychiatry services in the UK. Eligible participants (ie, those with a diagnosis of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS] score of ≥30, without cognitive impairment) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three groups in a two-stage trial: amisulpride in stage 1 and 2 (group A), amisulpride then placebo (group B), or placebo then amisulpride (group C). Treatment (100 mg oral amisulpride daily <italic>vs</italic> placebo) was given for 12 weeks in stage 1 and, initially, 24 weeks then reduced to 12 weeks in stage 2. Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Primary outcomes were psychosis symptoms assessed by the BPRS at 4, 12, and 24, or 36 weeks, and trial treatment discontinuation for non-efficacy. The primary, secondary, and safety endpoints were all analysed in participants given at least one dose of study treatment in modified intention-to-treat analyses. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2010-022184-35, and ISRCTN, number ISRCTN45593573.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 27, 2012, and June 28, 2016, we recruited 101 participants. 92 (91%) of 101 participants took trial medication, of whom 59 (64%) completed stage 1 and 34 (58%) of these 59 participants completed stage 2 treatment. Despite suboptimal compliance, improvements in BPRS scores at 12 weeks were 7·7 points (95% CI 3·8–11·5, p=0·0002) greater with amisulpride (mean 11·9 points [SE 1·3]) than with placebo (4·2 points [1·0]). In stage 2, BPRS scores improved by a mean of 1·1 points (1·6) from 12 weeks to the final assessment in those who continued amisulpride but deteriorated by 5·2 points (2·0) in those who switched from amisulpride to placebo (difference 6·3 points [95% CI 0·9–11·7], p=0·024). Fewer participants who were allocated amisulpride than placebo stopped treatment because of non-efficacy in stage 1 (p=0·010) and stage 2 (p=0·031). Serious adverse events were reported more frequently in the amisulpride group than in the placebo group in stage 1 (p=0·057) and stage 2 (p=0·19). The most common serious adverse events were infection (five patients in the amisulpride group, three in the placebo group) and extrapyramidal side-effects (three patients in the amisulpride group, none in the placebo group). Five patients died during the study, one from a gastric ulcer bleed before treatment started (group B), two while taking stage 2 treatment (one in group A and one in group C), and two who stopped trial treatment in stage 1 and died many weeks later (one in group B and one in group C). No deaths were related to treatment.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database on Jan 13, 2017, for relevant articles, using the search terms “late-onset schizophrenia”, “very late-onset schizophrenia-like”, “clinical trial”, and “treatment”, with no date or language restrictions. We did not find any randomised, controlled, double-blind trials in this patient group with onset of a schizophrenia-like illness at age 60 years or older. Available evidence for the use of antipsychotics in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis comes from one single-arm trial of 5 weeks of treatment with amisulpride that reported improvements in psychosis symptoms without significant extrapyramidal side-effects and from retrospective case-note reviews and published expert opinion. Because of the absence of reliable evidence on the benefits of antipsychotic treatment and high-profile reports of questionable efficacy and adverse safety of such treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, there are concerns that the risks of antipsychotics in an older patient group, who are potentially vulnerable to such side-effects, might outweigh any benefits. Furthermore, patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis usually have scarce insight into the potential value of taking antipsychotic treatment, hence most patients with such psychosis have not engaged with antipsychotic treatment.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial provides the first reliable evidence that an antipsychotic drug (amisulpride 100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and 24 weeks in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. The treatment effect size from 24 weeks of amisulpride was large despite suboptimal compliance. Treatment was well tolerated with similar discontinuation rates for side-effects with amisulpride and placebo, despite a modest increase in extrapyramidal symptoms in patients given amisulpride.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Psychosis symptoms in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis show a good and sustained response to amisulpride (100 mg/day) and this treatment is well tolerated. This randomised controlled trial is the first to show evidence of clear benefits from antipsychotic treatment in a situation where physicians might previously have shared the reluctance or ambivalence of their patients about such treatment.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para90">Although atypical antipsychotics are used to treat very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, their benefits and risks have not been properly evaluated. To our knowledge, the only evidence for efficacy is from a retrospective review of case notes<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and one single-arm, 5-week trial of amisulpride that reported improvements in psychosis without worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> No randomised placebo-controlled trial data are available to guide antipsychotic treatment in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Clinicians' concerns about the poor efficacy and substantial risks associated with the prescribing of antipsychotic drugs for older people with Alzheimer's disease,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> compounded by the characteristic impairment of insight into the potential value of treatment among patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, have resulted in less than half of eligible patients currently receiving treatment.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para100">The primary aims of the antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS) trial were to determine whether 12 weeks of treatment for very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis with low-dose amisulpride (100 mg daily) improves psychiatric symptom scores compared with placebo, and whether prolonged treatment with 100 mg amisulpride beyond 12 weeks confers additional benefit. We also aimed to assess side-effects and serious adverse events associated with amisulpride treatment, compliance with allocated treatment in this difficult-to-treat population, and the effects of treatment on quality of life.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="para110">ATLAS was a pragmatic, randomised, three-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with two stages. In stage 1, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of oral amisulpride over 12 weeks compared with placebo. In stage 2, we investigated the effects of continuing amisulpride versus withdrawal to placebo. Stage 2 treatment was initially planned to last 24 weeks, but the protocol was amended to reduce the duration to 12 weeks to increase the number of patients still being treated at the final assessment.</p>
                <p id="para120">People with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis often have little insight into their illness or the possibility that antipsychotic treatment could improve their symptoms; therefore we did not consider it practicable to involve patients directly in the design or management of the trial. Instead, the Service User Research Enterprise at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London (London, UK) advised on the choice of outcome measures, trial procedures, and on the use of language in trial patient information and consenting materials.</p>
                <p id="para130">The study was done in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996) and the principles of Good Clinical Practice, and was reviewed and approved by The London and Surrey Borders Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (reference 11/LO/1267) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="para140">We recruited patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis from community and inpatient specialist old age psychiatry services within the UK National Health Service. Eligibility criteria were diagnosis of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis according to International Consensus Group Criteria,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> including onset of delusions or hallucinations, or both, at age 60 years or older, BPRS score<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> of 30 or greater, and capacity to give informed consent to participate in the trial. Exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment or a standardised Mini Mental State Examination<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> score of less than 25, diagnosis of affective disorder, uncontrolled serious physical illness, prescribed amisulpride in the previous 28 days, contraindications to amisulpride, and participation in another clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product in the previous 28 days. Participants with conditions that would prevent them from having a blood test were excluded from the optional blood tests, but not the full trial. People treated with antipsychotics other than amisulpride in the 28 days before enrolment but who still satisfied eligibility criteria, and for whom stopping their current antipsychotic was considered appropriate, could participate. These participants stopped antipsychotic treatment the day before starting trial medication. Participants were given an information sheet about the study and the trial procedures were explained to them, after which participants gave written informed consent.</p>

              <sec id="cesec50">
                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para150">Once informed consent was given and baseline assessments were done, we randomly allocated participants in a 1:1:1 ratio, using a centralised randomisation service, to one of three groups: amisulpride (group A); amisulpride followed by placebo (group B); or placebo followed by amisulpride (group C). Treatment packs were allocated centrally by the ATLAS study office. The minimised randomisation procedure aimed to balance treatment allocation (as much as possible given available packs at each centre) overall, and by six stratification variables: age (60–69, 70–79, ≥80 years), sex, living circumstances (living with spouse or partner, living alone, other), time since onset of symptoms (&lt;6 months, ≥6 months), previous antipsychotic treatment (no, yes &gt;1 month previously, yes ≤28 days ago), and BPRS score (30–39, 40–49, ≥50). Participants were enrolled by their clinicians, clinical study officers, or ATLAS trial research nurses. These staff did outcome assessments. Amisulpride and placebo were provided in identical overencapsulated treatment cartons to maintain blinding. Participants, prescribing clinicians, outcome assessors, and all ATLAS trial staff (except statisticians) were masked to group assignment.</p>

              <sec id="cesec60">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para160">Participants were given overencapsulated 100 mg amisulpride or placebo in 12-week treatment cartons, each containing three 28-day blister packs. Group A took one capsule containing 100 mg amisulpride daily for 36 weeks (24 weeks for patients enrolled after the protocol amendment). Group B took one capsule containing 100 mg amisulpride daily for 12 weeks followed by one matching placebo capsule daily for a further 24 weeks (12 weeks for patients enrolled after the protocol amendment). Group C took one placebo capsule daily for 12 weeks followed by one 100 mg amisulpride capsule daily for a further 24 weeks (12 weeks for patients enrolled after the protocol amendment). Data from participants in group C were not used for trial analyses in stage 2 because there was not an appropriate comparator group. Information on compliance and the number of tablets taken was collected at each follow-up assessment and pills were counted to confirm reported compliance. Adverse events were recorded at each visit from a checklist of anticipated side-effects of amisulpride and free text recording of adverse events.</p>
                <p id="para170">To determine whether there was an association between compliance and baseline characteristics, we compared the baseline characteristics of completers and dropouts using time to dropout.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para180">Outcomes were assessed at 4 and 12 weeks and at 24 or 36 weeks for all participants regardless of whether or not they continued to take trial medication. The first primary outcome was change in psychosis symptoms, assessed by the BPRS score, between baseline and week 12 and between week 12 and the final assessment (week 24 or 36). The BPRS is a widely used clinician-rated instrument for the assessment of positive, negative, and affective symptoms in patients with psychotic disorders and was chosen because it covers the important symptoms elicited in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> It has been shown to be sensitive to improvements in symptoms associated with antipsychotic treatment in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and even clinically inexperienced raters can show test-retest reliability of over 90% if provided with guidance for the structured interview.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Each of the 18 BPRS symptom constructs is assessed by the rater on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (absent) to 7 (extremely severe). The total score (18–126) is calculated by summing the scores from the 18 items, with higher scores indicating more severe psychopathology. The BPRS was developed as a scale to measure general psychopathology in a wide range of psychiatric disorders and our prior hypothesis was that benefits of amisulpride would be most apparent on the six items (hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations, unusual thought content, tension, and uncooperativeness) that most closely reflect the symptomatology of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis; therefore we did a prespecified analysis of the change in the combined scores from these six BPRS domains.</p>
                <p id="para190">The second primary outcome was the proportion of patients who withdrew from trial treatment because of a perceived absence of efficacy between baseline and week 12 and between week 13 and the final assessment.</p>
                <p id="para200">Secondary outcomes were extrapyramidal side-effects, measured with the Simpson Angus Scale, which assesses nine extrapyramidal signs (gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, glabellar tap, tremor, and salivation) by direct examination;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> compliance expressed as proportion of participants who discontinued treatment and as percentage of prescribed medication taken between weeks 1 and 12 and between weeks 13 and 24; quality of life measured with the WHO Quality of Life Scale<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and the EuroQol-5D;<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and resource usage measured with the Client Service Receipt Inventory.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> A full economic analysis will be reported separately.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para210">Since patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis have rarely been recruited to randomised controlled trials, we used an initial feasibility phase to assess recruitment and retention, after which the initial target sample size of 300 randomised participants was pragmatically reduced to 100. This reduction was made because of the practical difficulties involved in the recruitment of people with this diagnosis, who are largely without insight into the presence of illness or the possible benefits of treatment. On the basis of a 5-point improvement on the BPRS being a minimal clinically important difference and the assumption that the SD of BPRS measures would be 9 points, we powered the trial to detect a moderate treatment effect of 0·56 SDs.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> If 100 patients were randomised and 90% of participants completed outcome assessments at 12 weeks, this design would provide 70% power at p&lt;0·05 (two-sided) to detect the 5-point minimal clinically important difference in BPRS, and over 80% power to detect a 6-point difference in BPRS in stage 1.</p>
                <p id="para220">Participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the modified intention to treat analyses of all primary and secondary outcomes using standard Student's <italic>t</italic> test and repeated measures regression methods.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> For patients who were assessed at 4 weeks but not at 12 weeks, the 4-week assessment was carried forward for the 12-week comparisons of change from baseline. For sensitivity analyses, we analysed the data with and without using last observation carried forward to check for any differences. We used SAS software (version 9.3) for all statistical analyses. An independent data monitoring and ethics committee reviewed and monitored the unblinded accumulating data and the safety of patients in the study.

              <p id="para330">The ATLAS trial shows that a single daily dose of 100 mg amisulpride is an effective treatment for the symptoms of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. The mean improvement in psychosis symptoms of 12 BPRS points with amisulpride we report is similar to the mean BPRS change of 14 points seen in a previous open-label study.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, a significant 4-point improvement in BPRS scores from baseline was also seen in our placebo group, showing that the net benefit of amisulpride is around 8 BPRS points compared with placebo. Although this 8-point difference in change in BPRS score would probably have been larger with better compliance, it is close to one standard deviation (8·8 points), indicating a large effect size.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para340">If a worthwhile benefit is defined as a 0·5 SD improvement<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>—which at 4·7 BPRS points is close to our predefined minimal worthwhile improvement of 5 BPRS points—then at the week 12 assessment, 45 (74%) of 61 participants in the amisulpride group compared with 14 (45%) of 31 participants in the placebo group had an improvement in BPRS score of 0·5 SD (p=0·007; post-hoc analysis). Alternative definitions of worthwhile benefit, such as a 25% reduction in BPRS score,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> produce similar estimates of about three patients as the number needed to treat to have one worthwhile benefit.</p>
              <p id="para350">This benefit of amisulpride in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis is substantially greater than the moderate effect sizes of around 0·5 SD reported from a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> of trials of antipsychotics in the reduction of psychosis symptoms in schizophrenia, and the small effect sizes of 0·15–0·2 SD reported from meta-analyses<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> of antipsychotic trials in psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our results should, therefore, encourage clinicians to be optimistic about the benefits of antipsychotic treatment in a group of patients who are generally undertreated.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para360">Although we chose to use amisulpride, a limbic-selective D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> antagonist,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> in ATLAS because it is relatively non-sedating (which helps to maintain compliance and blinding of treatment allocation), we would expect similar results with other antipsychotics. The recommended daily dose of amisulpride for patients with early onset schizophrenia is 400–800 mg, but our data show that a much lower dose (100 mg/day) can improve symptoms in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.</p>
              <p id="para370">We tested 100 mg/day of amisulpride because we believed that it would be unlikely to induce important extrapyramidal side-effects, since an open-label trial<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> had already shown that this daily dose of amisulpride is probably effective and well tolerated in our study population. Although our data suggest a moderate increase in extrapyramidal side-effects even at this low dose, these side-effects are not of sufficient frequency or severity to affect compliance or the benefits of amisulpride, even with up to 36 weeks of treatment. This finding is consistent with results from a PET study<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> showing that people with Alzheimer's disease receiving 50 mg/day amisulpride to treat psychosis symptoms had a higher occupancy of striatal dopamine receptors (40–80%) than was anticipated, which increases risk of extrapyramidal side-effects. The mean age of ATLAS participants was around 80 years, therefore exposure to high-dose antipsychotics would be expected to produce a substantially increased risk of such side-effects. These effects can be distressing and disfiguring, lead to reduced mobility and increased falls, and represent an important disincentive to both prescription and treatment adherence in this patient group. Differences between schizophrenia, psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis in antipsychotic efficacy, and the dose at which extrapyramidal side-effects appear are further evidence that these are distinct illnesses with specific treatment requirements.</p>
              <p id="para380">Although amisulpride improved clinician-rated psychosis symptoms in the ATLAS trial, successful treatment did not result in participant-rated, subjective changes in health-related quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol-5D or WHO Quality of Life Scale,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> which might reflect a poor awareness that psychotic symptoms could be occurring as part of an illness.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> If participants do not recognise that they are unwell or that antipsychotic treatment might improve their symptoms or situation, they are not likely to rate themselves or their situation as better. We used generic quality of life instruments because of a absence of validated measures for this population. The absence of notable changes in participant quality of life could be due to insufficient statistical power to detect small differences, but could also reflect an insensitivity of such generic quality-of-life assessments, which focus on physical and mood difficulties in a participant group for whom changes in these domains are not likely to take place with treatment. We had similar problems with the sensitivity of the Simpson Angus Scale, which could not detect clinically significant differences in potentially extrapyramidal symptoms reported by participants.</p>
              <p id="para390">The main limitation of our study was that recruitment was lower than expected. Despite our sample size, there was sufficient statistical power to show the substantial benefit of amisulpride over the first 12 weeks of treatment, even with only 100 patients randomised and suboptimal compliance. The benefits of continuing amisulpride compared with stopping after 12 weeks appeared to be similar to those in the first 12 weeks. However, with only 41 participants completing the first 12 weeks of treatment and entering the second randomisation between continuing and stopping amisulpride, this result, although plausible, requires confirmation in a larger study population. A further limitation was the variable duration of this second stage of treatment, which was initially 24 weeks but was reduced to 12 weeks to improve compliance, making it difficult to recommend an optimal duration of treatment. Missing outcome assessments can also introduce bias, particularly if participants with missing assessments are atypical, for example having worse than average symptoms. However, few patients in this study had no post-randomisation assessments and we tried to limit potential bias from missing data by carrying forward assessments from week 4, for the few participants who were not assessed at week 12. Results were similar with or without this imputation, thus we do not believe that the few missing assessments had any substantial effect on our conclusions.</p>
              <p id="para400">The greatest difficulty we encountered with recruitment to the ATLAS trial was the inability of many potential participants to appreciate that antipsychotic treatment could benefit them. Insight into the presence of illness and the possible benefits of treatment is uncommon in this group,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> who are often only persuaded to take antipsychotic medication by the argument that it might improve their sleep or anxiety, rather than because it might help with their psychosis symptoms. Notably, some patients said that they had been motivated to participate in this study because their clinical teams were advocating the use of antipsychotic treatment and they recognised that involvement in the trial carried a 1 in 3 chance of allocation to placebo, which they found attractive.</p>
              <p id="para410">Although substantial numbers of patients declined to take part in the ATLAS trial, the clear benefits seen in our study population should be reproducible in usual clinical practice. Those who took part in ATLAS are likely to be representative of the patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis that clinicians can successfully engage with drug treatment in usual practice. Similarly, some participants in the ATLAS trial might have had dementia pathologies, but this potential diagnostic heterogeneity will also be true of any group of patients considered by their psychiatrists to have very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and so the results of the ATLAS trial will apply to the treatment of typical future patients despite occasional diagnostic uncertainty.</p>
              <p id="para420">The difficulties we experienced in recruiting patients to the ATLAS trial reflect the more general challenge of engaging this clinical population in treatment. Even when patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis cooperate with a specialist mental health team for assessment, less than half will agree to take an antipsychotic and less than a third will be on treatment at 12-month follow-up or at the point of discharge to primary care.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Such low prevalence of antipsychotic treatment would be considered unacceptable in younger people with schizophrenia and the clear evidence of benefits from antipsychotic treatment shown in the ATLAS trial should encourage clinicians to be more confident that active treatment will benefit patients, and drive a more assertive approach to antipsychotic treatment in this vulnerable group. With less uncertainty about the benefits of amisulpride treatment, and without the additional complication of explaining randomised trials and placebo control, a greater proportion of future patients might agree to treatment than agreed to join the ATLAS trial. If patients do agree to treatment, even those with the least insight would be expected to benefit, because we found, if anything, greater benefits from amisulpride in those with more severe symptoms.</p>
