              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cognitive dysfunction is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), with the prevalence of
impairment ranging from 34% to 65%.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It exerts a disproportionate impact on function and employment and is present
from the earliest stages of the disease, or even pre-morbidly.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Cognitive dysfunction is particularly prevalent in patients with secondary
progressive MS (PwSPMS), where 50%–75% are impaired.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Deficits are often multifaceted, most commonly involving processing speed and
episodic memory, in addition to executive, verbal and visuospatial
abilities.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
Treatments for cognitive dysfunction are limited, although there is evidence to
support the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation, and licensed disease-modifying
therapies (DMTs) for PwSPMS (siponimod) may delay the rate of decline on cognitive
outcomes.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Multiple MRI metrics have been identified as risk factors for future cognitive decline.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In addition to higher T2 lesion volume (T2LV), more severe atrophy of both
cortical and deep grey matter structures has consistently been associated with
poorer cognitive performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Two studies have reported that
in patients with progressive MS, greater cortical atrophy in particular is
associated with faster cognitive decline.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There is also increasing evidence to support the use of neurofilament light (NfL)
levels as a biomarker of cognitive dysfunction. Cross-sectionally, higher serum or
plasma NfL has been associated with poorer cognition across multiple

predictors of current and future cognitive performance in PwSPMS. The key objective
was to assess to what extent sNfL is predictive of future cognitive decline in
PwSPMS beyond the variability already accounted for by T2LV and normalised brain

                      <p>The central column presents the beta coefficients for the
relationship between baseline WASI Full Scale IQ performance
(dependent variable) and the baseline predictor variables. The right
column presents the beta coefficients for the relationship between
the change in WASI Full Scale IQ and the same predictor variables.
The WASI Full Scale IQ is expressed on a Z-score scale. Time is
expressed in months, and hence, the change in WASI Full Scale IQ is
expressed as points per month. All results are derived from a single
linear mixed model which included all predictors and covariates,
together with their interaction with time. As baseline sNfL is
expressed on a log<sub>2</sub> scale, the relationship with the
dependent variable relates to a doubling of baseline sNfL. For MRI
variables, the relationship with the dependent variable relates to a
1 mL change in these baseline variables. The following additional
baseline covariates and their interaction with time were included in
the model: year in education, premorbid IQ (derived from the
National Adult Reading Test), age, sex, dichotomised baseline EDSS
(&lt; 6.0 vs ⩾ 6.0), trial treatment group (simvastatin or placebo)
and TIV.</p>

log<sub>2</sub> scale, the relationship with the dependent
variable relates to a doubling of baseline sNfL. For MRI variables,
the relationship with the dependent variable relates to a 1 mL
change in these baseline variables. The following additional
baseline covariates and their interaction with time were also
included in the model: years in education, premorbid IQ (derived
from the National Adult Reading Test), age, sex, dichotomised
baseline EDSS (&lt; 6.0 vs ⩾ 6.0), trial treatment group
(simvastatin or placebo) and TIV. The coefficient estimates and

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have assessed the extent to which sNfL can predict future decline in cognitive
performance in PwSPMS from the MS-STAT trial. In the pre-specified primary analysis,
we have demonstrated that independent of T2LV and selected regional normalised
volumes, higher baseline sNfL was associated with a faster subsequent rate of
decline in WASI Full Scale IQ from baseline to Month 24. The predicted 0.010
[0.003–0.017] point per month decline for each doubling of baseline sNfL corresponds
to a 0.24 [0.07–0.41] point decline over the 24 months of the trial on the Z-score
scale. For comparison, patients who have experienced a traumatic brain injury have a
WASI Full Scale IQ of 0.64–0.87 points lower than a matched control group (on the
Z-score scale).<sup><xref rid="bibr22-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> None of the other predictors were associated with future decline on the WASI
Full Scale IQ. In contrast to the association of sNfL with future changes in
cognition, when assessed individually, higher T2LV and lower nCGM volume, nDGM
volume and nTTG volume were associated with poorer current cognitive performance,
with the association between cognition and nTTG volume remaining significant in the
combined analysis. The results of our primary analysis were supported by secondary
analyses. Lower nCGM volume, nDGM volume and nTTG volume were again found to often
be associated with poorer baseline cognitive performance. Higher baseline sNfL was
associated with a faster rate of decline in measures of verbal comprehension and on
the VOSP cube analysis, and higher T2LV with faster decline on the PASAT. The
significant independent relationships for sNfL were further supported by exploratory
univariable analyses, as shown in <xref rid="fig1-13524585221114441" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
              <p>The demonstration that baseline MRI variables were often associated with current
cognitive performance, while sNfL was associated with future cognitive decline, is
biologically plausible. Normalised regional volumes estimate the cumulative loss
since maximum brain volume was achieved.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Similarly, once formed, T2 lesions typically persist on MRI, hence T2LV also
represents a cumulative measure of overall disease burden. Both such measures
therefore incorporate pathological processes which may have occurred at any point
during a patient’s disease (median 21 years in this cohort). As expected, our data
suggest that this disease burden is related to current cognitive performance. In
contrast, sNfL is released from ongoing neuro-axonal injury, and unlike regional
volumes or T2LV, sNfL has a half-life, remaining elevated for perhaps only 3 months
after an episode of disease activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Elevations in sNfL have been consistently associated with measures of recent
inflammatory disease activity in patients with progressive MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Our data are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that increases in sNfL
(representing the degree of ongoing neuro-axonal injury, largely caused by
neuroinflammation) are not independently associated with poorer current cognitive
performance, but instead are associated with a faster rate of future cognitive
decline. In this regard, elevated sNfL may share similarities with
gadolinium-enhancing lesions, which were not assessed in this cohort but have also
previously been associated with poorer future cognitive performance in pwMS.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Our results are also in keeping with the results reported for other
neurodegenerative conditions and cognitively normal older adults.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Other fluid
biomarkers previously associated with cognitive decline in pwMS include CSF CHI3L1
(a marker of glial activation) and oligoclonal bands, with the latter potentially
driven by its association with cortical lesions.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>

performance is in keeping with previously reported studies in pwMS.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr8-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The results for the nTTG
volume, which was associated with WASI Full Scale IQ, WASI performance IQ, memory
and executive function, are more novel. Interestingly, a recent study has reported
similar results in patients recently diagnosed with relapsing–remitting multiple
sclerosis (RRMS): lower nTTG volume was associated with poorer cognitive performance
using the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests (BRBN).<sup><xref rid="bibr30-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Similar results have been reported in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
or mild cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> These findings may relate to the location of the primary auditory cortex
within the TTG, and its role in attention and learning from auditory cues.
<sup><xref rid="bibr30-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The longitudinal changes in predictor variables, including change in sNfL, were not
independently associated with cognitive performance, beyond the variance accounted
for by baseline predictors. This may in part reflect the hypothesis that clinical
progression, such as cognitive decline, is primed by earlier neuroinflammation.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Baseline sNfL, representing recent inflammatory-mediated neuro-axonal injury,
may therefore be associated with the future decline in cognition via the
precipitated neurodegenerative mechanisms. Subsequent change in sNfL levels,
however, may not be associated with concomitant changes in cognitive performance as
a delay is required before the precipitated clinical progression becomes apparent.
This is analogous to an inverse of the therapeutic lag which is frequently seen with
anti-inflammatory DMTs.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Studies with longer clinical follow-up would be required to confirm whether
early changes in sNfL are associated with future changes in cognition, independent
of baseline sNfL.</p>
              <p>The participant excluded in the sensitivity analysis warrants discussion. The
markedly elevated baseline sNfL (116 pg/mL), together with the slow baseline 25-foot
walk, both of which subsequently improved during follow-up, suggests inflammatory
disease activity was present at baseline. While recent relapse was an exclusion
criterion for the MS-STAT trial, we speculate that this participant may have been
experiencing an undiagnosed spinal cord relapse at baseline, causing high sNfL and
poor lower limb function, but relative sparing of future cognitive performance.
Future studies should assess whether sNfL is a stronger prognostic factor for
cognition in clinically stable patients, rather than in those experiencing a
relapse.</p>
              <p>The neuropsychological battery used in the original MS-STAT trial was specifically
chosen to ensure as broad a coverage of cognitive domains as would be possible. To
do so, we applied tests widely used in the study of acquired neurological disorders
associated with cognitive impairment, notably the neurodegenerative diseases. The
aim was to reduce the risk that some aspects of cognition may be impaired in SPMS
that are not captured by other cognitive batteries, such as Brief International
Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS), BRBN and Minimal Assessment of Cognitive
Function in MS (MACFIMS). All of these tests are shorter and less comprehensive than
our test battery, and this reflects the rationale for their usage – namely to
provide a <italic toggle="yes">brief</italic> cognitive assessment in MS.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For this current analysis, we then made the a priori decision to use WASI
Full Scale IQ as the primary outcome, with all other cognitive measures performed in
the MS-STAT trial as secondary outcomes. The WASI Full Scale IQ represents a broad
measure of overall cognitive performance, based on four subtests (<xref rid="table1-13524585221114441" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="bibr35-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> It is widely used in dementia research where, for example, it has been
validated as a cross-sectional and longitudinal measure of cognition in AD or in
mixed neurological cohorts.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="bibr37-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr38-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>
Interestingly, similar to our findings, higher sNfL was associated with greater
estimated change in WASI Full Scale IQ in autosomal dominant AD and also associated
with poorer WASI similarities performance in frontotemporal dementia.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> The BIRT
memory battery has also been validated against the histological severity of
hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy and is sensitive to decline
following anterior temporal lobe resection.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> While the WASI and BIRT are
not commonly used in MS research, previous work has found that lower WASI Full Scale
IQ was associated with slower walking speed and higher risk of falls in a cohort of
78 pwMS and baseline WASI performance has been reported in a randomised controlled
trial of cognitive rehabilitation for pwMS.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In summary, we felt that the requirement for more comprehensive cognitive outcome
measures was warranted given the aim and hypotheses of the original MS-STAT
interventional trial. This has then allowed us to examine the relationships between
these detailed cognitive outcomes and the sNfL and MRI predictors included in this
analysis. We do accept that our measures are not currently widely used in the MS
field and would propose that future work aim to compare the effect size of these
study tests with those of BICAMS/MACFIMS/BRBN in predicting cognitive
dysfunction.</p>
              <p>A further point to note on the WASI was that the degree of cognitive impairment
(defined as Z-score &lt; −1.5) in this cohort was low (<xref rid="table2-13524585221114441" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with previous
data using the WASI in a mixed cohort of pwMS, which also found that few
participants were defined as cognitively impaired.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> An established weakness of using definitions of cognitive impairment based on
normative data, however, is that patients may experience an important decline in
cognitive function, but still not meet the required threshold to be deemed
cognitively impaired.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A previous study found that pwMS had significantly poorer performance
compared to healthy controls on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (which is
closely related to the WASI), despite T-scores apparently still within the normal range.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> While few of our participants were cross-sectionally defined as cognitively
impaired on the WASI, our use of longitudinal repeated assessments is therefore
preferable for assessing cognitive decline. Procedural learning effects are known to
be relevant for components of the WASI and would be expected to result in improved
participant performance on repeat assessments.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Despite this, 44% of participants declined on the WASI Full Scale IQ during
the trial, similar to the number who declined on the PASAT (42%).</p>
              <p>The treatment of cognition is a research priority for the MS community. Our
group-level analysis, however, cannot be used to determine an individual patients’
risk. Randomised controlled trial data support the ability of immunosuppressive DMTs
to both suppress sNfL levels and delay cognitive decline.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-13524585221114441" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Further research is required
to determine whether elevated sNfL may be useful in identifying patients that may
benefit most from such DMT in terms of future cognitive outcomes.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that in PwSPMS, elevated baseline sNfL was
independently associated with a faster future rate of decline in WASI Full Scale IQ.
In contrast, normalised regional brain volumes were frequently associated with
poorer current cognitive performance. Future research should aim to assess whether
elevated sNfL can identify PwSPMS that may benefit most from interventions aimed at
slowing cognitive decline.</p>
