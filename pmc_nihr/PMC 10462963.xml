                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Flexor tendons are traditionally repaired under either general anaesthesia (GA) or regional anaesthesia (RA), allowing for the use of an arm tourniquet to minimise blood loss and establish a bloodless surgical field. However, the use of tourniquets exposes the patient to certain risks, including skin, muscle and nerve injuries. A recent advancement in anaesthesia delivery involves the use of a wide-awake approach where no sedation nor tourniquets are used (wide-awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT)). WALANT uses local anaesthetic with epinephrine to provide pain relief and vasoconstriction, reducing operative bleeding. Several studies revealed potential benefits for WALANT compared with GA or RA. However, there remains a paucity of high-quality evidence to support the use of WALANT. As a result of this uncertainty, the clinical practice varies considerably. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of WALANT as an alternative to GA and RA in patients undergoing surgical repair of flexor tendon injuries. This involves addressing factors such as clinician and patient support for a trial, clinical equipoise, trial recruitment and dropout and the most relevant outcomes measures for a future definitive trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>WAFER is a multicentre, single-blinded, parallel group, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility of WALANT versus RA and GA. The target population is patients with acute traumatic flexor tendon injuries, across 3 major hand surgery units in England involving a total of 60 participants. Outcome assessors will be blinded. The primary outcome will be the ability to recruit patients into the trial, while secondary outcomes include difference in functional outcome, patient-reported outcome measures, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and complication rates.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Hand injuries account for up to 20% of all presentations to emergency departments, equating to 4.6 million patients annually in the UK alone and resulting in an average of 8 weeks of lost workdays.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> In patients with hand injuries, tendon lacerations are common and are reported in 54.8% of patients with a shallow laceration and 92.5% with deeper injury.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Patients with complete tendon laceration will require surgical repair, which is typically performed in the operating room, using an arm tourniquet to minimise blood loss and provide a clear surgical field.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The use of a tourniquet is associated with significant discomfort and is not well tolerated by patients without general anaesthesia (GA) or regional anaesthesia (RA).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>A recent advancement in the method of anaesthesia delivery in hand surgery involves the introduction of wide-awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> WALANT involves administering local anaesthesia (LA) with epinephrine for anaesthetic and vasoconstriction effect, respectively.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The vasoconstrictive effect of epinephrine achieves reduced bleeding at the site of surgery, hence acting as a chemical tourniquet and eliminating the need for a mechanical arm tourniquet. Removing the need for tourniquet and therefore GA/RA has several potential advantages for patients. First, patients can make immediate postoperative recovery, ultimately shortening the patient stay in hospital. GA is associated with side effects such as nausea and vomiting along with serious cardiac and respiratory risks especially among patients undergoing emergency surgery, elderly, smokers and overweight patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> RA avoids these risks but exposes the patient to the risk of permanent or temporary nerve damage (1 in 10) and failure of providing adequate pain relief resulting in conversion to GA (3 in 100).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Tourniquet use has also been linked to increased postoperative pain and side effects such as muscle, nerve and skin injury and post-tourniquet thrombosis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 12</xref></p>
              <p>While WALANT requires multiple injections that may cause temporary discomfort, it avoids many of the significant issues associated with GA and RA. Furthermore, patients who undergo WALANT have been reported to have a decreased need for post-operative pain relief.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Additionally, WALANT allows the surgeon to intraoperatively evaluate the tendon repair, while the patient actively moves their fingers, allowing adjustments to be made before skin closure. This has been shown to improve surgical outcomes and reduce the need for revision surgery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Patients can also receive education during the procedure to aid their rehabilitation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There are also potential economic and environmental benefits to using WALANT, as it does not require an anaesthetist, requires fewer clinical staff (anaesthetist, anaesthetic assistant, recovery nurse) and produces fewer anaesthetic waste gases.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>In recent years, WALANT has gained significant popularity as an alternative to GA or RA with tourniquet for flexor tendon repairs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While studies have suggested that it may have similar safety and potential benefits in comparison to GA or RA with a tourniquet, it should be noted that these studies are either retrospective in nature or lack sufficient statistical power to make definitive conclusions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> Furthermore, it is important to determine the outcomes that are important to be measured, evaluate equipoise among clinicians to recruit to a study comparing WALANT against GA/RA and acceptability of the trial to patients and clinicians before a definitive trial can be carried out. In addition, because of the uncertainty about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WALANT compared with standard of care and the variation is clinical practice, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WALANT is necessary. A feasibility study is hence necessary to help with the design of the definitive RCT. The WAFER trial therefore aims to evaluate the feasibility of WALANT as an alternative to GA or RA in patients undergoing surgical repair of traumatic laceration of flexor tendons of the hand.</p>

                <p>The WAFER trial is a multicentre, assessor-blinded, feasibility RCT with two parallel groups (WALANT vs GA/RA) conducted in three sites within the UK. Eligible patients will be randomised to WALANT or GA/RA for flexor tendon repair using a computerised randomisation method. This protocol is reported in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials 2013 guidelines.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Patient representatives who have had flexor tendon injury were involved in the design of this trial by providing feedback via online surveys and focus group meetings. A total of 27 patients were involved in the online survey and another 12 patients were involved in focus group meetings to identify priorities and outcomes of a flexor tendon study. Two patient representatives have been involved in designing and revising the trial to ensure that patient interests are central to the study design and that the trial is written clearly avoiding excessive or unnecessary medical jargon.</p>

                <p>Participants will be recruited at the Royal Free Hospital, Manchester University National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, and Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust. This trial is open to recruiting additional sites through National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Patients presenting to the accident and emergency unit or outpatient clinics with acute traumatic flexor tendon ruptures will be reviewed by a hand surgeon and assessed. Normal clinical practice is that all patients will be assessed clinically and if the flexor tendon is lacerated, it will be scheduled for repair under GA/RA or WALANT in the operating theatre. On scheduling the patient for surgery, patients will be flagged to the research team. At this time, patients will be screened and where appropriate be offered a patient information sheet for inclusion into the trial. This process will include explanation of the aims, methods of anaesthesia and surgery, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. Patients will be given sufficient time (24 hours or more if needed) to consider whether they wish to participate. Once the patients are ready for surgery, following review by the study team, patients will be assessed clinically to confirm ‘inclusion and exclusion criteria’ are met and an informed consent form will be completed, following which patients will be randomised to either of the treatment arms and enrolled into the study. Patient related data will be recorded in a patient assessment form.</p>

                  <p>Patients will have the procedure in an operating theatre under WALANT without an arm tourniquet. WALANT uses a mixture of LA with epinephrine to provide anaesthesia and haemostasis. A mixture of 1% xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200 000 will be injected into the digit or hand requiring surgery. This mixture is routinely used in clinical practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> The mixture is used in a ‘field block’ technique where 2 mL is injected into the subcutaneous fat in the middle of the base of the proximal and middle phalanges between both digital nerves, and 1 mL is injected into the distal phalanx. In addition, 10–15 mL LA will be injected in the palm where dissection will be performed.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
                  <p>Following injection, surgeons typically wait about 20 min for the haemostatic effect of epinephrine before incision. The flexor tendon repair will be performed as per standard practice using 4-strand core repair with epitendinous stitch as per the British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) guidelines.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>

                  <p>Patients will have the procedure in an operating theatre under either RA or GA as per the anaesthetist’s safe standard practice. RA is preferentially chosen unless there is a contraindication. An axillary, supraclavicular or infraclavicular brachial plexus block is performed awake using ultrasound guidance and may be supplemented with ultrasound guided peripheral nerve (ulnar and/or median) blocks. Lignocaine (1% or 2%) and/or bupivacaine (0.25% or 0.5%) with or without 1:200 000 epinephrine is given for the blocks at a calculated safe dose depending on the patient’s weight. GA is administered either as inhalational anaesthesia using sevoflurane or total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and a short-acting opiate (remifentanil or alfentanil). Analgesia is given intravenously as per the WHO analgesic ladder during a GA, with LA topical infiltration by the surgeons. The surgical procedure will be performed as per standard practice with the use of an arm tourniquet for haemostasis. The tendon repair will be performed with 4-strand core repair with epitendinous stitch as per BSSH guidelines.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>

                <p>A sample size of 200 eligible patients will be approached and asked to give their consent to be randomised into the trial. We anticipate that the approximate recruitment (randomisation) rate will be 30% of the approached patients. As such, 200 patients would be sufficient to be able to estimate the consent rate to within±0.07 through construction of 95% CI for the recruitment rate. Under the assumption that the recruitment rate is approximately 30%, we anticipate that up to 60 patients will be randomised (1:1 WALANT:RA/GA) to take part in the study. Our local audit informed that on an average over 100 cases of tendon repairs are performed per year by each centre of varying complexity.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

The interviews will explore patient’s perspectives of the treatment, their understanding of the two treatments, their reasons for taking part or refusing the trial and their acceptability of randomisation between the procedures. Purposive sampling will be used to select participants according to their age, pre-existing comorbidities and recruitment centre. A total of 40 patient interviews and 15 staff interviews will be conducted across the 3 sites. This method of sampling will ensure that a wide range of experiences and perceptions are collected. Interviews will continue until data saturation is reached. We will recruit patients who refused randomisation, those who consented and those who withdrew consent. We will also recruit members of staff in charge of delivering the trial to understand trial delivery processes and identify any issues with recruitment.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting an RCT that compares the use of WALANT and RA/GA as methods of anaesthesia for flexor tendon repairs. The results of this study will inform the design of a larger, more comprehensive trial. By examining factors such as patient and clinician acceptability, recruitment rates and key clinical outcome measures, the study aims to identify the most important and relevant considerations for a definitive trial. Additionally, the study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of WALANT as compared with the traditional standard of care in order to provide insights into the financial implications of using this method of anaesthesia.</p>
              <p>In designing this study, we conducted a retrospective observational study, an online survey and performed a focus group meeting with experts in the field, including hand surgeons, hand therapists and patients. In our retrospective study, we examined 151 patients involving a total of 251 tendon ruptures repaired either under WALANT or Regional/GA anaesthesia.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Our analysis revealed no significant differences in rates of tendon rupture, adhesions, infection or hand function between the two groups. These findings suggest that WALANT may be a safe and effective alternative to GA/RA with comparable surgical and functional outcomes. Additionally, WALANT allowed for intraoperative testing of the repair, provided patient education and had the potential to increase theatre efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, this data is limited by the retrospective nature of the study, small sample size and potential confounders related to severity of injury, therefore the true difference between groups is not known. Meanwhile, an online survey involving 60 participants (26 hand surgeons, 7 hand therapists and 27 patients) followed by a focus group meeting involving 22 participants (8 hand surgeons, 2 hand therapists and 12 patients) were carried out to identify priorities and outcomes of a flexor tendon study. Most of our survey participants (95.3%) agreed that a trial comparing WALANT against RA/GA should be performed. Overall, 83.9% of clinicians were willing to recruit or encourage recruitment, while 83% of patients were willing to participate in such a study. The focus group participants agreed that the important outcomes that should be compared are functional outcome, patient satisfaction and the difference in complications. The patients in our focus group mentioned that they would consider the new approach only if it provided at least equivalent hand function as the current standard of care. Our survey and focus group indicated good support from clinicians and patients to participate in a trial of this nature; however, there is a need to evaluate equipoise among all parties. Our focus group also suggested that some outcomes are more important than others. Therefore, it is important to find out the acceptability of the trial to patients and clinicians, recruitment rate, primary outcome of subsequent definitive trial and the difference in the primary outcome that can be considered a meaningful difference. Therefore, a feasibility study needs to be conducted to assess the practicality of conducting a larger, more conclusive trial, as well as to determine the most important outcomes to measure. This feasibility study will also provide valuable insights for future research in hand surgery, particularly with regard to study design and outcome selection.</p>
