                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cancer recurrence after curative cancer surgery significantly impacts patients and healthcare services. Before surgery, a small number of clinically undetectable circulating tumour cells are often present. The surgical stress response promotes the distribution and proliferation of circulating tumour cells leading to cancer recurrence and metastasis. Preclinical evidence suggests that lidocaine may exert ‘anti-cancer’ effects and alleviate pro-metastatic environments. The Feasibility Study of Lidocaine Infusion During Bowel Cancer Surgery for Cancer Outcome (FLICOR) will assess the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial on perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion for postoperative colorectal cancer outcomes.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The study is a double-blinded, randomised, controlled pilot study for a full trial comparing intravenous lidocaine administration at 1.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> bolus followed by 1.5 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> infusion for 24 h with placebo in patients undergoing minimally invasive (laparoscopy or robotic) colorectal cancer surgery. The feasibility of data collection instruments will be measured, including those for future economic evaluation and clinical and patient-reported outcomes. For the exploratory outcomes, blood samples will be collected before and after surgery on days 0, 1, and 3. Recruitment is planned for two NHS Trusts over 6 months with a 12-month follow-up. Patients and clinicians will be asked for their feedback on the study process.</p>

            <p id="p0010">Cancer recurrence can lead to metastatic disease and significantly affects patients and healthcare services. The implication of cancer recurrence is not only through the increased morbidity and mortality but also the cost associated with the additional treatment, loss of income, and other negative impacts on society.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Surgery is the main curative treatment for colorectal cancer.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Recurrence after surgery occurs in up to 50% of patients and is the leading cause of cancer death.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Therefore, exploring strategies to reduce cancer recurrence after surgery is of utmost importance.</p>
            <p id="p0015">At the time of diagnosis, there are often a few clinically undetectable circulating tumour cells.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> During surgery, the unavoidable tissue damage and manipulation of tumour and its vasculature also result in the shedding of further circulating tumour cells; they may form micro-metastases that could predispose to metastasis.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Surgery induces stress, inflammation, and immune suppression.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> These responses promote the distribution of cancer cells leading to cancer recurrence and metastasis.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0020">Manipulating the pro-metastatic response to surgery with a therapeutic agent may reduce or even prevent circulating tumour cells from establishing a permanent latch in target tissues.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Developing new anti-metastatic drugs is expensive, but repurposing a cheap, established one such as lidocaine may provide an affordable alternative.</p>
            <p id="p0025">In preclinical studies, lidocaine showed potential anti-metastatic properties via various mechanisms, such as direct inhibitory effects on cancer cells and indirect impact on the cancer cell microenvironment.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Lidocaine has been shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasive potential.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Lidocaine impedes the cancer microenvironment via anti-inflammatory effects and immune protection to reduce cancer cell invasion, migrations, and subsequent metastasis.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> A recent narrative review highlighted lidocaine's potential in cancer management.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0030">The anti-metastatic potential of lidocaine is evident in preclinical studies. However, a robust clinical trial is needed to determine if this evidence is reciprocated in clinical settings. For the clinical trial, it is necessary to decide what measures will work well and the barriers to running such a trial to ensure success.</p>
            <p id="p0035">The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of the current study protocol in the NHS setting and to identify potential barriers and facilitators to guide a future definitive trial. This objective includes evaluating the number of eligible patients with stage 2 or 3 colon or rectal cancer, the ability to recruit and the recruitment rates, the feasibility of study drug administration for 24 h from the start of general anaesthesia, including the availability of cardiac monitored beds postoperatively for completing the 24-h infusion, and retaining trial participants for follow-up. The secondary objective is to explore the feasibility and burden of data collection instruments, including clinical and patient-reported outcomes, those for a future economic evaluation, and to explore potential biomarkers to indicate the efficacy of lidocaine in reducing metastatic risks such as cell-free DNA and pro-metastatic cytokines. The protocol will be deemed feasible if 70% of eligible patients are approached, recruiting at least 40% of these, loss to follow-up of &lt;25% at 12 months, successful delivery of the study drug for 24 h for 90% of patients, and 90% of clinicians agree to recruit.</p>

Part of this work is to establish eligibility and recruitment rates over 6 months to determine the number of sites needed for the main study. Based on a high-throughput NHS colorectal surgery unit in Thames Valley, 70 patients underwent similar surgery over 6 months from a 2-yr average. If 40% enrolment is feasible, up to 28 patients could be recruited over 6 months at this site. Therefore, we estimated the recruitment of 50 patients across two NHS sites and supplied 60 IMP to account for potential wastage and will allow over-recruitment to 60 patients across both sites. The trial feasibility outcomes will guide our definitive trial, where we wish to evaluate an absolute reduction of 10% in cancer recurrence rate at 2 yr postoperatively.

                <p id="p0325">The lidocaine dose chosen in this study is within the recommendations made by a recent international consensus statement on the safe use of i.v. lidocaine, where plasma concentrations of lidocaine usually remain below the toxic level of 5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The earliest symptoms and signs of toxicity are neurological and include peri-oral tingling, tinnitus, light-headedness, and restlessness. The severity of symptoms and signs occurs with increasing plasma concentration. The recommended dose used in this study is less likely to reach more than 5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> where the signs of CNS toxicity present in the order of increasing plasma concentrations as muscle twitching, loss of consciousness, convulsions, coma, and respiratory arrest.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Cardiovascular signs and ECG changes are late manifestations of lidocaine toxicity which include myocardial depression and cardiac arrhythmias preceding ventricular cardiac arrest.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0330">In the event that possible toxicity is expected, other explanations for a given clinical presentation should also be considered and cannot be ignored. In the event of an adverse incident in a patient receiving an IMP infusion: preserve the pump with its settings and memory intact to enable investigation; and take blood for later analysis of lidocaine levels in both ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes and lithium heparin tubes, per local requirements for assays. Treatment is supportive, and lipid rescue should also be instituted per the AAGBI guidelines (Management of severe local anaesthetic toxicity 2010).<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0335">With every adverse event, the investigator or qualified clinician named on the delegation log will make assessments of the severity and causality. The investigator should initiate the appropriate treatment according to their medical judgement. Participants will be asked about daily potential adverse events up to hospital discharge. They will also be asked about possible adverse events during the 6- and 12-month follow-up.</p>
                <p id="p0340">Adverse events that occur from the day of IMP administration until 30 days later will be recorded. Adverse events attributable to lidocaine toxicity will be based on its well-documented side-effect profile in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Deterioration of existing cancer or known side-effects of other cancer treatments are not reported as SAEs or reactions but are recorded separately. This also includes mortality caused by the known nature of cancer, surgery, or complications of surgery. Other exceptions include hospitalisation for routine treatment or monitoring of cancer not associated with the IMP, pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition not associated with any deterioration, and any admission to a hospital or other institution for general care that does not fulfil the definition of SAE. An SAE form should be completed and sent to the trial email inbox within 24 h.</p>
