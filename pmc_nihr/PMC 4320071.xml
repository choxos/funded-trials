                <p>The entry of neutrophils into tissue has been well characterised; however the fate of these cells once inside the tissue microenvironment is not fully understood. A variety of signal transduction pathways including those involving class I PI3 Kinases have been suggested to be involved in neutrophil migration. This study aims to determine the involvement of PI3 Kinases in chemokinetic and chemotactic neutrophil migration in response to CXCL8 and GM-CSF in a three-dimensional collagen gel, as a model of tissue. Using a three-dimensional collagen assay chemokinetic and chemotactic migration induced by CXCL8 was inhibited with the pan PI3 Kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Analysis of the specific Class I PI3 Kinase catalytic isoforms alpha, delta and gamma using the inhibitors PIK-75, PIK-294 and AS-605240 respectively indicated differential roles in CXCL8-induced neutrophil migration. PIK-294 inhibited both chemokinetic and chemotactic CXCL8-induced migration. AS-605240 markedly reduced CXCL8 induced chemokinetic migration but had no effect on CXCL8 induced chemotactic migration. In contrast PIK-75 inhibited chemotactic migration but not chemokinetic migration. At optimal concentrations of GM-CSF the inhibitors had no effect on the percentage of neutrophil migration in comparison to the control however at suboptimal concentrations wortmannin, AS-605240 and PIK-294 inhibited chemokinesis. This study suggests that PI3 Kinase is necessary for CXCL8 induced migration in a 3D tissue environment but that chemokinetic and chemotactic migration may be controlled by different isoforms with gamma shown to be important in chemokinesis and alpha important in chemotaxis. Neutrophil migration in response to suboptimal concentrations of GM-CSF is dependent on PI3 Kinase, particularly the gamma and delta catalytic isoforms.</p>

              <p>Neutrophil accumulation in the tissue plays an important role in host defence to a wide range of infections. However, in chronic inflammatory diseases neutrophil accumulation within tissue can be detrimental. The entry of neutrophils into the tissue has been well characterised [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], however, the fate of these cells once inside the tissue microenvironment is not fully understood. An understanding of the signal transduction pathways controlling the migration of neutrophils within the lung could prove beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p>
              <p>There are three main forms of leucocyte migration, random, chemokinesis and chemotaxis. Both random and chemokinesis are non-directional motions the difference being that chemokinesis occurs in the presence of a (usually chemical), stimuli and random motion occurs in the absence of such stimuli. Chemotaxis is induced in response to a chemical stimulus, usually a chemoattractant but unlike chemokinesis the migration is directed towards the source of the stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>PI3Ks have been suggested to play an important role in neutrophil migration, with many authors showing substantial inhibition in the absence of PI3K [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors lead to the activation of class I PI3Ks, which are responsible for controlling the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphophate to form phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate has an important role in the development of cell polarity, which is necessary for cell motility and directional sensing [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the context of neutrophil migration two classes of PI3K are thought to be involved, Class IA and Class IB. Class IA contains the catalytic subunits Î±, Î² and Î´ [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Class IB contains the catalytic subunit Î³ [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent experimental evidence has suggested distinct requirements for the Î´ and Î³ subunits in migration and recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In response to stimulation with fMLF chemokinesis was shown to be critically dependent on the gamma isoform. However the PI3KÎ³ was not required for gradient sensing and gradient-biased movement and was therefore not thought to be involved in chemotaxis [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast fMLF-induced chemotaxis was dependent on the delta isoform whereas chemokinesis was PI3KÎ´ independent [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition PI3KÎ³ was vital for early neutrophil migration into inflamed tissue whereas in delayed neutrophil emigration in response to neutrophil chemokines, PI3KÎ´ replaces PI3KÎ³ and maintains the migration [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Boyden chamber assay is used in the majority of the literature to study neutrophil migration. However, this assay is essentially two-dimensional (2D) and does not relate closely to the environment encountered by the neutrophil once it enters tissue, which presents migrational clues in a 3D context with signals from the tissue matrix and tissue resident cells and structures. There may be significant differences in the adhesive, chemoattractant and signalling processes between 2D and 3D contexts. For example, leukocyte migration over a 2D surface is integrin dependent, whereas rapid migration in a 3D matrix can occur in the absence of integrin adhesion, as the cell migrates forward by pushing and squeezing itself between the matrix fibres [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Collagen is an important component of the extra-cellular matrix and lung remodelling in asthma is characterized by collagen deposition [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Leucocytes have been shown to display a similar pattern of migration in 3D collagen gels to that in vivo in peripheral tissue using intravital microscopy [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We have therefore used the 3D collagen gel assay to mimic the tissue to enable us to study the involvement of class I PI3Ks in CXCL8- and GM-CSF-induced neutrophil migration. In this study we show that neutrophils migrate in response to stimulation with CXCL8 or GM-CSF. Wortmannin inhibits CXCL8- and GM-CSF- induced neutrophil migration; however the migration was PI3K isoform specific depending on whether the migration was chemokinetic or chemotactic.</p>

                <title>Collagen gel and migration</title>
                <p>3D collagen gels were constructed as previously described by Muessel et al [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Purified neutrophils (6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cell/ml) were brought up in 2% FBS and used directly in the migration assays. In all experiments control cells were unstimulated neutrophils. Cells were mixed with collagen I, 10x MEM and sodium bicarbonate. For non gradient migration assays the chemoattractants and GM-CSF were added to the gel, the gel was then loaded into the chamber, which was made from a coverslip sealed with wax on a microscope slide and incubated at 37Â° for 1 hour prior to videotaping. For gradient migration assays the gel was loaded into approximately 3/4 of the chamber, which was made from a coverslip sealed with wax on a microscope slide and incubated at 37Â° for 1 hour prior to videotaping. Various chemoattractants were added to the final 1/4. Neutrophil migration was recorded by time-lapse video-microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 microscope (Germany) with a heated stage at magnification 20x N/A 0.3 and a QImaging Retiga 1300 CCD camera (BC, Canada). The movies were recorded and analysed by commercially available Improvision software (Coventry, UK, <xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

                <title>Neutrophil migration in 3D collagen gels</title>
                <p>To determine the normal migration pattern of neutrophils in a 3D environment, we stimulated the neutrophils with GM-CSF and CXCL8 in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of stimulation &lt;10% of cells migrated. CXCL8 in the non-gradient assay caused a dose-dependent chemokinetic migration with a maximum of 60% of cells migrating in response to 100ng/ml (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The average velocity of the neutrophils also increased dose-dependently with 100ng/ml and 300ng/ml stimulation causing the cells to move at 0.16Â±0.012Î¼m/s and 0.17Â±0.032Î¼m/s respectively, which was significantly faster compared to unstimulated cells (0.10Â±0.015Î¼m/s). The chemokinetic migration in response to 100ng/ml of CXCL8 in the non-gradient assay is highlighted in the vector diagram (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), which shows the direction of migration for each neutrophil in one gel. CXCL8 in the gradient assay caused a dose-dependent chemotactic response with a maximum of 75% of cells migrating in response to 300ng/ml (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Similarly the average velocity also increased in a dose dependent manner with 100ng/ml and 300ng/ml causing a significant increase in velocity to 0.17Â±0.017Î¼m/s and 0.18Â±0.009Î¼m/s respectively, compared to unstimulated cells (0.08Â±0.015Î¼m/s). In this case the vector diagram (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) shows the majority of cells are moving towards the CXCL8 in a chemotactic pattern of migration. GM-CSF induced vigorous migration in the non-gradient assay with a maximum of 79% of cells migrating in response to stimulation with 5ng/ml (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition the average velocity also increased dose dependently, stimulation with 5ng/ml and 50ng/ml caused a significant increase to 0.203Â±0.009Î¼m/s and 0.20Â±0.008Î¼m/s respectively, in comparison to unstimulated cells (0.10Â±0.015Î¼m/s). In contrast only modest migration was seen in the gradient assay, which was only significant at the highest dose of 50ng/ml (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The average velocity with 50ng/ml was 0.14Â±0.02Î¼m/s which was significantly higher than unstimulated cells (0.10Â±0.04Î¼m/s). In contrast to CXCL8 both the gradient and non-gradient assays resulted in chemokinetic patterns of stimulation (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>

                <p>PI3K is thought to play an important role in cell migration. The pan-inhibitor wortmannin was used initially in order to determine the importance of PI3K in neutrophil motility in our 3D assay. Treatment of neutrophils with 50nM wortmannin for 30 minutes prior to the addition of chemoattractant significantly inhibited CXCL8-induced migration in both the gradient and non-gradient assays (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the non-gradient assay treatment of cells with wortmannin (50nM, 30 min pre-treatment) significantly reduced migration in response to stimulation with 0.5ng/ml GM-CSF but had no significant effect on migration in response to stimulation with 50ng/ml GM-CSF (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).

These data highlight that PI3K is necessary for neutrophil migration in 3D gels in response to stimulation with CXCL8 and a sub-optimal concentration of GM-CSF.</p>

                <title>CXCL8 and GM-CSF stimulate Akt phosphorylation</title>
                <p>To determine the activation of PI3Ks phosphorylation of one of the downstream effectors of the PI3Ks can be examined. Phosphorylation of Akt was therefore examined. Western blotting shows that stimulation with CXCL8 with the DMSO control for the inhibitors (500ng/ml; 2 mins) increased phosphorylation of Akt in comparison to control unstimulated neutrophils (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, b) (p&lt;0.05). The vehicle control for the inhibitors (0.1% DMSO) had no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt in comparison to the CXCL8 stimulated cells. Prior to stimulation with CXCL8, pre-treatment of the cells with the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (50nM), PIK-294 (Î´, 10Î¼M) and AS-605240 (Î³, 10Î¼M) for 2 minutes, caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, b). Pre-treatment with PIK-75 (Î±, 1Î¼M) for 2 minutes caused a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt compared to stimulation with CXCL8 and DMSO (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, b)(p&lt;0.05). Akt was used as a control and showed bands of equal size indicating that the loading of each well was approximately the same so the effects seen with the Phosphorylated-Akt are due to differences in the stimulation and activation not in the quantity of cells loaded (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Neutrophils are normally not abundant in healthy tissue, however during periods of infection and inflammation neutrophil numbers escalate as they leave the blood to migrate to these sites. This is essential for host defence against infection however in some conditions including respiratory diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and asthma the presence of neutrophils within the tissue can be detrimental leading to tissue damage [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study investigated neutrophil migration in a 3D collagen environment designed to mimic the tissue environment of particularly the lung as the collagen accumulation is increased in the asthmatic lung [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This has highlighted clear differences in the control of migration in chemokinesis and chemotaxis in relation to signalling via PI3K. The neutrophils for this study were obtained from healthy volunteers in order to determine the normal pattern of migration prior to investigating the migration of cells from diseased individuals. We used CXCL8 as a physiologically relevant and reliable neutrophil chemoattractant that signals through G protein linked seven membrane chemoattractant receptors. fMLP gave a similar pattern of migration to CXCL8 in both the gradient and non-gradient gel (data not shown). We used GMCSF as a known priming and survival agent for neutrophils that was likely to be present at sites of neutrophilic inflammation. GMCSF signals through a tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates chemokinesis, but not chemotaxis. We considered it likely both these mediators would be present together in inflamed tissue and wished to investigate how neutrophils would integrate the responses through each pathway.</p>
              <p>Unlike unstimulated neutrophils, which were unable to move, stimulation with both CXCL8 and GM-CSF evoked a high proportion of cell migration. This contrasted with eosinophils, which migrated well to GM-CSF but only to a limited extent to chemotactic stimulation (eotaxin and C5a) in 3D gels [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The non-gradient and gradient stimulated respectively chemokinesis and chemotaxis in response to stimulation with CXCL8. In contrast in both the non-gradient and gradient assays migration in response to GM-CSF was chemokinetic. As the non-gradient and gradient migration patterns were essentially the same, we only used the non-gradient assay for subsequent experiments with GM-CSF.</p>
              <p>The class I PI3K catalytic subunits p110Î± and p110Î² are ubiquitously expressed, whereas in contrast the p110Î´ and p110Î³ isoforms are restricted to leucocytes in their expression [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These studies and the PCR data we presented show that all four class I PI3K isoforms can be expressed by neutrophils. We saw an additional band for PI3kinase delta which was larger than the predicted size. The identity of this band requires further investigation. A role for PI3Ks in neutrophil migration primarily using a 2D migration system has been previously demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our data using wortmannin confirmed this involvement. As when the cells were stimulated with CXCL8 or a suboptimal concentration of GM-CSF migration was almost completely abolished. Migration was not affected when the cells were stimulated with the optimal concentration of GM-CSF possibly because this activated the cells to such an extent that the concentration of the inhibitor was not sufficient to block migration although good inhibition of GM-CSF stimulated Akt phosphorylation by wortmannin was seen by western blotting. An alternative explanation is that the higher dose of GM-CSF activated a migration pathway that was not dependent on PI3 kinase phosphorylation of Akt.</p>
              <p>A role for the PI3KÎ´ isoform in migration has been previously described using the under agarose assay [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These authors demonstrated that pre-treatment of neutrophils with the PI3KÎ´ selective inhibitor, IC87114 inhibited chemotaxis, but had no effect on chemokinesis. It was therefore concluded that PI3KÎ´ was responsible for the directional orientation of neutrophils during migration [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our results confirm the involvement of PI3KÎ´ in chemotaxis as pre-treatment of the cells with the PI3KÎ´ selective inhibitor PIK-294 significantly reduced migration in response to stimulation with CXCL8. However in contrast to the above study our results also showed that blockage of PI3KÎ´ inhibited both CXCL8- and GM-CSF-induced chemokinesis. The neutrophils were pre-treated with two concentrations of PIK-294 and interestingly the lower concentration of inhibitor caused a greater reduction in CXCL8-induced chemokinesis compared to chemotaxis, the higher concentration caused approximately the same reduction in both chemokinesis and chemotaxis. The PI3KÎ´ inhibitor also antagonises PI3KÎ³ at a 10 fold higher concentration so we cannot therefore exclude the possibility that some of the inhibition could be due to cross-over inhibition of the Î³ isoform. However we feel this is unlikely considering the high dose of the PI3KÎ³ inhibitor required to achieve inhibition of chemokinesis.</p>
              <p>Inhibitor and knockout experiments with both human and mouse neutrophils have shown that migration is dependent on PI3KÎ³ [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Rather than being involved in both chemokinesis and chemotaxis it is thought that PI3KÎ³ may only be important for chemokinesis as Ferguson [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that pre-treatment with a PI3KÎ³ selective inhibitor significantly reduced the number of cells migrating when stimulated with fMLP in a Dunn chamber but had no effect on the migratory index, speed or direction. This lead to the conclusion that inhibition of PI3KÎ³ results in impaired chemokinesis but not the navigation of cells once they are moving [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our results support this as PI3KÎ³ inhibitor AS-605240 significantly reduced chemokinesis in the non-gradient assay in response to stimulation with CXCL8. In contrast chemotaxis in the gradient assay was unaffected by pre-treatment with AS-605240. Although migration induced by 50ng/ml GM-CSF in the non-gradient assay was not inhibited by AS-605240, when the cells were stimulated with 0.5ng/ml GM-CSF, pre-treatment with AS-605240 abolished neutrophil chemokinesis. The difference between the inhibition seen with the suboptimal and optimal concentration of GM-CSF was presumably due to the higher concentration of GM-CSF activating the cell to such an extent that the concentration of the inhibitor was not enough to completely prevent phosphorylation of the kinase although some inhibition was seen by western blotting (<xref rid="pone.0116250.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). As noted above however it is possible high doses of GM-CSF activate alternative signal transduction pathways. The failure of PI3 kinase inhibitors to prevent neutrophil chemokinesis to high concentrations of GM-CSF is reminiscent of the findings by Ferguson et al [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that LPS stimulated neutrophil migration was PI3 kinase independent.</p>
              <p>This is the first study to show the involvement of the PI3KÎ± isoform in human neutrophil chemotaxis in response to stimulation with CXCL8. Migration was not completely abolished therefore PI3KÎ± in addition to one or more of the other isoforms may be vital for chemotaxis. When neutrophils were pre-treated with a combination of both PI3KÎ± and Î´ inhibitors, chemotaxis in response to CXCL8 was further reduced highlighting an important combined role of the two isoforms for controlling neutrophil chemotaxis. This also suggests that the two isoforms are working through different pathways. The PI3KÎ± inhibitor does not have any effect on the Î´ isoform (see <xref rid="pone.0116250.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It does inhibit the Î³ isoform with a 13 fold higher IC50 however the Î³ inhibitor AS-605240 had no effect on gradient migration demonstrating that PIK-75 is indeed mediating its effects by inhibiting the Î± isoform.</p>

              <p>As Akt lies downstream of PI3Ks and may mediate some of the actions of PI3Ks, Akt phosphorylation was examined. CXCL8 has been shown previously to induce Akt phosphorylation, which can be reduced by pre-treatment with wortmannin [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0116250.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our experiments as expected CXCL8 induced Akt phosphorylation and this was reduced by pre-treatment with wortmannin and the PI3KÎ´ and Î³ selective inhibitors, however the PI3KÎ± selective inhibitor had no effect on the level of Akt phosphorylation. As with CXCL8, treatment with GM-CSF-induced Akt phosphorylation this was reduced by pre-treatment with wortmannin and the PI3KÎ´ and Î³ selective inhibitors. The PI3KÎ± selective inhibitor had no effect on Akt phosphorylation induced by stimulation with GM-CSF. Therefore while Akt may be involved in the migrating activity of PI3Î´ and Î³ this does not appear to be the case for alpha. However one caveat is that if we had used a longer pre-incubation time it is possible we would have seen great inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. The role of Akt in neutrophil migration has recently been explored; a deletion in Akt2 was shown to impair neutrophil migration [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Akt2 could therefore be an important component in controlling neutrophil migration.</p>
              <p>The specificity of pharmacological inhibitors can always be challenged and ideally our observations with pharmacological inhibitors should be confirmed with molecular approaches to knock down the relevant gene and protein. Gene deletion in an animal model is not within the scope of this paper although as noted above such studies have supported our findings using the pharmacological inhibitor of the gamma subunit [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Gene deletion of the alpha unit was shown to be embryonically lethal and we could find no papers on gene deletion of the delta subunit [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As far as we are aware siRNA approaches to reducing expression of the PI3 kinase isoforms to investigate migration are not possible in freshly isolated human blood neutrophils due to their short life span and low biosynthetic capacity.</p>
              <p>The signal transduction events controlling neutrophil migration are complex and remain incompletely understood. As shown by our data and by others [<xref rid="pone.0116250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], PI(3)KÎ³dependent phosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 to PtdIns(3,4)P3 (PIP2 to PIP3) is necessary for chemokinesis but does not appear to be involved in directional migration although the surface on which migration occurs is important as PI(3)KÎ³ also controls adhesion. One advantage of using the collagen gel where migration is relatively adhesion independent is that this removes a confounding factor in interpreting the effects of the isoforms on neutrophil migration. In this paper we have also shown that the delta isoform also plays a part in chemokinesis although whether this is via phosphorylation of PIP2 to PIP3 was not tested. Directed migration (chemotaxis) however appears to be controlled by a combination of the PI(3)KÎ´ and Î± isoforms which is likely to be independent of PIP2/3 and also in the case of the Î± isoform phosphorylation of Akt. Directional migration involves a number of second messengers and how these relate to PI(3)KÎ´/Î± activation is not clear.</p>
              <p>Our 3D assay is ideal for distinguishing chemokinesis from chemotaxis allowing dissection of the signal transduction processes involved in each function and the way they are modulated by growth factors compared to chemoattractants. We have made the novel observation that the growth factor GM-CSF can only cause chemokinesis even when presented in a gradient fashion. We have also observed for the first time that the Î± isoform of PI3K can mediate chemotaxis and confirmed roles for the Î³ isoform in chemokinesis and the Î´ isoform in chemotaxis and chemokinesis.</p>
