                  <p>As of July 2020, 33 patients with TRK fusion-positive CNS tumors were identified (median age: 8.9 years; range: 1.3–79.0). The most common histologies were high-grade glioma (HGG; <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 19) and low-grade glioma (LGG; <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 8). ORR was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16–49) for all patients. The 24-week disease control rate was 73% (95% CI: 54–87). Twenty-three of 28 patients (82%) with measurable disease had tumor shrinkage. The 12-month rates for duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 75% (95% CI: 45–100), 56% (95% CI: 38–74), and 85% (95% CI: 71–99), respectively. Median time to response was 1.9 months (range 1.0–3.8 months). Duration of treatment ranged from 1.2–31.3+ months. Treatment-related adverse events were reported for 20 patients, with grade 3–4 in 3 patients. No new safety signals were identified.</p>

              </caption>
              <p>There is a high unmet need for tolerable targeted therapeutic options for patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion-positive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, particularly for pediatric patients for whom radiotherapy may have significant negative long-term consequences on neurocognitive functions. Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective TRK inhibitor approved to treat adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer. In patients with TRK fusion-positive CNS tumors, larotrectinib demonstrated rapid and durable responses with a high disease control rate and favorable safety profile in various tumor types including low- and high-grade gliomas as well as non-gliomas. All complete and partial responses in this analysis occurred in pediatric patients, suggesting that larotrectinib may be a valuable therapeutic option for delaying or avoiding the need for radiotherapy in this population. This is the largest report to date of a TRK inhibitor studied in primary CNS cancers.</p>

            <p>The tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family of receptors is composed of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, which are neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (<italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic>) proteins encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">NTRK1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NTRK2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">NTRK3</italic> genes, respectively.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> TRK receptors are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and play an essential role in the normal development and function of the nervous system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Activation of TRK receptors by their respective ligands (neurotrophins) affects various neuronal events during embryogenesis and beyond, including neuronal cell differentiation, survival and proliferation, synaptic formation and plasticity, membrane trafficking, and axon and dendrite formation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref></sup> TRK receptors play important roles in nociception, proprioception, memory formation and retention,<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> pain and temperature sensation,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> appetite control, and learning.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref></sup></p>
            <p><italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions occur when the 3’ region of the <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene encoding the tyrosine kinase domain is joined in-frame with the 5’ end of a fusion partner gene, either by intra- or interchromosomal rearrangement.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The resulting fusion oncogene leads to the expression of a chimeric protein that retains the tyrosine kinase domain, is constitutively active, and drives downstream signaling.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>

            <p>Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. It was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2018 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation that are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity and who have no satisfactory alternative treatments or have progressed following treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> As of October 2021, larotrectinib was subsequently approved for use in more than 40 countries, notably being the first tumor-agnostic therapy to be approved by the European Medicines Agency.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A combined analysis of 159 patients with solid non-CNS tumors from three adult/pediatric phase I/II trials of larotrectinib (NCT02122913, NCT02637687, NCT02576431) showed a durable objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment of 79%, regardless of age or tumor type. At the data cutoff date of February 2019, 69% were still receiving treatment or had undergone surgery with curative intent. Adverse events (AEs) related to larotrectinib were predominantly grade 1 or 2.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
            <p>In prior reports, larotrectinib has been shown to have antitumor activity against TRK fusion-positive primary solid tumors that have metastasized to the CNS.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In a posthoc exploratory analysis of the integrated dataset of 159 patients, 12 evaluable patients with brain metastases achieved an ORR of 75% across all sites of disease. The 3 patients with measurable intracranial disease at baseline had intracranial tumor reductions of 14%, 46%, and 100%, demonstrating the brain penetrance of larotrectinib.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> One prior case report demonstrated activity of larotrectinib in a child with a high-grade glioma harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion,<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> but there is otherwise a paucity of data on the role of larotrectinib in primary CNS tumors. Here we present the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in a cohort of adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion-positive primary CNS cancer.</p>
            <sec sec-type="materials" id="s1">
              <title>Materials and Methods</title>
              <p>All patients with primary CNS tumors harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion detected by local/regional molecular testing and treated with larotrectinib in two clinical trials (NCT02637687 [SCOUT; phase I/II] and NCT02576431 [NAVIGATE; phase II]) as of July 20, 2020, were identified and included in the current analysis. Both trials included pediatric patients: SCOUT enrolled patients from 0–21 years of age and NAVIGATE enrolled patients ≥12 years of age. Eligibility criteria for both trials allowed patients with primary CNS tumors, regardless of histology and grade, who had progressed or were non-responsive to available therapies, were unfit for standard chemotherapy, or for whom no standard or curative therapy was available. Patients with neurologically unstable or rapidly progressive primary CNS tumors were not eligible. Patients who had previously experienced progression while receiving approved or investigational TRK inhibitors were also excluded. Patients who had received a TRK inhibitor for &lt;28 days of treatment and discontinued because of intolerance remained eligible. Larotrectinib was administered at the recommended dose of 100 mg (adult patients) or 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (pediatric patients; maximum of 100 mg) twice daily and continued until disease progression, withdrawal, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit. Patients could continue larotrectinib post-progression if, in the opinion of the investigator, they continued to derive clinical benefit.</p>
              <p>The main efficacy endpoint of these trials was ORR. Intracranial response to treatment was an endpoint for the current analysis and was investigator-assessed using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria based upon serial magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography scans.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> For this analysis, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> per investigator assessment was used for target lesions that were not measurable with RANO at baseline or for tumor types for which RANO measurement is difficult (e.g. pediatric high- and low-grade gliomas, leptomeningeal tumors).<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26–31</xref></sup> Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The 24-week disease control rate, defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting 24 weeks or more (measured from the date of the first dose of larotrectinib) following the initiation of larotrectinib, was calculated for the overall cohort as well as separately for adult and pediatric patients. The main safety endpoint of these trials was toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
              <p>All studies were done in accordance with the standard of good clinical practice, the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable country and local regulations. Protocols were approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each investigative site. All patients (or parents or guardians of minor patients) provided written informed consent before the initiation of any study-related procedures.</p>

                <p>At the time of data cutoff, all 33 patients were evaluable for ORR. Twenty-eight patients had measurable disease at baseline, with tumor response in 23 patients assessed by the investigator based on RANO sum of products of diameters. The other 5 patients with measurable disease at baseline were assessed with RECIST v1.1 as their target lesions were inadequate or difficult for RANO assessment. The remaining 5 evaluable patients had baseline target lesions that were not measurable by either RANO or RECIST v1.1 so were excluded from assessment of change in target lesion size (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The ORR for all 33 evaluable patients was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16–49; <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 10), with responses seen in high- and low-grade tumors, across tumor entities, and regardless of the type of <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion involved (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the 26 pediatric patients, the ORR was 38% (95% CI: 20–59). The ORRs for the 13 pediatric high-grade gliomas and 7 pediatric low-grade gliomas were 38% (95% CI: 14–68) and 43% (95% CI: 10–82), respectively. Best overall response for all patients was complete response in 3 patients (9%; 2 in pediatric high-grade gliomas and 1 in pediatric non-glioma; see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> for case study), partial response in 7 patients (21%; 3 in pediatric high-grade gliomas with 2 pending confirmation, 3 in pediatric low-grade gliomas, and 1 in pediatric non-glioma), stable disease in 20 patients (61%), and progressive disease in 3 patients (9%; all high-grade gliomas). The 24-week disease control rate for all patients was 73% (95% CI: 54–87). For the pediatric cohort, the 24-week disease control rate was 77% (95% CI: 56–91; 69% [95% CI: 39–91] for pediatric high-grade gliomas and 100% [95% CI: 59–100] for pediatric low-grade gliomas). For the adult cohort, the 24-week disease control rate was 57% (95% CI: 18–90; 50% [95% CI: 12–88] for adult high-grade gliomas and 100% [95% CI: 3–100] for adult low-grade gliomas). Of the 28 patients who had measurable disease, 23 (82%) achieved tumor shrinkage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

A pediatric patient was diagnosed with primary spinal high-grade glioma at 4 months of age.

An <italic toggle="yes">ETV6-NTRK3</italic> gene fusion was identified and the patient commenced on larotrectinib (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI: 16.9–NE) at a median follow-up of 16.5 months, with a 12-month overall survival rate of 85% (95% CI: 71–99) and a 24-month overall survival rate of 58% (95% CI: 28–88). The duration of treatment ranged from 1.2–31.3+ months (median 11.1 months).

Treatment-related neurological AEs were infrequent and mild (grade 1 or 2) and included memory impairment in 2 patients and 1 patient each with headache, dizziness, hallucination, and irritability.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite therapeutic advances, progress in the treatment of primary CNS tumors, in particular, has been relatively slow due to a number of reasons, including molecular heterogeneity, poor blood-brain barrier penetration of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective anticancer agents.<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The results from this analysis demonstrate the activity of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors regardless of histology, thus confirming its capacity for blood-brain barrier penetrance as previously shown by the response seen in metastases of extra-cranial tumors to the CNS.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Therapies used in the current standard of care for primary CNS tumors have limitations that highlight the unmet need for targeted therapies. For example, many chemotherapeutic agents have limited efficacy intracranially and/or demonstrate significant toxicity. In addition, cranial radiotherapy may have significant negative long-term consequences on neurocognitive functions, particularly in children.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Specifically, pediatric high-grade gliomas are associated with very low survival rates or limited tolerable therapeutic options.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Therefore, targeted therapy would be especially impactful in these patients by improving disease control and allowing for the delay of other treatments with less favorable risk/benefit profiles.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> As all of the complete responses and partial responses in this analysis occurred in pediatric patients, larotrectinib may be a valuable therapeutic option for delaying or avoiding the need for radiotherapy or as an adjuvant to surgery to preserve neurological function and avoid invasive or potentially debilitating complete tumor resection in this population.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> The current analysis is the largest report to date of a TRK inhibitor studied in primary CNS cancers. With this study, we further show that clinical trials of adult and pediatric patients with both primary CNS and non-CNS tumors are feasible, which is important when studying rare primary CNS tumors, such as those harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion.</p>
              <p>In this cohort of patients with various types of primary CNS tumors harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion, larotrectinib demonstrated marked, rapid, and durable responses, with no new larotrectinib-related safety signals seen. Of these patients, 73% had disease control lasting for at least 24 weeks. The 3 complete responses and 7 partial responses observed all occurred in pediatric patients of varying tumor types and grades (high-grade gliomas, low-grade gliomas, and non-gliomas). However, at present, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the apparent differences in efficacy observed between adult and pediatric patients given the small number of patients included in this analysis, particularly for adults. Pediatric gliomas differ from adult gliomas in molecular factors such as biological drivers, DNA copy number, and underlying genetic alterations.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Moreover, the frequency of pathologically significant concomitant mutations in TRK fusion-positive gliomas, such as alterations in <italic toggle="yes">IDH, H3.3,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53,</italic> appears to increase with age.<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> While these are potential confounding factors that may lead to differences in response to larotrectinib between adult and pediatric patients, further investigation in an expanded population is needed to determine if they have any effect on efficacy.</p>
              <p>In patients with primary CNS tumors, accurate diagnosis is important as histologic and molecular subtypes are key considerations in treatment, providing additional prognostic information. Molecular biomarkers are increasingly driving diagnostic and treatment decisions, thus molecular profiling of tumors is essential for optimizing treatment and clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Indeed, the 2021 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the CNS illustrates this paradigm shift as specific molecular markers have become mandatory for the correct diagnosis of several tumor types,<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> although this classification does not currently consider <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions. DNA methylation profiling has allowed for subclassification of different CNS tumors that were previously considered homogeneous diseases, reducing the substantial inter-observer variability seen in CNS tumor diagnoses that previously relied on histopathology alone.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Notably, methylation profiling studies of gliomas harboring an <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusion did not report a match between histology and methylation class family.<sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> In this current analysis, there was an insufficient number of patients with methylation profiling data available to conclude whether the methylation class families matched with the histologies observed.</p>
              <p>Gene fusion events appear to arise more commonly in the <italic toggle="yes">NTRK1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">NTRK3</italic> genes than in <italic toggle="yes">NTRK2</italic> in most solid tumors, with the exception of brain tumors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> This was reflected in this cohort of primary CNS patients, where <italic toggle="yes">NTRK2</italic> gene fusions were the most common type observed. Of note, <italic toggle="yes">BCR</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 3), <italic toggle="yes">NACC2</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2), <italic toggle="yes">SPECC1L</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2), <italic toggle="yes">AGAP1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2), and <italic toggle="yes">GKAP1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 2) were recurrent <italic toggle="yes">NTRK2</italic> fusion partners identified in this cohort. It is still unknown if the specific fusion partner affects the response to larotrectinib, and future studies may determine whether an association exists. The intracranial efficacy of larotrectinib has been demonstrated in TRK fusion-positive tumors that have metastasized to the brain, and this therapy is usually associated with low toxicity and few high-grade AEs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In a pooled safety population of three adult/pediatric phase I/II trials, larotrectinib was well tolerated in patients with non-primary CNS tumors, with treatment-emergent AEs being primarily grade 1 or 2.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In the current analysis of patients with primary CNS tumors, the AE profile was consistent with that seen in patients with non-primary CNS tumors. Specifically, treatment-related neurological AEs were infrequent and generally mild in severity as was also observed in patients with non-primary CNS tumors. Given the role that TRK proteins play in the function of the CNS (e.g. proprioception, pain sensation, and memory<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>), the neurologic on-target AEs observed in both patients with primary CNS and non-primary CNS tumors are not unexpected.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Data on neurologic effects of long-term treatment with larotrectinib are needed, particularly in the pediatric population due to the biological role of TRK proteins in the development and maintenance of the CNS. In this study with relatively short-term follow-up, larotrectinib appears to be well tolerated.</p>
              <p>There were several limitations of the study. Histologic review was performed locally without central review. As the larotrectinib development program enrolled patients across a variety of primary CNS and extra-cranial solid tumor types, with the aim of demonstrating the tumor-agnostic efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, there was less emphasis on the tumor-specific histology details. Detailed methylation data were limited, as complete molecular profiling was not required beyond testing for <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions. Similarly, per study protocols, radiological assessments for patients with primary CNS disease were investigator-assessed and collated locally at each study site rather than centrally reviewed. While RANO criteria was used for the majority of patients, RECIST v1.1 was used to assess tumor response in 5 patients who had target lesions that were not measurable with RANO criteria, including 3 pediatric patients. Pediatric gliomas have clinical and biological features distinct from adult gliomas that make measurement difficult with RANO criteria, which were developed for adults and do not take these differences into consideration.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref></sup> Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (RAPNO) criteria have recently been developed to address these challenges; as such, RAPNO criteria can provide a more accurate assessment of pediatric gliomas as compared to RANO.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> However, since the studies were initiated in 2015 prior to the development of the RAPNO criteria, it was not feasible to use RAPNO criteria for this current analysis.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Larotrectinib is active in patients with TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors, a population with a high unmet need for effective and tolerable targeted therapeutic options. Confirmed responses and durable disease control were observed in patients with low- and high-grade gliomas as well as those with non-gliomas, with no treatment-related safety concerns. These results further support expanded testing for actionable therapeutic targets, including <italic toggle="yes">NTRK</italic> gene fusions, in patients with primary adult and pediatric CNS tumors.</p>
