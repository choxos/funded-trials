                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The global transition to use of dolutegravir (DTG) in WHO-preferred regimens for HIV treatment is limited by lack of knowledge on use in pregnancy. Here we assessed the relationship between drug concentrations (pharmacokinetics, PK), including in breastmilk, and impact on viral suppression when initiated in the third trimester (T3).</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>In DolPHIN-1, HIV-infected treatment-naïve pregnant women (28–36 weeks of gestation, age 26 (19–42), weight 67kg (45–119), all Black African) in Uganda and South Africa were randomised 1:1 to dolutegravir (DTG) or efavirenz (EFV)-containing ART until 2 weeks post-partum (2wPP), between 9<sup>th</sup> March 2017 and 16<sup>th</sup> January 2018, with follow-up until six months postpartum. The primary endpoint was pharmacokinetics of DTG in women and breastfed infants; secondary endpoints included maternal and infant safety and viral suppression. Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling of DTG was undertaken at day 14 and 2wPP following administration of a medium-fat breakfast, with additional paired sampling between maternal plasma and cord blood, breastmilk and infant plasma.</p>
                  <p>No differences in median baseline maternal age, gestation (31 vs 30 weeks), weight, obstetric history, viral load (4.5 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL both arms) and CD4 count (343 vs 466 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) were observed between DTG (n = 29) and EFV (n = 31) arms. Although DTG C<sub>trough</sub> was below the target 324ng/mL (clinical EC90) in 9/28 (32%) mothers in the third trimester, transfer across the placenta (121% of plasma concentrations) and into breastmilk (3% of plasma concentrations), coupled with slower elimination, led to significant infant plasma exposures (3–8% of maternal exposures). Both regimens were well-tolerated with no significant differences in frequency of adverse events (two on DTG-ART, one on EFV-ART, all considered unrelated to drug). No congenital abnormalities were observed. DTG resulted in significantly faster viral suppression (P = 0.02) at the 2wPP visit, with median time to &lt;50 copies/mL of 32 vs 72 days. Limitations related to the requirement to initiate EFV-ART prior to randomisation, and to continue DTG for only two weeks postpartum.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Despite low plasma DTG exposures in the third trimester, transfer across the placenta and through breastfeeding was observed in this study, with persistence in infants likely due to slower metabolic clearance. HIV RNA suppression &lt;50 copies/mL was twice as fast with DTG compared to EFV, suggesting DTG has potential to reduce risk of vertical transmission in mothers who are initiated on treatment late in pregnancy.</p>

                      <p>In low- and middle-income settings, many women continue to present with untreated HIV in late pregnancy. Reducing maternal HIV viral load by the time of delivery is the most important single factor in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV.</p>

                      <p>Current efavirenz-based regimens do not suppress HIV viral load sufficiently quickly when initiated in late pregnancy. In non-pregnant adults, dolutegravir-based therapy was associated with significantly faster viral suppression; however data for safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics in pregnancy are lacking.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>We hypothesised that in women presenting in late pregnancy, dolutegravir would increase the likelihood of attaining undetectable viral load by delivery. However, it was first necessary to evaluate whether the standard dose of 50 mg once daily was sufficient in the third trimester of pregnancy, and to quantify the amount of drug to which the infant was exposed via the placenta and through breastfeeding.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 1.5 million HIV-infected women become pregnant worldwide each year, the majority from low- or middle- income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, a significant proportion of women are diagnosed late in pregnancy, with as much as 20% initiating anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in the third trimester in South Africa [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Late ART initiation in pregnancy is a major concern as it is associated with a 7-fold higher risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) compared to women who initiated ART prior to 28 weeks of gestation, and a doubling of infant mortality in the first year of life [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>In non-pregnant adults, dolutegravir (DTG) reduces HIV viral load (VL) to &lt;50 copies/mL after a median of 28 days, compared to 84 days for efavirenz (EFV) [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which is currently standard-of-care in many countries. Generic manufacture of DTG-containing fixed dose combinations has made this drug affordable and accessible for low income countries, and many countries are considering the place of DTG in national guidelines.</p>
              <p>DolPHIN-1 (<underline>Dol</underline>utegravir in <underline>p</underline>regnant <underline>HI</underline>V mothers and their <underline>n</underline>eonates, NCT02245022) was an open-label randomised clinical trial of DTG compared with EFV-based standard-of-care ART in women presenting with untreated HIV in the third trimester of pregnancy. The primary objective was to investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of DTG in HIV-infected women during the third trimester of pregnancy and after two weeks postpartum as defined by the area under the concentration-time curve of DTG between zero and 24 hours (AUC<sub>0-24</sub>). Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints included cord to maternal plasma DTG ratio (C:M ratio), maternal breast milk to plasma DTG ratio (M:P ratio), and infant DTG concentrations at maternal steady state and at one, two and three days following maternal discontinuation of DTG. Secondary endpoints also included viral load in each arm at delivery and the change in viral load over the first four weeks of therapy.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Consort Statement (Consort Checklist is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002895.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Subjects were identified at the Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda and Gugulethu Community Health Centre, Cape Town, South Africa with study procedures undertaken at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, and at the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation Clinical Trials Unit, respectively. Ethical approvals were obtained from the University of Liverpool Research Ethics Committee, the Joint Clinical Research Centre Research Ethics Committee, Uganda; and the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee, South Africa. Regulatory approvals were obtained from the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology, the Ugandan National Drug Authority and the South African Medicines Control Council. Initial recruitment occurred on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2017, with final follow-up of the last participant on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2018. Study protocol and statistical analysis plan are available as supplementary files, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002895.s004">S1 Text</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002895.s005">S2 Text</xref>.</p>

                <title>Sample size considerations</title>
                <p>Previous data on 50mg once daily DTG dosing in North American HIV-infected non-pregnant healthy volunteers yielded an AUC 43,400 ng.h/mL at steady state (coefficient of variation [CV] 20%)[<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Assuming similar variance in HIV-positive pregnant African women, recruitment of 30 subjects would yield &gt;95% power (paired design) to show a difference of +25% difference in mean AUC (the FDA upper boundary for bioequivalence) at α = 0.05. However, data for other antiretrovirals such as the protease inhibitors suggest that variance is greater in pregnant women. It was therefore judged that recruitment of 60 pregnant women (30 on DTG) would both allow detection (at 80% power) of a DTG AUC difference of 12% (CV 20%), 16% (CV 30%), 22% (CV 40%), 27% (CV50%), so that even with doubling in CV, there would be &gt;80% power to detect change in AUC outside the FDA bounds for bioequivalence (80–125%) and also allow meaningful exploration of differences in virological dynamics between DTG and standard of care.</p>

                <p>Between 9<sup>th</sup> March 2017 and 16<sup>th</sup> January 2018, potential participants were identified and screened at antenatal clinics associated with the study sites. Participants were enrolled if they were willing and able to provide informed consent; to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests and other study procedures; were aged at least 18 years; and had untreated HIV in late pregnancy, defined as greater than 28 and less than 36 weeks’ gestation by best available methods of estimation. Participants were excluded if they had received any antiretroviral drugs in the previous six months; had ever received integrase inhibitors; were anaemic (haemoglobin less than 8 g/dL); had elevations in serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT &gt;3xULN and bilirubin &gt;2xULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin); had active hepatitis B infection; a history or clinical suspicion of unstable liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinaemia, oesophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice); had severe pre-eclampsia, or other pregnancy related events such as renal or liver abnormalities (grade 2 or above proteinuria, elevation in serum creatinine (&gt;2.5 x ULN), total bilirubin, ALT or AST); or clinical depression or evidence of suicidal ideation.</p>
                <p>HIV-infected pregnant women were randomised 1:1 to receive once daily DTG 50mg plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with either lamivudine or emtricitabine (DTG-ART) or standard of care (SoC) consisting of once daily EFV plus plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with either lamivudine or emtricitabine (EFV-ART). Due to the national policy requirements in both Uganda and South Africa for pregnant women to commence ART on the day of HIV diagnosis [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], balanced against the need to screen against eligibility criteria for safety, all consenting women were commenced on EFV-based ART. Screening bloods were reviewed between three and seven days later, and at this point participants were enrolled in the study and randomised to either DTG-ART or EFV-ART. DTG was provided for the study by ViiV Healthcare.</p>

                <title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title>
                <p>Pharmacokinetic analysis was undertaken in mother-infant pairs receiving DTG-ART, and involved sampling of i) maternal plasma (in 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester and post-partum), ii) paired cord: maternal plasma, iii) paired maternal plasma:whole breastmilk, iv) plasma of breastfed infants and v) serial sampling (following DTG discontinuation) of maternal plasma and breast milk, and infant plasma. DTG was administered with a medium fat breakfast. Briefly, rich sampling (pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post observed dosing) was undertaken in mothers within 2 weeks after starting DTG. At delivery, where possible, a sample of paired maternal and cord blood was taken. At the post-partum visit, a further intensive pharmacokinetic assessment was performed in each mother. Additionally, breast milk (BM) was sampled pre-dose (BM<sub>trough</sub>) and at 2–6 hours post-dose (BM<sub>max</sub>). Since infants feed continuously throughout a maternal dose interval, we sought to estimate the lower bounds of infant exposure (Infant<sub>trough</sub>) by sampling infants at maternal trough, and the upper bounds of infant exposure (Infant<sub>max</sub>) by mandating a feed at maternal peak (T<sub>max</sub>; 2-3h post-dosing) then sampling infants 1h later. Finally, the ‘tail’ of elimination of DTG on maternal plasma and BM was characterised by serial sampling at 48, 72 and 96 hours following the last dose of DTG. In order to avoid excessive sampling, infants were randomly allocated to one of these three sampling points following discontinuation of maternal DTG.</p>
                <p>DTG in plasma was extracted using liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using a validated reversed phase liquid chromatography with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) set at 10 ng/ml and precision of 11% at the lowest QC (30ng/mL) [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Plasma samples were stored at -80°C before shipment to the Bioanalytical Facility, University of Liverpool for bioanalysis. Breast milk samples were spotted on Whatman 903 Protein Saver cards (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The cards were air-dried at room temperature and stored with desiccant sachets and a humidity indicator in individual gas impermeable zip-lock bags at 4°C until extraction. Extraction was by liquid-liquid extraction using TBME, and dolutegravir–d5 as internal standard. Linearity was maintained from 10 ng/mL to 4000 ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day accuracy and precision were ranged from 7–11%, 3–7% and 4–6% at low, medium and high QC levels and accuracy was within ±13–14%, ±3–5% and 0–2% for low, medium and high QC levels and ±0–4% for the LLOQ [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

                <p>Maternal safety assessments included clinical review and measurement of full blood count, urea, sodium, potassium, creatinine (and calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Cockroft-Gault formula), creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin and glucose. All clinical adverse events were categorised according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedRA; version 21.1), and assessed for severity according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (2004). Causality assessments were undertaken by a dedicated clinical pharmacist using the Liverpool Causality Assessment Tool [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Participants were reviewed for safety and tolerability after 7, 14 and 28 days on treatment, and after 56 days if delivery had not taken place. Following delivery, safety assessments were undertaken at 14 days and six months postpartum. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was administered prenatally to establish a baseline for each participant, and at two weeks and six months postpartum [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
                <p>Obstetric outcomes were assessed, including mode of delivery, length of rupture of membranes and any delivery complications.

                <title>HIV viral load</title>
                <p>HIV RNA was quantitated at each site using Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/TaqMan HIV-1 Test, version 2 (lower limit of quantification of 20 copies/mL). All participants had HIV viral load performed at screening. Since all participants immediately commenced EFV-ART, but were then randomised to continue or switch to DTG-ART up to seven days later, participants allocated to DTG-ART had a repeat HIV viral load performed at switch, to evaluate the impact of prior EFV-ART. A subsequent protocol amendment allowed capture of similar data on participants randomised to EFV-ART. Viral load measurements were repeated after 14 and 28 days on treatment, and at two weeks postpartum.</p>
                <p>Viral load results were reviewed by the Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (IDSMB) at two scheduled interim analyses involving the first 16 participants (8 on DTG-ART). The first of these took place after the first 8 subjects (recruited between 28-32w gestation) had delivered, the restriction of the upper limit of gestation at recruitment being applied so that there would be time to adjust her treatment regimen should an inadequate virological response be detected. Following this, a further review took place after the next 8 subjects (recruited between 28-36w gestation) had delivered. This was to ensure that the standard DTG dose of 50mg once daily did not risk exposing women to an impotent regimen in the third trimester. The following stopping criteria were predefined for these initial participants in the DTG-ART arm: at two weeks of ART, VL response of &lt;1 log<sub>10</sub> reduction or remaining ≥10 000 copies/ mL triggered assessment of adherence or factors affecting absorption and a further viral load in two weeks. At four weeks of ART, VL reduction &lt;1 log10 or evidence of blunting of virological response between weeks two and four prompted immediate switch to an EFV-based regimen. If there was &gt;1 log<sub>10</sub> reduction, but VL remained ≥ 10 000 copies/ml, DTG was continued but HIV VL was performed two-weekly until VL &lt;1000 copies/ml. This interim IDSMB review was completed and the study progressed to full enrolment.</p>

The proportion of patients with HIV RNA in the following categories were presented by timepoint: &lt;50, 50–199, 200–999, and ≥1,000 copies/mL. The proportion of subjects in each arm with HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at two weeks postpartum were compared by Chi-squared test. Two approaches to handle missing viral load data were used: 1) missing viral load equals failure [&gt;50 copies/mL] (M = F) in which subjects with missing data at two weeks post-partum were assessed as experiencing failure, and 2) missing viral load equals excluded (M = X) in which subjects with missing data at two weeks post-partum were excluded from the analysis. As a sensitivity analysis, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare log<sub>10</sub>HIV RNA at 2 weeks post-partum between arms for patients with an evaluable result at this timepoint (M = X). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate time to viral suppression (defined as HIV RNA &lt;50 copies/mL) by treatment group and were compared by the log-rank test.

However, it is notable that all but one DTG concentration was above the protein-adjusted IC<sub>90</sub> of 64 ng/mL [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and that with two exceptions that could be explained by complete non-adherence in one, and baseline multi-class resistance in another, all mothers responded virologically. Total exposure, defined by the AUC<sub>0-24,</sub> was 35,322 ng.h/mL. This is similar to findings from the US IMPAACT P1026s study in pregnant HIV-infected women [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. DTG is highly bound to plasma proteins, and work from the PANNA consortium has demonstrated comparable free DTG concentrations in pregnancy compared with postpartum women, related to lower serum albumin in the third trimester [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; this supports that the impact of the moderate reduction in total (free and bound) DTG is minimal. In contrast to the IMPAACT P1026s data [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we failed to demonstrate any significant difference in PK parameters when comparing third trimester to postpartum concentrations, except for a 17% reduction in C<sub>max</sub> (P = 0.05, <xref rid="pmed.1002895.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This is most likely related to our early post-partum sampling when maternal physiology had not yet returned to the non-pregnant state [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Consistent with other studies, DTG was found to cross the placenta with a C:M ratio of 1.21 [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is the first report of M:P ratio in a cohort of breastfeeding mother-infant pairs on DTG, and corroborates data from a case report [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This transplacental and breast milk exposure, coupled with the delayed infant clearance due to immaturity of infant UGT1A1 indicates that breastfed infants may have prolonged exposure to maternal DTG. This is seen in the prolonged elimination of DTG from infant plasma after cessation of maternal DTG: breast milk concentrations were undetectable after 24 hours, whereas 80% of infants still had measurable plasma DTG 96 hours after the final maternal dose. Population PK modelling is currently being undertaken to characterise DTG disposition in mothers, fetuses, infants and breast milk, incorporating DolPHIN-1 and other data. DolPHIN-1 evaluated a small number of infants exposed to maternal DTG, meaning two questions warrant further evaluation in larger cohorts. Firstly, whilst no drug attributable adverse events were noted in this study, scenarios of clinical concern include premature infants with further reduced UGT1A1 activity [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Secondly, where MTCT occurs despite maternal ART, evaluation of the impact of low dose infant exposure to DTG in selecting for resistant virus is required.</p>
              <p>DolPHIN-1 provides confirmatory evidence that the superior virological responses observed with DTG-based combination therapy in non-pregnant adults is also seen in pregnancy. Given that differences are most marked during the first 12 weeks of therapy, DTG has a potential role in prevention of mother to child transmissions among women who are initiated on ART in the third trimester.</p>
              <p>In women initiating ART in the third trimester of pregnancy, DTG-ART appeared safe and well-tolerated, although our sample size is small. Preliminary data from Botswana reported an increased frequency of neural tube defects among mothers who conceived on DTG [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] leading to recommendations that women of childbearing potential receiving DTG should be offered access to contraception until further data are available [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, no other safety concerns have been described in women who initiate DTG later on in pregnancy [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and our results suggest a DTG-based regimen was significantly more likely to achieve a maternal HIV viral load of &lt;50 copies/mL when compared to EFV-based ART initiated in third trimester. As maternal viral load at delivery is the principal determinant of MTCT, use of DTG-containing regimens in late-presenting pregnant women could potentially reduce the risk MTCT [<xref rid="pmed.1002895.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec024">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Two important limitations of the study related to the requirement to initiate immediate EFV-ART at HIV diagnosis, and the need to limit exposure of newborn and breastfed infants to what was not a recommended first-line regimen during the study period. However, randomisation ensured balance between arms in initial EFV-ART exposure, and these limitations would only have reduced any real differences between arms. The ongoing DolPHIN-2 study (NCT03249181) will provide more detailed evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of DTG in women and their infants where DTG-ART is initiated in the third trimester with follow-up until 72 weeks postpartum.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, some women attended for postpartum visit earlier than the proposed two weeks, potentially minimising differences in DTG exposure as a result of late pregnancy. Notwithstanding, we demonstrate here that standard doses of DTG are sufficient for mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>In summary, we found that DTG-ART resulted in a significantly shorter time to undetectable viral load, which is likely to be important in reducing MTCT when ART is initiated in late pregnancy. This is despite low steady-state exposures of DTG in the third trimester of pregnancy. We also observed significant transplacental transfer of DTG, which together with breast milk transfer, and likely delayed clearance of DTG resulted in significant DTG exposures in newborn infants.</p>
