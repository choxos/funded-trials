                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Amblyopia (lazy eye) affects the vision of approximately 2% of all children. Traditional treatment consists of wearing a patch over their ‘good’ eye for a number of hours daily, over several months. This treatment is unpopular and compliance is often low. Therefore, results can be poor. I-BiT is a system, based on stereo technology using shutter glasses, designed to treat amblyopia using dichoptic stimulation. This trial uses a redesigned system for home use and includes eye-tracking capability.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This is a randomised controlled trial involving three groups of 40 patients each, aged between 3.5 and 12 years, with a diagnosis of (1) anisometropic amblyopia, (2) mixed or strabismic amblyopia prior to strabismic surgery and (3) mixed or strabismic amblyopia who have just undergone strabismus surgery. They will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio between I-BiT and control and will receive treatment, at home over a 6-week period. Their visual acuity will be assessed independently at baseline, mid-treatment (week 3), at the end of treatment (week 6) and, for those receiving the active I-BiT treatment, 4 weeks after completing treatment (week 10).</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary endpoint will be the change in visual acuity from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints will be additional visual acuity measures, patient acceptability, compliance and the incidence of adverse events.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">The term amblyopia is derived from the Greek, meaning blunted sight and is defined as a unilateral or bilateral decrease in vision for which no obvious cause can be found on clinical examination, or as von Graefe phrased it, a condition where the observer sees nothing and the patient very little [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is a common condition affecting 2–3% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Amblyopia is characterised by:-<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par8">Reduced visual acuity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">The phenomenon of crowding</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Presence of a central suppression scotoma</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Impairment of binocular vision</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par12">Von Graefe was the first to demonstrate suppression in a lazy eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and there is evidence of suppression in all amblyopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">The first-line treatment is the correction of any existing significant refractive error for at least 18 weeks (refractive adaptation) but full resolution only occurs in about 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For patients in whom the amblyopia persists, then the mainstay of treatment has been patching, or more recently, penalisation. The major barrier to patching is that wearing patches is uncomfortable and accordingly compliance is variable. Objective measurements suggests that average concordance with patching was 48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A major factor may well be the association of increased reports of bullying by children who wear patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">The second issue is that the normal eye is covered up. Accordingly, while it may improve the vision in the amblyopic eye, it can lead to reduced vision in the patched eye and there is still the outstanding issue of developing stereopsis.</p>
              <p id="Par15">An alternative treatment is to use a strategy based on dichoptic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Dichoptic stimulation is the ability to present different images to each eye independently. For example, one could present the sprite (a sprite is a computer graphic which may be moved on-screen and otherwise manipulated as a single entity and here refers to a gaming object of interest) to one eye and objects to collect to the other eye thereby forcing both eyes to work together in order to successfully play the game. The I-BiT group, who were one of the first to adopt this approach, did so using a variation on the game Nux.</p>
              <p id="Par16">There is nothing original in the idea and a number of devices had been developed, starting with Priestly-Smith’s fusion tubes followed by Worth’s amblyoscope and then by the 1930s Maddox developed the major amblyoscope, or synoptophore. The synoptophore allows such tasks as putting the lion (seen by one eye) in the cage (seen by the other) and was developed very much with the idea of dichoptic stimulation for therapeutic benefit. However, such tasks were too simple to retain anyone’s interest beyond a few minutes and way short of the hours needed for any therapeutic effect.</p>
              <p id="Par17">What has changed is the rapid advances in stereo-viewing technology that has given this approach a new lease of life as it can be readily adapted for dichoptic stimulation. These considerations led us to the initial development of a virtual reality-based system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to treat amblyopia using dichoptic stimulation, either playing special video games or watching DVDs which we called I-BiT (<italic>I</italic>nteractive <italic>Bi</italic>nocular <italic>T</italic>reatment). Three pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have shown that the I-BiT™ system can improve the visual acuity in amblyopic patients. The most recent of these pilot studies using shutter-glasses technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed that all patients who completed their planned treatment (nine of the 10 patients) showed a mean improvement in visual acuity of 0.18 LogMAR. This system went to a randomised control trial (RCT) and while all the arms showed a visual improvement of 0.07 LogMAR units, there was no difference between the arms including the control (playing the videogame under non-dichoptic conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">A group from Iran developed their own system, which they also called I-BiT but was developed independently of the Nottingham team, using dichoptic games (Pacman, Tetris and Snake) with red-green anaglyph glasses, to treat 50 patients aged 3–10 years old and again showed improvement in vision in both the I-BiT and the control arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but both arms also received patching making the results hard to interpret.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The I-BiT™ system was designed for treating patients under supervision in a hospital-based setting and this significantly limits treatment times to only a few hours (3 h in the trial). There was also no attempt to ‘balance’ the images. The extra visual features that were shown to the amblyopic eye were ‘all or none’.</p>
              <p id="Par20">We have redesigned our I-BiT system for home use along with incorporation of an eye-tracker. The innovation is the combination of the two technologies of virtual reality and eye-tracking. This allows one to achieve the dual aims of dichoptic stimulation and harmonious retinal presentation with engaging visual material that will retain a child’s attention for prolonged periods of time. This combination is currently untested.</p>
              <p id="Par21">This study will aim to evaluate the new system in participants aged 3.5 to 12 years with anisometropic, mixed and strabismic amblyopia.</p>

                <p id="Par22">The trial is a feasibility study (similar to a stage 2 CTIMP trial) with the aim to show that this treatment strategy is feasible (equipment can be delivered and retrieved from patients’ homes and will function in a home setting) and to get some indication of clinical efficacy as to whether I-BiT combined with refractive correction is superior to refractive correction alone in the treatment of amblyopia in three scenarios (untreated anisometropic amblyopia, mixed or strabismic amblyopia and residual amblyopia in patients undergoing strabismus surgery).</p>

                <title>I-BiT™ system</title>
                <p id="Par23">The redesigned I-BiT system consists of desktop personal computer with a core 5i processor and graphics card and a 27″ HD screen. Attached to the inferior border of the screen is an eye-tracker bar with an infra-red light source. Dichoptic stimulation is achieved by using radio-wave controlled 3D active shutter glasses and a USB controller/infra-red emitter. The infra-red signal is converted to a radiofrequency signal (2.48 GigaHz) in a box which is opaque to infrared and transparent to radio waves. The active shutter glasses are to be worn by the patient as this is the means by which different images are presented to each eye. The controller/radiofrequency emitter synchronizes the glasses with the monitor so that each frame is displayed to the correct eye.</p>
                <p id="Par24">There is a games controller by which the options are selected and the games are played.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The system has the ability to perform simple psychophysical measurements (visual acuity, cover test and test for double vision). The visual acuity is measured using an illiterate E test. The cover test uses the eye-tracker and the target is shown first to the good eye, then to both and then to the amblyopic eye and the movement of the eyes is recorded when the target is switched from appearing to both eyes and is only shown to the amblyopic eye only. The test for double vision is when a bunny rabbit is shown to both eyes and the child is asked to select whether they see one rabbit or two.</p>
                <p id="Par26">It has the ability to off-set the images so as to ensure harmonious retinal presentation of images for patients with strabismic or mixed amblyopia.</p>

                <p id="Par27">I-BiT has episodes from popular young children’s programmes (with permission from the British Broadcasting Cooperation). For three of these programmes, there is a blurred patch that is presented to the central vision of the good eye and centrality is maintained by eye-tracking. For the fourth programme and software is used to detect the presence of faces in the images and then the faces that are shown to the good eye are specifically blurred but not for the amblyopic eye. The rationale is that faces have high salience.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par34">The trial protocol is version 1.4 and dated 19 December 2016. The trial is a single-masked, randomised control trial. It is not possible to mask the intervention as the participant has only to shut one eye to know whether they are in the treatment or the control arm.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The trial is split into three groups each of these three groups will investigate a distinct (and mutually exclusive) patient population which together cover most cases of anisometropic or strabismic amblyopia that presents to the National Health Service:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par36">Group 1: untreated anisometropic amblyopia.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">Group 2: strabismic or mixed amblyopia with no previous strabismus surgery (but may have had previous amblyopia treatment)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Group 3: immediate post-strabismus surgery. Participants with residual strabismic or mixed amblyopia undergoing alignment surgery. These participants will receive I-BiT Plus treatment starting in the immediate post-operative period</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par39">The trial will be assessor masked (it is not possible to mask the intervention) randomised intervention with 40 participants in each group with either continued refractive adaptation (if glasses are indicated and prescribed) or observation as the controls. The participants in the control arm will also be provided with a gaming computer on which they can play games and watch DVDs but will not have the capability to provide dichoptic stimulation nor provide eye-tracking. Carers will be provided with a contact number for enquiries and technical help.</p>
                <p id="Par40">In all three groups, the participants will be randomised to either receive I-BiT Plus for 6 weeks or extended refractive adaptation/observation and will be examined at weeks 3 and 6 post receipt of I-BiT Plus or laptop for both arms, and at week 10 in the I-BiT treatment arm only. In all three groups, after week 6, the participants in the control arms will be returned to standard NHS care while the intervention arms will be observed for a further 4 weeks. The rationale is that the week-6 visit is the comparison between treated and controls and is the primary endpoint. The point of the week 10 visit is to see if any improvement observed in the treated arm is stable or not and the comparison is, therefore, between the week-6 and the week-10 visits for the treated arms.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The choice of untreated controls was chosen as the most suitable choice for determining whether I-BiT is an effective treatment and superior to no treatment.</p>

There is now a body of evidence that dichoptic stimulation is an effective treatment for amblyopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and this trial builds on previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We have used the lessons from the previous studies to redesign the I-BiT system with the following improvements:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par99">Home-based system. Simple to use and also safe. For example, it will switch itself off if it is left idle for 15 min. The current system is designed to be used without supervision</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par100">Range of games and videos (as opposed to one game and one video)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par101">Allow image off-setting for strabismic and mixed amblyopia</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par102">Simple psychophysical tests incorporated</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par103">Monitor activities undertaken and treatment time. It will not permit a treatment session to be longer than 1 h or more than 2 h in 1 day</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par104">We also included a face verification system to help ensure that the person using the system is the intended participant</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par105">The major aim of this trial is as a feasibility study to see if all these features function as designed and at the same time get some indication of efficiency. The intention is to get sufficient information to allow a definitive study to be designed.</p>
              <p id="Par106">It should be noted that this approach is not without its problems. A major cause of treatment failure with patching is poor compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but videogames must be engaging and can have their own compliance issues. In the PEDIG study, only 22% of participants complied with more than 75% of the prescribed treatment. The revised I-BiT has programmed up eight games in an attempt to ensure a reasonable choice and includes around 40 h of videos which are particularly targeted to the 3.5–6 years age range where they may be less inclined to the gaming options.</p>
              <p id="Par107">It is the issue of compliance that undermines any power calculation. We are just powered to detect a clinically significant difference but this is assuming good compliance. So it is likely that we will end up under powered, but we will have a measure of compliance which can be used for future calculations.</p>
              <p id="Par108">A second issue arises specifically for strabismic and mixed amblyopia. Only the fovea can support normal visual acuity and so it seems an important requirement that the dichoptic images are presented harmoniously. The revised I-BiT has this capability to off-set images by a required amount and it can measure the distance of the participant from the screen in real time to ensure that the angle of off-set can change with distance such that the degree of off-set as measured in prism dioptres is kept constant. This is a novel development.</p>
              <p id="Par109">We have chosen controls whose only treatment is the wearing of glasses, if indicated rather than patching. To use participants who are under-going patching or penalisation as controls would have made this a non-inferiority study and this requires an infeasibly large number of participants to generate a meaningfully powered study.</p>
              <p id="Par110">All participants, if they have significant refractive error, must have undergone at least 12 weeks of refractive adaptation. Refractive adaptation can occur over 30 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and it is standard practice to allow 18 weeks of refractive adaptation before considering patching or penalisation. By allowing enrolment at 12 weeks, it means that the controls can complete their participation in this study and be finished by 18 weeks and so this would not delay the start of conventional treatment, if indicated. It does mean that we anticipate some improvement in vision in the control arms.</p>
              <p id="Par111">The chosen method, described under trial procedures, of how to measure visual acuity was developed following a Delphi-like process involving all the paediatric ophthalmologists and orthoptists at the four participating trial centres. Although the tests are standard, it transpired that there was considerable variation on how these tests are applied in practice. It has been emphasised to all the trial centres the importance of consistency of making this measurement. It is a psychophysical measurement and such measurements are only valid if the subject is concentrating on the task and, particularly with children, this cannot be guaranteed. The variation in practice all revolved around how particular clinicians compensated for perceived failures in concentration by the subject. This is an area that would benefit from further research in its own right.</p>
              <p id="Par112">Patients with anisometropic amblyopia are required not to have had previous patching or penalisation whereas this is permissible for those with strabismic amblyopia. The reason is the age of presentation as most patients with strabismic amblyopia present at under the age of 3.5 years and this age is too young to consider the use of I-BiT. Patients with anisometropic amblyopia usually present at over the age of 3.5 years and so this makes I-BiT a feasible option.</p>
              <p id="Par113">Alongside these trials, data will be collected in order to perform a cost-utility analysis in the paediatric population which is particularly challenging due to the problem of accurately measuring utility in this age range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Two questionnaires have been used to calculate Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) have been the CHU-9D22 and the EQ-5D-Y23 with the former validated for the 7–11 years age range and the later from the age of 8 years. In the age range 6–7 years the CHU-9D performs better than the EQ-5D-Y and accordingly we have chosen it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and it also has a proxy form where a guardian can respond on their behalf. There is no instrument that is validated for children under the age of 6 years. However, it is noted that this area is problematic. We are also using a modified CAT-QoL which is a treatment-specific tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] as a disease-specific measure.</p>
              <p id="Par114">The revised I-BiT does have the ability to perform simple psychophysical testing. The participants in this study will be monitored clinically but the efficacy of this automated testing will be separately assessed as it may be possible, in the future, to monitor progress remotely and without the need for hospital visits.</p>
              <p id="Par115">This approach has the potential to transform the way patients with amblyopia are treated.</p>
