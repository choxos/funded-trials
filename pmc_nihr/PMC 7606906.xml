                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Chronic pulmonary infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. If antibiotics are commenced promptly, infection can be eradicated. The aim of the trial was to compare the effectiveness and safety of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin versus oral ciprofloxacin in the eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa.</italic></p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a multicentre, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 72 cystic fibrosis centres (70 in the UK and two in Italy). Eligible participants were older than 28 days with an isolate of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> (either the first ever isolate or a new isolate after at least 1 year free of infection). Participants were excluded if the <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> was resistant to, or they had a contraindication to, one or more of the trial antibiotics; if they were already receiving <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> suppressive therapy; if they had received any <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> eradication therapy within the previous 9 months; or if they were pregnant or breastfeeding. We used web-based randomisation to assign patients to 14 days intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin or 12 weeks oral ciprofloxacin. Both were combined with 12 weeks inhaled colistimethate sodium. Randomisation lists were generated by a statistician, who had no involvement in the trial, using a computer-generated list. Randomisation was stratified by centre and because of the nature of the interventions, blinding was not possible. Our primary outcome was eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> at 3 months and remaining free of infection to 15 months. Primary analysis used intention to treat (powered for superiority). Safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study drug. TORPEDO-CF was registered on the ISRCTN register, ISRCTN02734162, and EudraCT, 2009-012575-10.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Oct 5, 2010, and Jan 27, 2017, 286 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 137 to intravenous antibiotics and 149 to oral antibiotics. 55 (44%) of 125 participants in the intravenous group and 68 (52%) of 130 participants in the oral group achieved the primary outcome. Participants randomly assigned to the intravenous group were less likely to achieve the primary outcome, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant (relative risk 0·84, 95% CI 0·65–1·09; p=0·18). 11 serious adverse events occurred in ten (8%) of 126 participants in the intravenous antibiotics group and 17 serious adverse events in 12 (8%) of 146 participants in the oral antibiotics group.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Compared with oral therapy, intravenous antibiotics did not achieve sustained eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in a greater proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis and was more expensive. Although there were fewer hospitalisations in the intravenous group than the oral group during follow-up, this confers no advantage over oral treatment because intravenous eradication frequently requires hospitalisation. These results do not support the use of intravenous antibiotics to eradicate <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in cystic fibrosis.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">Chronic pulmonary infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis. In US, UK, and European guidelines, inhaled antibiotics are first-line treatment and intravenous antibiotics second-line treatment for the eradication of early infection with <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>. Our Cochrane systematic review (last updated April 25, 2017) showed that nebulised antibiotics alone or in combination with oral ciprofloxacin are better than no eradication treatment for <italic>P aeruginosa.</italic> We repeated the literature search used in the Cochrane systematic review from Oct 11, 2016, to April 14, 2020, using the same search strategy: relevant trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms “antibiotics” AND (“pseudomonas aeruginosa” OR “mixed infections”) AND (“eradication” OR “unknown”). We also searched the relevant clinical trials databases <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN using the search terms “cystic fibrosis” AND “pseudomonas aeruginosa” AND “eradication”. Further details, including inclusion criteria and risk of bias assessment, can be found in our Cochrane systematic review. This search revealed a further six publications: two conference abstracts relating to the TORPEDO trial; an infection control study; two references to a study of oral azithromycin for eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> (as an adjunct to inhaled tobramycin); and a conference abstract relating to a further trial of azithromycin, which was under powered. We therefore conclude that, although intravenous antibiotics are widely used, there are no randomised controlled trials to investigate their effectiveness in eradicating <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in cystic fibrosis. The TORPEDO-CF trial has been designed to find evidence of superiority of intravenous therapy, if such superiority exists. If intravenous antibiotics are not superior, then guidance can be given that will save health resources.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Our randomised controlled trial is, to our knowledge, the first to compare the effectiveness of intravenous versus oral eradication therapy in children and adults with cystic fibrosis, and showed no significant difference in the number of participants achieving eradication. In the intravenous group, fewer patients were admitted to hospital in the 12 months following eradication. However, this confers no advantage as intravenous eradication usually requires admission whereas oral treatment does not. There was a considerable difference in cost between the two eradication regimens. The study has shown that oral eradication might be used with a cost saving of £5939 (equivalent to 7543 US dollars) per patient. This is the first cost-effectiveness study done as part of a randomised controlled trial of eradication.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">We found that intravenous antibiotics did not achieve eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in a greater proportion of children and adults with cystic fibrosis than oral therapy. Intravenous therapy usually requires a prolonged admission to hospital, with consequent family disruption, as well as requiring significant health-care resource. Admission for intravenous therapy in the context of early <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> infection (and without the presence of a significant pulmonary exacerbation), in adults and children with cystic fibrosis, should not be recommended.</p>
                  <p id="para90">Our trial found that, even in the oral group (which had a better primary outcome), only around half of participants were free of infection 15 months after randomisation. Future research should aim to improve rates of eradication through approaches such as earlier detection of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> and salvage therapy for failed eradication. It should also be a priority to evaluate the effects of CFTR modulators on acquisition and eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para220">The primary outcome was eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> from respiratory samples (cough swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage) at 3 months from commencing trial treatment and remaining free of infection to 15 months. We chose 12 months, following completion of eradication, as a reasonable period to evaluate whether eradication was sustained. Some participants did not have samples collected during the pre-specified protocol windows for the primary outcome at 3 months and 15 months. It was therefore decided, during a blind data review after trial completion, to extend the window at which the 3 month sample could be taken to 4 weeks either side of the expected visit date, providing treatment had ceased at least 48 h before sampling. Similarly, the window was extended to four weeks either side of the expected 15 month visit date. This decision was made to avoid excluding patients whose samples were taken outside the protocol-specified window. Secondary outcomes that utilised these sample results included time to recurrence of the original <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> infection and re-infection with a different genotype of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> or other respiratory organisms. To avoid excessive participant burden, specimens for microbiology were collected at routine clinic visits. Data on secondary outcomes, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow in mid expiration (FEF<sub>25–75</sub>), oxygen saturation, height, weight, body-mass index (BMI), number of pulmonary exacerbations,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> number of hospital admissions, number of days spent as an inpatient, carer and participant burden, were collected at baseline and at all of the routine trial visits.</p>

For 90% power at a 5% level of significance (two-sided), to detect a difference between groups of 20% (between 55% and 75% successful eradication), 128 participants were required in each group. A 20% difference between the two treatment regimens was deemed to be of clinical importance, since the more intensive intravenous treatment would need to be justified by a substantial benefit. We estimated that 10% of participants in each treatment group would not provide primary outcome data giving a recruitment target of 286 participants.</p>

Two post-hoc analyses were done comparing the proportion of participants in whom infection was successfully eradicated by 3 months and subgroup analyses of patients who were <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> naive and <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> free.

              <p id="para430">In the economic evaluation, before adjusting for covariates, the oral group had larger follow-up costs (excluding intervention costs) than the intravenous group, predominantly reflecting greater costs associated with follow-up inpatient stays (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 16–18</xref>), with all other costs and resource use being similar between the groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 19–22</xref>).

Overall, oral treatment was less costly than intravenous treatment when including intervention costs, with the incremental difference in mean costs being –£5939 (95% CI −7107 to −4666) after adjusting for baseline covariates. Much of the overall total cost difference reflects the inpatient stay cost for intravenous therapy.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para460">We tested the hypothesis that an intravenous antibiotic regimen is more effective than oral treatment for eradicating <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in people with cystic fibrosis. Inhaled colistimethate sodium was included in both regimens. Intravenous treatment was not superior in achieving the primary outcome, eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> at 3 months and remaining free of infection to 15 months. In the 12 months after completion of the eradication regimen, significantly fewer patients in the intravenous group were admitted to hospital than in the oral group. This difference might be because patients who have already had one hospital admission for eradication are less likely to accept a further admission in the subsequent 12 months. Health-related QOL was similar in the two groups, suggesting 2 weeks of intravenous treatment did not have a negative effect.</p>
              <p id="para470">A Cochrane systematic review<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> has shown that eradication of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> with an antibiotic eradication regimen in patients with cystic fibrosis is effective; however, no evidence exists favouring one eradication regimen over another. UK guidelines recommend inhaled colistimethate sodium and oral ciprofloxacin as first-line treatment.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Guidelines from the USA<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and Europe<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> favour inhaled tobramycin as a single agent, but acknowledge that other regimens (including colistimethate sodium and ciprofloxacin) can be used. Our trial has shown that there is no advantage in choosing intravenous treatment as first-line treatment. When a regimen comprising inhaled colistimethate sodium and oral ciprofloxacin was compared with inhaled tobramycin, there was no difference in eradication rates,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> suggesting inhaled tobramycin would perform equally well against intravenous treatment. The eradication rates achieved in our trial (44% intravenous and 52% oral) are less than those achieved in the ELITE trial<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> of 28 days versus 56 days of inhaled tobramycin (66–69% eradication at 27 months). This might reflect the exclusion of pseudomonas antibody-positive patients from the ELITE trial.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Our trial evaluating a single course of eradication treatment is not directly comparable with trials evaluating regular, cycled therapy such as the EPIC trial.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Eradication treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> is detected in respiratory secretions.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> A recent crossover trial<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> of eradication in young children showed a much lower eradication rate in those who had placebo in the initial 28 day treatment period. In the TORPEDO-CF trial, the protocol mandated that the eradication regimen should start not more than 21 days after <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> isolation.</p>
              <p id="para480">Our health economic evaluation showed a cost saving of £5939 (equivalent to US$7543) per patient with the use of oral versus intravenous treatment. The economic evaluation found that oral eradication therapy was likely to have similar effectiveness for the primary clinical measure, but that oral eradication was considerably cheaper. Consequently, there was high certainty that oral treatment was more cost-effective than intravenous therapy. In secondary analysis, using the EQ-5D-3L to calculate QALYs (commonly used for health technology assessment), oral therapy was also highly likely to be cost-effective versus intravenous therapy. However, estimates on QALYs and utility values reported in this study can only be considered indicative as EQ-5D-3L scores from proxy and self-reported instruments were combined.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">The TORPEDO-CF trial used a pragmatic design to minimise the burden of participation. Respiratory specimens for microbiology were collected at routine clinic visits, which meant that not all were obtained in the 3 week window at the end of the 15 month follow-up. To address this issue we extended the window to include patients with samples 4 weeks either side of 15 months and did a sensitivity analysis using the next sample collected after the 15 month window. We collected sputum or a cough swab when collection of sputum was not possible. We chose a minimum clinically important difference for the primary outcome of 20%. A difference of this size is plausible. In the largest trial<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> eradication to date, a difference of 17% was seen in the rates of eradication between treatment groups. Discussions with the patient community informed the design of the TORPEDO-CF trial and these discussions indicated that, if intravenous treatment was more effective, the magnitude of this effect should be sufficient to justify the inconvenience of hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics.</p>
              <p id="para500">A strength of our study was the large sample size and the length of follow-up. In the first generation of placebo-controlled eradication trials, sample size was often small and microbiological eradication was reported immediately after the end of eradication treatment.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> In 2012, a large RCT evaluating two 28 day eradication regimens showed that more than 60% of participants had further infection with <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> during a median follow-up of 16 months.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Arguably, with longer follow-up, recurrence of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> will be influenced to a lesser degree by a single course of eradication treatment. Hence, the 12 months of post-eradication follow-up used in our study is reasonable.</p>
              <p id="para510">Feasibility data suggested that 25% of eligible patients would be adults.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, we recruited only 15 adults out of a total sample size of 286 participants, because only a small number of adult centres participated. We therefore advise caution in applying these trial findings to the adult cystic fibrosis population. Many patients and families had a strong preference for one eradication regimen: 324 declined to participate because they did not want intravenous therapy and 34 because they did not want an oral regimen. Our feasibility study suggested that 45% of parents and patients would consider participation. The consent rates achieved in TORPEDO-CF were lower, at 286 (37%) of 772 eligible patients approached.</p>
              <p id="para520">Patient engagement work identified <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> eradication (UK)<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and microorganism detection and treatment (USA)<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> as important research priorities—both prioritised reducing treatment burden. Future studies should combine long-term follow-up with regimens to reduce recurrence after eradication. The 2018 OPTIMIZE trial<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> used 18 months of oral azithromycin as an adjunct to eradication with inhaled tobramycin, but found no difference in time to recurrence. When a treatment (such as intravenous antibiotics) is burdensome, but no more effective, it follows that patients should be offered an eradication regimen that is appropriate to their clinical condition and personal circumstances. <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> might be identified at the time of a pulmonary exacerbation when intravenous antibiotics are clinically indicated. In other cases, when the patient is asymptomatic, oral eradication is appropriate. In our trial, only eight (13%) of 137 of patients in the intravenous group and 17 (11%) of 148 patients in the oral group had an exacerbation at baseline.</p>
              <p id="para530">Intravenous treatment often entails hospital admission, requires intravenous access (which might be traumatic),<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> and carries the risk of side-effects, including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity with aminoglycosides such as tobramycin.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Because there were no important clinical benefits to the use of intravenous over oral therapy, the large difference in cost suggests that oral therapy should usually be recommended for eradication of early infection with <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in cystic fibrosis. If the findings of this trial are implemented in routine clinical practice, most patients will receive oral eradication treatment as an outpatient and many hospital admissions will be avoided, which in turn will reduce both treatment burden and health-care costs.</p>
