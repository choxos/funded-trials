                <p id="Par1">The presence of a disease continuum in inflammatory arthritis (IA) is a recognised concept, with distinct stages from at-risk stage (presence of anti citrullinated-peptide autoantibody) to diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including therapy-induced remission. Despite T-cell dysregulation being a key feature of RA, there are few reports of T-cell phenotyping along the IA-continuum. We investigated the disturbances of naïve, regulatory and inflammation related cell (IRC) CD4+ T-cell subsets in 705 individuals across the IA-continuum, developing a simple risk-score (summing presence/absence of a risk-associated with a subset) to predict progression from one stage to the next. In 158 at-risk individuals, the 3 subsets had individual association with progression to IA and the risk-score was highly predictive (p &lt; 0.0001). In evolving IA patients, 219/294 developed RA; the risk-score included naïve and/or Treg and predicted progression (p &lt; 0.0001). In 120 untreated RA patients, the risk-score for predicting treatment-induced remission using naïve T-cells had an odds ratio of 15.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). In RA patients in treatment-induced remission, a score using naïve T-cells predicted disease flare (p &lt; 0.0001). Evaluating the risk of progression using naïve CD4+ T-cells was predictive of progression along the whole IA-continuum. This should allow identification of individuals at high-risk of progression, permitting targeted therapy for improved outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a life-long progressive, autoimmune disorder that primarily affects synovial joints, affecting between 0.5–1% of adults worldwide, with 5–50/100,000 people developing RA each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected ~3 times more. The underlying disease mechanism includes autoimmune attack on joint bone and cartilage, leading to a clinical presentation of joint pain and swelling, with consequent disability and comorbidity. Systemic inflammation contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk, which is at a magnitude comparable to diabetes mellitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Diagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms and the presence of autoantibodies. Current management strategies now aim to diagnose and treat disease at the earliest opportunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The inflammatory arthritis (IA) disease continuum is now a well-accepted concept with distinct stages of progression (notably described as a-f phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>). Prior to disease, there are genetic (a) and environmental (b) risk factors that contribute to disease susceptibility, then a pre-clinical phase (of variable duration) (c), where systemic autoimmunity is manifest by the presence of autoantibodies, notably anti citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), but with no clinical evidence of joint involvement. This is followed by a phase of non-specific symptoms (d) including arthralgia (joint pain) but still without evidence of clinical synovitis. For these at-risk individuals, the aim is to prevent progression to IA/RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Once clinical synovitis is detected (e, undifferentiated arthritis) individual may meet the criteria for RA depending on clinical and serological characteristics (f). However, not all individuals will progress to IA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> with reports suggesting up to 40–50% medium term progression from the ACPA + at-risk stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. At both (e) and (f) stages, once RA is diagnosed, treatment is initiated with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cs-DMARDs), usually methotrexate (MTX). The aim of treatment is attainment of clinical remission as soon as possible, to improve outcomes and minimise comorbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This has been facilitated by improved diagnosis, use of early initiation and escalation of cs-DMARD therapy and the availability of new therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, diagnosing RA in sero-negative patients remains a challenge. Quantifying the risk of progression is the first step towards evidence based stratified intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Although the exact pathogenesis of RA remains unclear, autoimmune processes are known to play a role, as evidenced by linkage with the Major Histocompatibility Complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, autoantibody production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and lymphocyte infiltration in synovial tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These features support the hypothesis of a T-cell driven disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, further supported by the association with many T-cells related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the clinical response to T-cell modulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Over the past 10 years, our group has focused on demonstrating the value of phenotyping T-cells in the blood of RA patients. The initial discovery demonstrated the loss of naïve and regulatory CD4+ T-cells with the appearance of Inflammation Related Cells (IRC, abnormal T-cell subset expressing both naïve and memory differentiation markers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These data led to the consideration of whether T-cell subsets could have value as a biomarker. We established that reduced (age-normalised) frequencies of naive CD4+ T-cells in early RA at baseline were associated with failure to achieve remission with MTX treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we showed that the progression towards IA from at-risk stages (ACPA + no synovitis) could be predicted using all 3 T-cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Following 2 initial reports describing the potential of T-cell subset quantification associated with 2 stages of the IA-continuum (at-risk and response to treatment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, in this study we describe data from 705 patients recruited at distinct stages of the IA continuum, to model the potential clinical utility of scoring T-cells subset as biomarkers predictive of progression to the next stage of the continuum, with implications for targeted management. We first, modelled the clinical value of phenotyping T-cells for the prediction of progression from one stage to the next. Second, we then developed a novel scoring system for these T-cells abnormalities enabling an easy use in clinical practice. This should allow identification of individuals at high-risk of progression, for targeted management and improved outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par7">The quantification of T-cell subsets used flow cytometry (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the 3 subsets were quantified as previously described based on the gates illustrated in the panel a). This technology is routinely used by hospital services and we transferred our research panels to the NHS immunology services of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.

                <p id="Par8">All patients were tested using the NHS services. Demographics and clinical data are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for the 4 groups.

During the untreated at risk stage, all 3 subsets are relevant, but after diagnosis, this changes: Treg having limited value for predicating outcome and IRC being related to levels of inflammation, become only modestly useful. The fact that naïve cells remain predictive at all stages of the IA-continuum increases their value as biomarker (i.e. a test that is predictive independent of other parameters). Combined with longitudinal data showing worsening of the naïve T-cell loss with time in at-risk patients (supplementary material) but then, a limited recovery after MTX therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, this suggest a relative stability of this phenotype over the different stages of the IA-continuum, up to the achievement of remission.</p>

              <p id="Par26">The current study confirms the potential value of T-cell subset quantification for predicting the progression along the IA continuum with implications for the management of IA disease.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Only a proportion of at-risk individuals develop IA, however some individuals appear to be further along the continuum than others and develop disease rapidly. Identifying such individuals at high/imminent-risk of progression is a clinical priority providing an opportunity to intervene and prevent (or at least delay) disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. T-cell subset dysregulation occurs prior to the development of IA, increasing as the time to progression approaches, while remaining unchanged (or even improving slightly) in non-progressors. This opens a major opportunity for management.</p>
              <p id="Par28">For patients with evolving IA, the ability to predict those that will progress to RA should permit earlier intervention with cs-DMARDs, with well-reported benefits for long-term outcomes. Predicting RA therefore has important clinical value. The regression model suggests that using naïve T-cells offers an 80% accuracy in the prediction (with only age and DAS in the model).</p>
              <p id="Par29">In patients with new onset RA, current official guidance advocates clinical remission as a goal and suggests initial therapy with cs-DMARDs, usually MTX. Predicting response to MTX has important value in identifying patients who will do well on MTX. Conversely, identifying those unlikely to achieve this state with cs-DMARDS would avoid of the sustained inflammation which would occur with ineffective therapy, by enabling the immediate initiation of b-DMARDs (in combination with cs-DMARDs), in line with the modern treat-to-target principle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A PPV of 78% for naïve T-cell status combined with a NPV of 81% therefore confirmed the potential clinical utility of naive T-cells as a biomarker for predicting MTX induced remission in early RA. In a previous study, the association between achieving remission and higher naïve T-cells was not observed in patients treated with combination MTX + anti-TNF therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the future, it may be appropriate to consider biologic therapy as first-line DMARD in those RA patients who, on basis of abnormal naïve T-cells, will have a low probability of achieving remission with cs-DMARDs.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Currently, for RA patients achieving clinical remission, current practice is to taper treatment aiming for drug-free remission (EULAR recommendations)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Despite low sensitivity, the high specificity of abnormal naïve T-cells (confirmed by regression modelling) allows identification of patients who should not taper therapy. Further study of the depth of remission need to be performed to assess the sustainability of remission over 12 months notably when on b-DMARDs., Recent data showing that 25–30% of patients with DMARD induced remission, present with reduced naïve cells indicates the potential of this approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Our initial hypothesis that T-cell subsets would have value as biomarker across the IA-continuum was based on a model in which the thymus in IA produces fewer naïve and Treg T-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Naïve cells are also subjected to an abnormal drive for differentiation under the pressure of IL-6 and TNF resulting in the appearance of IRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The most specific disturbance appears to be with the naïve T-cell subset. We previously reported a similar reduction in naive cells in active compared to remitting colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, so such abnormalities may be common to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. IRC are mostly driven by inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and therefore their value may be associated more closely with the monitoring of inflammation (especially when it is subclinical or when CRP is within the normal range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>). IRCs express chemokine receptors that direct them towards inflamed tissue when disease is active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but in remission, chemokine receptor expression and hyper-reactivity is decreased, so IRC re-circulate and persist in the blood. Treg-cells appear more important in the early stages of the IA-continuum. This is consistent with previous data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and the recent hypothesis that the balance between Th17 and Treg cell is lost at this stage resulting in chronicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Although the identification of Th17 cells using surrogate markers (CD4+ CD161+ CCR6+ CXCR3−) is now being developed for routine quantification protocols, discrepancies exist, limiting their utility as biomarker. Alternative techniques such as those based on the epigenetic reprograming of the IL-17 gene in Th17 cells (as for FoxP3 in Treg), may bring more accurate data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The combination of Th17 with naïve and Treg cells may provide an even more comprehensive representation of T-cell in the IA-continuum and increase further the predictability of T-cell subsets.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The main limitation to our work is the lack of longitudinal data due to the fact that these cohort are observational (times visits on a 3, 6 or 12 monthly basis) and progression is occurring at any time during follow-up. It is noteworthy that in the at-risk, early IA, MTX response and remission groups, a similar proportion of patients present with a high-risk (based on naïve CD4+ T-cells) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This work has successfully been transferred from research to NHS services but not yet replicated outside of Leeds and we are involved in dissemination planning. Finally, the use of the CD62L as a second marker for naïve cells (rather than other potential marker such as CCR7 or CD44) has been driven by the relevance of CD62L as a marker of exclusion from tissue expressing IL6 as much as by its role as a lymph node homing receptor characterising naïve cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">A study based on stratification by naïve T-cell using its predictive value for MTX-induced remission will soon start recruiting, and will provide proof of the clinical value of this biomarker. In addition to transferring to NHS-services with efficient process times and reproducibility, we also performed a second feasibility study for postal samples to allow for multicentre studies to be more easily designed (supplementary material, Part IV). The stratification of at-risk individuals developing IA/RA as well as a personalised approach to remission and tapering are now feasible, representing a significant step towards and evidence based approach to rationalising the management of RA.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Subset quantification was performed by the NHS-routine immunology services (in accordance to Good Laboratory Practice) for naive, IRC and Treg cell subsets. Flow cytometry was performed on fresh EDTA blood, (details of procedures and validation in supplementary material Part I). Antibody clones used are described in supplementary material Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1S</xref>. Briefly, naïve and IRC CD4+ T-cell subsets were identified based on their expression of CD45RB-FITC, CD45RA-PE and CD62L-APC. CD4 Treg were quantified by cell surface staining for CD25-APC and CD127-PE followed by intracellular staining for FOXP3-FITC using the anti-human Foxp3 staining kit (Insight Biotechnology, Wembley, UK). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a QUANTO cytometer (BD), using BD Biosciences FACSDIVA software. Gating was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and showed on Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. Subset frequencies were reported as % of CD4+ T-cells. Data analysis using CD4+ T- cell numbers for each subset (rather than % of total CD4+ T-cells) were previously discussed and did not impact conclusion or improvement of statistics. Therefore we chose not to convert % into cell number to avoid additional manipulation of the raw data.</p>
                <p id="Par40">There is an age relationship between naïve and Treg frequencies as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. We established regression equations using 120 healthy controls for naïve and Treg CD4+ T-cells. [expected naïve] = -0.63 ×[age] +66.6 (rho = 0.850, p &lt; 0.0001); [expected Treg] = +0.061 ×[age] +1.83 (rho = 0.554, p = 0.001). IRC were not related to age. IRC were considered high when above the 95% CI of distribution (set at 4%). For naïve and Treg, subset frequencies were then normalised<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and reported as age normalised % of CD4+ T-cells using the heathy control range: [corrected frequency] = [frequency observed in patient] - [frequency expected at that age]. The latter being calculated from the age-subset frequency correlation observed in 120 healthy control. Because this not a statistical correction but a practical variable normalisation allowing to use positive vs negative parameters, we have changed wording  (previously used in publications) to use “normalised %”: where [Normalised %] = [frequency (%) observed in patient] - [frequency (%) expected at that age] as described recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>

Non-parametric tests were used throughout. Analyses were conducted using SPSS 21.1. The level of significance for P values was set at 0.05.</p>
                  <p id="Par42">For univariate analysis, continuous T-cell subset measures were compared between outcome using MWU tests. No adjustment was made for multiple testing as only 3 subset variables were included at this stage. ROC analysis were then performed to establish the individual predictive value of each subset. Thresholds for the dichotomisation of subsets as high and low risk for the outcome investigated were set at ~80% specificity. Sensitivity as well as odds ratio and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were then calculated.</p>
