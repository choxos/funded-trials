                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Heavy drinkers in contact with alcohol services do not routinely have access to testing to establish the severity of potential liver disease. Transient elastography by FibroScan can provide this information. A recent systematic review suggested providing feedback to patients based on markers of liver injury can be an effective way to reduce harmful alcohol intake. This randomised control trial (RCT) aims to establish the feasibility of conducting a larger national trial to test the effectiveness of FibroScan advice and Alcohol Recovery Video Stories (ARVS) in changing high-risk drinking behaviour in community alcohol services common to UK practice.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This feasibility trial consists of three work packages (WP). <italic toggle="yes">WP1</italic>: To draft a standardised script for FibroScan operators to deliver liver disease-specific advice to eligible participants having FibroScan. <italic toggle="yes">WP2</italic>: To create a video library of ARVS for use in the feasibility RCT (WP3). <italic toggle="yes">WP3</italic>: To test the feasibility of the trial design, including the FibroScan script and video stories developed in WP1 and WP2 in a one-to-one individual randomised trial in community alcohol services. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted at 6âmonths follow-up for qualitative evaluation. Outcomes will be measures of the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT. These outcomes will relate to: participant recruitment and follow-up, intervention delivery, including the use of the Knowledge of LIver Fibrosis Affects Drinking trial FibroScan scripts and videos, clinical outcomes, and the acceptability and experience of the intervention and trial-related procedures. Data analysis will primarily be descriptive to address the feasibility aims of the trial. All proposed analyses will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan.</p>

              <p>ARLD causes no symptoms in its earlier stages; indeed, patients are often unaware they have serious physical health problems until they present with the complications of cirrhosis, for example; ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy, variceal bleed and liver failure, when the opportunity for treatment and recovery of liver health is significantly reduced.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5 6</xref> It is estimated that the cost to the UK of alcohol on health is Â£3.5âbillion per year,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7</xref> consuming 3.6% of the National Health Service (NHS) annual budget.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In England, there were 5698 alcohol-specific deaths in 2018, the alcohol-specific age-standardised death rate was 11.9/100 000 (male=16.4 female=7.6). Nottingham (UK) has one of the highest (total=18.6, male=26.8 and female 10.2) alcohol-specific age-standardised death rate/100 000 in the country.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A recent trial from the USA predicted a 75% increase in age-standardised annual mortality and a 65% increase in decompensated cirrhosis due to ARLD over the next two decades.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have established that delivering brief advice about alcohol to harmful drinkers helps them reduce their alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Most studies were conducted in primary care settings where the prevalence of liver disease is likely to be markedly lower than in specialist alcohol treatment services. In alcohol services, where high levels of physical and psychological dependence on alcohol are frequent, National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines state adults with high levels of alcohol dependency should be assessed and offered intensive structured community-based interventions (with or without medical therapy) as these provide the best chance of achieving and maintaining abstinence from alcohol.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Most clinical services in the UK are based on these principles. Individual programmes vary by locality with many of these services delivered by non-NHS providers. Despite the delivery of brief advice and other alcohol-related interventions in clinical practice for over two decades, mortality and morbidity due to alcohol misuse continues to rise in the UK.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is a pressing need to optimise existing interventions to reduce harmful alcohol intake and examine effective alternative options.</p>
              <p>Early diagnosis of liver fibrosis provides an opportunity to intervene and reduce or stop alcohol intake. This is known to be the most effective way of preventing liver disease progression.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Transient elastography by FibroScan (Echosens, France) has been used in primary care (General Practice) settings to detect liver disease in populations identified as having liver disease risk (heavy drinkers and those with type 2 diabetes). These studies showed that screening asymptomatic individuals based on risk for liver disease doubles the rates of liver cirrhosis diagnosis in the primary care populations studied.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Moreover, a recent systematic review suggested providing feedback to patients based on markers of liver injury can be an effective way to reduce harmful alcohol intake.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Access to recovery stories can help address mental health problems and support recovery from addiction.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Peer support from people who have recovered from alcohol misuse is beneficial in modifying high risk drinking behaviour.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>This trial aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of conducting an RCT in community specialist alcohol services settings run by Nottingham Recovery Network (NRN) and to test the acceptability of trial interventions (FibroScan and Alcohol Recovery Video Stories, ARVS).</p>

                <title>Selection of the term âalcohol misuseâ</title>
                <p>We acknowledge the heterogeneity in language used to describe alcohol use, and also the stigma associated with some commonly used terms, which itself can act as barrier to change.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Some terms, such as alcohol use Disorder (AUD), are not well understood in the general population. The concept for this feasibility trial was developed in collaboration with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups. After extensive discussion between the study team and PPI groups, we have opted for the term âalcohol misuseâ as a general term to cover excess alcohol intake, harmful alcohol intake, drinking problems, alcohol dependence, and AUD.</p>
                <p>We define alcohol misuse as âweekly alcohol intake â¥14 units, or an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score of â¥8, or key alcohol worker and/or physician diagnosis or referral from any other services with problem drinkingâ.</p>

                <p>We will organise separate participant and FibroScan operator focus groups to collect feedback on the prototype scripts. The participant focus group will allow us to investigate the key messages to be included in the script and feedback, as well as considering how best to present the FibroScan results (eg, graphically, in the text). The FibroScan operator focus group will specifically discuss implementation in clinical practice. In addition, to evaluate the stage of change that each participant has reached, a validated readiness to change model will be piloted.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>Following Kruegerâs (1988) focus group guide, each focus group will include five to eight participants and will last for a maximum of 2âhours.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Depending on the latest COVID-19 guidelines, the focus group will be either virtual or face-to-face. A topic guide will be used (SP-Focus Group Guide WP1 V.2.0). We aim to arrange two participant focus groups and one FibroScan operator focus group. The focus groups will be facilitated by two members of the research team. Examples of questions include: (a) If you were a participant in the trial, would the script make sense to you? (b) Are there any parts of the script that you do not understand, and if so, why? (c) What is the best way to present the results of the FibroScan (eg, graphically, in the text)?</p>
                <p>Eligible participants (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) will be identified and recruited through multiple channels. For example, via existing patient forums at all three recruitment settings, the KLIFAD PPI group, by offering information to patients self-presenting to any of the trial treatment settings, snowball methods and via Black, Asian and minority ethnicity/Framework PPI groups. The focus group meeting will be recorded and transcribed verbatim either by automated software or an independent sponsor-approved transcriber. After the first participant focus group, the FibroScan script will be edited considering feedback and a second focus group will then be held to review iterated scripts. The final scripts will be sent via email to participants of focus groups for any final thoughts. We will then organise a FibroScan operator focus group of key alcohol workers working at any of the recruitment settings who are willing to give informed consent, to discuss any specific implementation issues.</p>

                <p>WP2 aims to create a video library of ARVS from people with a history of alcohol misuse. These ARVS will be used in the feasibility RCT (WP3).</p>
                <p>Receiving mental health recovery stories can provide benefits to some people experiencing mental health distress,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 24 25</xref> and the effectiveness of mental health recovery stories as an intervention to increase quality of life has been examined in a clinical trial.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, equivalent evidence is not available for the impact of ARVS. So that we can explore the impact of stories of recovery from alcohol misuse, in WP2 we will develop a set of recovery stories from participants who have successfully overcome their alcohol misuse. These videos will be peer-reviewed by the KLIFAD PPI group which will include input from Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH) Black, Asian and minority Ethnic PPI group.

                <p>The ARVS will be recorded either at Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre (NDDC) Biomedical Research Centre Nottingham University Hospital, the University of Nottingham or the participantâs usual place of residence. Each video will be of 2â5âmin duration. Videos will be titled based on FibroScan score (low-risk, medium and high-risk score). Videos will be subtitled and depending on the final video format, after the feedback, we envisage adding a photograph of the storyteller and a short-associated text on the title page with informed consent from the participant.

                <p>For adult drug and alcohol services, there are three main categories of standard intervention (usual care) delivered by the NRN: (a) Psychological: which includes motivational interventions, family and social network interventions and cognitive and behavioural-based relapse prevention interventions (substance misuse specific). (b) Recovery support: which includes 12-step work and counselling.</p>
                <p>(c) Pharmacological: which involves prescribing medication for drug and/or alcohol relapse prevention support. For example, naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram as part of alcohol or opioid relapse prevention therapy and Chlordiazepoxide for acute alcohol withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Specific treatment programmes are started after an initial assessment and based on the participantâs needs. The duration of contact with services varies, most participants stay with services for 12 weeks, some get discharged early and a few stay longer than 6âmonths.</p>

                  <p>As this is a feasibility trial, a formal sample size calculation for between-group comparisons of a primary outcome is not appropriate. Researchers have previously recommended sample sizes between 24 and 50 to satisfactorily achieve feasibility outcomes.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31â33</xref></p>
                  <p>After discussion with community alcohol services data manager and considering variation in number of patients presenting per week, we aim to approach 40 eligible participants per month. Assuming a 50% consent rate, we anticipate randomising 20 participants per month (10 per month per arm) for a recruitment period of 6âmonths. With an estimated sample size of 120, we will be able to calculate a dropout rate of 80% within a 95% CI ofÂ±7.1%. Assuming a non-differential follow-rate of 80%, this target sample size should provide follow-up outcome data on a minimum of 48 participants in each of the two arms.</p>

                  <title>Participant safety</title>
                  <p>There is a risk that being given a normal FibroScan result may provide false reassurance and encourage participants to maintain their current level of harmful drinking or encourage them to drink more. It is also possible that a high reading will generate anxiety. The trial is designed to minimise these risks by providing scripted feedback (WP1) and watching ARVS (WP2).</p>
                  <p>Cirrhosis diagnosis and FibroScan: It is anticipated that a small number of people will be identified who have previously unknown cirrhosis and so would be at risk of complications of liver disease. This will be mitigated by offering onward referral to out-patient Hepatology for all participants with a FibroScan reading &gt;15 kPa. This will be via contact with the participantâs GP and would follow the current NUHT Nottinghamshire adult liver disease stratification pathway for referral.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Some risk mitigations will be through the feedback included in this trial which covers cirrhosis.</p>
                  <p>For WP1 and WP2, we cannot foresee any potential risks except possible emotional distress during participation in a focus group or semi-structured interview. Participants can choose to skip any question that they prefer not to answer. If distress occurs during the WP3 trial visit, we will ask the participant to take a break to recover, or they can choose to terminate the process. We do not expect that the trial will cause any discomfort or pose any disadvantages, however, contact details for the trial team are provided should the participant have any questions before, during or after taking part. We have also provided a list of locally relevant support services at the end of each patient information sheet, which participants can consult.</p>
