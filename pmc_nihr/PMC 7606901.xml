                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Preoperative and perioperative aromatase inhibitor (POAI) therapy has the potential to improve outcomes in women with operable oestrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancer. It has also been suggested that tumour Ki67 values after 2 weeks (Ki67<sub>2W</sub>) of POAI predicts individual patient outcome better than baseline Ki67 (Ki67<sub>B</sub>). The POETIC trial aimed to test these two hypotheses.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>POETIC was an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised, phase 3 trial (done in 130 UK hospitals) in which postmenopausal women aged at least 50 years with WHO performance status 0–1 and hormone receptor-positive, operable breast cancer were randomly assigned (2:1) to POAI (letrozole 2·5 mg per day orally or anastrozole 1 mg per day orally) for 14 days before and following surgery or no POAI (control). Adjuvant treatment was given as per UK standard local practice. Randomisation was done centrally by computer-generated permuted block method (variable block size of six or nine) and was stratified by hospital. Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence. A key second objective explored association between Ki67 (dichotomised at 10%) and disease outcomes. The primary analysis for clinical endpoints was by modified intention to treat (excluding patients who withdrew consent). For Ki67 biomarker association and endpoint analysis, the evaluable population included all randomly assigned patients who had paired Ki67 values available.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Oct 13, 2008, and April 16, 2014, 4480 women were recruited and randomly assigned to POAI (n=2976) or control (n=1504). On Feb 6, 2018, median follow-up was 62·9 months (IQR 58·1–74·1). 434 (10%) of 4480 women had a breast cancer recurrence (280 [9%] POAI; 154 [10%] control), hazard ratio 0·92 (95% CI 0·75–1·12); p=0·40 with the proportion free from breast cancer recurrence at 5 years of 91·0% (95% CI 89·9–92·0) for patients in the POAI group and 90·4% (88·7–91·9) in the control group. Within the POAI-treated HER2-negative subpopulation, 5-year recurrence risk in women with low Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> (low–low) was 4·3% (95% CI 2·9–6·3), 8·4% (6·8–10·5) with high Ki67<sub>B</sub> and low Ki67<sub>2W</sub> (high–low) and 21·5% (17·1–27·0) with high Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> (high–high). Within the POAI-treated HER2-positive subpopulation, 5-year recurrence risk in the low–low group was 10·1% (95% CI 3·2–31·3), 7·7% (3·4–17·5) in the high–low group, and 15·7% (10·1–24·4) in the high–high group. The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse events were hot flushes (20 [1%] of 2801 patients in the POAI group <italic>vs</italic> six [&lt;1%] of 1400 in the control group) and musculoskeletal pain (29 [1%] <italic>vs</italic> 13 [1%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>POAI has not been shown to improve treatment outcome, but can be used without detriment to help select appropriate adjuvant therapy based on tumour Ki67. Most patients with low Ki67<sub>B</sub> or low POAI-induced Ki67<sub>2W</sub> do well with adjuvant standard endocrine therapy (giving consideration to clinical–pathological factors), whereas those whose POAI-induced Ki67<sub>2W</sub> remains high might benefit from further adjuvant treatment or trials of new therapies.</p>

                  <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para30">Longstanding experimental evidence from 1989 led to the hypothesis that short duration, presurgical endocrine therapy for early oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer might improve clinical outcome. We carried out a PubMed search for relevant clinical studies published from Jan 1, 1989 until Dec 31, 2019 using the terms “neoadjuvant endocrine”, “breast cancer”, “clinical trial”, and “presurgical and endocrine therapy”. No reasonably sized randomised trial addressed this issue by the time POETIC commenced recruitment in 2008. Subsequently, a randomised clinical trial reported that depot progesterone for 5–14 days before surgery improved outcome in node-positive early breast cancer. Before the initiation of POETIC, two small clinical neoadjuvant trials, IMPACT and Z1031, reported that tumour Ki67 2–4 weeks after starting preoperative endocrine treatment predicted outcome better than baseline Ki67. POETIC was designed to establish whether the gain in prognostic accuracy merited routine application of presurgical endocrine therapy for this purpose. An additional PubMed search was done with “Ki67” added to the above search terms. One small study of low dose tamoxifen was identified, but this did not substantially add to the earlier evidence. Another modestly sized trial used to triage patients with 2–4 week Ki67&gt;10% to chemotherapy and reporting the long-term outcome for those less than 10%, has led to a larger ongoing trial. One other large ongoing trial applies 10% as a cutoff at 2 weeks of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor for directing patients to different adjuvant therapy. The concept of complete cell cycle arrest has been developed as an additional possible cutoff for on-treatment Ki67.</p>

                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">Results from POETIC suggest that 2 weeks' preoperative endocrine therapy makes no perceptible improvement in long-term outcome, but was nevertheless a safe treatment practice. The trial confirmed the low risk of recurrence for those with a low baseline Ki67. In patients with a high baseline Ki67 value (&gt;10%) a biopsy 2 weeks after starting preoperative endocrine therapy provides additional clinical utility by predicting long-term outcomes. The trial documents the relationship of 2-week Ki67 with risk of recurrence for estimating whether the prognosis of individual patients is sufficiently good on endocrine therapy alone or whether additional treatment such as chemotherapy or new targeted therapies should be considered.</p>
                <p id="para60">
                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">The data show no reason for short-term presurgical treatment to be applied for its direct therapeutic potential, but support prescribing an aromatase inhibitor for the short-term period before breast cancer surgery in oestrogen receptor-positive tumours with a high proliferation rate to derive information on early endocrine responsiveness that can be used to predict a patient's 5-year prognosis on standard adjuvant therapy. The clinical manoeuvres to incorporate this in the patient pathway with reliable quality assured Ki67 are straightforward and the measurement of Ki67 is inexpensive, potentially making this an attractive approach to estimating the prognosis of patients with early breast cancer.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">The POETIC (Peri-Operative Endocrine Therapy—Individualising Care) trial was designed to address two important hypotheses in the treatment of post-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer.</p>
              <p id="para90">The first was that short duration presurgical endocrine therapy might improve clinical outcome. This hypothesis was plausible because 2 weeks' preoperative endocrine therapy had been shown to markedly reduce proliferation in human breast cancer as measured by Ki67.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Longstanding experimental evidence had shown that the stimulatory effect of surgery on the growth of metastases in mice could be inhibited by perioperative endocrine therapy.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Any improvement in long-term outcome following short exposure to preoperative or perioperative endocrine therapy would be achieved with no additional toxicity or resource implications and be of considerable clinical importance.</p>
              <p id="para100">The second hypothesis concerned identifying which patients with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer have a sufficiently good prognosis such that standard of care medical treatment, often comprising adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, was sufficient and which group should be considered for additional therapies. Traditional approaches to this problem had used standard prognostic parameters including size, grade, nodal involvement, and age, often integrated into a prognostic tool (eg, Nottingham Prognostic Index,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Adjuvant Online,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> NHS PREDICT<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>), but these merely provided the predicted probability of benefit for a patient population with given tumour and demo-graphic characteristics. More recently, genomic platforms have been developed aimed at providing more accurate prognostic and predictive information for the individual patient.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, these genomic tests are expensive, by no means universally available, and differ among themselves in terms of the information they provide.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para110">A simple test which predicts outcome after short duration preoperative endocrine therapy could therefore be helpful in accurately selecting appropriate treatment in the individual patient, if it incorporated an in-vivo response to aromatase inhibitor. A small neoadjuvant trial (IMPACT) had already suggested this might be feasible: results showed that tumour Ki67 after 2 weeks (Ki67<sub>2w</sub>) of endocrine treatment predicted outcome better than at baseline (Ki67<sub>B</sub>), remaining significant in multivariable analysis, whereas Ki67<sub>B</sub> did not.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Similar results have subsequently been reported from another small trial comparing letrozole with tamoxifen<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and from a further trial comparing anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane with one another.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> POETIC, with a much larger patient population, aimed to build on these findings to provide the definitive clinical evidence to inform future practice.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para120">This open-label, multicentre, parallel group, randomised, phase 3 trial recruited participants from 130 UK hospitals (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 25–27</xref>). Eligible patients were postmenopausal women (aged at least 50 years with amenorrhoea for more than 12 months, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or had been on hormone replacement therapy within the previous 12 months, and with follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations in the postmenopausal range if aged less than 55 years) with oestrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor- positive (Allred ≥3, H-score ≥2, or ≥1% of positive cells, assessed in local pathology laboratories), HER2-positive or HER2-negative (assessed locally), operable primary breast cancer and no evidence of metastatic spread investigated according to local guidelines. If palpable, a tumour of any size was sufficient, otherwise requiring an ultrasound size of at least 1·5 cm. Women required WHO performance status 0–1 and an indication for standard adjuvant endocrine therapy. Required staging investigations were according to local practice with no additional trial specific investigations. Exclusion criteria were typical for this patient population. Previous endocrine therapy or chemotherapy was not allowed, nor was concurrent use of hormone replacement therapy or any other oestrogen-containing medication (within 4 weeks of randomisation). No previous use of oestrogen implants at any time, current, continuous, long-term systemic steroid usage, or treatment with an unlicensed or investigational drug within 4 weeks of randomisation was allowed. Patients with invasive malignancy diagnosed within the previous 5 years or any severe co-incident medical disease were ineligible (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para130">Patients provided written informed consent before enrolment. POETIC was sponsored by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and approved by the London–South East Research Ethics Committee (reference 08/H1102/37) and managed and analysed by the ICR Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref> for study oversight details). The protocol is in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para140">Participants were randomly allocated (2:1) to perioperative aromatase inhibitor (POAI) treatment or no perioperative treatment (control) by computer-generated permuted block method (variable block size six or nine) derived centrally by ICR-CTSU using its dedicated randomisation system, stratified by hospital. To randomly assign a patient, staff at the recruiting site telephoned ICR-CTSU and thus had no knowledge of future treatment assignment. The allocation ratio weighted trial information to study of biological perioperative drug effects, in particular to assess how these effects relate to long-term outcome. No placebo was used; clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation, but central laboratory staff were masked.</p>

              <sec id="cesec50">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">POAI was a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor in standard dosage (oral anastrozole 1 mg per day or oral letrozole 2·5 mg per day); choice of agent was declared by each participating hospital at trial outset. Before randomisation, all patients had excisional surgery prebooked for around 2 weeks (minimum 10 days) later to ensure timing of surgery was not biased by treatment allocation. POAI was to commence immediately after randomisation allowing duration of treatment before surgery to be as close as possible to 14 days. If surgery was delayed, the pretreatment duration was extended. Treatment continued without interruption until 14 days after surgery.</p>
                <p id="para160">All non-trial adjuvant therapy, laboratory investigations, and disease staging were established on clinical grounds according to standard of care local practice (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). All patients had pretreatment mammography and breast ultrasound according to local diagnostic practice. In December, 2010, the independent data monitoring committee expressed caution relating to the potential influence of POAI therapy on tumour grade measured at surgery. In February, 2011, a letter to investigators, followed by an approved protocol amendment, recommended that local multidisciplinary teams gave due consideration to other factors, including pretreatment grade on diagnostic core where available, when considering use of adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>
                <p id="para170">Follow-up data were submitted annually to ICR-CTSU; disease-related events, second cancers and deaths were reported on occurrence. There was no specific safety endpoint. Adverse event data were restricted to three menopausal symptoms (hot flushes, sweating, and musculoskeletal pain) at baseline, surgery, and at follow-up 2 weeks postsurgery (assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3) as the safety profiles of the aromatase inhibitors used were well established. Serious adverse events were reported or recorded (as per protocol). Participants were able to withdraw from the trial at any time for any reason.</p>
                <p id="para180">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were required before randomisation (baseline) and at surgery. Baseline samples could be a core-cut diagnostic biopsy, a subsequent research core-cut biopsy, or sections from the diagnostic sample. At surgery, samples could be either core biopsies or sections cut from the routine excision.</p>
                <p id="para190">Tissue samples were processed, stored, and analysed for Ki67 staining centrally in the Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. Ki67 was analysed immunohistochemically in a core biopsy taken at baseline (Ki67<sub>B</sub>), and in either a core biopsy or the excision biopsy taken at surgery (Ki67<sub>2W</sub>), and was estimated as the percentage of cancer cells staining positive. We used MIB1 as the primary antibody to Ki67 and detection was done with the REAL EnVision system, both from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark until 2016; now Agilent Technologies, Didcot, UK). Scoring was according to methodology including between-batch quality control procedures as described by the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group Party.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Analysis of 2-week samples from the control group was restricted to a randomly selected subset since minimal change from baseline was expected.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The primary endpoint was time to recurrence (time from randomisation to local, regional, or distant tumour recurrence or death from breast cancer without previous notification of relapse) with second primary cancers and intercurrent deaths censored. Secondary clinical endpoints included relapse-free survival (as per time to recurrence but also including deaths from any cause as events), time to local recurrence (time from randomisation to first confirmed local recurrence, censoring at previous distant recurrence, second primary cancer, or death), time to distant recurrence (time from randomisation to first confirmed distant recurrence or breast cancer death without previous relapse, censoring at second primary cancer or intercurrent death) and overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause). Breast cancer-free survival duplicated the definition of time to recurrence, and was listed in the protocol in error.</p>
                <p id="para210">Ki67 was evaluated as a biomarker in relation to its effect on predicting disease outcomes (one of the trial's two key objectives) and as the molecular secondary endpoint to assess proliferation rate at baseline (Ki67<sub>B</sub>) and at surgery (Ki67<sub>2w</sub>), thus assessing the impact of POAI. The additional molecular secondary endpoint of gene expression profile at core biopsy and at surgical excision is not reported here as data analysis is ongoing.</p>

              <sec id="cesec70">
                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para220">The sample size assumed the proportion of patients with recurrence by 5 years would be low (approximately 10%) given known recurrence rates for similar populations.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> With 4350 patients it would be possible to detect a 3% improvement in time to recurrence at 5 years (10% to 7% recurrences) with 91% power (two-sided α of 5%). The sample size was increased originally from 4000 to 4350 patients to allow for underestimation of the relapse rate potentially owing to patients dying from other causes before breast cancer relapse. This change was endorsed by the trial steering committee and independent data monitoring committee and managed via a protocol amendment approved on Dec 31, 2012.</p>
                <p id="para230">Analyses relating to clinical endpoints were done according to modified intention-to-treat—removing patients who subsequently withdrew consent for use of data. For analyses that assessed the predictive value of Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub>, the population was defined as all randomly assigned patients who had paired Ki67 values available. Patients who did not have primary breast surgery as planned were censored at the date of that decision.</p>
                <p id="para240">Baseline demographic details, tumour characteristics, adjuvant treatment, and Ki67 data are presented with descriptive statistics. Protocol compliance between treatment groups (time from randomisation to surgery and number of inpatient days for surgery) was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests; differences in tumour grade at surgery were assessed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test for trend in prespecified analyses. Worst grade of adverse events and serious adverse reactions to POAI were summarised descriptively. Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> were reported by HER2 status. Analysis of percentage change between Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> used Wilcoxon sign rank tests within treatment groups and Wilcoxon rank-sum test between treatment groups. In a post-hoc exploratory analysis, following initial planned analyses on the trial data, a multivariable logistic regression model was created, using a forward stepwise approach, to determine factors affecting chemotherapy use.</p>
                <p id="para250">For survival-related endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and treatment groups compared with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated within Cox proportional hazards regression models, with HRs of less than one taken to favour POAI. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals and was found to hold. Comparisons between treatment groups were made with and without adjustment for progesterone receptor status (positive, negative, unknown), HER2 status (positive, negative, unknown), presurgical tumour grade (G1, G2, and G3), pathological tumour size (continuous), presurgical histological type (ductal, lobular, special type), nodal status (N0, N1–3, and N4+), age at randomisation (continuous) and vascular invasion (yes, no). Subgroup analyses were done for baseline clinical characteristics and presented using a forest plot.</p>
                <p id="para260">Associations between Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> and time to recurrence were done separately in the POAI and control groups with the principal focus being to study the on-treatment effect of POAI. A post-hoc analysis of all patients combined for Ki67<sub>B</sub> was included for completeness. Assessment of Ki67 in the control group was considered of low additional value because patients were not exposed to perioperative treatment and because of the lack of association between POAI and time to recurrence. Survival analysis included adjustment for clinical factors as mentioned previously, except for HER2 status which was a stratifying factor. HER2-positive tumours have a different pattern of recurrence and were typically additionally treated with specific HER2-targeted therapy. To explore associations between Ki67 and disease outcome in the POAI group, Ki67 scores were dichotomised and patients divided into four groups as follows: low–low (Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> &lt;10%); high–low (Ki67<sub>B</sub> ≥10%, Ki67<sub>2W</sub> &lt;10%); high–high (Ki67<sub>B</sub> and Ki67<sub>2W</sub> ≥10%); and low–high (Ki67<sub>B</sub> &lt;10%, Ki67<sub>2W</sub> ≥10%). Few POAI patients were classified into the low–high group. These are reported for completeness but not further analysed as their apparent response is probably due to measurement variability around the dichotomisation cut-point. Post-hoc subgroup analyses explored associations between Ki67 and disease outcome by chemotherapy use and age with a view to avoid confounding of interpretation. In addition to the predefined 10% Ki67 dichotomisation, chosen to ensure consistency with other neoadjuvant trials,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> other cut-points were explored using Harrell's C coefficient<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> including that for complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA; Ki67 ≤2·7%<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>).</p>
                <p id="para270">Previous analyses<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> of change in Ki67 in 679 control group patients with paired samples available indicated that in patients with a core-cut surgery sample the median proportional reduction was −4·1% (IQR −27·8 to 34·8), whereas in those with a resection sample at surgery, the median proportional reduction in Ki67 between baseline and surgery was −17·7% (IQR −44·2 to 12·7) in contrast with an earlier small pilot study.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> From these findings, it was assumed that, for a given surgical sample, change in Ki67 score would be proportionally approximately 15% less if the sample was core-cut rather than resection (eg, 10% reduction with resection sample translated to 8·5% for core-cut). To account for this difference, Ki67 data and the analyses linking Ki67 and time to recurrence were done with Ki67<sub>2W</sub> corrected according to surgical sample type. Ki67<sub>2W</sub> scores from resection samples were increased proportionally by 15%. This correction factor was derived (and used) in control participants and similarly applied to participants in the POAI group. The correction was also made for patients for whom surgical sample type was unknown. For cases where Ki67<sub>2W</sub> was 0%, no adjustment was made.</p>
                <p id="para280">This manuscript describes the primary endpoint analysis, time to recurrence after a 5-year median follow-up for both hypotheses; first by randomised POAI allocation and second exploring the ability of Ki67 to predict disease outcome. No formal interim analyses were planned or done before the primary analysis.

All analyses were done by means of Stata (version 13.1). A p value of less than 0·05 was deemed to be significant.</p>

Six patients subsequently withdrew consent for data to be used and therefore 4480 patients (2976 POAI, 1504 control) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="para320">Median age at randomisation was 67·1 years (IQR 61·5–74·8), 2536 (57%) of 4480 patients had a tumour size up to 2 cm, and all but eight (&lt;1%) patients were confirmed locally to have hormone receptor-positive tumours (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). 23 (1%) of 4480 patients did not have surgery as planned (16 patients in the POAI group and seven in the control group; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Adherence to trial treatment and timelines are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 14)</xref>. 177 (6%) of 2976 patients did not have the protocol defined duration of POAI (preoperatively &lt;10 days or &gt;21 days, postoperatively &lt;10 days). The most common reasons were 63 (2%) had their surgery changed, 35 (1%) had less owing to adverse events (16 were in the presurgical period), and 30 (1%) had less owing to patient choice or omission. Surgical details and postsurgery tumour characteristics were well balanced between groups with the exception of pathological tumour grade, which was higher in the control group (p&lt;0·0001; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Adjuvant radiotherapy and anti-HER2 therapy were given after surgery with similar frequency for the two groups and in line with UK standard of care. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 770 (26%) of 2957 patients in the POAI group and 460 (31%) of 1493 patients in the control group (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 15</xref>) with multivariable analyses attributing this to differences observed in postsurgical grade (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 16</xref>). Following surgery, most (POAI 2507 [86%] of 2960 patients; control 1186 [81%] of 1497 patients) women were prescribed aromatase inhibitor monotherapy (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para430">POETIC is, to our knowledge, the largest trial of its kind to assess the potential of POAI therapy in patients with postmenopausal, hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer and it did not show any significant long-term improvement in disease outcomes with this approach. This was despite preclinical experimental evidence in a mouse model suggesting the contrary.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A smaller phase 3 clinical trial, which reported after POETIC was initiated, randomly assigned operable breast cancer patients (n=976, 50% hormone receptor-positive, 45% hormone receptor-negative, and 5% hormone receptor unknown) to surgery or an intramuscular injection of depot hydroxyprogesterone 500 mg 5–14 days before surgery; no significant benefit was observed in the overall population (HR 0·87, 95% CI 0·68–1·09; p=0·23), but the results suggested a hypothesis-generating potential disease-free survival improvement in node-positive subgroups (HR 0·72, 0·54–0·97; p=0·02).<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In contrast, consistent with the overall finding, POETIC showed no suggestion of long-term outcome improvement with POAI overall or in the node-positive subgroup.</p>
              <p id="para440">In POETIC, the frequency of chemotherapy was slightly lower in patients in the POAI group than in those in the control group. Multivariable regression supported the suggestion that this was probably because of multidisciplinary teams being influenced by pathological tumour grade, which was on average lower in the patients in the POAI group. This absolute difference was small however (5%), and since the overall event rate was less than 20% would have had an imperceptible effect on outcome comparisons.</p>
              <p id="para450">On a pragmatic note, it is common practice to start some patients on preoperative endocrine therapy if there has to be a significant delay in surgery for any reason. Despite not showing any statistical evidence of clinical benefit, our results provide reassurance that there is no detriment to this practice.</p>
              <p id="para460">The second aim of this trial was to explore whether the measurement of tumour Ki67 2 weeks after starting treatment could predict disease outcome better than baseline Ki67 alone, thus providing the basis of a simple and inexpensive test to personalise adjuvant treatment in patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Previously, IMPACT had shown that 2-week on-treatment Ki67 predicted outcome better than baseline and, unlike baseline, was significant in multivariable analysis.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> POETIC has provided evidence for the clinical validity of on-treatment aromatase inhibitor Ki67<sub>2W</sub> in addition to Ki67<sub>B</sub> to predict those with high residual risk of recurrence in spite of standard-of-care therapy. At the initiation of POETIC, we believed that the evidence was insufficient to withhold or direct therapy on the basis of the Ki67<sub>2W</sub>. Our results provide an early indication of endocrine sensitivity or resistance including for the large number of patients who are not routinely considered for adjuvant chemotherapy.</p>
              <p id="para470">Separate clearly defined adjuvant treatment pathways for HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancers now exist and we therefore analysed these groups separately when considering prognostic risk. The HER2-positive subgroup was small with relatively few events. Focus for exploratory analysis was therefore on the HER2-negative subgroup, which comprised approximately 90% of the POETIC population.</p>
              <p id="para480">Previously, it had been shown that patients with a low Ki67<sub>B</sub> have a better prognosis than those with a high Ki67<sub>B</sub> value.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> POETIC confirmed this in a larger prospective population, dichotomising Ki67<sub>B</sub> at 10% with 5-year recurrence risk in HER2-negative patients in the POAI group of 4·4% for low Ki67<sub>B</sub> and 11·8% for high Ki67<sub>B</sub>. To our knowledge, this is the first large published dataset that makes use of the Ki67 scoring methodology recommended by the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group; the strong association of Ki67 at baseline with prognosis served as a clinical validation of that methodology.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Patients whose Ki67<sub>B</sub> was low did well on standard of care, with approximately 85% of those receiving endocrine therapy alone. It could be the case that if the patient's clinical pathological features led to chemotherapy being given, this approach might have contributed to the good outcomes. But irrespective of adjuvant treatment, it is reasonable to conclude that Ki67<sub>2w</sub> did not add significant prognostic or predictive information in this subgroup.</p>
              <p id="para490">In contrast, for patients whose tumours had a high baseline Ki67 in the POAI group, 73% had a low Ki67<sub>2w</sub> 2 weeks after starting treatment; those patients had a better prognosis at 5 years than those who continued to have a high Ki67<sub>2W</sub> (8·4% <italic>vs</italic> 21·5% 5-year recurrence risk). To what extent could this observation be applied to clinical practice?</p>
              <p id="para500">The answer to this question is influenced by the limitations of this trial. The first concerns the optimal cutoff for Ki67, and we have shown that dichotomising for cutoffs other than 10% merit further exploration. The second limitation concerns interpreting the data in relation to age and chemotherapy usage. Older age has already been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and POETIC patients aged at least 70 years had poorer outcomes than those aged below 70 years. Since a substantial minority (26%) of POAI patients had adjuvant chemotherapy, this could be a potential confounding factor in the interpretation of Ki67<sub>2W</sub> in relation to prognosis and prediction of the value of endocrine therapy alone. To address this, we repeated our analyses in patients according to their receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. This confirmed a persisting worse outcome for tumours high–high after 2 weeks of an aromatase inhibitor compared with high–low in the 74% of patients not receiving chemotherapy. In the corresponding groups who received chemotherapy, numbers were insufficient to determine a prognostic Ki67 effect or to define a plausible beneficial chemotherapy effect.</p>
              <p id="para510">In the two-thirds of patients below the age of 70 years not receiving chemotherapy, the overall outcome in terms of recurrence risk was better, probably reflecting the choice of omitting chemotherapy for better prognosis patients. But the key point was that in this population of patients non-confounded by chemotherapy, 21% with high Ki67<sub>B</sub> remained high at surgery (high–high) and those had 11·2% 5-year recurrence risk (arguably meriting chemotherapy in addition), compared with the low–low groups in which recurrence by 5 years was only 1·6% and the high–low group in which recurrence by 5 years was only 2·9% (indicating that additional chemotherapy would be of no clinically relevant benefit). This exploratory outcome must be interpreted with caution but further supports the prognostic value of measuring Ki67 at 2 weeks.</p>
              <p id="para520">Similar findings were observed for patients aged at least 70 years. Only 59 of those patients received chemotherapy, too few to provide statistical confidence in the relationship between Ki67 and outcome. In those aged at least 70 years who did not receive chemotherapy, there was again a large difference in outcome between the high–low and high–high groups (5-year recurrence risk 12·3% <italic>vs</italic> 34·5%), again supporting the discriminatory power of measuring Ki67 at 2 weeks, even though the absolute risks were greater.</p>
              <p id="para530">The prespecified Ki67<sub>2w</sub> 10% cut-point was chosen for consistency with ongoing clinical trials (ALTERNATE [<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01953588" id="interrefs50">NCT01953588</ext-link>]; ADAPT [<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01779206" id="interrefs60">NCT01779206</ext-link>]). The relationship of Ki67<sub>2w</sub> with recurrence risk is continuous and as illustrated by our analysis by means of CCCA, other cut-points might be selected if appropriate for a specific use (eg, assessing the value of well-tolerated additional treatment).</p>
              <p id="para540">In conclusion, in POETIC, giving perioperative endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor had no significant effect on long-term outcome. The trial also showed that using Ki67<sub>B</sub> and aromatase inhibitor on-treatment Ki67<sub>2w</sub> could help guide adjuvant treatment decisions. First, we believe that we have identified a subgroup with a low baseline Ki67 who have a sufficiently good prognosis that the majority will do well on standard endocrine therapy alone (except perhaps for a minority as dictated by other clinical–pathological factors) and who do not require a repeat 2-week biopsy. Second, giving POAI to the subgroup with high baseline Ki67 can differentiate two groups of patients according to their 2-week Ki67 value: those who convert to a low Ki67 might not need anything beyond adjuvant endocrine therapy (taking consideration of other clinical-pathological factors), whereas those with a high Ki67 that has remained high, should be considered for further adjuvant treatments and trials. There are, of course, now several commercially available genomic platforms developed to provide the same kind of prognostic and predictive information for the individual patient.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> But these tests are expensive, they often involve central testing of tissue, which has to be sent long distances with inevitable time delay, and results can differ between the platforms. Ki67 as used in POETIC potentially offers an inexpensive, easy and quick alternative in situations in which genomic testing is not readily available.</p>
