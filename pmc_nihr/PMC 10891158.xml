                <p id="Par1">Viral clearance, antibody response and the mutagenic effect of molnupiravir has not been elucidated in at-risk populations. Non-hospitalised participants within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms randomised to receive molnupiravir (n = 253) or Usual Care (n = 324) were recruited to study viral and antibody dynamics and the effect of molnupiravir on viral whole genome sequence from 1437 viral genomes. Molnupiravir accelerates viral load decline, but virus is detectable by Day 5 in most cases. At Day 14 (9 days post-treatment), molnupiravir is associated with significantly higher viral persistence and significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titres compared to Usual Care. Serial sequencing reveals increased mutagenesis with molnupiravir treatment. Persistence of detectable viral RNA at Day 14 in the molnupiravir group is associated with higher transition mutations following treatment cessation. Viral viability at Day 14 is similar in both groups with post-molnupiravir treated samples cultured up to 9 days post cessation of treatment. The current 5-day molnupiravir course is too short. Longer courses should be tested to reduce the risk of potentially transmissible molnupiravir-mutated variants being generated. Trial registration: ISRCTN30448031</p>

              <p id="Par3">Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with the nucleoside analogue molnupiravir (MK4482, EIDD2801) was reported to reduce viral load, hospitalisation and mortality in unvaccinated participants with early COVID-19 in the MOVeOUT trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Based on these data, molnupiravir received emergency use authorisation in the UK in November 2021 for early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals deemed to be at higher risk of complications due to age or underlying comorbidities.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Molnupiravir is metabolised intracellularly to NHC-triphosphate, which competes with natural cytidine and uridine for incorporation by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) into the nascent viral RNA. This leads to abnormal, non-Watson-Crick pairing with guanosine and uridine in further rounds of replication, increasing the substitution of adenosine for guanosine and cytosine for uridine, so-called transition mutations, within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Lethal mutagenesis resulting from treatment with RdRp inhibitors eventually leads to viral extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. A distinctive pattern of transition mutagenesis is evident in viral genomes recovered from animals and humans who have received molnupiravir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The risk that, following molnupiravir treatment, some highly mutated viruses might remain viable and capable of onward transmission has been postulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To measure the impact of molnupiravir in a largely vaccinated population, the Platform Adaptive trial of NOvel antiviRals for eArly treatMent of covid-19 In the Community (PANORAMIC) was established. The first drug tested in PANORAMIC was molnupiravir, and amongst 25,783 mostly vaccinated individuals, found that molnupiravir did not reduce hospitalisation or death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (primary endpoint). Secondary outcomes showed those receiving molnupiravir experienced significantly reduced viral load during treatment and reported faster symptom recovery and fewer general practitioner consultations than those receiving Usual Care.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here we report detailed results of the PANORAMIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> virology sub-study, where a subset of participants in both arms underwent serial virology and immunology sampling. Demographic, clinical, and viral load data together with biomarkers of immune response (anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody) and disease severity (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP)) were collected to study viral and immune dynamics. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and viral culture provide further insights into the risk-benefit profile of molnupiravir to patient and public health.</p>

                <p id="Par7">Prior to the molnupiravir arm closing, 657 out of 6127 participants approached agreed to take part in the virology sub-study, with 94 participants sent kits for intensive sampling (daily nasopharyngeal swab for 7 days plus Day 14) and 563 for less intensive sampling (nasopharyngeal swab on Days 1, 5 and 14). A recruitment flow chart is provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. All participants were asked to provide a dried blood spot on Days 1, 5 and 14. The Day 1 swab and blood spot were performed prior to treatment commencing and so constituted the baseline sample. Of these 81 (86%) intensively sampled participants and 500 (89%) less intensively sampled participants returned swabs. Overall, 2014/2441 (82.5%) swabs and 1608/1731 (92.9%) dried blood spot samples were returned. Four participants were excluded due to all swabs being undetectable for virus, yielding a final cohort of 577 participants with 1990 viral loads and, after removing 25 dry blood spot samples with insufficient material for analysis and those from the four excluded participants, 1566 spike antibody measures were retained. More participants in Usual Care enroled, but number of analysable samples returned per participant, baseline demographics, viral load, spike antibody and days since symptom onset were balanced between groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). There was however a significantly higher proportion of female participants in the Usual Care arm.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Disposition of PANORAMIC participants approached and provided virology samples.</title><p>&lt; LLOQ, below lower limit of quantification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2024_45641_Fig1_HTML" id="d33e741"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographics for the included participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Molnupiravir (n = 253)</th><th>Usual Care (n = 324)</th><th>P-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Intensive sampling (%)</td><td>38 (15%)</td><td>42 (13%)</td><td>0.557</td></tr><tr><td>Median number of viral load measurements per participant intensive group (range)</td><td>8 (4,8)</td><td>8 (4,8)</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Median number of viral load measurements per participant less-intensive group (range)</td><td>3 (1,3)</td><td>3 (1,3)</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Median number of spike antibody measurements per participant (range)</td><td>3 (0,3)</td><td>3 (0,3)</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Age years (sd)</td><td>58 (10.1)</td><td>58 (10.9)</td><td>0.844</td></tr><tr><td>Female (%)</td><td>139 (55%)</td><td>212 (65%)</td><td>0.0133</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity non-white (%)</td><td>7 (3%)</td><td>9 (3%)</td><td>&gt;0.999</td></tr><tr><td>Fully vaccinated (≥3 doses) (%)</td><td>240 (95%)</td><td>314 (97%)</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>Inhaled corticosteroids (%)</td><td>56 (22%)</td><td>70 (22%)</td><td>0.959</td></tr><tr><td>Immune disease (%)</td><td>23 (9%)</td><td>21 (6%)</td><td>0.311</td></tr><tr><td>Obesity (%)</td><td>43 (17%)</td><td>46 (14%)</td><td>0.419</td></tr><tr><td>Any comorbidity (%)</td><td>167 (66%)</td><td>199 (61%)</td><td>0.294</td></tr><tr><td>PANORAMIC primary outcome: Hospitalised or died (%)</td><td>2 (0.79%)</td><td>3 (0.93%)</td><td>&gt;0.999</td></tr><tr><td>Mean days since symptom onset at baseline (sd)</td><td>2.4 (0.78)</td><td>2.5 (1.12)</td><td>0.621</td></tr><tr><td>Mean viral load (log10(cp/mL)) at baseline (sd)</td><td>7.4 (1.14)</td><td>7.3 (1.04)</td><td>0.334</td></tr><tr><td>Mean spike antibody (log10(U/mL)) at baseline (sd)</td><td>3.3 (0.45)</td><td>3.3 (0.44)</td><td>0.91</td></tr><tr><td>Mean capillary CRP (mg/L) at baseline (sd)</td><td>0.68 (0.65)</td><td>0.65 (0.64)</td><td>0.544</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Continuous variables are reported as mean and standard deviation apart from the number of measurements which are reported as mean (range).

                <p id="Par9">Viral load declined significantly faster in molnupiravir-treated participants during treatment, but at the end of the 5-day course, only a minority (14%) had viral load below the lower limit of quantification (&lt;LLOQ) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In the multivariable viral dynamic model, sex, age, time since symptom onset and baseline spike antibody titre were significant predictors of baseline viral load (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). No covariate affected the slope of viral load decline except for molnupiravir. Molnupiravir significantly increased viral decline rate during treatment but significantly decreased it following treatment cessation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). The model predicts male participants have on average 0.2 log10 copies/mL higher baseline viral load whereas for a 10 year increase in age from the median a 0.13 log10 copies/mL increase in viral load is expected. A 0.5 log10 U/mL decrease in spike antibody from the population median is associated with a 0.18 log10 copies/mL increase in viral load. Time since symptom onset increasing from 2 to 5 days was associated with a 0.9 log10 copies/mL decrease in viral load. The viral decline half-life in Usual Care was 0.72 days. This decreased to 0.41 days when on molnupiravir, and then increased to 1.71 days post-treatment.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Viral and spike antibody dynamics in molnupiravir (purple) and Usual Care (grey) arms.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Median viral load ±95%CI with time, below limit of quantification (BLOQ) measures substituted with LOQ/2 for molnupiravir (<italic>n</italic> = 253) and Usual Care (<italic>n</italic> = 324) compared with a Mann–Whitney test. <bold>b</bold> Viral load with time showing multivariable linear viral dynamic model predictions for a typical individual (female, median age, S-Ab and time since symptom onset) receiving molnupiravir (purple line) or Usual Care (black line).

Increased numbers of spike mutations-of-interest over time were identified at low (5–50%) and consensus level (&gt;50%), particularly in molnupiravir-treated individuals, and more so in those with virus persisting beyond Day 5 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Emerging spike antibody escape or other mutations in molnupiravir-treated participants did not appear associated with viral decline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>).

A third substitution, F694Y, in NSP12 has been previously identified as an artefact of the ARTIC primer amplification and was therefore excluded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The recurrent NSP8 mutation is uncommon among UK viruses (0.01%) in the GISAID database and was present at a low level (&lt;6%) in three molnupiravir samples (Day 5) taken during this study. The mutation is not known to be in a position that affects RdRp function. The recurrent RdRp substitution N507I in Usual Care was present in 26 participants, nine in the molnupiravir-treated and 17 in Usual Care, including at baseline.

              <p id="Par23">This first report of a PANORAMIC virology-sub-study has shown that important virology and immunology insights are feasible through minimally invasive participant self-sampling. In the main trial molnupiravir treatment did not demonstrate benefit in reducing hospitalisations or deaths compared to Usual Care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We now show that while 800 mg molnupiravir twice daily for 5 days causes initial significant viral load reductions, treatment is independently associated with increased risk of detectable virus at Day 14 likely resulting from too short a treatment duration. The residual virus in participants receiving molnupiravir is mutated and can be cultured up to 9 days post-cessation of treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Our viral dynamic results conflict with those of the Phase II study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, in which mean viral loads were lower and the proportion with &lt;LLOQ viral loads higher in the molnupiravir-treated individuals one month later. However, in the Phase III trial viral load reductions were less marked during treatment, with less than 1 log10 copies/mL difference in treated or untreated by Day 5 and did not persist with post-treatment follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Our baseline viral loads were around 1 log10 higher than previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and since our estimate of viral decline rate, δ, was similar to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, our higher viral loads are a consequence of higher baseline. The causes of this include PANORAMIC participants being older with shorter time since symptom onset than previous studies. The incubation period of the omicron variant is around a day shorter than previous variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> which may have contributed to higher viral loads. In the treatment of infectious disease, it is rare for an effective therapeutic agent to be stopped before pathogen clearance. A 5-day course is too short to clear the virus and may explain the lack of clinical benefit in the main trial.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Modelling studies in SARS-CoV-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and other acute viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> showed antivirals are most effective early in disease, and we were able to recruit participants within 2.5 days of symptom onset on average.

Lower spike antibody correlating with higher viral loads underlines the evidence for spike antibody being a correlate of protection and control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The slower viral elimination rate post-treatment seen with molnupiravir maybe a result of greater numbers of target cells remaining to support ongoing infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, but lower spike antibody response due to initial viral suppression and/or viral genetic changes may contribute.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titres were significantly lower with molnupiravir by Day 14 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), even after controlling for other covariates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Early rapid reduction in viral load with molnupiravir treatment may have caused a smaller rise in antibody levels due to lower antigenic stimulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Whilst we were unable to culture sufficient virus to undertake antibody neutralisation assays, the magnitude of difference in antibody titre between the arms by Day 14 (2200 U/mL lower in the molnupiravir arm) when antibody response usually peaks, is likely to be clinically significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. With populations becoming increasingly reliant on natural infection to boost immunity, antiviral blunting of antibody response is a concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Molnupiravir acts through transitional nucleotide mutagenesis. Where the virus is not driven to extinction, mutated but viable viruses persist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences potentially displaying the mutational hallmarks of molnupiravir treatment have been identified among opportunistically sampled sequences in public databases. The enrichment for these mutated sequences both geographically, in countries with higher molnupiravir use, and temporally, after molnupiravir received its first emergency use license, underlines concern that molnupiravir mutated viruses may be capable of transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The ability of mutated viruses to persist fits with theoretical and experimental research in evolutionary biology suggesting that reductions in population fitness paradoxically confers increased potential for gaining beneficial variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. It is possible that molnupiravir-induced mutagenesis leads to increased non-synonymous variants with improved viral fitness. The independent occurrence of nine consensus-level mutations in more than one molnupiravir-treated participant with virus detectable on Day 14 might indicate an element of selection. P104S (ORF3a) and S1952L (ORF1a), at a prevalence of 0.07% and 0.03% respectively, are rare in the UK population, based on the GISAID database of opportunistically collected samples, and were also found at baseline in some samples. The significance of these together with others in ORF1a and A99T (ORF3a) which are also frequently observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> is unclear.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The only repeatedly occurring substitution (F490S present in 1.52% of the UK population) in the RBD has been shown to affect the binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. F490S has also appeared naturally in two variants of concern, the lambda lineage in 2021 and the currently circulating XBB 1.5 and related lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The rise to consensus following treatment, of F490S independently in two participants with virus persisting at Day 14, may be due to selection.</p>
              <p id="Par30">One consensus mutation and another below consensus that potentially could cause molnupiravir resistance based on data from MERS-CoV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> were found. V234I was present at consensus in one Day 14 virus but not in an earlier sample. It was not present at baseline in this population and found at very low frequency (1–5%) in three molnupiravir-treated participants at Day 5. V560L was present below consensus at Day 14 and not found in other participants. The independent emergence of the A716V mutation in the RdRp catalytic binding site on Day 14 in more than 1 patient is notable. This mutation was only found in molnupiravir-treated samples, and only rising to consensus level in two participants with virus persisting at Day 14. A716V has a prevalence in the UK of 0.0013% (GISAID database). Although the low levels seen during treatment make it unlikely to have conferred high level resistance to molnupiravir, it is possible that A716V, having been selected by molnupiravir, promotes greater survival fitness. Marker transfer studies to examine resistance for all three putative resistance substitutions are now needed.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Previous studies recovered viable virus from placebo-treated groups but not after treatment with molnupiravir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> whereas we did recover viable virus after molnupiravir treatment. The high transition to transversion mutation ratio we observed is in line with observational data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These observational data also had long branch lengths with evidence of excess transition (G to A and C to T) mutations. We observed 224 consensus genome-wide amino acid substitutions in viruses recovered from molnupiravir-treated participants on Day 14 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Only one substitution in the spike region was also reported in the opportunistically collected samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Other mutations below consensus were also found in both datasets. There were six mutations in the Usual Care group. The methods developed by Sanderson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> identified persistent molnupiravir-treated viruses in our study with high specificity, thus confirming their utility as public health tools for monitoring circulation of these viruses. Our data support the hypothesis that molnupiravir-mutated viruses which survive treatment can remain viable, thus posing a risk for transmission of new variants.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Sequencing identified four participants whose viral sequences showed little or no evidence of drug exposure, meaning they may not have taken the drug despite reporting having done so. For a further nine participants, who, despite evidence for molnupiravir-associated mutations at Day 5, had lost these by Day 14, it is possible that wild type virus, sequestered in compartments protected from drug treatment, outcompeted mutated virus when molnupiravir was terminated. Incomplete drug penetration into inflamed lungs has been proposed to explain similar findings in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In such situations, combination treatments may be beneficial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Systemic inflammation, especially CRP &gt; 40 mg/L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and elevated interleukin-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> is a hallmark of severe disease with COVID-19. Baseline disease severity as measured by CRP demonstrated a positive correlation with baseline viral load. Importantly, molnupiravir appeared to have no impact on CRP. This contrasts with findings from the MOVe-OUT study where post-baseline CRP levels were lower in the molnupiravir treated group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our dry blood spot CRP assay is exploratory but its positive correlation with baseline viral load and reduction over time suggest it reflects inflammation. Therefore, differences in baseline immune status (SARS-CoV-2 naïve in MOVe-OUT but vaccinated in PANORAMIC), and possibly lower overall degree of systemic inflammation at baseline in PANORAMIC may be more relevant.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Our study has some limitations. Since recruitment was from across the UK, participants were required to self-sample and return these by post. Of the participants who received kits we had an excellent rate of sample returns (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). High sample quality likely resulted from participants being provided detailed written and video instructions. Treatment allocation was not blinded but agreement to take part was before randomisation so higher numbers in Usual Care likely appeared by chance. The two arms were matched for demographics and baseline variables except for more female participants in Usual Care. Reassuringly the proportion returning samples (90% versus 88%) was not significantly different between the groups (<italic>p</italic> = 0.2706). Multivariable models corrected for sex, viral load and spike antibodies were similar between groups at baseline, only becoming significantly different with or without molnupiravir. This unbalance is therefore unlikely to have biased the results. Our study was not designed or powered to detect rates of viral mutation frequency, rather to ensure enough viruses were sequenced to detect common mutations and therefore generate hypotheses on consequences of mutagenesis. We fell short of the overall target of 600 participants before the molnupiravir arm closed due to the time lag between recruitment and sample return, but did achieve the minimum desired 30 per arm in the intensively samples group. We were unable to confirm escape of mutated viruses from the effects of host antibodies through viral neutralisation as culture was unsuccessful for these samples.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In summary, following a 5-day molnupiravir course, whilst viral load decreased on treatment it was not reduced to &lt;LLOQ levels before the drug was stopped, thus violating a fundamental principle of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Post-treatment, higher viral loads occurred in the molnupiravir group and some of these viruses were culturable indicating potential for transmission. Molnupiravir-exposed viruses were highly mutated, and the increased numbers of functionally relevant mutations including those known to confer evasion of neutralising antibody, potentially conferring selective advantage, is of concern. Furthermore, spike antibody response was blunted. Our study therefore indicates that 5 day of molnupiravir could drive the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of increased virulence or transmission and potentially leaves treated patients more susceptible to re-infection. These findings imply a need for a longer course of molnupiravir to be tested in a clinical trial and should inform decisions on whether to use the current 5-day course of molnupiravir until the results of such a trial are available.</p>

                <p id="Par36">To be eligible to join the PANORAMIC study (ISRCTN30448031), participants had to be symptomatic within the past 5 days, have a confirmed COVID-19 infection within the past 7 days (either a positive PCR or rapid antigen SARS-CoV-2 test), and be either aged 50 years and over or at least aged 18 years with relevant comorbidities. Participants provided written informed consent to take part in the trial and a subset were invited to take part in the virology sub-study for which further written informed consent was obtained. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the South Central-Berkshire Research Ethics Committee of the Health Research Authority approved the trial (Ethics approval reference: 21/SC/0393). Participants were not compensated financially or otherwise for taking part. Details of the main study design and statistical analysis plan have been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The virology study’s pre-specified primary outcome was viral load at Day 7, and has been reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The pre-specified secondary outcomes reported here were: change in viral load over 14 days post-treatment, change in spike antibody concentrations over 14 days post-treatment, and to determine whether genetic mutations in the virus are more frequent in patients taking antiviral treatment compared with Usual Care.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Participants in the virology sub-study were provided with Respiratory Virus Swab Collection kits, which consisted of a Sigma Virocult 1 ml tube containing Liquid Virocult medium and a Standard Tip Swab that complied with the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive. The kits also included detailed instructions approved for self-sampling of nasal and pharyngeal swabs, as well as dried blood spot sampling kits. A weblink to a video tutorial was provided to aid sample collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/klB-ckiQGz8">https://youtu.be/klB-ckiQGz8</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="Par39">The goal was to recruit 300 participants into the trial intervention arm (molnupiravir) and the Usual Care comparator arm. Based on a previously published viral dynamic model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> it was estimated that 30 participants in each arm could detect a proportional difference of 0.36 to 0.8 in below-detection-limit viral loads based on a two-sample test for proportions with a Type I error probability set to 0.025 and power set to 0.9. Hence this would give sufficient power to detect viral load differences for a potent antiviral and was the sample size for the Intensive sampling group. A further 270 participants in each arm had less-intensive viral load monitoring with the aim to detect smaller viral load differences and, since genetic mutations may not happen under antiviral treatment and if they do, their frequency was unpredictable, a total of 300 participants would provide a 95% probability of seeing at least one example of a mutation occurring in 1% or more of participants.</p>
                <p id="Par40">In the intensive sampling cohort, the participants were asked to collect nasopharyngeal swabs daily from Days 1 to 7 and on Day 14. In the non-intensive sampling cohort, participants collected nasopharyngeal swabs on Days 1, 5, and 14. Participants in both arms provided the baseline Day 1 sample upon receipt of the sampling kit, which for those randomised to receive molnupiravir arrived on the same day as the drug. The molnupiravir group were asked to provide their first sample before the first dose of molnupiravir. All samples were sent to the Great Ormond Street Hospital laboratory via Royal Mail priority boxes for prompt delivery. RNA samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 were then transferred to UCL Genomics for sequencing. All participants in the virology sub-study were also asked to provide three finger-prick dried blood spot samples on Days 1, 5, and 14.</p>

Negative sample extraction controls were included in each batch of extractions. After extraction, the samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and PDV using multiplex targeted one-step real-time RT-PCR on a Quantstudio 5 instrument. Each PCR run included a SARS-CoV-2 positive template control and a no-template control. Extraction and PCR control results were recorded and monitored for consistency.</p>

We originally planned to use a nonlinear viral dynamic model, but subsequent work completed after the statistical analysis plan was finalised showed viral decline could equally well be described using a linear model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Maximum likelihood estimation was used to fit all observations including those that were censored, with the probability of LLOQ observations being below the limit of quantification estimated (“M3 method”)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. A stepwise approach to covariate analysis was taken whereby variables (sex, time since symptom onset, baseline spike antibody, age) were tested sequentially on baseline viral load and slope. Dichotomous covariates were tested with a proportional effect whereas for continuous variables an allometric exponent was estimated as follows: <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = p x (<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>)<sup>β</sup>, where <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the individual parameter, <italic>p</italic> the population parameter, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> the individual covariate value, <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> the median covariate value in the population and β the estimated covariate effect.
