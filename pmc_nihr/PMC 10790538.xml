                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult malignant brain tumour, with an incidence of 5 per 100,000 per year in England. Patients with tumours showing O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation represent around 40% of newly diagnosed GBM. Relapse/tumour recurrence is inevitable. There is no agreed standard treatment for patients with GBM, therefore, it is aimed at delaying further tumour progression and maintaining health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limited clinical trial data exist using cannabinoids in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) in this setting, but early phase data demonstrate prolonged overall survival compared to TMZ alone, with few additional side effects. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (previously GW Pharma Ltd.) have developed nabiximols (trade name Sativex®), an oromucosal spray containing a blend of cannabis plant extracts, that we aim to assess for preliminary efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">ARISTOCRAT is a phase II, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to assess cannabinoids in patients with recurrent MGMT methylated GBM who are suitable for treatment with TMZ. Patients who have relapsed ≥ 3 months after completion of initial first-line treatment will be randomised 2:1 to receive either nabiximols or placebo in combination with TMZ. The primary outcome is overall survival time defined as the time in whole days from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Secondary outcomes include overall survival at 12 months, progression-free survival time, HRQoL (using patient reported outcomes from QLQ-C30, QLQ-BN20 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires), and adverse events.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Patients with recurrent MGMT promoter methylated GBM represent a relatively good prognosis sub-group of patients with GBM. However, their median survival remains poor and, therefore, more effective treatments are needed. The phase II design of this trial was chosen, rather than phase III, due to the lack of data currently available on cannabinoid efficacy in this setting. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will ensure an unbiased robust evaluation of the treatment and will allow potential expansion of recruitment into a phase III trial should the emerging phase II results warrant this development.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult malignant brain tumour, with an incidence of 5 per 100,000 per year in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Prognosis is poor, with the majority of patients surviving less than one year and the average years of life lost to a brain tumour being 20.1, compared to breast cancer at 13.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Treatment is palliative in nature from diagnosis, aimed at delaying disease progression and managing symptoms/preserving health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Optimal first-line treatment includes debulking surgery (if feasible), followed by chemo-radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ) (Stupp regimen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite this intensive treatment, median progression free survival time (PFS) is 6.9 months and median overall survival time (OS) 14.6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At the time of inevitable disease recurrence, the aim remains broadly similar to first line treatment; delaying further progression and maintaining HRQoL. There is no agreed standard treatment, therefore, treatment decisions are made on a case-by-case basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Response to TMZ is an important determinant of outcome. Patients with O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumours have better outcomes from treatment with TMZ, compared to those with promoter unmethylated tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Patients with tumours showing MGMT promoter methylation represent around 40% of newly diagnosed GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Common practice includes a further course of TMZ in those patients with MGMT methylated tumours who relapse more than six months after completing adjuvant TMZ.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Phytocannabinoids occur naturally in cannabis plants and have been used medicinally for centuries for a variety of purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the major psychoactive constituent in cannabis, and cannabidiol (CBD) the major non-psychoactive constituent. Activation of the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, exerts various downstream signalling effects, with diverse consequences on cellular biology and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Glioblastomas express both CB1 and CB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], with high-grade tumours expressing high levels of CB2. In vivo studies have found that the administration of CBD and THC reduced tumour growth in animal models of glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These effects are thought to be mediated by induction of cell death (via apoptosis or cytotoxic autophagy), inhibition of cell proliferation, and anti-angiogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Specific to GBM, combined administration of THC and TMZ exerts strong anti-tumoural effects in glioma xenografts, an effect maintained in tumours resistant to TMZ treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a trial investigating the effects of intracranial THC (100 mg/ml in ethanol) in patients with recurrent GBM, a reduction in tumour cell proliferation was reported in two of nine patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Jazz Pharmaceuticals (previously GW Pharma Ltd.) have developed nabiximols (trade name Sativex®), an oromucosal spray of a complex botanical mixture containing THC and CBD as the principal cannabinoids, with additional cannabinoid constituents and non-cannabinoid components, and was the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK for multiple sclerosis spasticity. A two-part safety and exploratory efficacy randomised phase I double blind, placebo-controlled trial of nabiximols in combination with dose dense TMZ in 21 patients with relapsed GBM suggested that combination nabiximols/TMZ may be associated with prolonged OS compared to TMZ alone (observed hazard ratio &lt; 0.5). In this trial, 12 patients received nabiximols and 9 placebo due to an imbalance in randomisation meaning that the interpretation of OS needed to be done with caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The most common adverse events (AEs) reported were vomiting, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and headache, most commonly Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 and 3, and there was no difference in the incidence of treatment emergent AEs between the treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There was no interaction documented between nabiximols and TMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">These data require confirmation in the setting of a larger randomised study in which known biomarkers of response to treatment, including MGMT status, are accounted for. Therefore, the ARISTOCRAT trial will assess whether the addition of cannabinoid (nabiximols) to standard TMZ treatment in patients with recurrent MGMT methylated GBM improves disease outcomes.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par10">ARISTOCRAT is a phase II, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial to compare nabiximols with placebo in patients with recurrent MGMT methylated GBM suitable for treatment with TMZ. The trial has a target sample size of 234 patients who will be randomised on a 2:1 basis to receive either nabiximols or placebo, respectively, in combination with standard TMZ treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The trial includes an initial feasibility study of 40 patients to confirm safety, compliance, and achievability of planned target recruitment. There are no formal criteria for evaluating feasibility but once 40 patients have been recruited, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review AE data, details on protocol treatment received, monthly recruitment rates and projected recruitment to make recommendations on trial continuation.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Randomisation is on a 2:1 basis to receive either nabiximols or placebo and stratified by age (≤ 70 vs. &gt; 70 years), performance status (Karnofsky PS 60–79 v 80–100), and sex (male vs. female) in a double-blinded manner.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Treatment allocation is performed by central randomisation at the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU), University of Birmingham following submission of the completed Randomisation Form on the electronic Remote Data Capture (eRDC) system. A standard minimisation procedure is being used to allocate patients into the two arms to ensure a balance between the stratification variables.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Each patient will be assigned a unique Spray Vial Allocation Number, which will correspond to the Spray Vial Allocation List provided to local pharmacy at the site initiation. This list is strictly for pharmacy staff and will not be disclosed to any of the other members of the clinical team at the site to maintain blinding. The local pharmacy will then blind the appropriate medication for that patient. Neither the investigator nor the patient will know which combination is being administered.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Emergency unblinding will only be available in the event of patient safety concerns, this can be performed via the ARISTOCRAT Trial Office or via the site pharmacy using the eRDC system or paper allocation list.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p id="Par18">Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) has been integral to this study from its inception. The study was discussed by patients at The Brain Tumour Charity’s Research Involvement Network, and feedback received was used in developing the trial design. Our patient and public advisor, Peter Buckle, co-developed the ARISTOCRAT trial by reviewing and refining the protocol and the participant-facing documents. He has provided input into the patient-reported outcome measures and has guided messaging about the study for the community. As a member of the Trial Management Group (TMG), he continues to assess trial conduct and will contribute to the interpretation and dissemination of study findings. A second PPIE representative, Kathy Seddon, sits on the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).</p>
                <p id="Par19">A video interview was recorded between the Chief Investigator and a GBM patient as an educational tool for the trial and was posted online. In addition, a patient-facing website has been developed with our PPIE representatives and is hosted by the University of Birmingham (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/aristocrat">www.birmingham.ac.uk/aristocrat</ext-link>), along with lay-friendly materials posted to The Brain Tumour Charity’s website.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Our ongoing plans for dissemination include a webinar hosted by The Brain Tumour Charity to be held following the launch of the trial to update patients, the public, and supporters.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Nabiximols or placebo is administered in a self-titration regime (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This should start as a single spray in the evening of day 1 cycle 1 and gradually titrate to reach an individualised dose based on tolerability. A minimum of three sprays per day is recommended, with the maximum daily dose of 12 sprays. Patients will establish their individualised maximum tolerated dose (MTD) within 14 days of their first dose and continue this regime every day for up to six months (six cycles). If this is not achievable the patient should be permitted to continue in the trial, providing that they continue to receive trial medication, but will not be considered evaluable for the trial and will be replaced.</p>

Missed doses will be recorded with reasons. Patients will be asked to return their diaries at their next clinic visit. Urine samples will be collected to check for ‘recreational’ cannabinoid (THC) testing at baseline, cycle three, and at end of treatment. This will be performed by Matrix Diagnostics Ltd. to maintain blinding; positive dipstick tests will receive confirmatory mass spectrometry analysis. Positive tests will not be fed back to sites or patients and will not affect a patient’s continued participation in the trial; however, they may be considered unevaluable at analysis.</p>

Amended doses and reasons for any modifications will be recorded at each cycle. Suggested guidance for modifications is provided in Appendix 5. If TMZ cycles are delayed due to TMZ related toxicities, then nabiximols/placebo can be continued during the delay if deemed appropriate by the treating clinician. Any patient with two prior dose reductions who experiences toxicity that would require a third dose reduction of TMZ or a delay of &gt; 2 weeks will have their TMZ, and nabiximols/placebo discontinued and be withdrawn from the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par42">If a toxicity suspected to be related to nabiximols/placebo occurs, then dosing can be suspended or amended until the event has resolved. Patients, whose dose is adjusted, may restart the titration at an appropriate dose and return to their MTD gradually by increasing the number of sprays by one spray per day (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). If a participant requires &gt; 2 weeks off nabiximols/placebo or reduce their dose to &lt; 3 sprays/day, then the patient should stop nabiximols/placebo permanently. TMZ can be continued, if appropriate, at the discretion of the treating physician as per local standard of care.</p>

Secondary outcome measures are overall survival at 12 months (OS12) (of particular clinical relevance is the overall survival at 12 months from the date of randomisation with overall survival at six months and 24 months also of interest); PFS, defined as the time in whole days from date of randomisation to the date of the first documented evidence of disease progression or death (from any cause); and HRQoL assessed at screening, and then every eight weeks until the end of treatment. HRQoL will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], EORTC BN20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], single items from the EORTC item library, and the EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par49">The target sample size is 234 patients based on testing the null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms in terms of OS, i.e., a hazard ratio (HR) = 1 and assumes exponential distribution for survival times. Calculations assume a recruitment period of 18 months and follow-up period of 12 months. As a phase II trial, the design uses a relaxed one-sided significance level of 10% (i.e., α = 0.1) and a randomisation ratio of 2:1 in favour of the experimental treatment arm. The expected median survival time on the placebo arm is 12 months, which equates to a hazard rate of 0.058 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Given these design parameters, the trial requires 132 events to have 80% power (i.e., β = 0.2) to detect a difference with a hazard ratio of 0.68, i.e., median survival time of 17.6 months on the experimental treatment arm and hazard rate of 0.039. Given the results from the phase I trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we believe this is a plausible benefit to target. It is estimated that we need to recruit 222 patients during the 18-month recruitment period to observe this number of events; a further 5% to cover potential dropouts has been added to give a target sample size of 234. The trial includes an initial feasibility study that, based on a pragmatic rationale, will incorporate the first 40 patients recruited.</p>

Interim data from the feasibility study (numbers of participating centres and monthly recruitment rates) will also be presented to the DMC to evaluate recruitment feasibility of the 234 target. In addition, treatment compliance, AE incidence, and HRQoL data will be reviewed to evaluate if the intervention is safe and acceptable. Later interim analyses will focus on efficacy outcome measures as well as safety. In particular, the DMC will advise on whether the emerging data warrant the potential expansion into a phase III trial. Should the DMC make this recommendation then further funding would be required.</p>

In addition, 6-month and where available 24-month survival rates will be reported. The difference between treatment arms will be estimated using a hazard ratio generated from a Cox regression model. All estimates will be reported with one-sided 90% confidence intervals. The null hypothesis of no difference between the treatment arms in terms of overall survival time will be tested using the Cox regression model. The primary analysis will be on all patients who have received at least two cycles of protocol treatment.</p>

The TMG will be responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the trial and will meet at regular intervals (e.g., every three months), or as required, usually by teleconference.</p>
                <p id="Par68">The TSC will provide oversight of the trial on behalf of the Sponsor (University of Birmingham) and trial funder (The Brain Tumour Charity) to ensure that the trial conduct, concentrating on progress, adherence to the protocol, patient safety, and consideration of new information of relevance to the research question(s).

The DMC will operate to a trial specific charter based upon the template created by the Damocles Group. During the recruitment phase of the trial, the DMC will review the unblinded safety and efficacy data in accordance with the guidelines for the pre-planned interim analysis. The DMC will meet every six months during trial recruitment. Additional meetings may be called if recruitment is much faster than anticipated and the DMC may, at their discretion, request to meet more frequently or continue to meet following completion of recruitment.

                <p id="Par74">A phase II rather than phase III trial design has been chosen for the ARISTOCRAT trial, as the preliminary data on potential efficacy is still sparse. In addition, the feasibility of undertaking such a trial in terms of safety, compliance, and achievability of recruitment needs to be evaluated before embarking on a phase III and this will be done within the early stages of this trial. The choice for the design to be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will ensure an unbiased robust evaluation of the treatment and will allow potential recruitment expansion into a phase III trial should the emerging phase II results warrant this development. In this case, the phase II sample size is synergistic with the requirements for the first stage of a two-arm two-stage phase III trial design.</p>

This collaboration will allow data sharing across the two studies thereby streamlining patient entry and provide additional oversight of ARISTOCRAT through the TJBM programme. In addition, patients also participating in TJBM will provide paired tumour and blood samples at the time of entry to TJBM, which are used for molecular analysis and whole genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Any excess sample will be stored at the TJBM Tissue Bank and available for future ethically approved research studies. Samples are also collected at any other point of biopsy or resection. For these patients, consent will be taken for non-anonymised samples, pathology reports and imaging required for accurate pathology review and quality assurance purposes to be transferred to the pathology team using NHS pathways.</p>
