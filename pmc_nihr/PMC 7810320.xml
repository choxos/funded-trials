After CKD, the next most prevalent condition was hypertension (n = 511, 59.3%), followed by obesity (n = 265, 30.8%) ischemic heart disease (n = 145, 16.8%) and diabetes (n = 133, 15.4%). Having two co-existing conditions was most common (27%), the most common combination of which was hypertension and obesity (29%). One or three conditions was the next most prevalent combination (20% and 21% respectively). The prevalence of multimorbidity was 73.9% (95%CI 70.9–76.8) in all participants and 86.6% (95%CI 83.9–89.3) in those with any-stage CKD. Logistic regression found a significant association between increasing age (OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.04–0.10), increasing BMI (OR 1.15, 95%CI 1.10–1.20) and decreasing eGFR (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.98–1.00) with multimorbidity.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent condition [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], affecting around 12% of the population globally. It is defined as decreased kidney function, measured as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1·73m<sup>2</sup>, or markers of kidney damage, present for at least 3 months duration [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As people age, there is a decline in eGFR [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the risk of poor health outcomes increases, including end stage renal disease, cardiovascular events and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Older people with CKD may also be living with other comorbidities as the prevalence of many long-term conditions increases with age [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been reported that CKD is rarely present without co-occurring diseases [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the prevalence of a different comorbidities in people with CKD have been described [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A study in UK primary care reported that 40% of people with stage 3 CKD are living with more than two chronic conditions and increased comorbidity was associated with reduced survival [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Healthcare delivery is generally centred on the treatment of single diseases, and multimorbidity, defined as having two or more comorbidities [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], is a huge challenge in the context of an aging population and optimal clinical management [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Over 50% of older people in the general population are living with more than one chronic condition [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and, as populations age, the number of people with multimorbidity is predicted to double [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Multimorbidity increases the likelihood of hospital admission and length of stay, increases healthcare costs, reduces quality of life, increases adverse reaction due to polypharmacy [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and increases mortality. Chronic disease management must therefore consider disease burden and how an individuals’ various health problems may interact [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Multimorbidity in CKD carries a greater risk of dialysis [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], increased mortality [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and incurs higher healthcare costs [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] compared to those with no comorbidities. It is therefore important to understand patterns between conditions in populations with multimorbidity and the clustering of diseases so that interventions can be targeted to treat people at highest risk.</p>
              <p>The Oxford Renal Longitudinal Cohort Study (OxREN) is a prospective observational longitudinal cohort study in a primary care population aged 60 years and older. The study was established in 2013 in the central region of the southern United Kingdom. The objectives include defining the prevalence of selected risk factors for CKD and establishing the distribution of estimated kidney function and its trajectory over time in patients detected by a targeted screening programme [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Understanding the range of comorbidities and the most common combinations of comorbidities will help the on-going clinical management of this population and establish whether people with CKD have higher rates of multimorbidity compared with the general population. Specifically, given the scarcity of data in the literature, we describe the prevalence of multimorbidity across the OxREN cohort and use data collected at the participants’ baseline assessments to identify factors associated with multimorbidity.</p>

                <p>OxREN recruited participants aged 60 years or above in primary care general practices in the Thames Valley region of the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2017. Interested and potentially eligible participants attended a primary visit where the study was explained and written informed consent was obtained. All OxREN participants who had a baseline assessment (n = 861) were included in the analysis [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Non-fasting blood and urine samples collected at the baseline study visit were analysed within 24 hours across two laboratories using identical albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable enzymatic creatinine assays, and reported using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) eGFR. Both samples for each patient were processed in the same laboratory. Based on laboratory results, 584 (65.8%) had a CKD diagnosis confirmed by two positive tests a minimum of 90 days apart [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The remaining 277 (32.2%) participants did not have a CKD diagnosis, but had one test with either a decreased eGFR (&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) or a raised urinary ACR (&gt;3 mg/mmol), suggesting transiently impaired renal function, or may potentially arise from variability in analytical methods in those near diagnostic thresholds. More details of the population included in this analysis are given in our paper summarising the characteristics from the baseline study visit [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <title>Multimorbidity</title>
                <p>Multimorbidity was defined as presence of ≥2 comorbidities at the baseline assessment as recommended by the Academy of Medical Sciences [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The comorbidities included were self-reported by the participant as part of the study, and confirmed from medical notes by a research nurse of 15 clinical conditions, which have been previously included in one or more measures of multimorbidity [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These were CKD, hypertension, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, thyroid disease, anaemia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, obesity (BMI ≥ 30), and transient ischemic attack (TIA). These comorbidities were chosen for pragmatic reasons as they could be established using laboratory results or clinical records and were recorded during the baseline assessment of the OxRen study. In the primary analysis, CKD was determined by calculating eGFR using the MDRD equation [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the newer Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation was also used in a secondary analysis to calculate eGFR [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

                <title>Factors potentially associated with multimorbidity</title>
                <p>Demographic, anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data collected at the baseline assessment were tested as potential predictor variables for multimorbidity. These predictors were collected using self-administered questionnaires or via measurements taken by a practice or research nurse using standard procedures. The following predictor variables were assessed: increasing age (years), sex (male vs female), ethnicity (non-white vs white), increasing BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status (former and current vs never), increasing alcohol intake (g/day), highest level of education (school vs higher), increasing eGFR (mg/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) (estimated from serum creatinine using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), increasing waist-to-hip ratio or having had a previous urinary tract infection. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to include stage of CKD, waist circumference and hip circumference (replacing waist-to-hip ratio). As an exploratory analysis we also explored whether cognitive function was associated with multimorbidity in 537 participants where this had been recorded.</p>

                <p>The prevalence of each chronic condition was tabulated and presented in bar charts. These included prevalence of individual conditions, numbers living with a single condition or multiple conditions, and numbers with the most common comorbidities, for the full cohort and stratified by a diagnosis of CKD. Numbers of comorbid conditions were reported and tabulated by sex, whether participants had CKD and whether CKD was an existing diagnosis or identified from screening. Summary statistics are presented as mean and standard deviation and proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results were tabulated to show the prevalence of certain comorbidities across the full cohort, participants with CKD only, and those with stage 3 CKD to allow comparison with other primary care cohorts. Chi-squared tests were used to test differences in proportions. The R statistical software package “UpSetR” was used to identify all combinations of co-morbidities and rank them by frequency [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
                <p>Results were presented as absolute prevalence and age-sex standardised prevalence using data from the Office for National Statistics [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Age and sex standardisation was carried out using direct standardisation methods [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Briefly, prevalence of multimorbidity in the OxREN cohort was calculated separately for males and females for each 5-year age group between 60–90 years and 90+ years. These were standardised to age-sex distribution of the English population as reported by the Office of National Statistics 2019 [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
                <p>Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Interactions were not considered. Normality of predictors were checked by visually inspecting histograms One person with missing BMI and blood pressure was excluded from the analysis. Stata version 16.0SE (StataCorp, Tx) and R (version 3.6.1) were used for statistical analyses.</p>

              <p>The study population of 861 participants had a mean age of 74±7 years, 54% were women and they were predominantly white (98%). Mean baseline eGFR was 58±18 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and 259 participants had a kidney function test result in the normal range, 34 had stage 1, 122 had stage 2, 379 had stage 3 and 67 had stage 4 CKD. The prevalence of KDIGO-criteria CKD was 65.8% (n = 584).</p>

                <title>CKD versus non-CKD</title>
                <p>Overall, 87% of people with CKD and 82% of people without CKD were living with at least one non-CKD condition. Those with CKD were most likely to have two or three co-existing conditions (26% and 25% respectively), meaning they were living with one or two conditions in addition to their CKD. Those without CKD were most likely to be living with only one condition (35%), followed by 28% with two co-existing conditions (<xref rid="pone.0245131.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>More people with CKD were living with 3, 4 and 5 or more comorbidities compared with those without CKD. This remained true when CKD was not included as one of the conditions: 17% of people with CKD were living with 3 other conditions compared with 12% without CKD, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.067). A few individuals (0.4%) were living with eight comorbidities.</p>
                <p>When results were stratified by whether participants had CKD when they entered the cohort, or whether they were identified to have CKD on screening, people with existing CKD had overall more comorbidities than those with newly diagnosed CKD (p = 0.034), and tended to be living with more co-existing comorbidities than those with newly-diagnosed CKD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245131.s005">S2 Table</xref>). The proportion of people with hypertension was greater in people with CKD (n = 374, 64%) compared to those without CKD (n = 138, 50%) in those with up to three comorbidities (in addition to CKD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245131.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>The prevalence of multimorbidity in those with CKD, was 86.6% (95%CI 83.9 to 89.3), which increased to 87.3% (95%CI 84.6 to 90.0) with age and sex adjustment when standardised by age and sex to the general population (<xref rid="pone.0245131.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245131.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows absolute numbers of people living with one to eight comorbidities stratified by whether or not they have CKD.</p>

In the univariable analysis, increasing age, BMI or waist-to-hip ratio, decreasing eGFR or being a current smoker versus having never smoked were associated with significantly higher odds of having multimorbidity, whereas having a previous urinary tract infection was associated with lower odds of having multimorbidity. In the multivariable analysis adjusting for all other predictors, only increasing age, increasing BMI and decreasing eGFR remained significant. Applying a significant level of 0.004 to correct for testing multiple variables, only age and BMI remained significant predictors of multimorbidity. The sensitivity analysis using different covariates showed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245131.s006">S3 Table</xref>).

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>This analysis has established that 87% of people with CKD were living with at least one other comorbidity. Hypertension was the most common co-morbid condition in CKD with a prevalence of 64%. In comparison, 50% of people without CKD were living with hypertension and 82% were living with at least one long-term health condition. After CKD and hypertension, obesity, ischemic heart disease and diabetes were the next most common co-morbidities. More people with CKD were living with three or more comorbidities (the most common combination being hypertension, obesity and diabetes) compared to those without CKD, which remained true even when CKD was not included as one of the conditions. The age-sex standardised prevalence of multimorbidity was 75% for the whole population and 87% in those with CKD. Some people (0.4%) were living with as many as eight coexisting comorbidities. In an analysis to determine predictors of multimorbidity, age, BMI and declining eGFR were the only factors significantly associated with multimorbidity after adjustment for other covariates.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This analysis is the first to provide an accurate estimate of the prevalence of multimorbidity in a screened older primary care population living with or at risk of CKD across all stages. It provides reliable results through prospectively collected data and medical records to collect anthropometric measurements and demographic characteristics and determine the presence and number of co-existing conditions. Furthermore, we have reported the prevalence of different comorbidities and their combinations to describe in depth the range of conditions people with chronic kidney disease are living with.</p>
                <p>This work has some limitations. Our cohort was recruited in the generally affluent parts of the UK and may therefore not fully reflect the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity of the UK population [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Because this cohort may have a higher socioeconomic status than the general population, it is possible that we have underestimated the prevalence of some conditions or multimorbidity in general. This may therefore mean that these data provide conservative estimates compared with populations of a similar age in all parts of the UK. To be transparent about the generalisability, we have discussed the results in the context of other studies, both in the UK and internationally. We did not collect data on cancer as people with terminal illness were excluded from the study, but this has not limited our ability to make comparisons with other cohorts, which similarly excluded people with terminal illness [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p>Previous studies in UK primary care have also reported hypertension to be the most common comorbidity in populations with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The Renal Risk in Derby study [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found a prevalence of hypertension of 87.8% in people with stage 3 CKD, which is unsurprisingly higher than the 64% in the OxREN CKD population, as our screening identified earlier stages of CKD. They also observed a higher prevalence of anaemia (24% versus 12% in OxREN participants with CKD), which has been reported as a major complication of CKD and is associated with poor outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The prevalence of diabetes, thyroid disorder, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease and heart failure in the Renal Risk in Derby study was similar to that in our cohort. Mean age and ethnicity of populations were similar in both studies, but there may have been differences in socioeconomic status between the cohorts, which could have accounted for differences in prevalence in hypertension and anaemia, which remained even when our analysis was restricted to those with stage 3 CKD. Prevalence of multimorbidity in the OxREN population was slightly higher than the 67% reported in a general Scottish primary care population over 65 years [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another UK-wide cohort reported a prevalence of hypertension of 42% in those with CKD stages 1–2, and 64% in those with CKD stages 3–5 [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They also found a prevalence of diabetes of 13% in those with CKD stages 1–2 and 19% in those with CKD stages 3–5. These were similar to our findings, but their analysis included anyone over 18 years of age, so was not restricted to an older population.</p>
                <p>Internationally, primary care may differ from the UK, making it difficult to make true comparisons. Other cohorts have generally found higher prevalence of comorbidities in people with CKD. The SCOPE study described patterns of multimorbidity in geriatric and nephrology outpatients aged over 75 years across several European countries [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They reported CKD and hypertension to be the most common combination of comorbidities with a prevalence of 54%, lower than the 64% in the OxREN cohort. They reported a similar prevalence of diabetes to OxREN, but a much higher prevalence or osteoporosis compared with our cohort, which may reflect the older age of participants. In an Australian cohort, the prevalence of hypertension was 91% and diabetes 44% [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but recruitment took place in a renal clinic and CKD stages were predominantly 3b-4, suggesting more severe disease than our cohort. A randomised trial recruiting older people from the US and Australia found that 83% of those with CKD had hypertension and 15% had diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These results present a similar prevalence of diabetes and a higher prevalence of hypertension compared with our cohort, despite participants being a similar age.</p>
                <p>Ten of the 15 comorbidities assessed in the OxREN cohort were concordant with CKD, meaning they have similar pathophysiologies or recommended treatments. Discordant conditions are unrelated and treatment for one condition may have a negative impact on kidney function [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Not all comorbidities have the same impact on clinical decision-making or patients’ ability to self‐manage chronic diseases, and it has been suggested that the presence of comorbidities with different pathologies are associated with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. This may be because healthcare is often not integrated, meaning that people living with multiple coexisting conditions may receive medications for one condition, which are contra-indicated for one of their other conditions [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The majority of the comorbidities in our cohort are associated with poor health outcomes.</p>
                <p>Increasing age, being a smoker, higher BMI and lower eGFR have been reported to be significantly associated with multimorbidity in people with stage 3 CKD [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One study of 400 participants found a significant association between age and decreasing cognitive function with incident multimorbidity in a population aged over 75 years [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. An exploratory analysis in the OxREN cohort did not find any association between cognitive function and multimorbidity at baseline. Socioeconomic status has also been reported to be associated with multimorbidity in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We did not examine this directly in our analysis, but we found no association between education status and multimorbidity.</p>

                <title>Clinical implications</title>
                <p>The scale of comorbidities we have found in this analysis suggest that a patient-centred approach to treatment and care is required. This is in line with recommendations from the UK’s National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Department of Health [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in treating multimorbidity. The high proportion of people in our cohort confirmed to be living with hypertension provided a further imperative for regular blood pressure monitoring to guide treatment to optimal blood pressure targets with antihypertensives. Although guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment thresholds and medication regimens for people with CKD [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], they do not suggest a frequency for blood pressure monitoring. Because of the high prevalence of hypertension in those with CKD, clinicians should consider frequent blood pressure monitoring to reduce cardiovascular risk [<xref rid="pone.0245131.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our finding that hypertension and obesity were the most common combinations of conditions in addition to CKD that people were living with, suggests that there may be multiple reasons for closely monitoring health status in individuals with CKD.</p>

              <p>Prevalence and factors associated with multimorbidity among primary care patients with decreased renal function.</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Hirst,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>
                <bold>The manuscript focuses on an interesting topic. The study, however, presents some important shortcomings that preclude at this stage to draw meaningful conclusions, and should be addressed. To mention few of them, i) need to describe laboratory methodology, i.e. serum creatinine assay and its traceability to IDMS and authors’ methodology for detecting raised ACR of &gt; 3 mg/mmol; ii) unclear the authors’ sampling methodology; iii) concern about the fact that transiently impaired kidney function was not defined nor they have indicated baseline measures or the magnitude of the transient impairment; iv) need to present results with subheadings for better reading; v) need to compare authors’ data locally with national datasets as well as international registry reports like Australian, Japanese, Germany, or European CKD data, and discuss the implications in detail.</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 03 2021 11:59PM.

              </p>
              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Partly</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: I congratulate the authors for such a nice study. It's important to delineate the burden of CKD and multi-morbidity at primary care level.</p>
              <p>I have few suggestions</p>
              <p>1. The presentation of results could be sub-headings for better reading. For example if the results are presented as Overall cohort, CKD, Non CKD and Male and female. I found that there was lot of information, especially % all over the place and I moved backwards and forwards to read.</p>
              <p>2. This data from primary care is very important and actually define a more milder cohort of CKD. If you take an average 74 year old white (98%) UK resident with hypertension, obesity and CKD as the top co-morbidities with rest of the conditions at much lower percentages including diabetes, cardiac and other vascular conditions, as seen in your data, this group represents a milder form of disease compared to any group of CKD patients seen in speciality renal practices. For example in out cohort in Australia ( 90% Caucasians) seen in specialist clinics, Obesity is &gt;50%, Diabetes is 44%, hypertension 91%, coronary artery disease 25% and other vascular complications in the range of 10%. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13567">https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13567</ext-link>). Similar is the case in other CKD registry reports. The implications of these comparisons with other international cohorts are huge. Either you evaluated a milder form of disease or your primary care programs are working very well so much so the CKD patients are managed very well at primary care level and mulitmorbidity profile is much contained and better. I suggest that you compare your data locally with national datasets as well as international registry reports like Australian, Japanese, German or European CKD data. I think your data send a much powerful message regarding the success of primary care in your country.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper.</p>
              <p>There are methodological issues which I believe should be addressed.</p>
              <p>One such issue you describe in your limitations (your population is not representative of the UK population and findings cannot therefore be extrapolated to the general population).</p>
              <p>You must describe laboratory methodology ie serum creatinine assay and its traceability to IDMS and your methodology for detecting a raised ACR of &gt; 3mg/mmol.</p>
              <p>You must also describe your sampling methodology - when were blood samples taken for serum creatinine analysis, were they fasted or non-fasted (relationship to a protein containing meal); when were urine samples for ACR testing taken; were samples stored before analysis.</p>
              <p>You have not defined transiently impaired kidney function nor have you indicated baseline measures or the magnitude of the transient impairment.</p>
              <p>Although correct to say that any test has both physiological and analytical variability without detailing the conditions under which the test sample is taken, the assay used or the magnitude of the abnormal result it is impossible to draw meaningful conclusions.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>I congratulate the authors for such a nice study. It's important to delineate the burden of CKD and multi-morbidity at primary care level.</p>
              <p>I have few suggestions </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments</p>
              <p>1. The presentation of results could be sub-headings for better reading. For example if the results are presented as Overall cohort, CKD, Non CKD and Male and female. I found that there was lot of information, especially % all over the place and I moved backwards and forwards to read. We have restructured the results to findings in the full cohort from the CKD and non-CKD populations.</p>
              <p>We have also included another subheading: “Differences by GFR-estimating equation and sex” to make comparisons between the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations and males and females.</p>
              <p>2. This data from primary care is very important and actually define a more milder cohort of CKD. If you take an average 74 year old white (98%) UK resident with hypertension, obesity and CKD as the top co-morbidities with rest of the conditions at much lower percentages including diabetes, cardiac and other vascular conditions, as seen in your data, this group represents a milder form of disease compared to any group of CKD patients seen in speciality renal practices. For example in out cohort in Australia ( 90% Caucasians) seen in specialist clinics, Obesity is &gt;50%, Diabetes is 44%, hypertension 91%, coronary artery disease 25% and other vascular complications in the range of 10%. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13567">https://doi.org/10.1111/nep.13567</ext-link>). Similar is the case in other CKD registry reports. The implications of these comparisons with other international cohorts are huge. Either you evaluated a milder form of disease or your primary care programs are working very well so much so the CKD patients are managed very well at primary care level and mulitmorbidity profile is much contained and better. I suggest that you compare your data locally with national datasets as well as international registry reports like Australian, Japanese, German or European CKD data. I think your data send a much powerful message regarding the success of primary care in your country. Thank you for your comments. </p>
              <p>We have changed the discussion to include a comparisons with literature, first in the UK followed by international settings.</p>
              <p>This section in the Discussion has now been substantially revised.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper.</p>
              <p>There are methodological issues which I believe should be addressed.. </p>
              <p>One such issue you describe in your limitations (your population is not representative of the UK population and findings cannot therefore be extrapolated to the general population).</p>
              <p> The reviewer has pointed out a concern about the generalisability. We have compared our results with those from other studies and suggested reasons for differences in prevalence of multimorbidity and individual comorbidities. We have included a sentence to explain that we have compared with other studies: “To be transparent about the generalisability, we have discussed the results in the context of other studies, both in the UK and internationally.”</p>
              <p>You must describe laboratory methodology ie serum creatinine assay and its traceability to IDMS and your methodology for detecting a raised ACR of &gt; 3mg/mmol.</p>
              <p> We have clarified these points in the text: “Non-fasting blood and urine samples collected at the baseline study visit were analysed within 24 hours across two laboratories using identical albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable enzymatic creatinine assays, and reported using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) eGFR. Both samples for each patient were processed in the same laboratory. The remaining 277 (32.2%) participants did not have a CKD diagnosis, but had one test with either a decreased eGFR (&lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2) or a raised non-fasting urinary ACR (&gt;3 mg/mmol), suggesting transiently impaired renal function, or may potentially arise from variability in analytical methods in those near diagnostic thresholds.”</p>
              <p>You must also describe your sampling methodology - when were blood samples taken for serum creatinine analysis, were they fasted or non-fasted (relationship to a protein containing meal); when were urine samples for ACR testing taken; were samples stored before analysis.</p>
              <p> Please see above</p>
              <p>You have not defined transiently impaired kidney function nor have you indicated baseline measures or the magnitude of the transient impairment.</p>
              <p> The participants we classified as having transiently impaired renal function had a single eGFR or ACR test over the diagnostic threshold, but did not meet the KDIGO criteria for sustained impairment. We have included these participants in our cohort as we believe that they may be more likely to progress to CKD than the general population. We have removed most references to transiently impaired renal function in the text and instead refer to this population as non-CKD. </p>
              <p>Details of this population, as well as other characteristics of the participants are given in a paper published earlier this year. Rather than repeat these, we have referred the reader to the paper: “More details of the population included in this analysis are given in our paper summarising the characteristics from the baseline study visit.(28)” </p>
              <p>Although correct to say that any test has both physiological and analytical variability without detailing the conditions under which the test sample is taken, the assay used or the magnitude of the abnormal result it is impossible to draw meaningful conclusions </p>
              <p>We hope the more detailed methods given above have served to clarify this.</p>
