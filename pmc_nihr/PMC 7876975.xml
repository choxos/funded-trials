                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Mental health disorders in the context of long-term conditions in children and young people are currently overlooked and undertreated. Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population. The aim of this multi-site randomised controlled trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a modular psychological intervention to usual care for the mental health disorders in comparison to assessment-enhanced usual care alone.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In total, 334 participants aged 3–18 years attending epilepsy services will be screened for mental health disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the diagnostic Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA). Those identified as having a mental health disorder and consenting to the trial will be randomised to either receive up to 22 sessions of the modular psychological intervention (MATCH-ADTC) delivered over the telephone over 6 months by non-mental health professionals in addition to usual care or to assessment-enhanced usual care alone. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-randomisation. It is hypothesised that MATCH-ADTC plus usual care will be superior to assessment-enhanced usual care in improving emotional and behavioural symptoms. The primary outcome is the SDQ reported by parents at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include parent-reported mental health measures such as the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life measures such as the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and physical health measures such as the Hague Seizure Severity Scale. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment. Qualitative process evaluations and a health economic evaluation will also be completed.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial aims to determine whether a systematic and integrated approach to the identification and treatment of mental health disorders in children and young people with epilepsy is clinically and cost-effective. The findings will contribute to policies and practice with regard to addressing mental health needs in children and young people with other long-term conditions.</p>

              <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
              <p id="Par58">Children and young people with epilepsy who also have mental ill-health are poorly served by current health care provision. The mental health disorders often go undetected and undiagnosed, treatment when provided is often inadequate and service organisation fails to integrate and co-locate physical and mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is despite the evidence that co-occurring mental ill-health impacts on physical health and quality of life and, in adults, increases chance of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par59">The protocol described here is for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to address aspects of this problem. The clinical trial forms Work Package 3 of a broader research programme aimed at developing a new psychological treatment for anxiety, depression and behavioural problems in children with epilepsy.</p>
              <p id="Par60">The background and rationale for the research programme as a whole is embedded within a wider national priority within the UK National Health Service (NHS) - namely the closer integration of mental and physical health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder in childhood, affecting approximately 1 in 150 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Evidence-based psychological treatments for common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders) have not been systematically evaluated in young people with epilepsy despite their high prevalence in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although epilepsy is defined by recurrent seizures, the comorbid mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression often have a greater impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One reason for the failure to apply psychological treatments may be current service organisation. Such patients are seen in paediatric services and, if mental health input is needed, are referred to local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). However, CAMHS are overstretched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and inexperienced in dealing with mental ill-health in the context of a long-term condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par61">The Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma or Conduct problems (MATCH-ADTC) is a psychological intervention which is compliant with UK recommended best practice with modules that are selected to treat multiple common mental health disorders in youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It draws from psychological theories to encourage positive behaviours and reduce unhelpful ones and is based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for managing behaviour problems, anxiety, depression and trauma in children. The treatment contains therapeutic procedures that were selected to correspond to the practices found in several leading evidence-based psychological treatments (EBTs), against which MATCH was compared in randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite extensive trial literature demonstrating the efficacy of evidence-based psychological treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], they are disappointingly rarely implemented in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The MATCH-ADTC protocol and manual modular design ensures that the needs of individuals with multiple mental disorders (40% of patients) are met - in contrast to the protocol for the majority of trials which address only single, specific disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par62">MATCH-ADTC is divided into 33 practice modules that correspond to four focus areas with corresponding coordinating modules. The first focus area/coordinating module is for anxiety disorders and the practice modules within this correspond to the strategies in ‘Coping Cat’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The second focus area is for the treatment of depression and the modules within this corresponds to the strategies in ‘Primary and Secondary Control Enhancement Training’ (PASCET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The third focus area is for Parent Training for behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The fourth focus area is for trauma. Both Coping Cat and PASCET have been used successfully in children with physical illnesses and comorbid mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. According to the protocol, the therapist focuses on the initial problem area identified by the patient and family together with the information gathered in the clinical and research assessment. It is considered to represent true evidence-based practice in that the protocol combines research evidence, clinical judgement and patient values and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Once a problem area has been selected (e.g. anxiety), an algorithm specifies a default sequence of focus area and practice modules and guides clinical judgement. However, the intervention is also personalised so that if the default sequence cannot be implemented (e.g. due to low mood), then the sequence can be changed to address the immediate issue. Once the interfering issue has been addressed, treatment for the original problem area is resumed. Carers and family members can join the telephone/video conferencing sessions where appropriate and in the original trial 41% of the sessions included the child plus a family member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par63">Focus groups with patients and family members identified the need for an epilepsy-specific focus area/coordinating module, which was not a component of the published MATCH-ADTC protocol. This was felt necessary to meet the needs of young people with both epilepsy and mental health disorders. Epilepsy-relevant content was integrated throughout the treatment, such as epilepsy-related examples in worksheets. The epilepsy materials were developed and finalised in earlier stages of the programme of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par64">The overarching aim of this programme of research is to transform the treatment of mental health disorders in young people with epilepsy by systematically identifying and treating mental health problems from within epilepsy services to enable early detection and intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par65">Specifically, the trial aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adding a personalised modular psychological intervention—MATCH-ADTC with epilepsy-relevant content integrated throughout and an additional epilepsy-specific focus area, with one compulsory and three optional modules—to assessment-enhanced usual care. Assessment-enhanced usual care is usual care with the addition of standardised assessment measures, since those in this arm will have completed the Development and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA) and the results of the DAWBA will be provided to clinicians and to participants. The intervention will be delivered by non-mental health specialists, over the telephone/online, within epilepsy services, for young people with epilepsy who also meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par66">This study is a two-arm randomised controlled superiority trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MATCH-ADTC in addition to usual care for mental health disorders in epilepsy to assessment-enhanced usual care alone.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Patients aged 3–18 years within epilepsy services (and their accompanying parent/carer) will be approached. The process of determining eligibility will involve being asked some brief questions, completing the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and, if above the threshold, providing informed consent before completing a full computerised psychiatric diagnostic assessment (the Development and Wellbeing Assessment: DAWBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Those meeting diagnostic criteria for a mental health disorder according to this assessment will be invited to take part in the trial. Participants will be individually randomised to usual care only or to usual care plus the MATCH-ADTC intervention. The primary outcome measure is the total difficulties score from the SDQ reported by the parent/carer at 6 months post-randomisation. The primary analysis will be conducted on an intention-to treat basis and blind to treatment assignment. All measures will be repeated 1 year post-randomisation to examine whether any improvements in mental health are maintained as a secondary outcome.</p>

Other advantages are that the intervention is designed to be adapted for a diverse range of children, ages and problems and can be delivered in a range of social and healthcare services, including neurological services, by non-mental health specialists.

The comparison against assessment-enhanced usual care ensures that we can determine the added value over existing service provisions.</p>

                  <p id="Par92">Usual care for mental health disorders varies by site but typically includes referral to CAMHS or hospital-based paediatric psychology services (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This intervention is considered as ‘assessment-enhanced’ usual care since those in this arm will have completed the DAWBA and the results of the DAWBA will be provided as information to the GP, referrer and other clinical team members involved as appropriate (e.g. neurologist or paediatrician).

                  <title>MATCH-ADTC in addition to usual care</title>
                  <p id="Par93">The epilepsy-specific version of MATCH-ADTC used in the trial is a personalised modular cognitive-behavioural intervention with epilepsy-relevant content integrated throughout and an additional epilepsy-specific focus area, including an epilepsy-specific compulsory module and three optional epilepsy-related modules delivered over the telephone/video conferencing for young people attending epilepsy clinics who meet diagnostic criteria for a DSM-5 mental health disorder, in addition to usual care.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">MATCH-ADTC involves a weekly phone/online video call with the therapist who carries out the initial face-to-face assessment; parents complete measures at home and email them to the therapist before each session, and strategies are practiced at home. Face-to-face therapy sessions are permitted if clinically indicated or strongly preferred by the family. MATCH-ADTC comprises an average of 16 sessions but there is flexibility as many young people will have multiple mental health disorders whereas others may have one. MATCH-ADTC uses an algorithm to tailor the treatment to each young person’s individual needs and participants with co-occurring mental health disorders can have each of those addressed within the intervention. Those with intellectual disabilities may need to go at a slower pace than others and therefore may require more sessions. The minimum number is expected to be 10 and the maximum number of sessions is 22. The intervention must be completed within a 6-month window. The two booster sessions may be completed outside of this window. Some patients may receive fewer than 10 sessions providing that there is mutual agreement that their goals have been reached. All therapy sessions will be delivered within 6 months of randomisation although booster sessions can occur between 6 and 12 months post-randomisation. Clinical sessions including face-to-face sessions and telephone/online video calls will be audio and/or video recorded to ensure the sessions are delivered consistently. Key content of MATCH-ADTC for depression includes cognitive and problem-solving strategies and scheduling pleasurable activities; anxiety is addressed using exposure techniques; behavioural strategies, delivered through the parents, include one-on-one time, praise, effective instruction-giving, rewards and ignoring unwanted behaviour; trauma is addressed through developing a trauma narrative, exposure and safety planning. Session by session measurement of symptoms and progress towards self-identified goals is also included as part of the intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par95">Children and young people in the MATCH-ADTC arm will also access usual care for the mental health disorder if required as per Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p>

                <p id="Par96">There is a strong PPI element to the MICE trial, including a diverse and committed research advisory group (RAG) comprising parents, carers and young people with epilepsy (with an age range of 6–15 years). Meetings were held every 2 months to develop the treatment and quarterly during the training phase and will continue quarterly for the duration of the trial. Several members of the group were also involved in the advisory work for the programme development grant which preceded the MICE trial. All adult members of the RAG have completed modules 1 and 2 of NIHR online PPI training and several of the group have co-authored a paper on patient experiences which has been submitted for publication. The PPI lead was part of the interview panel which recruited two research assistants to the project and has co-presented at an event with the PI about the impact of high-quality PPI. The Steering Group also has two independent PPI representatives with lived experience. The goals of the PPI group are to ensure that the trial meets the needs of the population it is intended to serve.</p>

Training included a 5-day intensive training led by experts in the field of epilepsy and mental health, including members of the MATCH-ADTC team, epilepsy experts and mental health professionals with extensive experience in working with children, young people and families. Therapists received a half-day booster training at the end of the 6-month period with topics tailored to their individual training needs. All therapists saw at least one family for telephone-delivered mental health treatment during the 6-month training period during which therapists were offered weekly telephone clinical supervision with a qualified clinical psychologist. Supervision-of-supervision was provided on a monthly basis by a member of the MATCH-ADTC team.</p>

The SDQ is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire for children and young people aged 2 years and above. The 25 items are divided between 5 scales (emotional, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, prosocial behaviour), with the first four added to provide a total difficulties score. The SDQ has good internal consistency (mean Cronbach <italic>α</italic> .73), cross-informant correlation (mean 0.34), and retest stability after 4 to 6 months (mean 0.62) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. SDQ scores above the 90th percentile predict a substantially raised probability of independently diagnosed psychiatric disorders (mean odds ratio 15.7 for parent scales) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It has been validated across the age range of children and young people seen within neurology clinics and used in those with autism spectrum disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and intellectual disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] known to be highly prevalent in this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further, the SDQ has an ‘impact scale’, which assesses the impact that symptoms have on everyday life in a range of domains (home, school, leisure). The parent-reported measure was chosen for data completeness, as the self-report version is unsuitable for young people under the age of 11 years.</p>

The database will be password protected and only accessible to parents/carers and participants (where appropriate), delegated members of site staff and the MICE trial team, and external regulators if requested.</p>
                <p id="Par147">The Sealed Envelope database is hosted on servers in the UK provided by Rackspace UK; these servers are backed up by Amazon Web Services Ireland (AWS), and both Rackspace UK and AWS have been certified to ISO 27001 and ISAE 3402. Access to the database is controlled by password-protected accounts, and an individual’s access to the database is restricted by their role. The underlying database infrastructure is encrypted and access is strictly limited to Sealed Envelope staff.</p>
                <p id="Par148">The database and metadata have been developed by the clinical trial manager in conjunction with CCTU. The database software provides a number of features to help maintain data quality, including maintaining an audit trail, allowing custom validations on all data, allowing users to raise data query requests and reports to identify validation failure/missing data.</p>
                <p id="Par149">The identification, screening and enrolment logs, linking participant identifiable data to the pseudoanonymised PIN, will be held locally by the trial site. This will either be held in written form in a locked filing cabinet or electronically in password-protected form on hospital computers. After completion of the trial, the identification, screening and enrolment logs will be stored securely by the sites for 10 years unless otherwise advised by CCTU.</p>

Participants who discontinue protocol treatment should remain in the trial for the purpose of follow-up and data analysis. They will be asked whether they continue to consent to being contacted for follow-up assessments. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Therefore, withdrawal from the study will not result in exclusion of the data for that participant from analysis.

The study staff will ensure that the participants’ anonymity is maintained, except where information is disclosed by a patient or parent/carer that suggests a risk of harm to the patient, parent/carer or others. Each participant will be assigned a unique 5-digit trial PIN by site staff. The database will record the PIN, the patient’s initials and date of birth, but not the patient’s name. The only link between the PIN and the patient’s name will be on the screening log kept at site and accessed only by the patient’s direct clinical care team. Data will be recorded on the custom-designed Sealed Envelope database under this identification number.

Access to participants’ medical history and to files to write summary notes of progress will be necessary. Access to medical records by those outside of the direct healthcare team will only be gained after the participant/parent/carer has given their consent for this. Participants’ educational records may also be accessed by the research team. Consent will be taken for potentially linking data collected to Health Episode Statistics and the National Pupil Database.</p>
                <p id="Par155">Postal and email addresses will be required to write to participants (for example to send them progress reports or to send them electronic copies of measures). Phone numbers and/or usernames/addresses will be required for telephone/video conferencing consultations as part of the intervention, possibly for interviews and assessments and to provide support in completing measures and to send text messages. The research team will only have access to these details if the participant has consented to this, and such data will be held at Great Ormond Street Hospital. All phone/video conference calls and face-to-face meetings, including assessments, interviews and clinical sessions, will be audio/video recorded. Only therapists will be shown on video recordings.</p>
                <p id="Par156">Audio recording of some participants’ assessment interviews will be transcribed verbatim and used for the purposes of qualitative analysis. Quotes from these interviews may be used to illustrate presenting themes, but any data that would make the participant identifiable would be removed. Telephone calls will also be audio recorded, for use in supervision and to ensure fidelity to the protocol. Video recordings of clinical sessions may also be made. Only therapists will be shown on video recordings. Personal data will be contained within a project master file (paper copy), which will be kept in a locked cabinet accessible only to the research team at GOSH. Personal data contained on research databases (for example participant contact addresses) will be kept on a secure, restricted-access drive, only accessible to the research team with GOSH contracts.</p>

All statistical hypothesis tests will use a two-sided <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. All confidence intervals (CIs) presented will be 95% and two-sided.

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p id="Par159">The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention group and the control group in the total difficulties score of the parent-reported SDQ at 6 months post-randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par160">The total difficulties score of the SDQ has a range of 0–40. Mixed effect linear regression will be used to determine if there is any difference in the total difficulties score due to intervention. The model will include fixed effects for intervention group, baseline SDQ total difficulties score and the stratification factors; age (&lt; 11 versus 11+), primary mental health disorder (anxiety, depression, disruptive behaviour or trauma), presence of autistic spectrum disorder (yes/no) and presence of intellectual disability (yes/no). A random factor, <italic>Therapist</italic>, will be included to take account of therapist effects. Results will be presented as adjusted treatment effect and the associated 95% CI. If the intervention is effective, we would expect to see a reduction in the total difficulties score (higher total difficulties score indicates a higher risk of a diagnosis of mental illness).</p>
                  <p id="Par161">The primary analysis will be conducted following the intention-to-treat principle in accordance with the randomised intervention. All efforts will be made to ensure that the primary outcome data is collected for all patients, whether or not they complete their randomised treatment. Missing baseline data are not anticipated since baseline data are completed prior to randomisation and must be recorded to allocate treatment. All patients with reported outcome data will be included in the analysis. The primary analysis is likelihood based and therefore robust to the assumption of missing-at-random, but should substantial missing data be encountered, reasons for missingness will be explored and a sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to investigate the validity of the missing at random assumption.</p>

                <title>Economic analysis</title>
                <p id="Par167">A detailed health economic analysis plan, including a full specification of the analysis principles and details, will be written prior to the first substantive analysis and approved in advance by the programme steering committee (PSC).</p>
                <p id="Par168">Costs and cost-effectiveness will be compared between groups at the final 12-month follow-up to capture the economic impact over the longest period available. A secondary analysis at the 6-month follow-up will be carried out for consistency with the primary clinical analysis; however, to avoid unblinding the analyst earlier than necessary, this will be carried out after the primary economic analysis has been completed.</p>
                <p id="Par169">The economic perspective will be that of the NHS and personal social services sectors including those provided within the education sector. Health and social care service use will be collected using the CA-SUS at baseline (covering the previous 3 months) and at the 6- and 12-month follow-up points (covering the period since last interview) using the CA-SUS. Service use will be valued using nationally applicable unit costs (NHS Reference Costs and Personal Social Service Research Unit (PSSRU) Costs of Health and Social Care). The intervention will be directly costed taking a bottom-up (micro-costing) approach and using data on direct contacts recorded in clinical records. Indirect (non-face-to-face) time will be estimated using a questionnaire completed by therapists on time spent on different activities in a typical week. Intervention costs will be estimated using information on therapist salaries and working conditions, including relevant overhead costs (capital, managerial, administrative, etc.).</p>
                <p id="Par170">As a result of current limitations in the measurement of health-related quality of life in young children, capable of generating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for application in a cost-utility analysis, our primary economic analysis will be a cost-effectiveness analysis using the primary clinical outcome measure (parent-reported SDQ total difficulties score).</p>
                <p id="Par171">A more exploratory secondary economic analysis will consider cost-utility analysis using the CHU-9D to generate QALYs. Parents of all participants will be asked to proxy-complete the CHU-9D on behalf of all young people.</p>
                <p id="Par172">Additionally, self-report health-related quality of life data will be collected for the main parent/carer using the EQ-5D-5L to explore the impact of the intervention on both young people and their carers.</p>
                <p id="Par173">Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using the net benefit approach and following standard approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A joint distribution of incremental mean costs and effects for the two groups will be generated using nonparametric bootstrapping to explore the probability that each of the treatments is the optimal choice, subject to a range of possible maximum values (ceiling ratio) that a decision-maker might be willing to pay for an additional unit of outcome gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be presented by plotting these probabilities for a range of possible values of the ceiling ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. These curves are a recommended decision-making approach to dealing with the uncertainty that exists around the estimates of expected costs and expected effects associated with the interventions under investigation and uncertainty regarding the maximum cost-effectiveness ratio that a decision-maker would consider acceptable.</p>
                <p id="Par174">All economic analyses will be adjusted for co-variates in line with the clinical analyses described above, including the stratification variables (age (&lt; 11 versus 11+), primary mental health disorder (anxiety, depression, disruptive behaviour or trauma), presence of autistic spectrum disorder (yes/no), presence of intellectual disability (yes/no) and for the baseline values of the variables of interest (e.g. baseline cost, CHU-9D score, as appropriate).</p>

The psychological intervention will be delivered by non-mental health specialists from within epilepsy services in order to facilitate the closer integration of physical and mental health care. Given the high rates of mental health disorders coupled with high rates of unmet need in this group, positive results could result in suggestions for changes in service organisation and delivery in the UK and internationally. The model could also be used for the treatment of mental health disorders in children with other long-term conditions.</p>
