                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Typhoid fever is a major public health problem in low-resource settings. Vaccination can help curb the disease and might reduce transmission. We have previously reported an interim analysis of the efficacy of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in Nepali children. Here we report the final results after 2 years of follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a participant-masked and observer-masked individually randomised trial in Lalitpur, Nepal, in which 20 019 children aged 9 months to younger than 16 years were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of TCV (Typbar TCV, Bharat Biotech International, India) or capsular group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenA). Participants were followed up until April 9, 2020. The primary outcome was blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Cases were captured via passive surveillance and active telephone surveillance followed by medical record review. The trial is registered at ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN43385161 and is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>From Nov 20, 2017, to April 9, 2018, of 20 119 children screened, 20 019 participants were randomly assigned to receive TCV or MenA vaccine. There were 75 cases of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever included in the analysis (13 in the TCV group and 62 in the MenA group) over the 2-year period. The protective efficacy of TCV against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever at 2 years was 79·0% (95% CI 61·9–88·5; p&lt;0·0001). The incidence of typhoid fever was 72 (95% CI 38–123) cases per 100 000 person-years in the TCV group and 342 (95% CI 262–438) cases per 100 000 person-years in the MenA group. Adverse events occurring within the first 7 days post-vaccination were reported previously.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The final results of this randomised, controlled trial are in keeping with the results of our published interim analysis. There is no evidence of waning protection over a 2-year period. These findings add further support for the WHO recommendations on control of enteric fever.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Typhoid fever, once endemic in high-income countries, remains a major public health concern in low-resource settings where there is inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene conditions, including Nepal.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> More than 9 million cases of febrile illnesses and 110 000 deaths are attributed to typhoid fever each year.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> South Asia accounts for over 70% of the global burden.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Growing antimicrobial resistance in the region, especially outbreaks of cephalosporin-resistant typhoid in Pakistan, poses a challenge in the treatment of typhoid fever.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Access to clean drinking water, adequate sanitation and good hygiene are essential for control of typhoid fever, but the substantial costs associated with the large infrastructure changes and difficulties in making and maintaining behavioural changes in low-resource settings has been challenging. Vaccines against typhoid fever can be a cost-effective interim solution to curb the disease and antimicrobial resistance associated with it.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although licensed vaccines are available, their use has been limited to travellers. The parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccines are poorly immunogenic in young children. The oral Ty21a vaccine is not licensed for children younger than 6 years and is difficult for most children to swallow. Vi-rEPA, a typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV), showed high efficacy in young children; however, never advanced to market approval.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> More recently, a new TCV containing a Vi polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus-toxoid protein carrier (Typbar-TCV) has shown high immunogenicity and the ability to elicit immunological responses in young children.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In principle, TCVs can elicit a longer duration of protection in comparison with polysaccharide vaccines.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, in October, 2017, recommended the use of TCV for the control of endemic and epidemic typhoid fever and in December, 2017, Typbar-TCV was WHO-prequalified.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed for research articles on typhoid conjugate vaccine efficacy in children published any time before April 2, 2020, with no language restriction. We used the search terms “typhoid fever”, “conjugate vaccine”, “high burden”, and “children”. A randomised, controlled trial of Vi-rEPA, a conjugate vaccine containing Vi bound to non-toxic recombinant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A, done in Vietnam in children aged 2–5 years showed a vaccine efficacy of over 90% over 27 months of follow-up. The vaccine, however, is unavailable in the market.The interim analysis of this study has been published previously in which we reported that a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) given to children aged 9 months to younger than 16 years conferred over 80% protection in the first 12 months after vaccination. There are no other published studies showing the efficacy of this typhoid conjugate vaccine.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">This study shows the protective efficacy of the TCV in children over 2 years and supplements the previously reported one-year interim results of this study. Additionally, we report the immunogenic response to the vaccine up to 18 months post-vaccination. The results suggest that a 4-fold increase in antibody titre is maintained in a large proportion of the children at 18 months.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">The results of the study show that protection is maintained with a single dose of typhoid conjugate vaccine protection up to 2 years after vaccination. The results support the WHO recommendations to vaccinate children in endemic typhoid settings. Further data on medium-term to long-term efficacy of the vaccine is needed to establish the need for booster doses.</p>

              <p id="para100">We did a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial of a single dose of TCV in Lalitpur, Nepal, where typhoid is endemic, as a part of the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC),<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with the aim of establishing the field efficacy of TCV. TyVAC is a partnership between the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, and PATH, an international non-profit organisation. In 2019, we reported the interim results after 1 year of follow-up from the ongoing trial.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A single dose of TCV had an efficacy of 81·6% (95% CI 58·8–91·8; p&lt;0·001) in the first year after vaccination. Seroconversion defined as a 4-fold increase in anti-Vi IgG titres 28 days post-vaccination was 99% in the TCV group. We now report the final efficacy results after 2 years of follow-up.</p>

                <p id="para110">In this phase 3, double-blind, individually randomised, controlled trial in Lalitpur Metropolitan City, an urban area within Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, we enrolled children aged 9 months to younger than 16 years old. Parents or legal guardians provided written informed consent before enrolment, and assent was sought from children aged 7 years and older. Follow-up of the trial participants was planned for a 2-year period until the last participant was unmasked. The unmasking process started from Jan 20, 2020. Each participant was offered the alternative vaccine to the one they previously received, and a blood sample was taken in a subset of participants. On March 22, 2020, after the government of Nepal's announcement to restrict all unnecessary movement of people owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the field activities were stopped and unmasking and revaccination could not be completed. The study participants were informed about the suspension of the vaccination and will be unmasked and offered vaccination after the situation improves and in accordance with government directives. Unmasking and vaccination was resumed from Jan 25, 2021. After being temporarily suspended again on April 28, 2021, owing to a second wave of COVID-19, the study has again resumed from May 27, 2021. Passive surveillance clinics remained open for the 2-year period until April 9, 2020, providing a full 2 years of follow-up for the primary efficacy endpoint.</p>
                <p id="para120">The trial was reviewed and approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and the Nepal Health Research Council and was done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para130">Participants were enrolled and randomly assigned during the vaccination visit by means of 1:1 stratified block randomisation, with random block sizes of 6–12 by means of an offline mobile application built for the purpose. The participants received a single 25 μg/0·5 mL dose of tetanus-toxoid conjugated Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (Typbar TCV; Bharat Biotech International, India) or meningococcal capsular group A conjugate vaccine (MenA; MenAfriVac, Serum Institute of India, Pune, India). In addition, from a subgroup of consenting participants, 1500 were randomly selected (1000 in the TCV group and 500 in the MenA group) for the immunogenicity component of the study. Only staff administering the vaccine were aware of which vaccine was administered and these staff were not involved in the follow-up of participants.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para140">Blood cultures were obtained from participants presenting to the trial clinics (Patan Hospital, Lalitpur or 18 community-based clinics) with reported fever for at least 2 full days or a current temperature of at least 38°C. Blood cultures were done at Patan Hospital following the standard operating procedures. Additional participants who attended health facilities other than the trial clinics were identified from routine tri-monthly phone calls to participants. Medical records of these participants were reviewed for blood culture-confirmed diagnosis. Only participants with confirmed blood culture-positive typhoid fever are included in the primary efficacy analysis.</p>
                <p id="para150">Following vaccination, parents and guardians were asked to inform the study doctors about any adverse events. All adverse events, occurring within the first 7 days post-vaccination, were recorded via phone call and have been described and reported previously. Serious adverse events in the 2-year study period were identified from participants visiting the study clinics, surveillance at Patan Hospital, and via tri-monthly phone calls. Serious adverse events were followed up and recorded by study doctors. Any serious adverse events were recorded on a tri-monthly basis.</p>
                <p id="para160">Blood sample collection was planned on day 0, day 28, 18 months, and 24 months post-vaccination. Blood samples were temporarily stored at 2–8°C, processed within 6 h of blood draw and stored at −20°C. We were able to complete 18 months sample collection, with 381 participants bled at 24 months at the unmasking visit.

The secondary outcomes were incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever in participants with at least 3 full days of fever; incidence of blood culture-confirmed paratyphoid fever; numbers of clinically suspected typhoid fever; numbers and duration of inpatient or outpatient fever; and length of hospital admission. The exploratory outcomes were absenteeism from school or work as the result of illnesses; and all-cause mortality. All exploratory outcomes were prespecified. Immunogenicity of TCV at 1 month post-vaccination and persistence of antibodies induced by TCV at 18 and 24 months were explored.</p>

                <p id="para190">A target sample size of 20 000 children was required in the trial, and under the assumptions of the power calculation approximately 36 cases of typhoid fever in the control group and nine cases in the TCV group were expected to be observed (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). The primary outcome, the incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever, was calculated as the number of cases divided by the total number of person-years of follow-up. Only cases occurring more than 14 days after vaccination were included in the analyses. The vaccine efficacy was calculated as (1 − IRR) × 100%, where IRR is the incidence rate ratio (TCV:MenA), estimated by means of a Poisson regression model. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome were done by means of Poisson models with interaction effects.</p>
                <p id="para200">The cumulative incidence of typhoid was summarised by means of the Kaplan-Meier method. For any participant with more than one blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever, only the first event was used in the Kaplan-Meier analysis, but all events were included in incidence estimates.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para350">Among a cohort of Nepali children, the protective efficacy of single dose TCV against blood culture-positive typhoid fever in 2 years post-vaccination is similar to that reported in the interim efficacy analysis (vaccine efficacy 81·6%, 95% CI 58·8–91·8; p&lt;0·001).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> There was also no significant difference in the vaccine efficacy during the first 12 months of follow-up versus thereafter. The vaccine efficacy is also similar to seroefficacy estimates (vaccine efficacy 85%, 95% CI 80–88) from a phase 3 immunogenicity trial in India.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para360">Immunogenicity of TCV was robust in this population. Our results showed a 99% seroconversion of anti-Vi IgG antibodies and a 97% seroconversion of anti-Vi IgA antibodies at day 28. Similar anti-Vi IgG immune responses to TCV have previously been reported in studies from Vietnam and India.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In a study evaluating the antibody response to Vi-polysaccharide and Vi-conjugate vaccines in a typhoid fever controlled human infection model, there were high anti-Vi IgG and IgA responses to TCV, and anti-Vi IgA antibodies were associated with protection in individuals who received TCV.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Further, sustained 95% and 89% seroconversion at 18 months shows persistence of immunological responses.</p>
              <p id="para370">There were significant differences in the increase in anti-Vi IgG and IgA titres from baseline to day 28 as well as from baseline to 18 months post-vaccination across age groups, with the increse being lowest in the youngest age group. There was no significant difference in efficacy between the 2 to younger than 5 year and 5 year and older age groups or by time since vaccination. The presence of comparatively high titre of antibodies at baseline in the older age groups is suggestive of environmental exposure to typhoid and, as a result, some degree of pre-existing protective immunity against the disease. This might imply that some of the differences in antibody titres by age result from boosting of pre-existing immunity rather than immaturity of the immune response in younger age groups. It has been suggested that infants produce lower and less persistent antibodies in response to T-cell dependent protein or conjugate vaccines, and maternal antibodies might suppress the response to vaccination, which could explain the results.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, a cluster randomised trial done in Dhaka, Bangladesh has shown high immunogenic response in children younger than 2 years,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> This result suggests that the small number of participants in the youngest age group of the immunogenicity component of our study limits interpretation of this finding. Similarly, there were only two cases of culture-positive typhoid fever in the younger than 2-years age group leading to a lack of power to establish vaccine efficacy in the youngest children in our study. However, other studies report robust efficacy in this age group, including a cluster randomised trial in Bangladesh showed consistent direct protection across all age groups including in those younger than 2 years of age.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para380">TCV did not reduce all-cause fever, hospital admissions, or absenteeism. TCV did significantly reduce clinically diagnosed typhoid cases, however the vaccine efficacy was lower than in culture-confirmed cases. In addition, TCV did not protect against paratyphoid fever, as expected; a separate vaccine against paratyphoid might be required.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Given the non-specific symptoms associated with enteric fever, it is not surprising that not all clinically suspected cases would be true typhoid fever. It is difficult to distinguish typhoid from other diseases, including upper respiratory tract infections and typhus fevers in our setting.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The duration of fever in the TCV group, which was shorter than in the MenA group (6 days <italic>vs</italic> 7·5 days; p=0·0084), suggests that even in those with the disease, severity might be less after TCV administration.</p>
              <p id="para390">A large proportion of the isolates were non-susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Azithromycin was used as a standard for treatment of suspected and diagnosed typhoid fever in the study. However, fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are unfortunately still incorrectly being used in south Asia. No multidrug resistant strains or extensively drug-resistant strains were identified in the study, although extensively drug-resistant strains have been reported to cause epidemic in Pakistan. TCV will not only prevent typhoid fever, as suggested by our study, but might help in the control of antimicrobial resistance.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para400">Our data from 2 years of follow-up show that there is a high incidence of typhoid fever in the population (342 cases per 100 000 person-years in the MenA group).
