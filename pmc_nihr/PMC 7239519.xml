                  <p>Up to half of all women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus develop type 2 diabetes within 5 years after delivery. Metformin is effective in preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk non-pregnant individuals, but its effect when commenced in the postnatal period is not known. We plan to assess the feasibility of evaluating metformin versus placebo in minimising the risk of dysglycaemia including type 2 diabetes after delivery in postnatal women with a history of gestational diabetes through a randomised trial.</p>

                  <p>Optimising health outcomes with Metformin to prevent diAbetes After pregnancy (OMAhA) is a multicentre placebo-controlled double-blind randomised feasibility trial, where we will randomly allocate 160 postnatal women with gestational diabetes treated with medication to either metformin (intervention) or placebo (control) tablets to be taken until 1 year after delivery. The primary outcomes are rates of recruitment, randomisation, adherence and attrition. The secondary outcomes are maternal dysglycaemia, cost and quality of life outcomes in both arms, and acceptability of the study and intervention, which will be evaluated through a nested qualitative study. Feasibility outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics, point estimates and 95% CIs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition with glucose intolerance first diagnosed in pregnancy. Up to 50% of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes progress to type 2 diabetes within the first 5 years after delivery.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Women with gestational diabetes who require pharmacological treatment are at an increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, only a fifth of women with gestational diabetes undergo postnatal screening for type 2 diabetes in the first year, with many lost to follow-up further on.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Undiagnosed type 2 diabetes increases the risks of stillbirth, miscarriage and congenital abnormalities in subsequent pregnancies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Metformin has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes in general populations at risk of the disease.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In systematic reviews of randomised trials, metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by up to 50% in women with a history of gestational diabetes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> One of the large primary studies, the Diabetes Prevention Programme, demonstrated that the reduction in type 2 diabetes risk persisted 10 years after commencing metformin in women with gestational diabetes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, none of the studies commenced the intervention in the postnatal period, and these involved mostly older women than young mothers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>The immediate postnatal period offers a unique window of opportunity to intervene and prevent progression to type 2 diabetes especially in women who are at an increased risk of this condition and also lowering the risks of entering subsequent pregnancies with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Metformin intake in the postnatal period has the potential to achieve these benefits. Although metformin is currently offered in pregnancy to treat gestational diabetes, the acceptability of continuing or starting the medication in the immediate postnatal period and taking it for a prolonged period after delivery is not known. Prior to a large-scale randomised placebo-controlled trial on the effectiveness of metformin to prevent type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes, a feasibility study is needed. The use of a placebo in the trial is needed to recognise the psychobiological effects attributable to the overall therapeutic context in the clinical setting.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>We aim to conduct a feasibility study on the effectiveness of metformin in preventing dysglycaemia and progression to type 2 diabetes after delivery in women with gestational diabetes using metformin compared with placebo, and to assess the acceptability of the intervention and study procedures to women and healthcare professionals.</p>
                <sec id="s1-1-1">
                  <title>Primary objectives</title>
                  <p>Our primary objective is to obtain real-time data relevant to the trial design and trial processes such as recruitment, randomisation, follow-up and outcome assessment. We will determine the proportion of screened women who are eligible, the proportion recruited and randomised, and women’s adherence to the study protocol and intervention. We will collect data on the rates of follow-up at 6–13 weeks, 6 months and 1 year post delivery.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s1-1-2">
                  <title>Secondary objectives</title>
                  <p>Our secondary objectives include assessment of acceptability of the trial to women, their perceptions of risk and benefits of metformin, barriers to adherence, and the dose of metformin that is acceptable to women. We will explore the acceptability of the trial to healthcare professionals, barriers to recruitment and adherence to study protocol and intervention delivery. The potential role of the intervention and the trial in routine clinical practice will also be explored. We will obtain preliminary estimates on the effects of metformin on dysglycaemia (pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance) and type 2 diabetes), and weight change at 1 year after delivery, identify any side effects from the intake of metformin to mothers and their babies, and obtain relevant cost data to inform future economic evaluation. See <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for the definitions of maternal dysglycaemia. We will determine the robustness of the randomisation and data collection process, healthcare professionals’ adherence with the study protocol in secondary and in primary care and identify the level of support required for successful recruitment.</p>

                  <p>Potentially eligible participants will be screened to confirm eligibility prior to being approached by a member of the research team during their antenatal visit to the joint obstetric diabetes clinic. A record of women who are screened, but not eligible, and eligible women who do not provide consent will be kept in the screening log. Anonymised information on these participants will include age, ethnicity and reasons for being ineligible or declining consent.</p>
                  <p>Eligible participants will receive the patient information sheet (PIS) prior to their hospital booking visit. A researcher will approach the eligible woman and review the PIS and answer any questions. We will obtain written informed consent to participate in the quantitative part of the study. A small proportion of participants will also be asked to provide written informed consent for the qualitative part of the study. In cases where women have been approached during their antenatal visits, but had not given consent yet, they may be consented post delivery but before discharge. We will collect baseline information on demographics and clinical characteristics after obtaining consent. The validated European Quality of life 5-Dimensions 5-Level scale (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire will be administered to capture quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in all participants.</p>

                <p>Participants will be provided with either placebo or metformin sustained-release 500 mg tablets after childbirth, prior to postnatal discharge. Participants will be advised to commence the trial medication from discharge until 12 months post delivery, to achieve a target dose regimen of 2 g/day. The placebo is identical in appearance, smell and taste to the metformin tablets. For metformin-naïve participants, the study tablets will be titrated in increments of 500 mg to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. The titrating dosing schedule will be: 1 g daily in week 1, 1.5 g daily in week 2 and 2 g daily in week 3 until the end of the study. For women continuing metformin, they will be titrated to the target dose in a similar way. All trial participants will be contacted by the research midwives to increase the dose of their trial medication accordingly. The target dose can be taken as four 500 mg tablets with a meal one time a day or two tablets two times per day with meals. Dosage will be adjusted based on participant tolerance to side effects, adverse events (AEs) and if women request to have at least 1 g/day.</p>

The main goal of purposive sampling is to ensure variation in particular characteristics of the population under study that may influence their response towards the intervention (eg, previous diagnosis of GDM, parity, ethnicity). The first set of interviews at 6–13 weeks post discharge will explore participants’ views of the recruitment process, understanding of type 2 diabetes, their perception of risk of developing type 2 diabetes, reasons for participation, perceived acceptability of metformin, the adherence tools and possible reasons for non-adherence. The second set of interviews will focus on participants who found adherence particularly easy or difficult, and explore perceptions of follow-up procedures and adherence to the intervention. Concepts identified from the first set of interviews will inform discussions in the second interviews. Alongside this, we will endeavour to interview a sample of women who drop out of the trial. Interviewees will receive a £10 voucher for their time.</p>

Cost components include the cost of metformin and placebo including their administration, cost of routine tests, laboratory tests and further investigations, costs of clinic visits, hospital admissions (length of stay), antenatal costs, postnatal costs, neonatal costs and costs to treat AEs. Resource use data will be prospectively collected at patient level using clinical records and diaries. Unit costs will be taken from standard sources. Quality of life outcomes will be assessed from data collected using a validated questionnaire. Data on health-related quality of life collected using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will inform the QALYs calculation. The QALYs experienced from baseline to end of trial will be calculated as the area underneath this profile. Cost–utility will be calculated as the mean cost difference between the intervention and control group divided by the mean difference in outcomes to give the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The OMAhA trial is a crucial step towards global efforts to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes by targeting high-risk women with gestational diabetes. Until now, it is not known if metformin, a drug that prevents type 2 diabetes in the general population at risk, is also effective in postnatal period to prevent the disease after a history of gestational diabetes.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Our feasibility study is conducted in inner city multiethnic populations of young women within an NHS setting, who are at highest risk of developing both gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness and acceptability of metformin in new mothers are not known necessitating the need for a trial in this area.</p>
              <p>Metformin is an oral hypoglycaemic agent which has been used for over 60 years as an effective oral glucose lowering agent for type 2 diabetes. The use of metformin in gestational diabetes is recommended by NICE for treatment of gestational and type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Metformin is excreted into human breast milk and to date no adverse effects have been observed in breastfed infants,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and is the recommended drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes in postnatal mothers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is available as either immediate release tablets or sustained-release tablets taken orally, both of which are approved for the treatment of non-diabetic patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Maximum plasma metformin concentrations are reached more slowly with the sustained-release formulation compared with immediate-release metformin.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the OMAhA trial, we will be using the sustained-release formulation which allows us to implement a simpler dosing regimen, with increased tolerability thus improving patient adherence and greater glycaemic control.</p>
              <p>The OMAhA study’s research question was prioritised by our Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) Group, the Katie’s Team, comprising women and families with lived experiences of gestational diabetes. In our work leading to the proposal, we surveyed mothers with gestational diabetes, and healthcare professionals on intervention strategies for preventing progression to type 2 diabetes in women developing gestational diabetes. Our survey of 106 healthcare professionals showed that 80% (17/21) of midwives and about 50% (11/21) of the obstetricians were unsure of the future risk of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This further hinders provision of interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes in the postnatal period. Three-quarters of mothers (50/67) were interested in continuing metformin after delivery to prevent type 2 diabetes. Two-thirds (52/77) of healthcare professionals said that they would offer metformin as part of a trial if available.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our meta-analyses of women with gestational diabetes identified women with high glucose levels, and those who needed insulin in pregnancy to be at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and hence our target population includes women with gestational diabetes on medication.</p>
              <p>A full-scale definitive trial on the effectiveness of metformin in preventing type 2 diabetes in postnatal women will require a large sample size and resources.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Randomisation, follow-up and adherence assessment can be challenging especially in the immediate postnatal period with new mothers. The physical and emotional tiredness of caring for a newborn, as well as the personal and family adjustment required can hamper adherence and visit attendance.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Adverse delivery outcomes that may extend postnatally such as postcaesarean complications may hamper commencement of the trial medication in the early postnatal period.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Concerns with metformin use while breast feeding, acceptability of the drug regimen and duration are possible barriers to study and intervention adherence. A feasibility study is vital to assess these study process related outcomes to inform the definitive trial avoiding unnecessary attrition and poor adherence, allowing for savings in costs, time and other resources. The qualitative component of the OMAhA study aims to explore the impact of these barriers, ascertain the actual rates of follow-up, adherence and attrition, identify support strategies and alternative solutions prior to a large-scale trial.</p>
              <p>By recruiting participants from the joint obstetric diabetes clinic, we will be able to engage with the women who are already on metformin. Providing information on their subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes is expected to increase their motivation to join the study and adhere to the protocol.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our qualitative evaluation will assess the recruitment process on women’s concerns, motivations as well as contextual factors which may optimise or undermine research participation. By exploring the randomisation rates which are assessed after delivery, our study will determine if the experience of childbirth impacted on women’s willingness to continue with the trial.</p>
              <p>The feasibility of collecting the required clinical outcome data also needs to be assessed, given the low uptake of postnatal screening for type 2 diabetes especially at 6–13 weeks after birth.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The OMAhA study includes features to encourage visit attendance and retention in the study such as regular communication with women through phone calls and texts, and reminders of upcoming appointments. We also provide dedicated research staff to collect blood samples for outcomes to minimise the waiting times, and encourage visit attendance, and also reimburse women for their time through vouchers. To encourage adherence, participants are offered an optional mobile application with daily automated reminders to take the intervention. By regular contact with participants, we aim to foster engagement with the study, and in doing so, reinforce the potential benefits of the intervention and study, advising on ways to overcome potential challenges or side effects of the intervention, encouraging adherence.</p>
              <p>Our qualitative evaluation will explore the influence of these support strategies on adherence, visit attendance and retention, as well as eliciting suggestions from mothers and healthcare professionals on ways to best help with associated challenges. All of these learnings will inform the design and conduct of the full-scale definitive trial. As well as a nested qualitative evaluation, we have PPI input on the methodology and design to enhance acceptability and integration into routine practice.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The iterative process of trial monitoring and progress review by the TMG and an independent team of clinical specialists and patient representatives (TSC and DMC) will aid in resolving any challenges in study conduct, in addition to ensuring the safety of the trial.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>Our findings on feasibility and process outcomes will guide our decision to progress to a full-scale trial. Our progression criteria are arbitrary, and we will combine these with qualitative insights on solutions to factors which may have undermined recruitment, follow-up and adherence, in addition to recommendations from the TSC.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
