                  <p id="Par1">Venous leg ulcer(s) are common, recurring, open wounds on the lower leg, resulting from diseased or damaged leg veins impairing blood flow. Wound healing is the primary treatment aim for venous leg ulceration, alongside the management of pain, wound exudate and infection.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Full (high) compression therapy delivering 40 mmHg of pressure at the ankle is the recommended first-line treatment for venous leg ulcers. There are several different forms of compression therapy available including wraps, two-layer hosiery, and two-layer or four-layer bandages.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">There is good evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of four-layer bandage and two-layer hosiery but more limited evidence for other treatments (two-layer bandage and compression wraps). Robust evidence is required to compare clinical and cost-effectiveness of these and to investigate which is the best compression treatment for reducing time to healing of venous leg ulcers whilst offering value for money. VenUS 6 will therefore investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of evidence-based compression, two-layer bandage and compression wraps for time to healing of venous leg ulcers.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">VenUS 6 is a pragmatic, multi-centre, three-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Adult patients with a venous leg ulcer will be randomised to receive (1) compression wraps, (2) two-layer bandage or (3) evidence-based compression (two-layer hosiery or four-layer bandage).</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Participants will be followed up for between 4 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be time to healing (full epithelial cover in the absence of a scab) in days since randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include key clinical events (e.g. healing of the reference leg, ulcer recurrence, ulcer/skin deterioration, amputation, admission/discharge, surgery to close/remove incompetent superficial veins, infection or death), treatment changes, adherence and ease of use, ulcer related pain, health-related quality of life and resource use.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par36">Venous leg ulcer(s) are common, recurring, open wounds on the lower leg, resulting from diseased or damaged leg veins that impair blood flow. Treatment and care for these ulcers are often delivered by nurses in community clinics, out-patient settings, or peoples’ homes. Wound healing is the primary treatment aim for venous leg ulceration, alongside management of ulcer-related pain and wound exudate and infection prevention. When healing is achieved, the impaired blood flow can remain meaning those with healed ulcers are at high risk of recurrence.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Full (high) compression therapy delivering 40 mmHg of pressure at the ankle is the recommended first-line treatment for venous leg ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] although early access to endovenous ablation surgery has recently been shown to result in faster healing and is cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There are several different forms of compression therapy available to treat people with venous leg ulcers, including wraps, hosiery and bandages, but there is uncertainty about the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of different options.</p>
                <p id="Par38">The Venous Leg Ulcer Study 6 (VenUS 6) is a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the following approaches to delivering full compression therapy to people with venous leg ulcers:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par39">Arm 1: Two-layer hosiery or four-layer bandage systems (termed here as evidence-based compression</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par40">Arm 2: Two-layer bandage systems</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Arm 3: Compression wraps (<italic>adjustable hook-and-loop-fastened compression</italic>)</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par42">Treatments in the evidence-based compression arm have been evaluated previously in large randomised controlled trials. A network meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] combining individual patient data and aggregate data from randomised controlled trials with 858 participants (including 387 VenUS 1 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) showed that the four-layer bandage system reduced time to ulcer healing compared with the short stretch bandage. VenUS 1 reported the four-layer bandage system to be cost-effective. VenUS IV (457 participants) showed that two-layer hosiery is as effective as the four-layer bandage in healing venous leg ulcers, with two-layer hosiery the more cost-effective treatment (under a scenario assuming two-layer bandage and four-layer bandage had equal effectiveness) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, two-layer hosiery is not a suitable treatment for all patients, for example where the patient has oedematous legs.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Evidence is limited for the other two compression therapies being evaluated in VenUS 6: the two-layer bandage system and compression wraps. At the time of trial design, three randomised controlled trials (299 participants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] had compared two-layer bandage systems with four-layer bandage systems and there was uncertainty about the relative effects of the two treatments: risk ratio 1.17 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.57), resulting in a GRADE assessment of low certainty evidence. There is also limited randomised controlled trial evidence (24 participants) assessing compression wraps in this patient population. One study assessed the effectiveness of wraps for ulcer area reduction over a short period of follow-up (12 weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and one assessed the costs of compression wraps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; however, time to healing was not reported in either study. Despite this limited evidence, two-layer bandages and compression wraps are increasingly reported as a treatment for venous leg ulcers.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par44">The key objectives of VenUS 6 are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par45">To compare compression wraps with evidence-based compression for time to healing of venous leg ulcers</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">To determine whether two-layer bandage systems are non-inferior to evidence-based compression for time to healing of venous leg ulcers</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">To determine which full compression treatment for venous leg ulcers is cost-effective (i.e. provides the best value for money in routine use in the United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS)).</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par48">VenUS 6 will also compare the effect of compression wraps with evidence-based compression and two-layer bandage systems on ulcer recurrence, reported adverse events, ulcer-related pain, health related quality of life and adherence to treatment.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par49">VenUS 6 is a pragmatic, multi-centre, three-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled, trial. Participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three treatment arms.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Funded as part of the trial, three nested studies within a trial (SWATs) are included to assess the effectiveness of strategies to improve recruitment or retention:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par51">SWAT 1 tests use of an infographic intervention to aid recruitment. This recruitment SWAT is cluster randomised (at the site level) with participants receiving either an infographic (visual document explaining the study) plus the standard participant information sheet (PIS) or just the PIS alone.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">SWAT 2 tests use of a newsletter and/or thank you card (vs no newsletter and/or thank you card) to improve retention. The newsletter and/or thank you card are sent to participants at months four and nine following randomisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">SWAT 3 tests the inclusion of a pen vs no pen with the month three questionnaire as a method of improving retention.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par54">Participants will not be informed about the three SWATs included in this trial and therefore cannot provide their informed consent for their involvement. Due to the nature of the SWAT interventions, this approach is deemed low risk.</p>
                <p id="Par55">The trial also contains a process evaluation to better understand and explain the trial findings and potential mechanisms of impact. Trial data will be considered alongside data collected from semi-structured interviews exploring the views and experiences of participants and nurses throughout the trial. The protocol for this component will be reported separately (unpublished) and therefore is not detailed further here.</p>

We assume a median time to healing of 2.3 months in the evidence-based compression group, an average follow-up time of 12 months and 10% attrition (pre-healing). We also assume that there is truly no difference between evidence-based compression and two-layer bandage under the alternative hypothesis for this test (i.e. HR = 1). Under these assumptions, 225 patients per group are required to obtain 80% power for a one-sided test of size 2.5% of the null hypothesis that two-layer bandage is inferior to evidence-based compression by a clinically relevant amount (i.e. HR = 1.33).</p>
                <p id="Par106">We also plan to recruit 225 patients to the compression wraps group. Under the same assumptions regarding healing rate in the evidence-based compression group, length of follow-up time and attrition as stated above, and assuming a hazard ratio of 1.33 (comparing compression wraps with evidence-based compression) under the alternative hypothesis, this sample size (i.e. 225 per group) obtains 80% power for a superiority comparison of evidence-based compression and compression wraps using a two-sided test of size 5%. If the two-layer bandage and evidence-based compression groups are combined and compared 2:1 against compression wraps, then under the same assumptions as the superiority comparison outlined above, this sample size (i.e. 450 vs 225) would obtain 90% power for a two-sided test of size 5%.</p>
                <p id="Par107">We will only combine the evidence-based compression and two-layer bandage groups for the superiority comparison with compression wraps if two-layer bandage is found to be non-inferior to evidence-based compression (i.e. the null hypothesis of the non-inferiority comparison is rejected). If the null hypothesis of the non-inferiority comparison is not rejected, then the evidence-based compression and two-layer bandage groups will not be combined, and compression wraps will be compared with each of these groups individually (i.e. compared 1:1:1). Under the same alternative hypotheses (i.e. HR(evidence-based compression/two-layer bandage) = 1 and HR(compression wraps/evidence-based compression) = 1.33) and assumptions (i.e. median healing time of 2.3 months in the evidence based compression group, average follow-up time of 12 months, 10% attrition) as above, the power to detect superiority of compression wraps over evidence-based compression or evidence-based compression and two-layer bandage combined is approximately 86%.</p>

Study-specific guidance will be provided to both the nurses and participants to allow standardisation of images.</p>
                <p id="Par130">These images will be assessed by two clinical experts blinded to allocation to confirm the date of healing, with disagreements resolved through discussion and the involvement of a third reviewer if required. The blinded assessment of healing date will be used as the primary healing endpoint. Non-blinded assessment of healing will be used as a secondary outcome.</p>
                <p id="Par131">Monthly telephone calls will also be completed with the participant to assess reference leg healing, ulcer recurrence and clinical events, e.g. ulcer infection, ulcer deterioration, surgical intervention and death.</p>
                <p id="Par132">Data will be collected via participant-completed questionnaires at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Self-reported data will include wound-related pain, treatment adherence and ease of use, health-related quality of life (VEINES-QoL and EQ-5D-5L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and resource use. Where no response is provided, a reminder letter will be sent after 2 weeks to encourage completion. Where no response is provided after a further 2 weeks, participants may be contacted by telephone to collect data.</p>

                    <p id="Par145">The trial analyses will follow a detailed pre-specified statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be approved and made available on the funder’s website before the end of patient recruitment. The primary outcome will be time to healing of the reference ulcer as defined in the ‘<xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Primary outcome</xref>’ section. If, prior to healing of the reference ulcer, participants reach the end of study follow-up, are lost to follow-up, withdraw from follow up and do not consent to continued healthcare records access for healing data or experience competing events (death or amputation of the reference leg), healing times will be censored as detailed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>VenUS 6 censoring of healing</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7349_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                    <p id="Par146">The primary analyses will include both non-inferiority and superiority comparisons. For the non-inferiority comparison (two-layer bandage vs evidence-based compression), two treatment effect estimands will be targeted.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> An unconstrained treatment policy estimand whereby all intercurrent events (e.g. treatment switches/cessations and receipt of surgery) will be accepted as part of completely pragmatic treatment policies (essentially an intention-to-treat analysis) and a constrained estimand whereby certain constraints are placed on the intercurrent events that are accepted as a part of the treatment policies.</p>
                    <p id="Par147">Intercurrent events (such as treatment switches) will often result in the care received by patients allocated to different treatment groups being more similar, potentially resulting in attenuation of differences between treatment groups. Hence, estimands that do not address the influence of intercurrent events are potentially anti-conservative in the context of investigating non-inferiority. This provides the rationale for the constrained treatment policy estimand; the purpose of this estimand is to remove the influence of intercurrent events that could either be mitigated in practice (e.g. treatment switches that could be avoided by appropriate use of analgesia), or that might not be applicable to all patients (e.g. surgical treatments that some patients cannot/will not receive), whilst accepting the influence of intercurrent events that cannot be easily avoided as an unalterable part of the treatment strategies being compared (e.g. treatment switches due to allergy/adverse events). For the superiority comparisons, just the unconstrained treatment policy estimand will be targeted. Precise description of the unconstrained and constrained treatment policy estimands, and the estimators/methods that will be used to estimate them, will be given in the SAP.</p>
                    <p id="Par148">For the non-inferiority comparison, the unconstrained treatment policy estimand will be estimated by modelling reference ulcer healing time using a Cox proportional hazards model with a three-level variable for group allocation (evidence-based compression vs two-layer bandage vs compression wraps), conditioning on the following baseline covariates: reference ulcer area, reference ulcer duration, participant age, participant mobility status and recruitment site (via shared frailties for participants recruited at the same site). For the constrained treatment policy estimand, patients will have their reference ulcer healing times censored at the first of any relevant departures from the constrained treatment policies. These healing times will then be analysed using a similar model as used to estimate the unconstrained treatment policy estimand. For both analyses, the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the hazard ratios (HRs) for all between-group contrasts will be reported, together with estimated differences in median healing times (with 95% CIs based on non-parametric bootstraps). For each estimand, the estimated upper 95% confidence limits of the HRs for the evidence-based compression vs two-layer bandage contrasts will be compared with the non-inferiority margin of 1.33. If either of these upper limits is greater than 1.33, then the null hypothesis that two-layer bandage is inferior to evidence-based compression will not be rejected. If both estimates are less than 1.33, then the null hypothesis that two-layer bandage is inferior to evidence-based compression will be rejected.</p>
                    <p id="Par149">If the null hypothesis that two-layer bandage is inferior to evidence-based compression is rejected, then a further model will be fitted with the two-layer bandage and evidence-based compression groups combined and compared with compression wraps (i.e. a two-level variable for group allocation—evidence-based compression + two-layer bandage vs compression wraps), with the same fixed effects and shared frailties as previously detailed. The point estimate and 95% Wald method CI of the HR for the two-layer bandage + evidence-based compression vs compression wraps contrast will be reported, together with the estimated difference in median healing time (with 95% CIs based on non-parametric bootstraps).</p>

                    <p id="Par150">Secondary time to event outcomes include time to healing of the reference leg and time to ulcer recurrence. Time to healing of the reference leg will be calculated and analysed in a similar manner to the primary outcome, although only the unconstrained treatment policy estimand will be targeted and there will be no combined two-layer bandage and evidence-based compression vs compression wraps comparison. Time to recurrence is defined as time from an ulcer-free reference leg to date of recurrence of a new ulcer on the reference leg. Participants whose reference leg heals and remains healed until they reach the end of follow-up or are withdrawn will have their time to recurrence censored at the relevant time, as will participants who experience a competing event (mortality and amputation of the reference leg). This outcome will be analysed using a similar model as used for the analyses of the primary outcome, although there will be no combined two-layer bandage and evidence-based compression vs compression wraps comparison.</p>

This is likely to be more useful to decision-makers.</p>
                  <p id="Par153">On this basis, and under a UK NHS and the Personal Social Services perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a decision analytic modelling approach will be taken. The decision model will aim at estimating the relevant costs and health benefits of all relevant compression systems, to fully inform judgements on the long-term cost-effectiveness of these interventions in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. The modelling exercise will aim to represent possible patient disease (or health) pathways and, by doing so, can incorporate multiple sources of evidence, extrapolating from limited data, and explore uncertainty over parameter values and structural assumptions. In this specific case, the main advantage of using a decision analytic model is in allowing the compression systems here to be compared to the wider set of relevant high compression treatments by including external information to the trial. The planned decision analytic model will extend previous work and include data from the network meta-analysis outlined above. Based on the selected model, further literature searching will be conducted to identify evidence on the following categories of model parameters: health-related quality of life/utility, costs and resource use, ulcer recurrence and mortality, to be used alongside current trial data.</p>
                  <p id="Par154">Costs and health benefits conditional on healing status (health-related quality of life measured using EQ-5D-5L) will be derived using regression approaches, allowing for key covariates and uncertainty in estimates. Alternative scenarios regarding the extrapolation of the primary outcome over the lifetime of the model and the evidence informing it will be explored. Alternative scenarios exploring the extrapolation of secondary outcomes such as wound recurrence will also be explored. Uncertainty in the evidence base used to populate the decision analytic model will be characterised using appropriate distributions and any uncertainty in the adoption decision demonstrated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The value of further data collection using value of information analysis will be established.</p>

                <p id="Par175">Serious adverse events (SAE) will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par176">Results in death</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par177">Is life-threatening</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par178">Requires unplanned inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospitalisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par179">Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par180">Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par181">Any other important medical condition that, although not included in the above, may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par182">Where an adverse event is reported, participating sites will be required to promptly report this to YTU. Where the event is considered serious, causality and expectedness will be confirmed by the Chief Investigator or another clinical member of the trial management team. All events will be followed up until the event resolves or a decision is made for no further follow-up. Participants experiencing SAEs which are deemed to be related to the trial treatments (intervention or control) and which remain ongoing at the time of participant trial exit will be followed up for one further month beyond trial exit.</p>
                <p id="Par183">Where events are unexpected and related these will be reported to the research ethics committee and Sponsor within 15 days.</p>
                <p id="Par184">Adverse and serious adverse events will be routinely reported to the DMC and TSC for their review and oversight. Where repeated adverse events (serious or non-serious) of a similar type are observed, these will be discussed with the DMC and will be onward reported to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and Sponsor should concerns be raised in relation to the type of event and/or frequency observed.</p>

Centralised monitoring checks of eligibility and consent will be completed for 100% of participants and an annual audit of site files and documentation, via a self-complete checklist, will be completed with each participating NHS Trust. Further details relating to these activities will be documented in a study-specific monitoring plan.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par191">Use of compression wraps and two-layer bandage systems as treatments for venous leg ulcers have been increasing despite limited high-quality evidence to support their clinical and cost-effectiveness. Given the increasing use of these treatments, a randomised controlled trial comparing these treatments with the current gold standard compression treatments (evidence-based compression) is required; VenUS 6 is designed to generate the robust evidence required to fill this gap.</p>
