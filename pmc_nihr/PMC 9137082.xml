                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Audit and feedback aims to improve patient care by comparing healthcare performance against explicit standards. It is used to monitor and improve patient care, including through National Clinical Audit (NCA) programmes in the UK. Variability in effectiveness of audit and feedback is attributed to intervention design; separate randomised trials to address multiple questions about how to optimise effectiveness would be inefficient. We evaluated different feedback modifications to identify leading candidates for further “real-world” evaluation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using an online fractional factorial screening experiment, we randomised recipients of feedback from five UK NCAs to different combinations of six feedback modifications applied within an audit report excerpt: use <italic>effective comparators</italic>, provide <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, recommend <italic>specific actions</italic>, provide <italic>optional detail</italic>, incorporate the <italic>patient voice</italic>, and minimise <italic>cognitive load</italic>. Outcomes, assessed immediately after exposure to the online modifications, included intention to enact audit standards (primary outcome, ranked on a scale of −3 to +3, tailored to the NCA), comprehension, user experience, and engagement.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We randomised 1241 participants (clinicians, managers, and audit staff) between April and October 2019. Inappropriate repeated participant completion occurred; we conservatively excluded participant entries during the relevant period, leaving a primary analysis population of 638 (51.4%) participants.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">None of the six feedback modifications had an independent effect on intention across the five NCAs. We observed both synergistic and antagonistic effects across outcomes when modifications were combined; the specific NCA and whether recipients had a clinical role had dominant influences on outcome, and there was an antagonistic interaction between <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> and <italic>optional detail</italic>. Among clinical participants, predicted intention ranged from 1.22 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 1.72) for the least effective combination in which <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, <italic>optional detail</italic>, and <italic>reduced cognitive load</italic> were applied within the audit report, up to 2.40 (95% <italic>CI</italic> 1.88, 2.93) for the most effective combination including <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, <italic>specific actions</italic>, <italic>patient voice</italic>, and <italic>reduced cognitive load</italic>.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">Potentially important synergistic and antagonistic effects were identified across combinations of feedback modifications, audit programmes, and recipients, suggesting that feedback designers must explicitly consider how different features of feedback may interact to achieve (or undermine) the desired effects.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Audit and feedback, as a component of quality improvement, aims to improve the uptake of recommended practice by reviewing clinical performance against explicit standards and directing action towards areas not meeting those standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Around 60 national clinical audit (NCA) programmes in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] inform service improvement across priorities such as diabetes, stroke, and cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par13">Whilst a number of components which may enhance effectiveness have been identified (e.g. providing feedback more than once), feedback effectiveness remains difficult to predict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Rigorous evaluation methods, including randomised trials, can establish the relative effectiveness of alternative feedback components. Given there are many potential ways of delivering feedback components (e.g. timing, comparators, display characteristics), with or without co-interventions (e.g. educational meetings, computerised reminders), addressing all would require a prohibitive number of head-to-head trials and would not allow investigation of interactions between interventions and their components. More efficient methods are needed to prioritise which feedback components to study and to take forward to definitive trials.</p>
              <p id="Par14">The multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) offers a methodological approach for building, optimising, and evaluating multicomponent interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. MOST comprises three steps: <italic>preparation</italic>, laying the groundwork for optimisation by conceptualising and piloting components; <italic>optimisation</italic>, conducting trials to identify the most promising single or combined intervention components; and <italic>evaluation</italic>, a definitive randomised trial to assess intervention effectiveness. Earlier implementation studies have used a similar approach to define the most promising “active ingredients” for further study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], including experiments that systematically vary components of an intervention within a randomised controlled design in a manner that simulates a real situation as much as possible. Interim endpoints (e.g. behavioural intention, behavioural simulation) are measured rather than actual behaviour or healthcare outcomes. A key mechanism of effect of audit and feedback interventions is that they operate by increasing recipients’ intention to enact desired changes in accordance with the audit standards.</p>
              <p id="Par15">We undertook the first and second steps of MOST to develop and investigate the single and combined effects of different feedback components (hereby referred to as “feedback modifications”). We began with a set of 15 theory-informed suggestions for effective feedback, identified through expert interviews, systematic reviews, and our own experience with providing, evaluating, and receiving practice feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These suggestions were grouped under the nature of the desired action (e.g. improving the specificity of recommendations for action), the nature of the data available for feedback (e.g. providing more rapid or multiple feedback), feedback display (e.g. minimising unnecessary cognitive workload for recipients), and delivery of feedback (e.g. addressing credibility of information). We considered and added a further suggestion (incorporating the patient voice) in response to current policy drives to involve patients and members of the public more in health service organisation and delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">We used a structured consensus process, involving audit and feedback developers, recipients and researchers, and public representatives, to select the following six feedback modifications as high priority for investigation in an online fractional factorial screening experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]: <italic>effective comparators</italic>, <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, <italic>specific actions</italic>, <italic>optional detail</italic>, <italic>patient voice</italic>, and <italic>cognitive load</italic>. The consensus panel guided our selection based on the need for further research, likely feasibility of adoption by national clinical audits, feasibility of delivery within an online experiment, and user acceptability. We then engaged professionals typically involved in developing or targeted by NCAs in three rounds of user-centred design to develop and apply the modifications within an audit report excerpt and design a web portal for the online experiment.</p>
              <p id="Par17">In the second stage of a MOST, reported here, we used a randomised fractional factorial screening design, to investigate and optimise the most promising single and combined effects of the six modifications on interim outcomes. We chose a factorial design to allow all six modifications and their interactions to be investigated simultaneously. By randomising participants to multiple modification conditions, all participants contribute to the evaluation of each effect, with a reduced sample size compared to an equivalent evaluation in multiple or multi-arm multistage adaptive trials, which would in any case detect different estimands (i.e. simple effects rather than main and interaction effects) to those of interest here.</p>

                <p id="Par18">We conducted an online, fractional factorial screening experiment. Six modifications to feedback (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; see also Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were each operationalised in two versions (ON with the modification applied, OFF without modification) and applied within audit report excerpts for five different NCAs. We randomised participants to receive one of 32 combinations of the modifications, stratified by NCA. After viewing the audit excerpt, participants completed a short questionnaire, to generate all study outcomes. This study is reported as per the CONSORT guideline for randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The six feedback modifications selected in our online fractional factorial screening experiment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Modification description</th><th>Modification ON vs OFF</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><bold><italic>A.

                <title>Setting and participants</title>
                <p id="Par19">We collaborated with five UK NCAs covering a range of clinical priorities: the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion (NCABT), Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet), and Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN) in secondary care and the National Diabetes Audit (NDA) in primary care. The NCABT, MINAP, and TARN each covered more than 150 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England alone. PICANet included 34 paediatric intensive care units, and the NDA covered all (approximately) 7500 general practices in England.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Each NCA emailed invitations containing the link to the online experiment to their distribution lists of feedback recipients, i.e. clinicians, managers, nurses, and commissioners; all were eligible to participate. Prior to experiment entry, participants were required to confirm informed consent. On completing the experiment, participants were offered the opportunity to view evidence-based guidance on how to improve their own audit and feedback practice. Participants were also offered a £25 voucher and certificate of completion. Email addresses provided for voucher and certificate requests were not linked to experiment data to preserve anonymity.</p>
                <p id="Par21">After opening to recruitment, we identified a serious breach of study integrity involving inappropriate repeated participant completion of the experiment linked to a single general practice in order to claim multiple £25 vouchers for completion. This occurred within a 5-day period subsequently defined as the “contamination period”. We therefore temporarily closed the experiment to enhance security. Additional experiment entry criteria, applied prior to randomisation, required participants to provide NHS or Health and Social Care Northern Ireland email addresses. These were validated to confirm that participants had not previously completed the experiment and to prevent those who had, from proceeding; email addresses remained unlinked to experiment data to retain anonymity.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par22">Following consent, participants selected the audit relevant to them, before indicating their role and organisation. Participants were then randomised to be presented with one of 32 versions of the excerpt of an audit report comprising different combinations of the six modifications (each ON or OFF). Participants were informed that the excerpt contained simulated but realistic data.</p>
                <p id="Par23">The audit excerpts followed a basic template (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The page was titled with the relevant audit (e.g. “National Diabetes Audit Report”) and a statement that the data were collected in 2018. The excerpt showed an audit standard (e.g. “Patients with type 2 diabetes whose HbA1c level is 58 mmol/mol or above after 6 months with single-drug treatment are offered dual therapy”) and the result (e.g. “Our practice achieved this standard of care for 86% (318/370) of patients”). NCA collaborators advised on the selection of audit standards to help ensure experiment participants perceived them as valid and credible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The remaining content depended on which combination of the six feedback modifications participants were randomised to (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par24">The primary outcome was participant intention to adhere to an audit-specific standard (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Intention has a known, if limited, ability to predict behaviour that may inform intervention development and early evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>NCA standards contributing to experiment outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><italic>NCA</italic></th><th><italic>Key standard selected</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>NCABT</td><td>Clinical staff should prescribe tranexamic acid for surgical patients expected to have moderate or more significant blood loss unless contraindicated</td></tr><tr><td>NDA</td><td>Patients with type 2 diabetes whose HbA1c level is 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) or above after 6 months with single-drug treatment are offered dual therapy</td></tr><tr><td>MINAP</td><td>Adults with non-ST-segment-election myocardial infarction or unstable angina who have an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events are offered coronary angiography (with follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention if indicated) within 72 h of first admission to hospital</td></tr><tr><td>PICANet</td><td>Minimise the number of unplanned extubations for paediatric intensive care patients per 1000 days of invasive ventilation</td></tr><tr><td>TARN</td><td>Patients who have had urgent 3D imaging for major trauma should have a provisional written radiology report within 60 min of the scan</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par25">We aimed to minimise unintended “loading” of responses of intention due to social desirability bias by presenting the target behaviour in the context of other behaviours that would be appropriate, including the introductory statement, “Considering the time and resources available to you and other clinical priorities …”, and anchored items over “the next three months”.</p>
                <p id="Par26">The primary outcome measured intention as the mean value across three items beginning with the stem statements, “I intend”, “I want”, and “I expect”. Each item was followed by the appropriate audit standard, e.g. “Over the next three months, I <italic>[intend/want/expect]</italic> to ensure that our patients with type 2 diabetes whose HbA1c level is 58mmol/mol or above following 6 months with single-drug treatment are offered dual therapy”.

We chose a half fraction of the full design, i.e. 32 combinations, to provide a more efficient design to identify the vital few (significant) factors from the trivial many (screening).</p>
                  <p id="Par34">We generated our balanced and orthogonal half fractional factorial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], denoted <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

                  <p id="Par35">The trade-off using the half, rather than the full design, is the introduction of aliasing (confounding) in model effects. Under the half fraction with six factors, all effects are aliased; main effects are aliased with 5-way interactions, 2-way interactions aliased with 4-way interactions, and 3-way interactions form aliased pairs. Under the sparsity of effects principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], in which a system is usually dominated by main effects and low-order interactions, we assume negligible four-way and higher-order interactions and attribute any effects to the main effects and lower-order interactions.</p>
                  <p id="Par36">Although the full factorial design, with no aliasing, would have allowed estimation of higher order effects, this would have required increased resource to implement and verify all 64 combinations across the five NCAs. Considering existing knowledge and assumptions about interactions, we therefore chose the half fraction to minimise the number of combinations required whilst allowing estimation of all main effects and 2-way interactions of modifications. We considered but discounted use of the quarter fraction as further aliasing would have compromised the interpretation of 2-way interactions. The full design and alias structure can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

                  <p id="Par37">Participants were allocated to one of the 32 combinations of the six feedback modifications, with equal allocation using block randomisation, stratified by NCA. The design was replicated in blocks of the 32 combinations, each partitioned into two blocks of 16 using the alias pair ABF = CDE, to ensure modifications were balanced (each modification has the same number of participants at each level) and orthogonal (sum of the product of any two or more modifications is 0) within each block of 16 participants. A statistician (AWH) prepared the randomisation lists, which were programmed (MA) into the website. Remaining study personnel remained blind to allocation. Participants were, by nature of the experiment, exposed to the randomised audit excerpts but not informed of their allocation.</p>

                  <p id="Par38">Assuming similar effects of each modification across NCA and role, 500 participants across the five NCAs provided 90% power to detect small-to-moderate main effects (0.3 SDs) for each modification using a two-sided 5% significance <italic>t</italic>-test. Due to the use of effect coding for each modification, all else being equal, there is equal power for detecting interaction effects (of any order, irrespective of aliasing) of the same magnitude as the main effects. Any antagonistic interactions would reduce the magnitude of main effects; this sample size provided approximately 80% and 70% power to detect reduced main effects of 0.25 SDs and 0.22 SDs, respectively. No allowance for loss to follow-up was required, as data were collected at one time point. As this was a screening experiment, the aim was to identify potentially important effects for further evaluation (by ruling out unimportant effects). No allowance was made for multiplicity because false positives are identified through further experimentation. Detection of promising effects was based on the use of Pareto plots, where a split was made between potentially important and unimportant effects.</p>

                  <p id="Par47">We assumed a continuous distribution for all outcomes. We explored the distribution of outcomes using descriptive statistics and graphical display, model diagnostics to check validity of statistical modelling. Although outcomes were collected on a 7-point Likert scale, model diagnostics from the linear models were satisfactory, and this approach was considered more appropriate than alternatives including loss of power from dichotomising the outcome or increased complexity from modelling the data using ordinal regression.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">We used effect coding for each modification to ensure parameter estimates, and their interactions provided the main effect (rather than simple effects); that is, the effect averaged across all combinations of levels of the other modifications.</p>

Blank cells represent parameters not included in the model. Parameter estimates are all on the same scale of −3 “completely disagree” to +3 “completely agree”. The model intercept represents the overall predicted mean outcome in the NDA and clinical recipient reference groups, averaged across all possible combinations of modifications. Parameter estimates for NCA and role represent the deviation from the predicted mean outcome for the alternative audit and non-clinical recipients. Positive estimates represent an improvement in outcome compared to the reference NDA and clinical recipients, whereas a negative parameter estimate represents a detrimental effect on outcome. Positive parameter estimates for the main effect of each modification represent an improvement in outcome when the modification is ON (+1) and a negative effect on outcome when the modification is OFF (−1). Conversely, negative parameter estimates represent a negative effect on outcome when the modification is ON (+1) and an improvement in outcome when the modification is OFF (−1).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par80">In an online experiment involving five NCA programmes, none of six feedback modifications independently increased intention to enact audit standards across clinical and non-clinical recipients. However, potentially important synergistic and antagonistic effects were observed when feedback modifications were combined, as well as dominant influences of NCA programme and recipient role. Whilst modification effects were generally small (&lt; 0.1 on a scale of −3 to +3), their combined cumulative effect showed more substantial heterogeneity. Predicted intention for the primary outcome, in clinical participants in the NDA, ranged from 1.22 (95% <italic>CI</italic> 0.72, 1.72) for the least effective combination including <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, <italic>optional detail</italic>, and <italic>reduced cognitive load</italic> to 2.40 (95% <italic>CI</italic> 1.88, 2.93) for the most effective combination including <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, <italic>specific actions</italic>, <italic>patient voice</italic>, and <italic>reduced cognitive load</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par81">Our findings should be considered in the light of Clinical Performance Feedback Intervention Theory (CP-FIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This theory specifies steps in the feedback cycle: choosing standards of clinical performance against which care is measured (goal setting); collection and analysis of clinical performance data (data collection and analysis); communication of the measured clinical performance to health professionals (feedback); reception, comprehension, and acceptance of this by the recipient (interaction, perception, and acceptance, respectively); planned behavioural responses to feedback (intention and behaviour); and changes to patient care (clinical performance improvement). A further step of verification may occur between perception and acceptance where recipients interrogate the data underlying their feedback. CP-FIT proposes that feedback, recipient, and context variables operate via a range of mechanisms (e.g. credibility of feedback, social influence) to determine success or failure of the feedback cycle.</p>
              <p id="Par82">Our six feedback modifications and study outcomes mainly focused on perception and intention, although our modifications also targeted interaction, acceptance, verification, and behaviour to lesser extents. Only <italic>reduced cognitive load</italic> alone had positive effects on perception, and <italic>effective comparator</italic> had negative effects. Other feedback modifications’ effects were conditional on interactions, some of which had intuitive explanations. Providing <italic>optional detail</italic> and <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> both entails giving additional information to audit recipients; combining their overlapping functions led to intention being less than the sum of their parts (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Other interactions were difficult to explain, if not counterintuitive, such as both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> and <italic>cognitive load</italic> for different outcomes, NCAs, and roles. Such a range of findings reflect the exploratory nature of this screening experiment, which aimed to detect the most promising signals of effects for further study.</p>
              <p id="Par83">Our findings suggest that the recipient and context variables of CP-FIT, which approximated to role and NCA in our study, have greater influences on feedback effectiveness than single feedback modifications. Participation in the NCABT was associated with lower intention relative to the NDA as was having a non-clinical role, with the exception of NCABT non-clinical participants. These variations may reflect differences in audit organisation and specialty engagement with audit programmes. For instance, there was a trend towards higher intention in PICANet; this highly specialised audit has a relatively small number of participating sites and may therefore represent a more cohesive, engaged, and responsive network compared with other NCAs. By comparison, the NCABT services a diverse range of topics and clinical settings. A consequence could be differing levels of familiarity with the audit standard selected for each NCA, its credibility, or perceived difficulty of achieving the standard. This is supported by the finding that comprehension and user experience varied less by NCA.</p>
              <p id="Par84">With the exceptions of MINAP and NCABT, intention was generally higher for clinical than managerial, audit, or administrative roles. This is consistent with an earlier modelling experiment evaluating audit and feedback, which found that changes in simulated behaviour were mediated through perceived behavioural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In our study, clinicians may have perceived greater control over their ability to implement audit standards than those in other roles.</p>
              <sec id="Sec36">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par85">Previous modelling studies have largely evaluated how feedback in general affects cognitions, but not the effects of individual feedback components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our fractional factorial design provides information on the effects of both individual and combined modifications and their interactions, demonstrating a rigorous approach for developing multicomponent interventions. Our analysis populations exceeded our sample size requirement of 500 participants, providing over 90% power to detect small to moderate main and interaction effects for each modification. Our use of effect coding also ensured equal power to detect main and interaction effects of the same size. The five NCAs provided diversity in audit methods, topics, and targeted recipients, thereby increasing confidence that the effects we found across NCAs are relevant to a wider range of audit programmes.</p>
                <p id="Par86">Five main study limitations concern the design and “dose’ of the online feedback modifications. First, we selected feedback modifications amenable to online experimentation and which could be operationalised with reasonable fidelity to the original suggestions for effective feedback. Nevertheless, where anticipated effects were not detected, we must consider whether the online feedback modifications were optimised to deliver a sufficient “dose” to influence participant responses and how these could be strengthened in future online experiments or “real-world” pragmatic trials. One case in point is <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>; whilst the Cochrane review indicated that feedback may be more effective when it combines both written and verbal information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], we operationalised this modification by adding graphical to textual information. The intervention dose may also have been reduced by limited duration of exposure. We originally estimated a completion time of 20–25 min for the audit excerpt and survey; however, participants spent a much lower median time of just over a minute on audit excerpts and less than 5 min on the experiment overall. Whilst these short durations reflect limited engagement, it is uncertain how long feedback recipients would typically spend examining feedback in actual practice settings; it may be relatively brief given competing demands for attention. Therefore, this aspect of our experiment may have reasonable external validity given that much NCA feedback is delivered electronically.</p>
                <p id="Par87">Second, we set out to design a screening experiment which would be relatively sensitive in detecting changes in proximal outcomes of behaviour change, specifically intention to enact audit standards. We would expect some attenuation of effects on intention when the feedback modifications are applied in “real-world” practice, largely because of numerous post-intentional influences on practice (e.g. time and resource constraints). Furthermore, we had anticipated that outcomes measuring intentions would exhibit skew towards higher intention, partly due to social desirability bias. We attempted to neutralise some of this bias by offering statements which recognised that participants would have competing priorities in normal practice. However, the general skewness of outcomes towards higher intentions imposed a ceiling effect on our ability to detect change.</p>
                <p id="Par88">It is worth considering whether intention is the most appropriate primary outcome to use in screening experiments of audit and feedback. CP-FIT hypothesises that several factors, both upstream and downstream to intention, affect the ability of feedback to change clinical behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Upstream influences include interaction with and perception and verification of feedback data. For example, we found that <italic>reducing cognitive load</italic> improved comprehension of data and increased intention to bring audit findings to the attention of colleagues when accompanied by <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>. Therefore, any future experiments could use a wider range of outcomes to reflect different aspects of the whole audit and feedback cycle.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Third, we noted that 11.3% of participants (most commonly managers) dropped out of the experiment prior to questionnaire completion. This suggests a modest degree of self-selection, so that those who completed the experiment might have perceived the experiment or the feedback as more relevant to their roles than those who did not.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Fourth, the integrity of the experiment was threatened by a significant number of duplicative responses. Designing our experiment to maintain participant anonymity of responses meant we could not identify the duplicative responses within experiment data. We therefore minimised the impact of duplicative responses by removing all 603 (49%) responses over the affected period to ensure the primary analysis only included genuine, independent responses. This approach simultaneously discarded unidentifiable genuine responses, representing a waste of research resources and participant time. We conducted sensitivity analyses, excluding only participants who spent less than 20 s completing the experiment questionnaire. This resulted in far fewer exclusions (280, 23%) and a greater proportion of participants included from general practice. Sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome largely supported the modification effects identified. However, we also identified additional effects not detected in the primary analysis, in part due to increased sample size but also due to differences between the two groups of study participants.</p>
                <p id="Par91">Finally, it is noted that any significant effects discussed could be due all or in part to aliasing (designed confounding) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), although this is considered unlikely based on the sparsity of effects principle.</p>

              <sec id="Sec37">
                <title>Implications for practice and research</title>
                <p id="Par92">Our screening experiment aimed to identify single and combined feedback modifications worthy of further real-world trial evaluation. We detected promising signals of effects on intentions for certain combinations of feedback modification and mixed effects of single and combined modifications on a range of proximal intentions, comprehension, and user experience. Although we would be cautious in generalising from an online experiment, we highlight findings with implications for audit programme design and delivery.</p>
                <p id="Par93">We observed potentially important differences between NCAs for intention to enact the audit standards used in the experiment. Further work should explore which aspects of the audit standards, audit organisation, or targeted recipients account for these variations. Our findings suggest a need for national audits to explicitly review the strengths and weaknesses of their whole audit cycles to identify priorities for change. Clinical recipients were more likely to report higher intention than managerial, administrative, and audit staff. Audit programmes should consider reviewing how their feedback is disseminated to staff who are most likely to be able to act on it, particularly clarifying expectations and goals for managers.</p>
                <p id="Par94">The varying interactions between feedback modifications we observed suggest that audit programmes cannot presume that all proposed enhancements to feedback are additive and highlight the need to explicitly consider how different features of feedback might fit and act together, synergistically or antagonistically. As audit and feedback developers are faced with making design decisions on what to include in their feedback interventions, we make specific suggestions based on modification effects supported by good or consistent evidence from the combined analysis of five NCAs:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par95">Using a comparator aiming to reinforce desired behaviour change (<italic>effective comparators</italic>), which shows recipient performance against the top quarter of performers compared to showing a comparison against overall mean performance, may reduce how easily participants understand audit results and their overall user experience unless accompanied by short, actionable messages with progressive disclosure of additional information (<italic>optional detail</italic>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par96">Combining <italic>optional detail and</italic> a quotation and photograph from a fictional patient describing their experience of care related to the associated audit standard (<italic>patient voice</italic>) may improve recipient experience.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par97">Combining <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> with <italic>optional detail</italic> may reduce intentions to implement audit standards and set goals, comprehension, and recipient experience.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par98">Many recipients may invest relatively brief time in digesting feedback. <italic>Minimising cognitive load</italic>, by removing distracting detail and additional general text not directly related to the audit standard, may improve comprehension and, when combined with <italic>multimodal feedback</italic>, intention to bring audit findings to the attention of colleagues.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par99">This randomised fractional factorial screening experiment undertaken across different NCA programmes and healthcare settings has allowed the efficient evaluation of multiple features of feedback interventions. We found that none of six feedback modifications independently increased intention to enact audit standards across clinical and non-clinical recipients. However, potentially important synergistic and antagonistic effects were observed when feedback modifications were combined, as well as dominant influences of audit programme and recipient role. In particular, antagonistic interactions between <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> and <italic>optional detail</italic>, and <italic>cognitive load</italic> and <italic>optional detail</italic>; synergistic interactions between <italic>effective comparators</italic> and <italic>optional detail</italic>, and varying effects of <italic>multimodal feedback</italic> and <italic>cognitive load</italic> across NCAs. Our findings need to be contextualised in the wider theoretical and empirical literature on audit and feedback so that any advice on combining feedback modifications in “real-world” evaluations is based upon those interactions which have the strongest evidence.</p>
