                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious cause of morbidity and cost to society. Environmental hazards are implicated as a major contributor to falls among older people. A recent Cochrane review found an environmental assessment, undertaken by an occupational therapist, to be an effective approach to reducing falls. However, none of the trials included a cost-effectiveness evaluation in the UK setting. This protocol describes a large multicentre trial investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of environmental assessment and modification within the home with the aim of preventing falls in older people.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A two-arm, modified cohort randomised controlled trial, conducted within England, with 1299 community-dwelling participants aged 65 years and above, who are at an increased risk of falls. Participants will be randomised 2:1 to receive either usual care or home assessment and modification. The primary outcome is rate of falls (falls/person/time) over 12 months assessed by monthly patient self-report falls calendars. Secondary self-reported outcome measures include: the proportion of single and multiple fallers, time to first fall over a 12-month period, quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L) and health service utilisation at 4, 8 and 12 months. A nested qualitative study will examine the feasibility of providing the intervention and explore barriers, facilitators, workload implications and readiness to employ these interventions into routine practice. An economic evaluation will assess value for money in terms of cost per fall averted.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>This study protocol (including the original application and subsequent amendments) received a favourable ethical opinion from National Health Service West of Scotland REC 3. The trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and at conference presentations. A summary of the findings will be sent to participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Falls in older people are common and can have serious consequences. Approximately 30% of people over the age of 65 years living in the community will have a fall each year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Around 85% of falls occur in the home.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> One-fifth of all falls are serious and require medical attention with 5% leading to a fracture.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Fall-related fractures are a serious cause of morbidity and cost to society.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Repeated falls commonly precipitate admission to institutional care and tend to be experienced by frail people in the older age range of 75 years and over.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> The number of falls is likely to increase due to an ageing population and will have a major impact on healthcare resource use, primarily due to hip fractures resulting from a fall. The importance of fall-related injuries has been recognised in the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The NSF calls for health improvement plans to be devised that will reduce the burden of fall-related injuries.</p>
              <p>It is well recognised that many falls result from an interaction between environmental hazards and a broad array of medical conditions and physiological impairments.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Environmental hazards are attributed by older people as primary factors in their falls and, thus, frequently cited in the literature as major contributors to falls. ‘Accident/environment’related factors were identified as the primary cause of just under one-third of falls in a review of 12 studies (mean of 31%, range 1%–53%, n=3628).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Talbot <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> conducted a retrospective study and identified that ‘accident/environment’related factors were perceived by older people as the second most common cause of falls, with key environmental contributors identified as objects on floors, external forces and wet, uneven and icy surfaces.</p>
              <p>The theoretical approach underpinning environmental assessment and modification is the person–environment–occupation (PEO) conceptual model of occupational therapy practice.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This model posits that the person, environment and task being performed continually interact in ways that enhance or diminish a person’s occupational performance and that environmental hazards are dynamic entities that occur through the interaction between these three elements. The PEO model underpins occupational therapy practice that aims to maintain, restore or create a balance between these elements.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>The latest Cochrane review in this area (updated September 2012)<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found that environmental assessment and modification was an effective approach to reducing falls (relative risk of falling 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). It also concluded that the effectiveness of an environmental intervention was increased if delivered by an occupational therapist (OT). Current NICE guidance suggests that ‘older people who have received treatment in hospital following a fall should be offered a home hazard assessment and safety intervention/modifications by a suitably trained healthcare professional’. However, at the time of setting up the study, there was no guidance with respect to environmental assessment for people living in the community who are at elevated risk of falling but have not yet received hospital treatment due to a fall. Indeed, there has only been one UK trial of environmental assessment by an OT, which was a pilot study conducted by some of the authors.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> While this study showed no evidence of a difference between the randomised groups on the primary outcome of fear of falling, a statistically significant reduction was observed in the number of falls (a secondary outcome). Consequently, there is reasonable evidence to suggest OT delivered home hazard assessment and modification can lead to a reduction in falls. This large, multicentre trial builds on this previous work and aims to undertake a high-quality, adequately powered trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an environmental assessment and modification, delivered by an OT, for the prevention of falls.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The Occupational Therapist Intervention Study (OTIS) study is a modified cohort,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> pragmatic, two-arm, open, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an economic evaluation and nested qualitative study. The cohort RCT (cRCT) design was chosen to avoid some of the key potential biases that can occur in a pragmatic trial, namely, high attrition and patient preference effects. In a cRCT, patients are recruited initially into a cohort, and there is usually an outcome run-in period. Given that outcome attrition occurs largely at the first follow-up time point, this attrition is largely avoided if an eligibility criterion for the randomised phase is completion of outcomes during the run-in period.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> With respect to preference effects, although the control group are aware of the possibility of being offered an intervention (in this case occupational therapy), they are unaware of when the actual randomisation occurs: this might avoid those biases, due to patient preference effects, which relate to timing of the offer of the intervention. In this study, the cRCT design was modified in that both intervention and control groups were told about the intervention prior to randomisation and that which group they would be in would be decided by chance/randomisation. In the cmRCT design, the process of obtaining patient information and consent aims to replicate that in real world routine healthcare, where patients are never told prospectively that their care options will be decided by chance. This approach partly replicates routine care in that the participant is not aware of when randomisation takes place and those in the control group are not aware of when they were formally allocated to be in the comparison group. Similarly, the intervention group are offered the intervention without having to face the possibility that once an offer has been made, that randomisation would withdraw the offer.</p>

Randomisation will be carried out using the YTU secure web-based computer randomisation service based on an allocation sequence generated by an independent data systems manager, who is not involved in the recruitment of participants. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the control group or the intervention group in a 2:1 ratio in favour of the control group (to reduce costs). Up to 12 participants from a particular site will be randomised at a time in a single block according to when sites state they have capacity to undertake intervention appointments and for how many participants. The allocation ratio used may go up to 3:1 in a block if the OTs have reduced capacity to carry out the assessment.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>We propose to recruit and randomise 1299 participants to the OTIS trial in a 2:1 ratio (ie, 866 to usual care and 433 to intervention). This number allows for 10% attrition and provides 90% power (using two-sided significance at the 5% level) to show a difference in the percentage of participants who experience at least one fall in the 12 months following randomisation from 60% in the control group to 50% in the intervention group, accounting for the unequal randomisation (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release V.13). In the REFORM trial, previously conducted by some of the authors, an absolute difference of 5% was observed in the percentage of participants experiencing a fall (intervention group: 50%; control group: 55%), with a lower confidence limit of 13%; therefore, the decision was made to power this trial for a 10% absolute difference. In the event that sites are struggling with capacity to undertake assessments, we will consider using an allocation ratio of 3:1 (usual care to intervention) to reduce the number of participants they would have to see. If the final ratio was 3:1 (ie, 974 to the usual care and 325 to the intervention), we would have 85% power under the same conditions. The primary outcome is actually a count variable (number of falls, while proportion of participants experiencing at least one fall over the 12 months is a key secondary outcome); however, powering a trial for count data is more complex and requires greater assumptions and so a binary approach to the sample size calculation has been taken here.</p>

                <p>In addition to the usual care and falls prevention leaflet described above, participants allocated to the intervention arm will be offered a home environmental assessment to identify personal fall-related hazards and behaviours. The assessment will be undertaken by a Health and Care Professions Council registered OT and will take approximately 2 hours to conduct. If the assessment is too demanding for the participant, the appointment may be split over two visits. OTs will attend a 1-day face-to-face training session on how to conduct the assessment. This will be provided by either the researcher who carried out the pilot trial (AP) or two of the OT researchers (ShC and AD) who will be trained by AP to deliver the training in a standardised way.</p>
                <p>The environmental assessment will begin with an initial discussion about the participant’s history of falling, lifestyle, patterns of usage of areas in the home, risk-taking behaviour, strategies already adopted to reduce falls, environmental changes already in place prior to the assessment and functional vision. This will then be followed by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and an environmental assessment using the Westmead Home Safety (WeHSA) tool.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The WeHSA was developed in Australia in 1997 for older adults and consists of a 57-item standardised, valid and reliable checklist of fall hazards in the following domains: internal/external traffic ways, general/indoors, living area, seating, bedroom, toilet, bathroom, kitchen, laundry, mobility aid, footwear, pets, medication management and safety call systems. The OT and the participant will move through the house together, and a functional assessment will be completed. Items on the checklist will be rated as either relevant (ie, deemed to be a hazard) or not relevant (ie, not deemed to be a hazard or not present). The OT will discuss any potential falls hazards identified by either the participant or the OT during the assessment and problem solve with the participant to engage them in identifying possible solutions. A list of recommendations will be agreed. If possible, any identified hazards will be removed. If required, the OT will make referrals to other agencies for equipment or a handyman for other minor modifications. They may also make recommendations for equipment that cannot be provided by social services, such as lightweight step ladders with handles and height adjustable rotary washing lines. In such cases, the OT will liaise with the client or a family member regarding purchase of such equipment. The OT will make a clinical judgement whether an additional home visit is required. Four weeks after the assessment, the OT or member of the OTIS research team will telephone the participant to check adherence to the recommendations.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome is the number of falls per participant over the 12 months from randomisation. A fall is defined as ‘an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest on the ground, floor or lower level’.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Data will be collected via participant self-reported monthly falls calendars, on which participants will be asked to mark the number of falls they have on each day or indicate that they have had no falls that month. An explanation of what the researchers consider to be a fall will be included in the participant information sheet and on the falls calendars. If a participant is uncertain as to whether an event is classed as a fall, then they will be encouraged to ring the research team at the YTU to discuss. Participants who do not return their falls calendar within 10 days of the due date will be either telephoned or sent a letter by the YTU to obtain missing data. Participants will be given a Freephone number to ring during office hours to report any falls as soon as possible after the event and when it is safe and convenient to do so. Participants who ring to report a fall will be asked for further details. Participants who indicate on their falls calendar that they have sustained a fall will be telephoned by the research team for further information. Information collected during the telephone call will include: cause/reason for fall and consequence of fall, for example, superficial wound (bruising, sprain, cut and abrasions), fractures (including type of fracture) and hospital admissions. Data collected from the 4-month, 8-month and 12-month follow-up questionnaires will include falls data and will be used for those participants who do not return their monthly falls calendars.</p>

                <p>This study will record and report details of any adverse events (AEs) that are required to be reported to the Health Research Authority, that is, events that are related to taking part in the study and are unexpected. The AE reporting period begins as soon as the participant consents to be in the study and ends 12 months after they are randomised.</p>
                <p>Details of any AEs will be recorded using a trial adverse event form. Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported by the OT should be reported within 48 hours of the OT becoming aware of the event or within 14 days for non-serious events. A follow-up report will be completed if additional information becomes available.</p>
                <p>For this trial, an SAE is defined as any untoward occurrence that:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Results in death.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is life threatening.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>An event is defined as ‘related’ if the event was due to the administration of any research procedure. Whereas an ‘unexpected event’ is defined as a type of event not listed in the protocol as an expected occurrence.</p>
                <p>The relatedness of an event will be reviewed by the chief investigator and the Trial Steering Committee. Incidents of hospitalisations, disabling/incapacitating/ life-threatening conditions, ageing-associated diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis and dementia) and other common illnesses such as depression, falls and deaths are expected in the study population due to the age of the cohort. Similarly, any hospitalisation that was planned prior to entry into the study or cannot be attributed to taking part in the study or prolongation of an existing hospitalisation due to social reasons will not be recorded as an SAE.</p>

                <p>The number of falls per person will be analysed using Poisson regression (or negative binomial regression, as appropriate) adjusting for gender, age, history of falling and the allocation ratio used to randomise the participant as fixed effects. The model will include an exposure variable for the number of months that the participant returned a monthly falls calendar. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for potential clustering effects by the OT by assigning every randomised participant an OT irrespective of group allocation. For intervention participants, this will be the OT delivering their intervention, whereas for control participants, a counterfactual therapist, that is, one that they could have seen had they been randomised to the intervention group, will be randomly assigned to them. Therapist will then be included as a random effect in the primary analysis model. Additionally, a Complier Average Causal Effect analysis to assess the impact of compliance on treatment estimates will be undertaken for the primary analysis.</p>

                <p>Fear of falling will also be analysed in its continuous form using a covariance pattern model incorporating all postrandomisation time points in the analysis and adjusting for baseline score, gender, age, history of falling, allocation ratio, treatment group, time and a treatment group-by-time interaction. The correlation of observations within patients over time will be modelled.</p>
                <p>The time to the first fall will be derived as the number of days from randomisation until the patient reports having a fall as detailed in the participant’s falls calendars. Time between any subsequent falls will also be calculated. Participants who have not had a fall will be treated as censored at their date of trial exit, or date of last available assessment or 365 days/trial cessation, as appropriate. The proportion of patients yet to experience a fall will be summarised by a Kaplan-Meier survival curve for each group. Time to fall will be analysed using the Andersen and Gill method for analysing time to event data when the event can be repeated. The analysis treats each time to event or censoring as a separate observation. The data will be analysed by Cox proportional hazards regression using robust SEs to account for dependent observations by participant and adjusting for the same covariates as in the primary analysis model.</p>

                <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                <p>The health economic evaluation aims to establish the cost-effectiveness of OT delivered environmental assessment and modification in terms of preventing falls and assess the impact of the intervention on participants’ quality of life. The economic analysis will be performed using individual patient level data on an ITT basis. The analytical approach will take the form of cost-effectiveness and cost–utility analyses. The cost-effectiveness approach will assess value for money in terms of cost per fall averted, and the cost–utility analysis will assess cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The perspective for both analyses will be that of the UK NHS and personal social services, as well as secondary analyses undertaken from a societal perspective. Discounting for future cost and health benefit will not be undertaken given the time frame for the trial is 12 months after randomisation. The year of pricing will be set as the mid-year of the trial.</p>
                <p>Health benefits associated with the treatments will be measured in terms of both estimates of the mean number of falls, corresponding to the main outcome of the trial, and mean QALYs, defined as a year lived with full health. In line with NICE recommendations,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> the EuroQol EQ-5D<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> will be used to elicit patient utility values at different points in time and used to calculate QALYs for each patient, using the area under the curve approach.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> These utility values are used as ‘quality adjustment’ for each patient’s survival time. Specifically, the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L will be used.</p>
                <p>Cost data will be collected for each patient regarding healthcare resource use, specifically within primary care and the community (ie, GP, nurse, physiotherapist and OT visits) and the hospital setting (ie, outpatient attendances, day cases, inpatient stays and accident and emergency attendances). Unit costs will then be applied to estimate the total cost per patient. Additional information will be collected regarding intervention costs and private/personal expenses that feed into the societal perspective analysis (eg, activities of daily living equipment and travel costs for healthcare attendances). Unit costs will be obtained from established costing sources such as NHS Reference Costs<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and PSSRU Unit Costs of Health and Social Care.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Data on the cost and utility measures will be collected prospectively at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months via self-reported questionnaires.</p>
                <p>Mean within-trial estimates of cost and health benefits will be estimated using regression methods, allowing for the correlation between costs and effects, as well as adjusting for covariates. The results will be presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, where the difference in mean cost estimates between the two arms is divided by the difference in mean health benefit between the two arms. Findings will also be presented in terms of net health benefit.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Multiple imputation methods will be used to handle missing data where needed.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p>
                <p>The uncertainty surrounding the decision to accept a treatment as the most cost-effective will be explored in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These curves depict the probability of accepting a treatment as being cost-effective for a large range of willingness to pay values for an extra unit of health benefit. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to explore the impact of underlying assumptions of the analysis and the range of unit costs on the cost-effectiveness results.</p>
                <p>The main outcome of the trial, falls reduction, is associated with a reduction in fractures. However, due to the restriction in the length of follow-up, the long-term effect in terms of the decreasing number of fractures might not be observed in the current trial. Therefore, a further analysis will explore the possible long-term impact of the trial, assuming that a falls reduction should also lead to a fracture reduction. A decision analytic model approach will be adopted to perform this task. The perspective will be the UK NHS and personal social services, with a lifetime time horizon whereby every participant in a hypothetical cohort is followed up until the last participant dies. The hypothetical cohort will be constructed, based on the characteristics of the trial population, to estimate the QALY yield and cost saving of the long-term effect of the intervention. The model parameters that are not collected in the trial will be extracted from the existing literature.</p>
                <p>The model outputs will be the estimated expected mean costs, effectiveness and QALYs associated with each alternative treatment. Estimated total costs and outcomes will be discounted according to the latest health technology appraisal guidance.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Uncertainty regarding cost-effectiveness will be evaluated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, where inputs into the analysis are defined as probability distributions that reflect uncertainty.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The uncertainty surrounding the decision to adopt a given treatment option as a cost-effective treatment at different levels of willingness to pay will be represented in CEACs. The impact of assumptions undertaken in the analysis regarding the evidence over parameters or relating to the decision model (such as extrapolation) will be evaluated in sensitivity analysis, if possible.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study uses a modified cRCT design. The authors have previously conducted three cRCTs.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Participants in these trials were recruited from either routine NHS podiatry clinics<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or from general practices.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> All were aged at least 65 years and over and therefore had an elevated risk of falling. One key feature of the cRCT design is the capacity to undertake multiple RCTs over time. A strength to this trial is that during the recruitment phase of the OTIS study, we will be able to test the feasibility of recruiting participants from these cohorts and determine whether it is a quick and cost-effective means to recruit participants. A further strength lies in the fact that in addition to the main OTIS trial, we have taken the opportunity to undertake three SWATs. The results of these studies will add a significant contribution to the body of evidence about strategies to improve recruitment to trials and minimise the amount of missing data.</p>
              <p>One potential limitation to the study is that some participants with mild dementia and cognitive impairment may be included in the study. These participants may have a higher risk of falling. We have tried to exclude this group of participants at screening by collecting data on participant’s medical history. In addition, if the study team have any concerns about the ability of a participant to provide informed consent or outcome data during the course of the study, then this is discussed with either the participant, a family member (if the participant consents) or with the participant’s GP. Nevertheless, it is still possible that some participants with mild dementia and cognitive impairment may be included in the study that we are unaware of. Further limitations include the fact that the study uses unblinded, patient self-report primary outcome measure, so there is the possibility of reporting bias being introduced. Also, the results of the study will be generalisable to a community-dwelling population of older people within England only.</p>
              <p>Falls in older people are a major health problem. A recent Cochrane review found environmental assessment, undertaken by an OT, to be an effective approach to reducing falls in older people. As far as we are aware, none of the trials included a cost-effectiveness evaluation within a UK setting. The OTIS protocol aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an environmental assessment and modification for preventing falls in older people and will be the largest trial to evaluate this intervention in isolation. If the results of this study are found to be positive, then further research could be conducted to investigate whether the intervention could be delivered equally effectively by trained assessors. Alternatively, further research into the intensity of the intervention, that is, whether more home visits are more effective, could be undertaken.</p>
