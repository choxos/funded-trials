                  <p id="Par1">A three-arm parallel group, randomised controlled trial set in general dental practices in England, Scotland, and Wales was undertaken to evaluate three strategies to manage dental caries in primary teeth. Children, with at least one primary molar with caries into dentine, were randomised to receive Conventional with best practice prevention (C + P), Biological with best practice prevention (B + P), or best practice Prevention Alone (PA).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Data on costs were collected via case report forms completed by clinical staff at every visit. The co-primary outcomes were incidence of, and number of episodes of, dental pain and/or infection avoided. The three strategies were ranked in order of mean cost and a more costly strategy was compared with a less costly strategy in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A total of 1144 children were randomised with data on 1058 children (C + P <italic>n</italic> = 352, B + P <italic>n</italic> = 352, PA <italic>n</italic> = 354) used in the analysis. On average, it costs £230 to manage dental caries in primary teeth over a period of up to 36 months. Managing children in PA was, on average, £19 (97.5% CI: -£18 to £55) less costly than managing those in B + P. In terms of effectiveness, on average, there were fewer incidences of, (− 0.06; 97.5% CI: − 0.14 to 0.02) and fewer episodes of dental pain and/or infection (− 0.14; 97.5% CI: − 0.29 to 0.71) in B + P compared to PA. C + P was unlikely to be considered cost-effective, as it was more costly and less effective than B + P.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The mean cost of a child avoiding any dental pain and/or infection (incidence) was £330 and the mean cost per episode of dental pain and/or infection avoided was £130. At these thresholds B + P has the highest probability of being considered cost-effective. Over the willingness to pay thresholds considered, the probability of B + P being considered cost-effective never exceeded 75%.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">Dental caries has a large health and economic impact for the United Kingdom (UK) as it is the most common disease in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treating oral disease is expensive, costing NHS England £3.4 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">In the UK there is uncertainty surrounding the best strategy to manage caries in primary teeth, especially in primary care. There is debate about the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of conventional restorations (removing a carious lesion with a drill and placement of a restoration) compared to minimally-invasive biologically-orientated strategies (sealing-in a carious lesion with an adhesive restoration or preformed metal crown rather than removing it), or prevention-focused strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Cost-effectiveness analysis allows treatment comparisons in terms of both costs and effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent cost-effectiveness analyses of managing dental caries found the Hall Technique (HT), a method for managing carious lesions by sealing-in, to be cost-effective compared to conventional restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and compared to both conventional restorations and a Non-Restorative Cavity Control approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, these studies followed outcomes on single teeth and have focused on one type of biological approach (i.e. HT).</p>
              <p id="Par28">A large trial, FiCTION (Filling Children’s Teeth: Indicated or Not?), was undertaken to measure the costs and effects, in terms of dental pain and/or infection, of three strategies to manage dental caries in the primary teeth of young children with dentine caries in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The strategies evaluated were Conventional restorations with best practice prevention (C + P), Biological management of carious lesions with best practice prevention (B + P), and best practice Prevention Alone (PA). The C + P strategy involved the complete mechanical removal of carious tooth tissue using local anesthesia and a drill followed by placement of a restoration alongside best practice preventive therapy and has been considered standard practice in the management of dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The B + P strategy involved sealing-in carious lesions using a variety of techniques including adhesive restorative materials or preformed metal crowns placed using the HT along with preventive therapy; Schwendicke et al.’s (2018, 2019) analyses focused on the HT component of B + P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. PA involved avoiding restorative intervention and using four components of preventive management; toothbrushing (with toothpaste of at least 1000ppmF concentration), dietary advice, fluoride varnish application, and fissure sealants to prevent further carious lesions.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The trial methodology and clinical outcomes are presented elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In brief, this multi-center, three-arm, parallel group, patient-randomised controlled trial set in general dental practices in England, Scotland, and Wales was undertaken to evaluate three strategies to manage caries in the primary teeth of children aged 3 to 7 years with at least one primary molar tooth with caries lesions extending into dentine. The original planned follow-up was 3 years but due to an extension in the recruitment period this was revised to an average target follow-up of 35.5 months (a minimum of 23 months and a maximum of 36 months).</p>

                  <title>Estimation of costs</title>
                  <p id="Par32">Time/materials-based costing was used to estimate the costs at every visit to manage dental caries in primary teeth. These costs depended on the quantity of dental care resources used for each child during their time in the trial (up to 36 months post-randomisation). Resource use data, to inform the cost analysis, were collected via case report forms (CRFs) completed by the clinician at every visit. Costs were categorised as staffing, preventive treatments, operative treatments (restoration materials), other associated items (e.g. radiographs), referrals, and prescriptions. Capital costs were excluded as all three strategies were provided as part of current care; therefore, these costs would have been incurred regardless of which strategy was implemented. Unit costs, based on the materials required for each treatment, were multiplied by the number of resources used. Unit costs are detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and briefly described below. All costs are in 2018 pounds Sterling.</p>
                  <p id="Par33">The length of time for each visit, based on the start and end time recorded in the CRF, was used to estimate dental personnel costs. Time spent providing prevention was subtracted from total visit time to take into account that the same personnel may not provide preventive and operative treatments. We assumed a dental nurse would be present for the full duration of each visit.</p>
                  <p id="Par34">Preventive care was integral to all three arms and was expected to be provided regardless of randomised allocation. Preventive treatment costs were the resources used for fluoride applications and fissure sealants placed on first permanent molars.</p>
                  <p id="Par35">Operative treatments were included in two arms; C + P (e.g. local anesthetic, carious tissue removal, and restoration) and B + P (e.g. partial/no carious tissue removal and restoration), but some treatments were included in all three arms (e.g. extractions under local anesthetic and pulp therapy). Information on the number of surfaces treated was also collected since treatment of more than one tooth surface could incur additional costs (e.g. additional restorative material). The cost of resources used at every visit were also included, regardless of treatment. Other treatment costs included radiographs and inhalation sedation.</p>
                  <p id="Par36">A patient referral was reported if a child was referred to a dental hospital/clinic for a consultation and/or operative treatment. The costs associated with referrals were categorised A-F (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) depending on treatment provided, where it took place, who provided it, and the number of visits required.</p>

                  <p id="Par37">The original primary outcome, incidence of dental pain and/or infection was modified during the trial to include a co-primary outcome, number of episodes of dental pain and/or infection. Number of episodes was included as it was considered more clinically relevant and statistically more sensitive to analyse the frequency of dental pain and/or infection experienced by a child.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">Incidence is defined as the proportion of children with at least one episode of dental pain and/or infection during their time in the study. Episodes were defined on a tooth-by-tooth basis based on the frequency of dental pain and/or infection reported during the child’s follow-up. However, if multiple teeth had dental pain and/or infection at the same visit, this was counted as one episode or if the same tooth had dental pain and/or infection at consecutive visits, this was counted as one episode regardless of the time between visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Data on dental pain due to dental caries and clinically diagnosed infection were collected on the CRF at every visit. It was assumed that those who did not have regular appointments did not need further treatment and/or did not experience dental pain and/or infection.</p>

                  <p id="Par39">The economic analysis was conducted on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT). Children were included in the ITT analysis if they had at least one CRF and therefore at least one clinical assessment of the primary outcome. The economic analysis compared the three strategies in terms of mean costs and effects over the follow-up period. Both costs and effects were discounted at the recommended rate of 3.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Effects were discounted, based on when the incidence or episode of dental pain and/or infection began. To enable the estimation of budget impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] the average total costs by cost category presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> were not discounted.

                  <p id="Par40">For the incremental analysis, the strategies were ranked in terms of increasing mean cost and a more costly strategy was compared with a less costly strategy in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness. A treatment was considered to be dominated if it was more costly and less effective than its comparator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If a treatment was not dominated, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated. The ICER is the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean effects and gives an estimate of the mean cost per additional unit of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par41">STATA software was used for all analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Regressions on costs and effects were run simultaneously using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. SUR permits the simultaneous estimation of costs and effects, calculated at an individual level, while accounting for unobserved individual characteristics that could affect both costs and effects and lead to potential correlation between these two dependent variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, the SUR controlled for additional covariates (age, time in study, and practice variation) that may affect costs, effects, or both.</p>
                  <p id="Par42">A stochastic sensitivity analysis, using the bootstrapping technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], explored the impact of the statistical imprecision surrounding estimates of costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness.

              <p id="Par45">A total of 1144 children were randomised and data on 1058 children were used in the economic analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 86 children did not have any clinical assessment of the primary outcome and were not included in the ITT analysis). The children included in the economic analysis were evenly distributed across the three arms in terms of numbers randomised and baseline characteristics; 352 randomised to B + P, 352 to C + P, and 354 to PA. On average, children were 6 years old [sd: 1.3] when recruited and there was an even split between females (51%) and males (49%).

The median follow-up was 33.8 months (IQR 23.8, 36.7).</p>
              <p id="Par46">The percentage of missing data for the economic analysis was low (&lt; 5%). There were 7713 visits recorded across the three arms. On average, children had seven visits during their time in the trial, each lasting 21 min. All three strategies were similar in terms of average number of visits (mean visits [sd]: C + P 7.7 [4.2], B + P 7.4 [4.1], and PA 6.8 [3.7]) and duration of visits (mean minutes [sd]: C + P 21.8 [6.9], B + P 21.2 [7.2], and PA 20.1 [6.7]).</p>
              <p id="Par47">The number of visits at which preventive treatment was provided was similar across the three arms with slightly more prevention provided in the PA arm (C + P 79%, B + P 79%, and PA 85% of visits). The three strategies differed in the frequency of operative treatments provided, with less than 20% of all PA visits involving operative treatment compared to over 40% of B + P and C + P visits. The type of operative treatment provided also differed, as would be expected given the nature of the different strategies.</p>

              <p id="Par52">B + P was, on average, more costly but more effective, in terms of both incidence of, and episodes of, dental pain and/or infection avoided, compared to PA. At a willingness to pay threshold of £330 we would consider B + P cost-effective to avoid an incidence and £130 to avoid an episode of dental pain and/or infection compared to PA. As C + P was, on average, more costly and less effective than B + P, in terms of both incidence of, and episodes of, dental pain and/or infection, it was dominated by B + P.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par57">On average, it costs £230 to manage dental caries in primary teeth in a child with at least one tooth with a dentinal caries lesion over a period of up to 36 months. The main cost drivers were staff time, operative treatments, and patient referrals. On average, PA incurred a higher referral cost because that arm had more referrals and more referrals requiring GA, an important consideration in view of the morbidity associated with GA use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par58">Although in terms of cost-effectiveness PA was, on average, the least costly treatment, it was also the least effective for both incidence of, and episodes of, dental pain and/or infection. There was an 87% probability that PA would be considered cost-effective as the least costly option but B + P and C + P would, on average, provide more oral health benefits, albeit at a higher cost. If society was willing to pay £330 to avoid one additional child experiencing dental pain and/or infection, B + P would have the highest probability (47%) of being considered cost-effective compared to PA (46%) and C + P (7%). Similarly, when society is willing to pay £130 or more to avoid an episode of dental pain and/or infection, B + P would have the highest probability (49%) of being considered cost-effective compared to PA (45%) and C + P (6%).</p>
              <p id="Par59">Vermaire et al. (2014) and Samnaliev et al. (2015) came to similar conclusions in their analyses, in that treatments aimed at caries prevention increased the cost of providing treatment and that the opportunity cost of these treatments is dependent on the payers’ willingness-to-pay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our results differ from other studies in which the HT, which was a component of our B + P intervention, was reported to be more effective and less costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] when compared to conventional and preventive based strategies. However, both of these studies by Schwendicke et al. (2018, 2019) were based on treating a single tooth, or two contralateral teeth per child whereas in our study the whole child/mouth (up to 20 primary teeth per child) could be treated, a situation more representative of real life treatment provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our study also had considerably more data available to inform our analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 1058 children, <italic>n</italic> = 2721 teeth; compared with <italic>n</italic> = 142 children and teeth in Schwendicke et al. 2018; and <italic>n</italic> = 91 children, <italic>n</italic> = 182 teeth in Schwendicke et al. 2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The costs estimated in the two Schwendicke et al. (2018, 2019) studies were based on current charges to the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present analysis we based our costs on a very detailed costing exercise, however, when we used current charges to the NHS in a sensitivity analysis we still reached the same conclusion (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Schwendicke et al. (2019) found a negligible difference in total treatment costs between HT and conventional treatment and this difference only became clinically and statistically significant when patient costs were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Parental time and travel costs to attend appointments were not considered in our analysis. Inclusion of such costs are unlikely to change our conclusions as the average number of visits and length of visits were similar across the arms. Costs incurred by the parent and child due to toothache, such as time off work, childcare, and time off school, were considered in a sensitivity analysis but did not change our overall conclusions. In terms of oral health effects, direct comparisons could not be made with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which considered the pain associated with dental caries together with endodontic treatment and extractions. The main differences in our study are, firstly, that B + P encompassed a number of minimally-invasive restorations of which the HT was only one and secondly, treatment was at the participant level (including all primary teeth) and not at the single tooth level.</p>
              <p id="Par60">This economic analysis had a number of strengths and limitations. The main strength was that the analysis was pre-planned and the data used were collected as part of the trial. There were few missing data and all available data were included in the analysis despite the varying follow-up. A limitation of the analysis was that SUR model may not have been an appropriate fit for the co-primary outcomes. However, a trade-off was made between fitting the most appropriate model and applying one that allows for the correlation of costs and outcomes, which the SUR approach does. Finally, capital costs were excluded from the analysis; this omission reduced the total cost of each arm equally hence the incremental costs, ICER, and our overall conclusions remain unchanged.</p>
              <p id="Par61">In practical terms, we do not know society’s willingness to pay threshold to avoid dental pain and/or infection in a primary tooth. A judgement is required as to what value the NHS places on avoiding dental pain and/or infection. Recent research conducted by Lord et al. (2015) estimated the willingness to pay to avoid dental caries with pain in a primary tooth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. They estimated this to be £153 (95% CI: £93 to £213 – inflated to 2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. If we adopted this as the willingness to pay threshold the PA arm would have a 68% probability of being considered cost-effective compared to B + P (29%) and C + P (3%) in terms of an incidence of dental pain and/or infection avoided. A willingness to pay threshold to avoid an episode of dental pain and/or infection also needs to be determined but based on the Lord et al. (2015) threshold, B + P would have the highest probability (53%) of being considered cost-effective compared to PA (40%) and C + P (7%). Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate threshold to assess our results.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par62">To conclude, on average, PA is the least costly, despite having more referrals requiring GA, but the least effective strategy for managing dental caries in primary teeth. B + P has the potential to provide more oral health benefits to children with dentinal carious lesion in at least one primary molar tooth, however this comes at an additional cost. Over the willingness to pay values considered, the probability of B + P being considered cost-effective was approximately no higher than 65% to avoid an incidence of dental pain and/or infection and no higher than 75% to avoid an episode of dental pain and/or infection. It is unlikely that C + P would be considered cost-effective.</p>
