                  <p id="Par1">The TRIAL-STIM Study aims to assess the diagnostic performance, clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a screening trial prior to full implantation of a spinal cord stimulation (SCS) device.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The TRIAL-STIM Study is a superiority, parallel-group, three-centre, randomised controlled trial in patients with chronic neuropathic pain with a nested qualitative study and economic evaluation. The study will take place in three UK centres: South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (The James Cook University Hospital); Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. A total of 100 adults undergoing SCS implantation for the treatment of neuropathy will be included. Subjects will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the three participating sites and randomised to undergo a screening trial prior to SCS implant or an implantation-only strategy in a 1:1 ratio. Allocation will be stratified by centre and minimised on patient age (≥ 65 or &lt; 65 years), gender, presence of failed back surgery syndrome (or not) and use of high frequency (HF10™) (or not). The primary outcome measure is the numerical rating scale (NRS) at 6 months compared between the screening trial and implantation strategy and the implantation-only strategy. Secondary outcome measures will include diagnostic accuracy, the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% and 30% pain relief at 6 months as measured on the NRS, health-related quality-of-life (EQ-5D), function (Oswestry Disability Index), patient satisfaction (Patients’ Global Impression of Change) and complication rates. A nested qualitative study will be carried out in parallel for a total of 30 of the patients recruited in each centre (10 at each centre) to explore their views of the screening trial, implantation and overall use of the SCS device. The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost–utility analysis.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par17">Approximately 20% of the adult European population has significant chronic pain, and 7–8% of the population has chronic pain with neuropathic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Health-related quality of life is significantly poorer in people with chronic pain than in those without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and poorer in people with neuropathic pain than in those with non-neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In routine clinical care, up to 50% of patients with neuropathic pain fail to obtain pain relief from analgesic medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as an effective and cost-effective treatment for severe neuropathic pain refractory to medical management conditional on a screening trial being conducted before a final implant of SCS in every case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The evidence for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such SCS screening trials still remains unclear.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>SCS screening trial and purpose</title>
                <p id="Par19">An SCS screening trial consists of the insertion of a wire (lead) introduced into the epidural space of the spinal cord through a needle puncture. The lead is then positioned to target the pain by passing current into the lead from an external power source, generating paraesthesia over the painful area. Pain coverage is expressed as a percentage of the whole area of pain covered by the paraesthesia. In patients where it is possible to achieve ≥ 80% coverage, the wire can be fixed to the spinal fascia through an open procedure and tunnelled to exit through the skin away from the incision. This technique is known as a definitive trial because the same wire is used later to attach to a battery if the trial is successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In some cases the implantation of the lead may be guided by anatomical landmarks rather than patient feedback. In an alternative technique known as a temporary trial, a wire is simply fixed to the skin at the site of the epidural needle puncture of the back by sutures or tape. The wire can be removed without the need for a surgical intervention at the end of the trial but requires a repeat implantation in the case of a successful trial. Trials can last from a few minutes (‘on-table trial’) to a few weeks (‘home trial’).</p>
                <p id="Par20">The screening trial period allows the patient to test the efficacy of SCS therapy directly and specifically. An expert panel defined a successful trial as the patient reporting ≥ 50% pain relief during the trial with stable or reduced pain medications, with at least stable levels of daily activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Evidence for SCS screening trials as a predictor of long-term success</title>
                <p id="Par21">SCS screening trials are recommended by consensus expert opinion and national guidance in many countries, including the United Kingdom. However, the research literature to date has not provided definitive evidence to support the value of screening trials for SCS and in particular their ability to reliably predict the long-term success of SCS therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The PROCESS RCT trial randomised neuropathic pain of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) compared SCS to conventional medical management; 95% of the patients receiving SCS reported ≥ 50% pain relief at the screening trial phase, but by contrast only 48% reported the same outcome at 6-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another RCT compared SCS to reoperation in FBSS; 19/24 (80%) subjects reported a successful screening trial, but only 9/15 (60%) continued to report ≥ 50% pain relief at the 2-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, no pain outcome data were available for patients who failed the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Similarly, the SENZA randomised trial comparing high-frequency SCS to conventional SCS reported that 90/97 (92.8%) of subjects who trialled a higher frequency of SCS and 81/92 (88.0%) subjects who were trialled with traditional SCS were eligible for implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. By 12 months the figures for ≥ 50% pain relief dropped to 78.7% and 51.3% respectively. Oakley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] showed that 55% (18/33) of patients had ≥ 50% pain relief at the 6-month follow-up compared to 75% in the trial period. Screening trials have been shown to exclude good candidates for SCS. Twelve patients who failed to obtain ≥ 50% pain relief during an SCS screening trial still received an implanted SCS device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. At follow-up, a third of the patients reported pain relief rates of 44–88%. The authors concluded that the screening trial is not the sole predictor of long-term success but, again, did not assess pain outcomes in trial failures.</p>
                <p id="Par24">A retrospective study compared a 15-min on-table trial to a 5-day home trial and found a 98% (53/54) success rate for 15-min trials compared to 90% (47/52) for 5-day home trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The authors concluded that since both methods appeared to have equivalent predictive value for successful long-term outcomes, home trials should be eliminated based on increased therapeutic failures, greater risk of infection and additional therapy costs.</p>

                <p id="Par30">The study is designed as a superiority, parallel-group, three-centre RCT in patients with chronic neuropathic pain with a nested qualitative study and economic evaluation. Participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either a strategy of a screening trial followed by SCS implantation based on the screening trial result or an SCS implantation-only strategy. Both groups will be followed-up for 6 months post randomisation. Duration for the main study protocol (i.e. start of recruitment to last patient recruited completing all study procedures) is expected to be 26 months. Patients’ participation within the trial will last for 6 months following implantation.

                <p id="Par64">Randomisation will be achieved by means of a password-protected web-based system developed and maintained by Exeter Clinical Trials Unit (ExeCTU). Once the patient has completed the screening interview and baseline data collection interview, the researcher will access the randomisation website using a unique username and password. The website will require entry of the study site and participant age before returning the participants’ unique randomisation number and allocation (Engager Intervention or Control). Allocation will be stratified by centre and minimised on patient age (≥ 65 or &lt; 65 years), gender, presence of FBSS or not and use of high frequency (HF10™) or not. Allocation concealment will be maintained by only revealing allocation of each participant to the study manager following completion of written informed consent and baseline outcomes.</p>

                <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par71">An economic evaluation will be carried out to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a screening trial and implantation strategy versus an implantation-only strategy. Healthcare resource utilisation (e.g. management of AEs, interventions, investigations, medication, inpatient hospitalisations, A&amp;E and other healthcare-related visits, plus out-of-pocket costs and absences from work) will be collected for each patient during the study follow-up period using data collection methods which have been successfully adopted by the applicants in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Resources required for the specific screening trial and implantation interventions will be recorded within the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Items of resource use will be costed using national averages obtained from national sources (such as the Personal Social Services Research Unit, the British National Formulary and NHS reference cost databases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Cost components will be combined to derive total patient-level costs for the NHS. In addition, non-NHS costs such as productivity loss due to absence from work or patient out-of-pocket expenses will also be quantified to provide a full picture of how the strategies being compared will affect the financial burden imposed by the condition on both the NHS and the patients. Generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data will be collected using the EQ-5D-5L instrument. Both resource utilisation (costs) and the EQ-5D-5L will be collected at each follow-up visit. A within-trial cost consequence analysis will be carried out to estimate mean resource utilisation, costs, EQ-5D scores and total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in each group, together with relevant measures of sampling uncertainty. QALYs will be calculated using the area under the curve approach, with regression-based adjustment for baseline EQ-5D score. The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost–utility analysis, to calculate the cost per additional QALY gained. Base-case analyses will be conducted from the NHS perspective, with additional analyses from the societal perspective. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to explore the robustness of the results to plausible variations in key assumptions and variations in the analytical methods used. In order to account for uncertainty, probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) will also be undertaken using bootstrapping and the bootstrapped cost–effect pairs will be graphically presented on a cost-effectiveness plane. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed to show the probability that the intervention is cost-effective for specific thresholds of cost per QALY gained.</p>
                <p id="Par73">A two-stage economic model will also be developed with a decision tree reflecting the outcomes of the first 6 months and reproducing the observed TRIAL-STIM Study outcomes. After this 6-month period, a Markov “state transition” model will then extrapolate the evolution of patient outcome and costs over a period of 15 years. The model will be populated with data from the trial itself and previously published research. Again, extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be undertaken.</p>

A semi-structured telephone interview will be carried out with 30 patients recruited by purposive sampling (among those consenting) at three sites (at baseline and 1 month post implantation). Baseline interviews will explore the impact of pain on daily living, thoughts and understanding of the screening trial and implantation only and expectations of the spinal cord stimulator. One-month follow-up interviews will revisit thoughts and understanding of the spinal cord stimulators, expectations and explore their overall experience of the SCS device. Ten patients will be recruited from each centre, five from each treatment arm. Open-ended questions will be used to allow patients to express their own viewpoints. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. Data will be analysed using thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], facilitated by NVivo qualitative analysis software.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par105">SCS has been tested against various control therapies in the management of neuropathic pain of FBSS as well as painful diabetic neuropathy and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. All studies have implemented a screening trial prior to implantation of the final permanent components of the therapy. While generally recommended by most guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], none of the guidelines present an evidence-based rationale for screening trials.</p>
              <sec id="Sec36">
                <title>Pros and cons of screening trials</title>
                <p id="Par106">Screening trials give patients the opportunity for a short period of experiencing SCS therapy and allow them to experience the sensation generated by SCS and its interaction with body movements. This also allows patients and physicians a baseline evaluation of the pain relief and current consumption, which influence the choice of battery implanted. However, screening trials require duplication of procedures, thereby consuming more healthcare resources. In a recent RfPB-funded study the applicants adopted a no-screening trial policy with average on-table total implant time of 111 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. By contrast, the normal screening trial surgery duration averages 90 min and pulse generator implant surgery averages 60 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par107">Moreover, prolonged SCS screening trials expose patients to a higher risk of infection due to bacterial colonisation of the wire skin exit site. Longer trials of up to 15 days have been associated with an infection rate of 7.5% compared to an average infection rate in the same department of 2.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As most SCS infections require device removal this is an expensive as well as an inconvenient complication. We also found screening trials to be associated with severe and prolonged surgical pain, calling into question a patient’s ability to judge the impact of SCS on their original pain.</p>
                <p id="Par108">In conclusion, published studies to date call into question the predictive value of screening trials. While screening trials allow patients to experience first-hand the effects of SCS therapy before deciding to receive a permanent implant, screening trials are costly, require procedure duplication, are associated with increased risk of infection and may not appropriately represent therapeutic long-term outcomes. The current NICE recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] that all candidates for SCS undergo screening trials is largely based on expert opinion rather than firm evidence.</p>
                <p id="Par109">A number of studies have examined the predictive value of screening trials in predicting long-term outcome of SCS therapy, but none with an appropriate design or adequate power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par110">Weinand et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] conducted a retrospective case series of 54 patients. All patients had an acute 15-min on-table trial followed by an externalised approximately 5-day trial with a mean follow-up of 9.4 ± 1.5 months. The screening trial success rate was reported at 98% in acute screening and 90% in prolonged screening. The authors concluded that acute and prolonged SCS screening appear to have equivalent predictive value for successful long-term SCS control of chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain. These preliminary results suggest potential justification for eliminating prolonged and retaining acute (intraoperative) SCS screening for selection of permanent SCS implantation candidates. The investigators found no clear difference between acute on-table trials and prolonged outpatient trials and concluded that on-table acute trials were more cost-effective. Moriyama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] conducted a prospective cohort of 55 patients of various pain aetiologies implanted with SCS and followed up for 6 months. They reported a screening trials success rate of 61.8% (34/55), reported the factors predicting a positive response to include increased paraesthesia coverage, female gender and disorders of peripheral vs central nervous system, and reported screening trial sensitivity of 84.8% and specificity of 70% (14/20).</p>
                <p id="Par111">Given that both of these studies reported such a wide margin of screening trial success and included a small sample size, we believe that the proposed TRIAL-STIM Study is fully justified clinically and economically.</p>
