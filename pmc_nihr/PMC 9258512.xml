                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Every year 2.4 million deaths occur worldwide in babies younger than 28 days. Approximately 70% of these deaths occur in low-resource settings because of failure to implement evidence-based interventions. Digital health technologies may offer an implementation solution. Since 2014, we have worked in Bangladesh, Malawi, Zimbabwe and the UK to develop and pilot Neotree: an android app with accompanying data visualisation, linkage and export. Its low-cost hardware and state-of-the-art software are used to improve bedside postnatal care and to provide insights into population health trends, to impact wider policy and practice.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a mixed methods (1) intervention codevelopment and optimisation and (2) pilot implementation evaluation (including economic evaluation) study. Neotree will be implemented in two hospitals in Zimbabwe, and one in Malawi. Over the 2-year study period clinical and demographic newborn data will be collected via Neotree, in addition to behavioural science informed qualitative and quantitative implementation evaluation and measures of cost, newborn care quality and usability. Neotree clinical decision support algorithms will be optimised according to best available evidence and clinical validation studies.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Worldwide, 2.4 million children younger than 28 days die yearly, accounting for 48% of deaths in children under 5<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Approximately 70% of newborn deaths are avoidable through the implementation of simple, evidence-based interventions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Health systems strengthening and training in newborn care are key to saving newborn lives.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Implementation of evidence-based guidelines can be supported through provision of reliable data systems, clinical decision support tools and education.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> We are developing and robustly evaluating an integrated quality improvement system for hospital-based sick and vulnerable newborns: Neotree. Neotree combines evidence-based clinical guidelines with real-time newborn data collection, data visualisation and export and newborn education on one platform.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This tablet-based digital system is for use at the hospital bedside by healthcare professionals (HCP) with a range of skills and competencies (primarily nurses) supporting the care and treatment of newborns. Neotree development has followed standard software development and Medical Research Council (MRC) complex intervention development frameworks.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background work to Neotree</title>
                <p>A literature review of HCP-led newborn interventions in low-resource settings (LRS) identified gaps in successful implementation of proven interventions.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> To address these gaps, we explored the concept and acceptability of digital data capture and clinical decision support via workshops with HCP in Bangladesh (n~15; 2014, unpublished) and developed a prototype app (2015). An editor platform was designed to allow a clinician to configure the data capture forms and Neotree-alpha was configured (2016). Next, a qualitative study was conducted with HCP in Zomba Central Hospital (ZCH), Malawi to understand barriers to delivering quality newborn care and to explore the potential for digital health interventions to mitigate these.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We selected ZCH as a Neotree co-investigator had previously piloted a clinical algorithm to support babies with respiratory distress at this site.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Neotree-beta minimal viable product 1 (MVP-1) was subsequently codeveloped with Malawian HCP (n=46, 2016–2017) in the same clinical setting.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Neotree-beta MVP-1 included data capture on admission, resuscitation clinical diagnostic and management support and associated educational material. Clinical management advice pages were designed and linked to HCP chosen diagnoses. Neotree was found to be acceptable, feasible and highly usable and the potential for electronic clinical audit data demonstrated.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 12</xref> HCP reported improved perceived ability to deliver quality care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Neotree implementation did not continue at ZCH due to lack of ongoing funding. Identified strategies to optimise implementation included the introduction of a technical support role (suggested title: Neotree Ambassador).</p>
                <p>In November 2018, Neotree was introduced at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital Neonatal Unit, Harare, Zimbabwe, at the request of local clinical teams,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> presenting an opportunity to codevelop and test Neotree in a doctor-led unit within a new LRS with unique health system challenges. Neotree Ambassador roles were included in deployment, discharge data capture was developed, and linkage between clinical and laboratory blood culture data was undertaken to improve management of neonatal sepsis. A second site was identified in Malawi—Kamuzu Central Hospital—for further development and piloting. Since May 2019, we have been further developing Neotree-beta MVP-2 data capture on admission and discharge at this site, codeveloping a data dashboard prototype and assessing usability, acceptability, barriers to implementation, usage and feasibility of both of these functions, using behavioural science frameworks. The data dashboard prototype included a summary statistics page, an admission hypothermia page and monthly morbidity mortality statistics developed using PowerBi.</p>
                <p>Following this work, our priority has been the ongoing development and pilot implementation evaluation of remaining functions of Neotree, to create Neotree-gamma. Neotree-gamma will include data capture (admission, discharge and laboratory); clinical decision support (resuscitation and non-resuscitation diagnosis and management); education; and data transfer to local teams, dashboards and national databases. As HCP complete the admission, they will receive prompts to respond appropriately to the data they have entered and manage patients according to evidence-based guidelines. Neotree works offline to synchronise with a network when available. It is a not-for-profit venture with open-source code and can be preconfigured to adapt to available resources (medication and technology) within the index facility.</p>

Information on potential impact on intervention hospitals will be collected through time-use surveys with all HCP involved in Neotree development and implementation, supplemented with project records on their involvement in different intervention activities, such as software development and training workshops (i.e., opportunity costs). To measure the effect of implementation on time spent on procedures/activities in the delivery of newborn care pathways, a pilot time-use survey will be conducted (implementation phase) at all intervention sites and one comparable site in each setting, to record admission and discharge activities and time spent on each activity for around 10 newborn patients in each hospital (n=30 in total). The tools developed and used for economic data collection will be modified and adopted for future use in a larger trial/evaluation study of Neotree.</p>

These are: Mbuya Nehanda Maternity Hospital (part of the Parirenyatwa hospital group) and Bindura Provincial Hospital. Selection of comparator hospitals was based on geographical proximity and similarities in catchment area and service-level provision to intervention hospitals. Data from paper-based admission forms will be entered retrospectively at these sites onto the Neotree app. In Malawi, aggregate electronic routine case fatality data from representative health facilities will be attained from the Health Management Information System (i.e., from a central hospital, with nurse-led provision and a similar catchment area to Kamuzu Central Hospital).</p>
                <p>Of note, data collected during this pilot implementation phase are insufficient and not designed to test clinical and cost effectiveness—rather they will be used to refine Neotree and to inform a robust evaluation. Primary, secondary, process, quality of care and economic outcomes will be clarified, alongside data collection procedures and our logic model.</p>

                <p>No patients were directly involved in the design of the study. However, this protocol responds to findings from our pilot acceptability and feasibility work in Malawi in 2016, which indicated that HCP were concerned about parent perceptions of the use of Neotree in routine newborn care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> They reported that some parents were ‘afraid they think you are taking the information someplace else’. Student-nurses reported that parents/guardians thought the tablets were a distraction and that ‘we are just on social networks<italic toggle="yes">’</italic>, while others viewed it positively ‘with gladness’.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 26</xref></p>
                <p>In response, this study will explore the acceptability of Neotree via semi-structured interviews with parents/carers across the three implementation sites, to capture patient perspectives. We will also develop a patient and public involvement strategy. This will include working with partners (Art &amp; Global Health Center Africa and the UCL Co-Production Collective) to build the capacity of mothers/carers so that they may support dissemination of study results in catchment areas of intervention hospitals, and coproduce future iterations of Neotree. We will use participatory methods, such as community dialogues, to disseminate study results.</p>

              <p>Few digital interventions in LRS have been well described and rigorously evaluated thus limiting their potential with respect to clinical and implementation effectiveness, sustainability and generalisability. The work described here will allow the completion of codevelopment of Neotree-gamma with key functionalities configured, operationalised, tested and ready for larger scale roll out and evaluation across Zimbabwe and Malawi. Behavioural science theory and frameworks will be used to explore barriers/enablers to implementation and inform intervention refinement and development of strategies to encourage implementation at scale and long term sustainability.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> The economic evaluation will estimate pilot implementation costs and resource requirements for sustainability and scale up, and affordability. Clinical outcome and cost data will inform sample size and potential resources for a large-scale evaluated roll out. It should be acknowledged that the costs and resource use at the pilot hospitals will not necessarily be generalisable to other hospitals, but we hope that the detailed cost analysis alongside the pilot, will provide information to estimate potential costs at scale.</p>
              <p>Our overall vision is to use evidenced-based best practice and information technology to improve clinical decisions for newborn care and increase rates of newborn survival in under-resourced healthcare settings. We aim to create a locally led and curated database of aggregate newborn outcomes that can be used to robustly evaluate health systems, undertake healthcare planning and resource allocation at both the microlevel (by site), regional, national and international levels. In addition, we are committed to open-source code ensuring the Neotree code is freely available for countries and hospitals to adopt, modify and run, and enabling those hospitals and ministries to own and control their data.</p>
              <p>This work addresses a primary sustainable development goal—reducing neonatal mortality in LRS—and addresses key strategic aims of the Every Newborn Action Plan.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our clinical algorithms and linkage to microbiology data aim to optimise the management of leading causes of newborn death. In this study, the care for an estimated 15 000 babies across the three test sites will be impacted by Neotree. Through successful rollout across Zimbabwe and Malawi—the care for nearly 300 000 babies could be improved annually.</p>
