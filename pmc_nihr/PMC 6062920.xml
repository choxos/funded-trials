                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">UK deaths due to chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis have quadrupled over the last 40 years, making this condition now the third most common cause of premature death. Most patients with advanced cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease [ESLD]) develop ascites. This is often managed with diuretics, but if refractory, then the fluid is drained from the peritoneal cavity every 10–14 days by large volume paracentesis (LVP), a procedure requiring hospital admissions. As the life expectancy of patients with ESLD and refractory ascites (if ineligible for liver transplantation) is on average ≤ 6 months, frequent hospital visits are inappropriate from a palliative perspective. One alternative is long-term abdominal drains (LTADs), used successfully in patients whose ascites is due to malignancy. Although inserted in hospital, these drains allow ascites management outside of a hospital setting. LTADs have not been formally evaluated in patients with refractory ascites due to ESLD.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Due to uncertainty about appropriate outcome measures and whether patients with ESLD would wish or be able to participate in a study, a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed. Patients were consulted on trial design. We plan to recruit 48 patients with refractory ascites and randomise them (1:1) to either (1) LTAD or (2) current standard of care (LVP) for 12 weeks. Outcomes of interest include acceptability of the LTAD to patients, carers and healthcare professionals as well as recruitment and retention rates. The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale, the Short Form Liver Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, the EuroQol 5 dimensions instrument and carer-reported (Zarit Burden Interview) outcomes will also be assessed. Preliminary data on cost-effectiveness will be collected, and patients and healthcare professionals will be interviewed about their experience of the trial with a view to identifying barriers to recruitment.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">LTADs could potentially improve end-of-life care in patients with refractory ascites due to ESLD by improving symptom control, reducing hospital visits and enabling some self-management. Our trial is designed to see if such patients can be recruited, as well as to inform the design of a subsequent definitive trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par56">UK deaths due to chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis have quadrupled over the last 40 years, making this condition the third most common cause of premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ascites — an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity — is present in up to 90% of patients with advanced cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], resulting in frequent hospitalisations due to debilitating episodes of pain and breathlessness. In the early stages, this condition can be managed using diuretic therapy, but as the condition progresses (end-stage liver disease [ESLD]) the ascites becomes unresponsive to medical treatment. In the absence of liver transplantation, a diagnosis of refractory ascites confers a median life expectancy of ≤6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par57">End-of-life care in patients with ESLD and refractory ascites has not been a research priority. More than 70% of patients with ESLD die in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], a figure substantially — and in our view unacceptably — higher than that of 40% for patients with terminal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most common palliative management for refractory ascites due to ESLD is large volume paracentesis (LVP), performed every 10–14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This involves a costly 24–48 h hospital admission, insertion of a temporary abdominal drain and removal of up to 15 L of ascitic fluid over 4–6 h. There is simultaneous administration of intravenous 4.5% or 20% (w/v) human albumin solution, 8–10 g per 1 L of ascitic fluid removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Consequently, patients often delay the hospital visits until their ascites is tense and painful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], thus reducing their quality of life (QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Individuals with refractory ascites often have contraindications to alternative invasive procedures such as the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and/or the automated low-flow ascites (ALFA) pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par58">In this feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) we will investigate the use of a simple and less invasive device, the long-term abdominal drain (LTAD), in patients with refractory ascites due to ESLD. This technique involves placing a tunnelled drain through the abdominal wall, with ultrasound guidance, and with the patient under local anaesthetic. Once the drain is in place, the patient’s ascites can be drained in the patient’s usual place of residence. Community nurses or (where willing) carers can then remove smaller volumes (1–2 L) of ascitic fluid in about 5–10 min, usually two to three times a week dependent on patient preference. These devices have been extensively utilised in patients whose ascites is due to advanced malignancy, and they have been shown to be both clinically effective and cost-effective. They have low complication rates and offer improved QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Mullan D, Laasch H-U, Jacob AHH:Tunnelled intraperitoneal catheters in the management of malignant ascites: complications and cost implications [2012], unpublished). In terms of palliative care in refractory ascites due to ESLD, there may be additional benefits, including the involvement of patients and carers in the management of this condition; reduced complications through the regular removal of smaller volumes of fluid; and, importantly, reduced stigma associated with hospital-based LVP (voiced to us as a concern by service users).</p>
              <p id="Par59">Given the relative success of these devices in patients with ascites due to malignancy, there is a clear need for an RCT in ESLD and refractory ascites comparing the use of palliative LTADs to current standard of care (LVP), with end-of-life QOL and cost-effectiveness as major outcomes. LTADs have not been specifically assessed in patients with ESLD because of the potentially increased risks of bleeding (due to coagulopathy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and infections, specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par60">There are additional concerns related to this specific patient group. We do not know whether such individuals would be able or even willing to participate in an RCT, given their potentially higher prevalence of alcohol and substance misuse and other psychosocial issues. Similarly, there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate assessment tools and outcome measures. Finally, given the complex end-of-life care needs of this cohort, concerns remain to patients, carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) over a strategy that moves care away from the hospital to the community. To address these issues we have designed a feasibility study to inform the development of a subsequent definitive RCT.</p>

                <p id="Par61">The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a future RCT of the safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of refractory ascites management using the LTAD against current standard of care (LVP) in patients with ESLD when liver transplant is not an option. This document is based on v6.0 of the protocol (13 October 2017). This multicentre trial has been designed in accordance with phase 2 of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Complex Interventions Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the Method Of Researching End of Life Care guidance (MORECare) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par62">This feasibility RCT is being conducted both at a hospital (the Royal Sussex County Hospital [RSCH], Brighton, Sussex, UK and the Princess Royal Hospital [PRH], Hayward’s Heath, Sussex, UK, both part of the Brighton and Sussex University Hospital [BSUH] National Health Service [NHS] Trust; Worthing Hospital, Worthing, Sussex, UK [Western Sussex NHS Foundation Trust], Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK, Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, UK [Blackpool Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust] and Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK [University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust]) and in a community setting (The Sussex Community Trust). Those randomised to the LTAD will be followed up in the community. This 3-year study is planned to run from September 2015 until September 2018.</p>

Patients will be provided at least 48 h to read the PIS. If willing, consent will be obtained in hospital by a research team member. If the research team is the usual medical team, to avoid any potential conflict of interest, potential participants will be discussed at the weekly liver multidisciplinary meeting (MDM). Capacity to give informed consent will be carefully assessed (see <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">inclusion criteria</xref>). In the event that capacity is lost during the trial, the participant’s nominated consultee will be approached to determine whether the participant should continue in the study. If a consultee has not been nominated or is unavailable, then the participant’s usual medical consultant (independent from the research team) will be consulted to decide whether it is in the participant’s best interests to continue in the study.</p>

The allocations will be made by minimising on (1) centre, (2) Child-Pugh score and (3) gender. No stratification will be utilised. Minimisation will be implemented using an independent system hosted at King’s Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU). Patients will be enrolled by the research team member, who will log into the web-based system and enter patient ID number, recruiting site, gender and Child-Pugh score. The system will automatically generate a confirmation email informing the research team of the outcome of allocation.</p>

                  <title>Group 1: LTAD</title>
                  <p id="Par85">There are two LTADs currently available in the UK: the PleurX™ (UK Medical Ltd., Basingstoke, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) and the Rocket® (Rocket Medical, Watford, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). We have chosen to use the Rocket device (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] primarily because our local clinicians and community nursing teams are already familiar with it. Rocket Medical already has an established training and support programme for local community nurses and care homes. In addition, our earlier experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] suggests that the Rocket devices are easier to insert than the PleurX™ devices and that they require less expensive consumables that can currently be prescribed by community practitioners.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Rocket Medical Long-Term Abdominal Drain in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2779_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                  <title>Procedure for insertion of LTAD</title>
                  <p id="Par86">Insertion of the LTAD will be performed in hospital in a side room, using bedside ultrasound guidance. Insertion will only be performed if, within the week leading up to planned LTAD insertion, haemostatic function (including INR and platelet count) has been checked and blood products administered as necessary. Where INR is &gt; 1.7, patients will receive up to two volumes of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), transfused according to patient weight and INR, immediately prior to drain insertion. Where the platelet count is ≤ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>, patients will be given one to two pools of platelets immediately prior to insertion of the drain.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">To ensure consistency, it would be ideal that all LTADs are inserted at one site (RSCH), but if this is not possible due to patient preference or logistic issues, they will be inserted at local sites, usually by an interventional radiologist.</p>
                  <p id="Par88">The Rocket® LTAD will be inserted using a combination of tunnelled and Seldinger technique as stated in the Rocket® information sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After confirming the location of the insertion site using bedside ultrasound and skin preparation with Chloraprep™ (chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol), a local anaesthetic (up to 10 ml 1% or 2% lidocaine) will be administered at the incision site and along the proposed tunnel tract. A small incision is made where the catheter will enter the abdominal cavity. The introducer needle will be inserted through the incision into the peritoneal cavity and a guide wire is passed through the needle, which will then be removed. A second incision (exit site) will be made approximately 5 cm medial from the first, where the catheter will exit the tunnel. The catheter will be tunnelled from exit site incision to the first incision site with the tunneller, making sure that the cuff is midway between the first and second incision sites. A split-sheath dilator will then be passed over the guide wire, and the inner dilator and guide wire removed, leaving the split sheath in situ.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">The tunneller is then removed from the catheter, which is then passed through the split sheath, separating the split sheath and ensuring that all of the catheter is contained within the peritoneum. The last piece of the split sheath is then removed. The catheter is then adjusted along the tunnel, so the cuff moves towards the exit site, ensuring that any kinks are removed from the catheter. Finally, both incision sites will be sutured (avoiding the catheter) and a dressing applied.</p>
                  <p id="Par90">Participants will receive antibiotic prophylaxis (ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day) or an equivalent antibiotic (if there is a contraindication to ciprofloxacin), dependent on local practice.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">We will provide guidance to the participant and carer (where present) on how to use the LTAD, based on the information previously supplied in the PIS. Participants will also be given an information sheet provided by Rocket Medical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Participants will be referred to their community nursing service. A Rocket Medical discharge letter will be sent to their GPs and the community nursing team. Rocket Medical will also be informed so that they can organise any further support/training for patients, carers and community nurses. In addition, we will arrange for drainage bags to be delivered directly to the participant’s usual place of residence on request by the community nurses.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">The community nurses will visit the participants in their homes and either perform the drainage procedure themselves or supervise the drainage of ascites. The frequency of these visits will depend on the participant’s ascites-related symptoms, but work in ascites due to malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] indicates that two to three visits each week are most commonly required, with approximately 1–2 L of ascites being drained each time. It is recommended that the drainage frequency not exceed three times per week. In the event that participants and/or carers wish to perform self-drainage, they will be trained to do so by the community nurse.</p>
                  <p id="Par93">The Integrated Primary Care Team (IPCT) will closely monitor trial participants allocated to the LTAD arm. We expect that this will happen two to three times a week if the community nurses are performing ascitic fluid drainage.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">For participants who live in a care home or move to a care home (with or without nursing), the follow-up procedure would be the same as for patients who live at home. In such cases we would seek approval from the care home managers. For those requiring hospice care, this would be a temporary stay, since hospices do not generally provide long-term care. Again, permission will be sought from the hospice team to visit the participants for follow-up and only if such visits remain acceptable to the participants.</p>

They will undergo LVP as clinically indicated. LVP involves the insertion of a peritoneal drain for up to 6 h and removal of up to 15 L of ascites. If the total volume of fluid to be removed is &gt; 5 L, intravenous 4.5% or 20% (w/v) human albumin solution, 8–10 g per 1 L of ascitic fluid removed, will be administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par96">As with Group 1, participants will receive antibiotic prophylaxis (ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day or an equivalent antibiotic (if there is any contraindication to ciprofloxacin), dependent on local practice).</p>
                  <p id="Par97">For both groups there will be two weekly visits with a research team member for questionnaire-based and clinical assessments as well as routine clinical blood samples (as discussed in subsequent sections). We anticipate that these two weekly contacts will improve adherence to the protocol.</p>

                <p id="Par98">While participating in this trial, for no individual will routine clinical care be modified or denied whether in the community, primary care or hospital setting. This will include symptomatic relief for pain (including use of opioids), shortness of breath, confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), jaundice or itching. Use of diuretics will be permitted in both groups. As is the current standard of care in patients with ESLD, the use of certain drugs (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides) will be contraindicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par99">Palliative care needs and concerns will be reassessed at each visit for each participant using the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (see subsequent sections). If a high level of specialist palliative care need is identified (as defined within a distress protocol standard operating procedure [SOP]), through the IPOS questionnaire, a research team mini MDM (either face-to-face or virtual) will be convened to agree on the most appropriate way forward. As is standard clinical practice, referrals to a specialist service by the usual healthcare providers can also occur irrespective of any trial assessments or advice. If that occurs, consistent with standard practice, a referral is simultaneously made to a community (district) nurse, if this was not already done for another reason.</p>
                <p id="Par100">It may become necessary, after discussion with the CI and the Trial Management Group (TMG), to remove the LTAD. Reasons for this could include (1) patient request, (2) serious adverse reaction (SAR) assessed by the CI as being directly related to the LTAD and (3) significant deviation from the study protocol with potential for harm (for example the participant not allowing community nurses to enter residence to perform drainage).</p>

Some, like the IPOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (see the following section), are short, relatively brief to complete and have a proxy version if a patient loses capacity during the study. As this is a feasibility study, we will explore the acceptability of the measures used. We will pilot the patient questionnaires comprising the proposed measures with the first eight patients to explore and assess patient fatigue and time taken for completion. We will review the pilot findings and amend the patient questionnaire schedule if indicated, submitting the required Research Ethics Committee (REC) amendment for all proposed changes. The research team member will assist the participants in completion of the questionnaires if needed and if specifically requested by the participant. If participants are too unwell, the questionnaires can be completed by proxy by the carers, to reduce both the participant burden as well as the risk of missing data. Additionally, for those patients allocated to the LVP group, if the hospital visits coincide with questionnaire assessments, the assessments can be done at that point in hospital.</p>

They are validated for clinical practice, audit and research and can be used in any setting. The POS-S captures physical symptom specific information, and “other” symptoms specific to liver disease/ascites can be added, e.g. abdominal bloating. A SOP will be implemented when clinical and/or risk of harm issues are identified to ensure timely assessment by their usual healthcare providers and/or referral to a specialist palliative service depending on needs identified.</p>
                <p id="Par128">A staff version of the IPOS will be used in case participants are unable to complete the questionnaire. The IPOS will be assessed at baseline and two weekly and takes less than 10 min to complete (a total of 10 questions).</p>

For community and home-based services, a modified version of the Ambulatory and Home Care Record (AHCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] will be used and administered by the research team member at baseline and two weekly. The carers will assist with this, especially if the participant is too unwell. The AHCR, a standardised and comprehensive framework and tool, measures resources used within the end-of-life context from a societal perspective. This approach gives equal consideration to costs borne by the health system as well as those costs borne by care recipients and informal caregivers, such as family members and friends. It will take about 20 min to complete. Self-reported data will be verified and supplemented (e.g. for supplies) with reference to nursing records. Data on all hospital use will be gathered from hospital records at the end of the study using a purposefully designed in-house proforma. Service use will be converted to costs using national sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and National Health Service (NHS) reference costs.

                <p id="Par135">Twenty-eight optional interviews (with 20 participants and 8 clinical key informants) will be undertaken by a qualitative researcher, with additional support if needed. Clinicians and research participants will be identified and recruited via the research team member. Patient recruitment will seek to reach a maximum diversity sample of participants, i.e. interview participants with a wide range of demographic characteristics, with purposive sampling (if feasible), informed by the IPOS (given that the individuals of this cohort are living with deteriorating health). The research team member will invite patients to participate in the qualitative interview study and will seek permission to pass contact details (normally telephone number) to the qualitative researcher. The qualitative researcher will contact participants to arrange a convenient time for the interview. As life expectancy in refractory ascites due to ESLD is on average 6 months, the qualitative interview methodology seeks to explore a wide range of patient experiences, recognising that participant beliefs and experiences may change across this period. Interviews will, therefore, be divided into two phases:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par136"><italic>Phase 1</italic> (weeks 0–8) 12 patients (6 from each arm), 4 clinical staff</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par137"><italic>Phase 2</italic> (weeks 9–12) 8 patients (4 from each arm), 4 clinical staff</p></list-item></list></p>

In our pilot study of seven patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], survival post insertion ranged from 6 to 96 days (though the LTADs were inserted late in the disease trajectory). Due to the advanced disease stage of the participants, we are assuming a 50% attrition. The sample size will therefore be increased to 24 participants in each arm, i.e. a total recruitment target of 48 participants.

                  <p id="Par170">If purposive sampling is not feasible, the proportion of participants choosing to participate in qualitative interviews will be noted. Interviews will be audio recorded and labelled using the same anonymous study number as the intervention component of this study. The same number will be used so that in the event of a participant reporting a serious concern about his/her condition or care, the qualitative researcher can raise this concern with the patient’s clinician. In this unlikely event, the researcher will inform the patient of the need to convey this information to the clinician. The qualitative researcher will have access to the clinical study data of the individual if needed.</p>
                  <p id="Par171">Thematic analysis supported by qualitative software (NVivo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] will be used to extract overarching themes from the interviews to capture patients’ experiences and beliefs. Utilising the process of triangulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], the findings of the qualitative arm will be used to inform the quantitative results, particularly in the context of QOL and experience of end-of-life care provision.</p>
                  <p id="Par172">Data will be analysed in a blinded manner. However, the research team members collecting information from the patients will always be aware of their allocation since a high level of scrutiny is necessary to ensure that there are no safety events in the LTAD group. Our service users were also insistent that participants not engage with multiple members of the research team, further excluding blinded data collection.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par181">The impetus for the REduced Drainage Utreatable Cirrhosis (REDUCe) trial was driven by our concerns that patients with ESLD receive suboptimal end-of-life care compared to those with other terminal conditions. Most individuals with ESLD almost always die in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] while receiving end-of-life care, even though in many cases palliative care provided within the community would be more appropriate and compassionate. Such an option is often not feasible due to the complex end-of-life needs of patients with ESLD (including LVP) and the fluctuating disease trajectory making it difficult to define when a palliative phase has been reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Most patients with ESLD develop ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the management strategy in ESLD is thus often dictated by this specific symptom. Our own data suggest that approximately 40% of patients with ascites requiring LVP can go on to develop refractory ascites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This condition has a major impact on the QOL in ESLD, due to factors such as direct physical discomfort but also the need for recurrent hospitalisation for LVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We would argue that for many such individuals these recurrent hospitalisations impair their QOL. A more appropriate option would be to focus on holistic palliative care in the community, based on discussions on future wishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This will require a multidisciplinary approach to the disease, reflected in the composition of the REDUCe study team.</p>
              <p id="Par182">Consistent with the lack of research in this complex cohort of individuals and therefore not unexpectedly, recruitment to this trial has been challenging. We found that clinicians who were not part of the study team were often reluctant, particularly in younger patients, to diagnose ESLD and discuss the implications of a limited life expectancy and purely palliative management. In some instances prospective participants were only identified late and unfortunately died before they could make an informed decision about trial participation. The patients themselves are often vulnerable and (in their opinion) disenfranchised and stigmatised. Finally, setting up new sites for a study that spans both acute hospital and community settings, often without existing research collaborations, has been difficult and time-consuming.</p>
              <p id="Par183">Conversely, we have already begun to note positive changes in attitudes, beliefs and practice of HCP locally and in the study sites. Simply by attempting to discuss the REDUCe trial, we have seen a change in attitudes towards symptom control and QOL as well as timely referral to palliative care. There is also increasing recognition that patients should be able to be more involved in decisions about their end-of-life care. This trial has raised the local profile of these under-researched patients, with wider recognition of the need for MDT communication and collaboration. Specifically, many local hospitals now discuss all patients with ESLD at a weekly liver MDM so as to identify in a timely manner those who are entering the palliative phase of their disease. This has undoubtedly driven the improvement in recruitment. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), acknowledging this and the potential of this study to result in a paradigm shift in end-of-life care in ESLD, has granted a funded extension for a year.</p>

                <title>Authorship eligibility guidelines</title>
                <p id="Par185">Authorship credit will be provided to those individuals who have made a significant contribution to the trial concept and design; data acquisition, interpretation and analysis; and drafting of the manuscript including intellectual content and critical revisions. Therefore the CI, co-investigators, research fellow, members of the BSCTU and all PIs at participating sites will be eligible for authorship credit. However, as is current accepted practice, it will be unacceptable for PIs to independently publish data of individuals whom they have recruited for the study. No data will be released prior to first presentation and or publication without the explicit knowledge and consent of the CI. After discussion within the TMG, it may be deemed appropriate to present interim results at local, national and international meetings and conferences.</p>

                <title>Dissemination plan</title>
                <p id="Par186">Results of this study will be disseminated via local (Regional British Society of Gastroenterology), national (British Association for Study of Liver) and international (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver) meetings. Further dissemination will occur via palliative care conferences (UK Palliative Care Congress, European Association of Palliative Care World Congress, American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine Annual Assembly) and regional research networks and end-of-life groups. We plan to publish our research in high impact hepatology and palliative care journals. Our service user members will play a vital role in research dissemination. We also anticipate providing evidence to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).</p>

                <p id="Par187">The need for protocol amendments will be discussed by the TMG and submitted to the Sponsor for determination of substantial/non-substantial amendment. Substantial amendments will be submitted to the Health Research Authority (HRA) for review. Once a favourable opinion has been given, the BSCTU will be responsible for notifying local sites of the amendment and ensuring that the PI/CI are aware when the implementation can occur.</p>

All study data will either be held on secure university and hospital computers or in a secure and locked location at the BSCTU. Initially patient identifiers will be utilised during randomisation, but subsequently all research participants will be allocated a unique study number that will be recorded on all other data collection forms. Only those individuals directly involved with the research will have access to the study data.</p>
