                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The cost-effectiveness and long-term health impact of behavioural weight management programmes depends on post-treatment weight-loss maintenance. Growing evidence suggests that interventions using acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) could improve long-term weight management. We developed an ACT-based, guided self-help intervention to support adults who have recently completed a behavioural weight loss programme. This study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of this type of intervention and findings will inform the development of a full-scale trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, two-arm, feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation. We will recruit and randomise 60 adults who have recently completed a behavioural weight loss programme to the ACT-based intervention or standard care, using a computer-generated sequence with 2:1 allocation stratified by diabetes status and sex. Baseline and 6-month measurements will be completed using online questionnaires. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subsample of participants and coaches about their experiences at 3 (mid-intervention) and 6 (postintervention) months. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and a full-scale trial will be assessed using a number of outcomes, including adherence to, and engagement with the intervention, recruitment and retention rates, proportion of missing data for each outcome measure, participants’ experiences of the intervention and study, and coaches’ experiences of delivering intervention support. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be integrated and summarised to contribute to the interpretation of the main feasibility evaluation findings. Value of information methods will be used to estimate the decision uncertainty associated with the intervention’s cost-effectiveness and determine the value of a definitive trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The cost-effectiveness and long-term health impact of behavioural weight management programmes depends on post-treatment weight loss maintenance.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Systematic reviews show that most weight is regained within 3–5 years, even after specialist-led behavioural programmes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Extended use of traditional behavioural strategies (eg, self-monitoring, problem solving) can improve weight loss maintenance to some extent,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but new approaches are needed to maximise the benefits of behavioural weight management programmes.</p>
              <p>There is growing evidence to suggest that interventions that incorporate strategies from acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) may be effective for long-term weight control and can improve some psychological determinants of weight loss maintenance.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> However, to date, most studies have been conducted in-person, in a US setting and the cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention has not been evaluated. In addition, ACT-based interventions are usually psychologist led and the cost and scarcity of psychologists specialising in obesity could limit their use in countries with a national healthcare system. There is currently insufficient evidence on the potential scalability of an ACT-based intervention that is delivered remotely to support weight loss maintenance in the UK, including the importance of facilitator expertise and cost-effectiveness. To address this, we developed the Supporting Weight Management (SWiM) programme as a web-based, guided self-help intervention that uses ACT-based treatment and specifically focuses on supporting post-treatment weight loss maintenance. SWiM uses digital technology and non-specialists (referred to here as ‘SWiM Coaches’) to minimise resources needed to deliver an ACT-based intervention at scale. SWiM is intended to be used following completion of a standard behavioural weight management programme (lasting at least 12 weeks), and seeks to reinforce what helped people to lose weight, build on what worked for them, and teach new ACT-based skills and strategies to support them in the longer term.</p>
              <p>The study described in this protocol is designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the SWiM intervention, and inform the development of a full-scale trial. The first section of this protocol describes the feasibility evaluation, which focuses on the feasibility of conducting a full-scale trial comparing SWiM to standard care. The subsequent section describes the embedded process evaluation, guided by the MRC framework for process evaluations of complex interventions in healthcare.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The process evaluation focuses on assessing the implementation of the intervention, identifying the contextual factors that may be associated with variations in implementation and outcomes, as well as exploring the hypothesised causal mechanisms of the intervention. These findings will provide insight into what worked, what did not and why, and enable us to identify and implement further refinements needed to improve the intervention for a future trial.</p>

              <p>This is a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, two-arm, feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Participants will be randomised to either the ACT-based weight maintenance intervention (SWiM) or to standard care, using a computer-generated sequence with 2:1 allocation stratified by diabetes status and sex. This allocation will allow us to observe a reasonable number in the standard care group to gain information about their experiences, estimate retention in this group and assess willingness to be randomised. Participants will complete baseline and 6-month (from baseline) measurement sessions using online questionnaires. A subsample of participants from the standard care and intervention groups, and all coaches, will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews at both 3 months (mid-intervention) and 6 months from baseline (post-intervention). In addition, a subsample of participants who enrol but withdraw from the intervention group will also be interviewed. Qualitative interviews will collect data that will be used to contribute to both the feasibility evaluation and the process evaluation.</p>

                <p>Based on expert stakeholder advice that the specific support needs of the following groups are beyond the remit of this intervention, adults who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible for inclusion:</p>

                </list>
                <p>There are no inclusion or exclusion criteria for body mass index (BMI) in order to be as inclusive as possible. Participants typically require a BMI of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>or higher (or 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> depending on ethnicity) to be eligible for behavioural weight loss programmes. Therefore we do not expect that participants will lose enough weight to reduce their BMI to 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>or less (ie, ‘underweight’) and participate in the SWiM programme. Any potential participants who are underweight would be identified at screening and further assessment would be conducted to determine suitability.</p>
                <p>We expect that some participants may continue to receive weight management support while participating in the SWiM programme (eg, attending groups, using an app to monitor food intake) and we do not wish to exclude these participants. We will collect information on whether participants continue to receive any support from their original behavioural weight loss programme or additional interventions. If participants report that they are receiving a more intense intervention, such as very low calorie diets, or a medical intervention, such as GLP-1 analogues, during the feasibility study, we will judge their eligibility to participate and/or continue on a case-by-case basis. This feasibility study will inform whether further inclusion and exclusion criteria should be implemented prior to a full trial.</p>

                  <p>SWiM is a web-based, guided self-help intervention that uses ACT-based treatment to support adults following the completion of a behavioural weight loss programme. It aims to help them to reflect on what has worked (and not worked) in the past, build on what works for them, and learn new ACT-based skills and strategies to overcome challenges that typically derail weight loss maintenance. The intervention includes access to an online web platform with 14 sessions (‘SWiM sessions’) consisting of psychoeducational content, reflective exercises and behavioural experiments. SWiM consists of weekly sessions for the first 13 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4-week break for participants to reflect and practice their new skills and strategies, then a final session at week 18 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Each session is expected to take around 30–60 min to complete. Participants are encouraged to weigh themselves weekly and to record their weight at the start of each session. Between sessions, participants are asked to complete more reflective exercises and behavioural experiments (called ‘SWiM Practice’). Full details of intervention content have been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>

                  <p>To guide them through the intervention, participants receive four scheduled telephone support calls from a trained, non-specialist ‘SWiM coach’ over the course of the intervention (specialists being defined as professionals with specialist qualifications or registration in weight management, for example, dieticians). Coaches are trained by a member of the research team, who is a practitioner psychologist (RR), and the training was developed by the research team specifically for this study. As part of the training, coaches are asked to: (1) read through a training manual, which includes semistructured scripts to guide telephone calls and (2) attend 3 hours of training with the practitioner psychologist either in person or via video call. The training manual includes an outline of intervention content, underpinning theories of the SWiM programme (ACT and motivational interviewing), a practical guide to conducting telephone support, the procedures for participant withdrawal, information on how to avoid stigmatising language and information for signposting participants to mental health support. The practitioner psychologist training takes coaches through the training manual in detail, provides opportunities for questions and includes role-play of each telephone call script with feedback. Following completion of this training, coaches have the opportunity for one-to-one or group follow-up sessions for further practice or clarifications. Coaches are also asked to complete each session on the SWiM website from the perspective of the participant.</p>
                  <p>Calls are scheduled following completion of sessions 1, 3, 8 and 14. There will also be three additional, optional calls that can be used at any time should the participant want further support from the coach. The role of the coach is to help the participant take ownership of their weight management. Automated email reminders are sent to participants to remind them to complete sessions and calls.</p>

                    <title>Web platform</title>
                    <p>On the SWiM web platform, intervention content is divided into SWiM sessions, which are each divided into activities. Progress through the sessions is presented as a ‘journey’ using a map-like graphic. Star icons light up when activities and sessions are completed. As participants complete core skills and exercises, these are stored in a ‘SWiM Aids’ tab, where they can be accessed without revisiting specific sessions. The web platform allows participants to revisit past sessions and skills, and it is intended that future roll out would include indefinite access to the website. The web platform includes a weight tracker, which generates a line graph that automatically updates as data is inputted by the participant. As part of the first session, participants are asked to enter their prior weight loss, so tha they can see what they have already achieved. The weight tracker automatically sets a weight maintenance target range with a boundary of±3 kg that participants are encouraged to stick within. This boundary can be adjusted if required as weight changes over time. Each session starts with a reflection on the previous session and SWiM practice, and entry of weight data into the tracker.</p>
                    <p>Participants will be given the option of receiving a printed booklet of the website exercises in the post if they prefer to write their answers down, however, they will be encouraged to complete the exercises online as well, so that the coach can provide tailored support.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p>Quantitative analyses will be primarily descriptive. We will describe the number and proportion of participants who are invited to the study, respond, enrol (by recruitment method) and complete outcome assessments. Each of these will be examined for potential biases by gender, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Change from baseline to 6 months for weight and each of the secondary outcomes will be summarised separately within the intervention and standard care groups using mean (SD) or median (IQR). Linear regression will estimate the difference (intervention minus standard care) in mean change in weight from baseline, adjusted for baseline weight and the randomisation stratifiers (diabetes status and sex). Since this is a feasibility study, it is not powered to detect differences between randomised groups or mediation by psychosocial variables. However, it will provide estimates of the SD of weight at baseline and correlation between weight at baseline and weight at 6 months, which will inform the sample size calculation for a full-scale trial.</p>
                  <p>VOI methods will estimate the decision uncertainty associated with the intervention’s cost-effectiveness given the existing evidence base, and will determine the value of a definitive trial, based on ability to reduce decision uncertainty. Using data from the feasibility study, we will undertake a formal, structured elicitation process to elicit expected trial outcomes and uncertainty. We will use the Sheffield Elicitation Framework methods<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and recruit participant experts on the likely effectiveness of the intervention from within the research team and externally. If the elicitation suggests very small effects and a high cost then we might already be certain of poor cost-effectiveness. If it suggests large effects and a small cost, this may be sufficient to suggest the intervention is highly cost-effective. However, and most likely, if the intervention lies somewhere between these scenarios, we will use expected value of sample information to estimate the value of alternative trial designs in reducing uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness estimates. This will help to select an optimal trial design to inform future cost-effectiveness analyses. We currently plan to examine three options for sample size (small, medium, large) and follow-up (1.5, 3, and 5 years), however, the exact details will be developed in an iterative process to support the trial design.</p>

                  <title>Economic analysis</title>
                  <p>Economic analyses (cost-effectiveness analysis, cost–utility analysis) will be undertaken, comparing the incremental costs and effects of the SWiM programme versus standard care. We will conduct a microcosting to estimate resource use for the set-up, delivery and maintenance of the SWiM programme. Resource use estimates will be derived from the literature and informed by feasibility study data, and will be adjusted based on expert input through an informal panel process.</p>
                  <p>Healthcare costs will be calculated as the product of resources used and appropriate unit costs adopting National Health Service (NHS) and personal social service (NHS-PSS) and patientperspectives. Cost components will include the SWiM intervention, primary care (eg, General Practitioner (GP) and nurse visits) and secondary care services (eg, outpatient and hospital admissions). Resource use data will be captured by case report forms (CRF) and a Short Health Economics Questionnaire (SHEQ), the latter also including over-the-counter medications, private visits, travelling and productivity loss. The CRF and SHEQ will be completed at baseline (covering the 3 months before the baseline) and 6 months (covering the 6 months from the baseline) by clinical personnel and patients, respectively. The outcomes used in the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the change in weight over time and HRQOL captured by the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, which will be expressed in quality-adjusted life-years.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Missing data on costs and outcomes are anticipated, and will be handled using multiple imputation methods.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                  <p>Imputed mean cost-effectiveness in each arm will be used to obtain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which will be calculated by dividing the mean cost difference by the mean effectiveness difference. These mean differences will be estimated using regression methods adjusting for HRQOL, costs and any unbalanced variables observed at randomisation. The uncertainty around the incremental cost and incremental effectiveness estimates will be evaluated using non-parametric bootstrapping methods and presented as cost-effectiveness probabilities, estimated as the proportion of the bootstrapped cost and effectiveness pairs with corresponding ICERs below different values of the cost-effectiveness threshold.</p>
                  <p>The economic analysis will also have a feasibility component. This will address whether any important cost components should be added to the analysis, the sources of unit cost data, the extent of missing data and methods for dealing with this, and the feasibility of all analytical methods. Second, the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be combined with the epidemiological information on projected numbers to undertake a VOI analysis to evaluate the potential economic value and acceptability of future research.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>

Interviews will be conducted at both time points for all groups in order to capture changes over the course of the study. Intervention and standard care participants will be purposively sampled using outcome data (broad demographic, range of weight outcomes). Questions will focus on the extent and manner of intervention implementation, challenges experienced, their experiences of the intervention and their remaining needs at the study end. We also aim to interview up to five participants who withdraw from the intervention arm to explore their experiences of the study and intervention. Interviews with coaches will focus on their experiences of delivering the coach support and their training and support needs throughout the study.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative analysis</title>
                  <p>All qualitative data will be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A dual coding approach will used: initial inductive open coding will be carried out to generate themes, followed by a second deductive coding round based on the MRC framework for process evaluations<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> (<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>) and the results of planned quantitative analyses. Both phases of coding will be conducted on each qualitative dataset in succession (eg, interviews, followed by open-text responses of questionnaires). These two stages of analysis will allow the qualitative findings to specifically answer the research questions of the process evaluation, and speak effectively to the questions arising from the quantitative findings, while retaining an integral attention to issues that might otherwise be lost in the qualitative data, or be silent in the quantitative data. In addition, the inductive coding stage ensures that data that does not specifically relate to the MRC framework for process evaluations is not lost.</p>
                  <p>All qualitative data (interview transcripts and open-text responses) will be uploaded into NVivo V.12 (QSR International). Interview data will be analysed first; standard care participant interviews will be analysed to gain an understanding of the experiences of participants who receive standard advice for weight loss maintenance on completion of a behavioural weight management programme. Interviews conducted at mid-intervention (3 months from baseline) and postintervention (6 months from baseline) will be compared within and then between standard care participants to understand how their experiences and needs may have changed over the course of the study period. This process will be repeated for the intervention participant interviews, followed by comparison of findings with the standard care participant interviews for convergence and dissonance in experiences and opinions (eg, standard care participant interviews at 3 months from baseline will be compared with intervention participant interviews at 3 months from baseline, and this process will be repeated for interviews at 6 months from baseline). This will allow us to draw comparisons of experiences and identify how the SWiM intervention may have produced change, compared with standard advice. Next, the interviews with coaches will be analysed and mid- (3 months from baseline) and postintervention (6 months from baseline) interviews will be compared within and between coaches to gain insight into how their experiences and needs may have changed over the course of the study. Coach interviews will then be compared with the participant interviews for convergence and dissonance in views and opinions.</p>
                  <p>A thematic framework will be generated on the basis of the participant interview data and will be used to guide coding for the open-text responses from the postintervention questionnaires, followed by the open-text responses for the remaining qualitative data from the coach support forms (completed by participants), SWiM session feedback questionnaires (completed by participants) and coach call reports (complete by coaches). While coding the open-text responses, the thematic framework will remain open to the integration of new codes identified throughout analysis.</p>

                  <p>Once the quantitative and qualitative datasets have been analysed separately, the findings will be systematically compared with assess the degree of: (1) agreement (convergence), (2) the extent to which findings offer complementary information on the same issue (complementarity) or (3) appear to contradict one another (dissonance), as well as identify areas of ‘silence’, where a theme may be generated from one dataset but not another.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This process will strengthen understanding of the findings and themes generated from each method and dataset, and lead to the generation of meta-themes that cut across the datasets.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Findings will be summarised and displayed in a table, highlighting the different methods used for each component of the MRC framework.</p>

              <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
              <p>Substantial patient and public involvement (PPI) has been sought in the development of the SWiM intervention. The initial ideas and research proposal were reviewed by 22 men and women attending the Fakenham Weight Management Service in Norfolk, England and six members of the University of Cambridge PPI Panel. Once funding was awarded, a Patient User Group Panel (PUGP) was formed, comprising members with diverse experiences of weight loss and weight maintenance. This group helped in development and refinement of the logic model, the intervention content and prototype iterations. Regular meetings were convened during the development phase in order to consult on progress and to feedback to the panel on how their input was incorporated. A series of ‘think aloud’ user testing sessions were completed for the alpha version of the web platform with feedback requested on content, design and functionality. To get feedback on the content from a wider and more diverse audience, remote user testing of the web platform was conducted with the PUGP members and participants from the WRAP study<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> from around the UK.</p>
              <p>To maximise participant engagement and retention, and minimise burden, PPI representatives reviewed the content, design and delivery of participant-facing materials. They will also advise on the content and methods of qualitative interviews and focus groups to ensure sensitivity and to maximise participant engagement.</p>
              <p>A member of the PUGP will review a sample of the interview transcripts for each participant group and coaches, providing input to the analysis and interpretation of the findings. They will be included as a co-author on the qualitative results paper.</p>
              <p>A PPI representative is a member of our Investigator team and has contributed to the design of the protocol and chairs the PUGP. She will contribute to designing and delivering PPI training, preparing ethics and Research and Development submissions, coauthoring journal articles and the final report, disseminating findings to a wide range of audiences and supporting other PPI members.</p>
              <p>Two PPI representatives are members of the Programme Steering Committee (PSC). They will review the final study reports and contribute to the writing of specific sections, such as the lay summary.</p>
              <p>Including PPI perspectives in plans for dissemination will ensure that we access an appropriate range of audiences and communicate messages effectively. PPI representatives will advise on content and methods of dissemination and will review public-facing documents, such as newsletters and press releases.</p>
              <p>PPI representatives will be reimbursed for their time and expenses in a timely manner and tailored PPI training will be provided to suit the specific needs of the individual and their role, guided by INVOLVE Standards for PPI.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

              <title>Programme steering committee</title>
              <p>The PSC will provide overall supervision for the SWiM feasibility study on behalf of the trial sponsors (NHS Cambridgeshire and Peterborough CCG, University of Cambridge) and trial funder (NIHR Clinical Commissioning Facility) and ensure that the project is conducted to the rigorous standards set out in the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The PSC will provide advice to the investigators on all aspects of the trial and will review and agree the trial protocol, the statistical analysis plan and any amendments to the protocol. The PSC will be chaired by Professor Lucy Yardley (University of Southampton), who supersedes Professor Andrew Farmer (University of Oxford). Independent members include Dr Thomas Fanshawe (University of Oxford), Dr Edel Doherty (NUI Galway), Mr Graham Rhodes (PPI representative) and Mrs Hazel Patel (PPI representative) who supersedes Mrs Norma Scullion. This is a low-risk trial with no rules for early stopping and participants and study coordinators are not blind to intervention allocation. Thus, a separate data monitoring committee was not deemed to be necessary.</p>

              <p>Ethical approval was received from Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee on 15 March 2021 (21/EE/0024). At the end of the trial, we will present our findings to our PPI representatives and our stakeholder panel, and we will work with them to refine the intervention and plans for a full-scale trial and to identify appropriate ways to communicate findings to participants and other non-academic audiences.</p>
              <p>All specified analyses will be written up as scientific papers and submitted for publication in peer-reviewed open-access journals. Members of the research team will be involved in reviewing drafts of the manuscripts, abstracts and any other publications arising from the trial. The principal investigators will have final approval on all publications and press releases. Authorship will be determined using International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria.</p>
