                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Reducing bullying is a public health priority. KiVa, a school-based anti-bullying programme, is effective in reducing bullying in Finland and requires rigorous testing in other countries, including the UK. This trial aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of KiVa in reducing child reported bullying in UK schools compared to usual practice. The trial is currently on-going. Recruitment commenced in October 2019, however due to COVID-19 pandemic and resulting school closures was re-started in October 2020.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Design: Two-arm pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with an embedded process and cost-effectiveness evaluation.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants: 116 primary schools from four areas; North Wales, West Midlands, South East and South West England. Outcomes will be assessed at student level (ages 7–11 years; n = approximately 13,000 students).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par34">Bullying in childhood is one of the most tractable public mental health problems facing young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is generally defined as a pattern of ‘unwanted, aggressive behaviour … that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power’ Olweus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The psychiatric morbidity arising from bullying is substantial; population studies suggest that 25–40% of mental health problems including depression, anxiety and self-harm in young adults may be attributable to childhood bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Bullied children access more school health, primary care and specialist child mental health services than their counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and experience poor mental health into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Bullying is also associated with school absenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] impacting future educational attainment and employment prospects. Children who bully are also at risk of harm and more likely to show later violent behaviour and illicit drug use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">This paper describes the protocol for a two-arm pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled Trial (RCT) trial with an embedded process and cost effectiveness evaluation of the Kiusaamisen Vastaan (“KiVa”) anti-bullying programme, the most widely used bullying prevention programme across Europe. In a Finnish RCT (2007–2009) in 234 schools, KiVa significantly reduced bullying and victimisation among 7 to 11-year-old students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] across all forms of bullying, including verbal, physical, racist, and cyber-bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and reduced anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since 2009, KiVa has been scaled up into over 90% of Finnish public schools (approximately 2700 schools) and demonstrated year on year positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A cost-effectiveness analysis reported an increased cost of €829 for a gain of 0.47 victim-free years per student, and a cost per QALY gained of €13,823 considered cost-effective when compared to the Swedish health policy threshold of around €50,000 per QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">Unlike the UK, Finland’s education system has negligible attainment differences between schools: no selection, tracking or streaming during basic education and highly educated primary school teachers with a mandatory five-year master’s degree qualification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Finland is also one of the wealthiest countries in the world and has less income inequality than the United Kingdom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm">https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm</ext-link>). It is, therefore, not certain that KiVa intervention effects will transfer to the UK context. KiVa trials in Italy and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found reduced levels of bullying and victimisation with variable effect sizes. A small pilot study in Wales however found no statistically significant reduction in victimization and bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">The Stand Together RCT is being conducted in UK primary schools with students aged 7 to 11 years, and will include a comprehensive process and health economic evaluation.</p>

                <title>Informed consent</title>
                <p id="Par54">At recruitment, head teachers were asked to confirm that they had discussed the project with school staff and provide informed consent for their school’s participation in the research. Teaching staff completing self-reported outcomes provided informed consent for their own involvement. Information about the trial was provided to parents and, whilst parents are not able to withdraw their child from the KiVa intervention, they have been given the right to withdraw their child from the research trial and any subsequent data collection. Children will provide their assent for student-level self-report outcomes at each data collection point. If children indicate that they do not assent, either verbally or otherwise through their behaviour, their data will not be collected. Prior to the 12 month follow-up, all parents will receive a letter detailing the plans to link their child’s trial data to data held by the Department for Education, National Pupil Database (NPD). Parents will have the opportunity to opt-out of this activity without it impacting on their child’s continued participation in the trial. For the process evaluation, a sub-set of staff, children and parents will be invited to take part in interviews for which separate consent (for adults) and assent (for children) will be obtained.</p>

              <sec id="Sec12">
                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par55">The sample calculation was based on previous research (reduction from 18 to 14% in rates of victimisation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and a similar baseline victimisation rate of 18% from a UK based pre-post study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To achieve a 4% absolute reduction (22% relative reduction), 3520 students are required to power an individual level trial at 90% power and a 5% significance level. This equates to an effect size (odds ratio) of 1.35 which is of public health significance and broadly in line with effects achieved from other KiVa trials and the wider literature on bullying and victimisation. The effect size for which this trial is powered is within the mid-range of other relevant KiVa studies, which range from 1.22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to 1.47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">The study will take account of clustering. In the Finnish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] the school level intra-cluster correlation (ICC) for the comparison of KiVa and UP in self-reported victimisation was 0.02 at the 12-month follow-up. An average cluster size of 111 students in Years 3 to 5 is assumed, based on recruiting students from three-year groups (years 3, 4, 5) with an average 27.8 students per class (based on 2018 KS2 figures from English schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]), and an average 1.34 classes per year group (based on data from the UK KiVa pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). A UK study (based on 114 schools) reported an ICC of 0.016 and an average cluster size of 108 Clarkson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par57">Assuming 111 students in Years 3 to 5, an ICC of 0.02, and allowing for one school dropout per arm, 10% student dropout due to either opt-out or loss to follow-up, an 18% rate of victimisation, and a relative reduction of 22%, a trial involving 116 schools (58 per arm) would provide 90% power at a 5% significance level (a total of 12,828 students).</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p id="Par59">Schools were informed of their allocation after teacher baseline data was collected. Whilst all attempts were made to inform schools of their allocation after all children’s baseline data are collected, this was not possible in approximately 60% of schools due to COVID-19 related time constraints. However, there should have been no visible signs or KiVa related changes for the children during the academic year (2020/21). Comparison of data collected prior and subsequent to allocation notification will determine if this had any impact on our primary outcome.</p>
                <p id="Par60">After baseline data collection, students, teachers, trial managers, the intervention delivery team (trainers) and researchers involved in the process and cost-effectiveness evaluation will not be blind to intervention status. It is practically impossible to maintain a blind for fieldworkers as the KiVa interventions includes prominent displays around the schools, but the trial statistician will remain blind to allocation status.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par61">KiVa is an acronym for ‘Kiusaamista Vastaan’ which, translated, means ‘against bullying’; ‘kiva’ is also the Finnish adjective for ‘nice’. KiVa is an evidence-based programme developed in Finland for children aged 7 to 15 years, the age range for children in Finnish comprehensive schools. Its development and evaluation were funded by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture in 2006, following the lack of change in bullying prevalence after several legislative changes, over 10 years, requiring schools to have anti-bullying policies. Its development and evaluation were commissioned from Professor Salmivalli and colleagues at Turku University.</p>
                <p id="Par62">KiVa is based on research demonstrating that ‘bystanders’ – children who are present during bullying but not actively involved – can contribute to the maintenance of bullying by assisting or reinforcing the perpetrator’s behaviour, giving them a position of power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Defending the victim, on the contrary, can help to make bullying an unsuccessful strategy for attaining high social status. By influencing the behaviour and norms of all students, the social rewards gained by perpetrators are reduced and, consequently, their motivation to bully.</p>
                <p id="Par63">The KiVa programme is informed by a social architecture model of bullying, which demonstrates the significant roles of the bystanders in supporting or standing against bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The KiVa programme has two distinct components; universal and indicated actions. Universal whole-school interventions, promoting school-wide change are most effective at reducing bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and likely to provide a non-stigmatising approach to prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Universal actions at the class and school level to prevent bullying help students to recognise bullying, providing them with safe way of responding to incidents, and teaching them to empathise with, and support, victims. The curriculum is grouped into 3 units for students aged 7–9, 10–12 (KS2) and 13–15 years (KS3) respectively. Other universal actions include posters for school corridors, high-visibility vests for break-time supervisors to highlight the presence of supervision, and a parent’s guide. A trained KiVa team carry out indicated actions using scripted strategies, procedures, and documentation for addressing confirmed cases of bullying with both victims and bullies.</p>
                <p id="Par64">The intervention delivery is over one full academic year, however, the programme is designed to be embedded in ongoing school practice. Although the lesson plans target KS2 classes the programme is introduced to all staff, parents and students and is visible across the school. The manualised curriculum targets students in Years 3 and 4 (Unit 1), and Years 5 and 6 (Unit 2). Each unit contains ten structured 90-min lessons, typically delivered fortnightly as twenty 45-min lessons throughout the school year by class teachers. The curriculum encourages student engagement via oral presentations, role-play, videos, group work and whole class activities. Online games that support lessons can be played at home or in school. A trained KiVa team (2 to 3 staff members) address confirmed bullying incidents using the structured and scripted indicated actions.</p>
                <p id="Par65">Intervention school training will be provided in June 2021 prior to the academic year in which implementation starts. Accredited KiVa trainers at each site will deliver training courses for the intervention schools (approximately 8 schools per training) and offer additional support over the course of the implementation year. Two members of the teaching/management team from each intervention school will attend a local two-day training and then lead school-wide implementation.</p>

                <title>Comparison</title>
                <p id="Par66">Comparison schools will continue with standard anti-bullying practice. The mandatory curricula in Wales and England aim to develop students’ pro-social values and attitudes and empower participation in school and community life as responsible citizens. Comparison schools will continue to use existing methods to cover this curriculum, and to address bullying. No other programme or strategies will be prohibited during the trial, so that there is no interference with UP which may vary across comparison schools (e.g., in terms of curriculum, school policies, skills and interests of teaching staff). This will be recorded via annual checklists describing: a) existing policies and practices to prevent and deal with bullying; and b) any changes to policies and practices during the trial period to enable better understanding of UP and supplement and inform the process and economic evaluations.</p>

                  <p id="Par73">The primary study outcome is student self-reported victimisation, measured by responses on the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (OBVQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the most widely used bullying survey in the world and used in Finland and internationally for KiVa trials, enabling comparison across trials. The OBVQ measures different forms of bullying, including verbal, physical, relational and cyber-bullying. The global item: “How often have you been bullied at school in the last couple of months?” will be used to measure victimisation. Students respond on a five-point scale (0 = “not at all”, 1 = “once or twice”, 2 = “2 or 3 times a month”, 3 = “about once a week”, 4 = “several times a week”). Each item will be analysed continuously and dichotomised with those scoring 2 to 4 classified as victimised and those scoring 0 to 1 as not victimised. This categorisation is conceptual (bullying concerns <italic>repeated</italic> acts), but supported by empirical research showing large and highly significant psychometric differences between these two groups on internalising problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

To assess fidelity of indicated actions, each school will be asked to complete a termly checklist which captures the extent to which bullying incidents have been dealt with in line with the KiVa strategies, procedures and documentation.

Interviews will explore staff experiences of, and key factors affecting implementation, its perceived value for their professional roles and schools, facilitators of, and barriers to, its integration within school systems and whether adoption of KiVa has led to changes in, or discontinuation of, other activities/policies. Staff will be asked about their receipt of intervention training and support, their confidence in dealing with bullying and the extent to which they perceive their school as having a strategy for bullying following KiVa adoption.</p>

This will involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Statistical analysis will be performed in Stata (version 63 or higher). All analyses will be intention to treat (ITT) (i.e., students will be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of adherence to intervention) and missing outcome data will not be replaced (all main statistical analysis will be conducted on complete cases). Between-group comparisons will be presented with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI). As the trial includes a reasonable number of clusters, the analysis will be based on the individual student, allowing for clustering between students within school using robust standard errors. Analyses will control for the school level stratification variables (geographical area, school size, proportion of students eligible for Free School Meals (FSM)). Key student characteristics (age, sex) will also be controlled for.</p>

However, KiVa has been trialled in several countries (e.g., Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and found to be effective (with varying levels of effectiveness), and it is unlikely to be detrimental. KiVa is presently one of only four bullying interventions with a Blueprints for Violence Prevention classification as having evidence of effectiveness (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blueprintsprograms.com">http://blueprintsprograms.com</ext-link>).

                <p id="Par146">The study has been approved by the Bangor University Psychology Research Ethics and Governance Committee (2019–16592). Headteachers provided written consent for the participation of their schools in the study. Teaching staff completing self-reported outcomes provide written informed consent for their own involvement. Parents are provided with information about the trial and can opt their child out of the research study via electronic opt-out. Children provide electronic informed consent for student-level self-report outcomes at each data collection point. For the process evaluation, a sub-set of staff, children and parents will be invited to take part in interviews for which separate oral informed consent (for adults) and electronic informed assent (for children) will be obtained.</p>

                <p id="Par148">The authors declare that as part of the initial introduction of KiVa to the UK, JH and SC were licensed as KiVa trainers and received some funding for the training activity that has helped in the initial recruitment of schools and dissemination of KiVa in the UK. However, there is now a licensed training agency, the Children’s Early Intervention Trust (registered charity number 1120056) that oversees a trainer team and neither JH or SC would be involved in training schools recruited to this trial.</p>
