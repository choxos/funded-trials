                  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Primary outcomes were 12-months change in children's BMI z-score and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY). Secondary outcomes included changes in children's physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption and quality of life, parents' BMI and mental well-being, family eating/activity, parent-child relationships and parenting style.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>115 families (128 children) were randomised to FFH (n=56) or UC (n=59). There was no significant difference in BMI z-score 12-months change (0.114, 95% CI −0.001 to 0.229, p=0.053; p=0.026 in favour of UC with missing value multiple imputation). One secondary outcome, change in children's waist z-score, was significantly different between groups in favour of UC (0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29). Economic evaluation showed that mean costs were significantly higher for FFH than UC (£998 vs £548, p&lt;0.001). Mean incremental cost-effectiveness of FFH was estimated at £552 175 per QALY.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Childhood obesity represents a major public health burden. Although trends may now be reversing in England,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> prevalence remains high. In 2014–2015, 33.2% of children in year 6 (10–11 years) were either overweight or obese.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Childhood overweight and obesity have been linked to immediate and long-term physiological and psychological health risks,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> including type 2 diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease in adulthood.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>A review of 64 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for childhood obesity concluded that family-based interventions combining dietary, physical activity and behavioural components produce significant improvement.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In children under 12 years, involving parents was useful. Family-based interventions for childhood obesity are being offered, but they rarely cover parenting skills.</p>
              <p>‘Families for Health’ (FFH) is a manualised group-based family intervention for overweight or obese children aged 6–11 years. The programme places more emphasis on parenting skills, relationship skills and emotional and social development than other UK interventions. A pre-post pilot of 27 children showed mean reductions in body mass index (BMI) z-scores sustained at 9 months (−0.21, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.07, p=0.007) and 2 years (−0.23, 95% CI −0.42 to 0.03, p=0.027),<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>In a multicentre RCT in overweight or obese children aged 6–11 years, with parallel economic and process evaluations, families were randomised to FFH (target 60 families) or usual care (UC) (target 60 families) (ISRCTN45032201). Randomisation, via a central telephone registration and randomisation service of Warwick Clinical Trials Unit, was stratified by locality using biased coin (p=2/3) minimisation to ensure approximately equal-sized arms. Families could not be blinded to treatment allocation, but every effort was made to ensure that allocation remained unknown to researchers.</p>

Sites A and C were relatively more deprived, whereas site B was less deprived (IMD 2015 rank out of 326 Local Authority Districts, where one is the most deprived: site A 55, site B 249, site C 14).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Sites A and C also had greater ethnic diversity (% white ethnicity: site A 73.8%, site B 92.6%, site C 67.9%).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
                <p>Eligible families had an overweight (≥91st centile for BMI) or obese (≥98th centile for BMI) child aged 6–11 years, based on the UK 1990 definition<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>; and at least one parent or guardian willing to take part. Families were excluded if parent or child had insufficient command of English; the child had recognised medical cause of obesity or was unable to participate due to severe learning difficulties and/or behavioural problems. We aimed to recruit 40 families from each of three sites, using active and passive recruitment methods.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Active recruitment methods were via letters to families with an eligible child identified by the National Child Measurement Programme and by referrals from healthcare professionals, including dietitians and general practitioners (GPs). Passive recruitment methods were via the local media (newspapers and radio); flyers and posters at schools, GP surgeries and other community venues and attending public events.</p>

                <p>The FFH intervention (V1) was developed by Candida Hunt and the University of Warwick team (SS-B, WR). Following evaluation in the pilot,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the programme underwent minor modifications and it is FFH V2 that was delivered in this RCT. The changes in V2, implemented based on parents' feedback, were the reduction in length from 12 to 10 weeks, the addition of two follow-up sessions, enhanced information on healthy eating and the distribution of pedometers. The FFH V2 manualised programme comprises 10 weekly 2½-hour sessions, with children and parents from 8 to 12 families attending parallel groups. The programme combines information on parenting skills, social and emotional development as well as healthy eating including portion size and physical activity. The plan was to run six FFH courses (two in each site). Parenting components, based on the Nurturing Programme from Family Links,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> aimed to increase parental capacity to implement and maintain lifestyle changes. Further details of the FFH intervention are available.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
                <p>Four facilitators, as pairs in the children's and parents' groups, ran each programme following a 4-day Family Links training course. Facilitators were selected for their personal attributes, including previous relevant experience. Professional backgrounds included community nursing, teaching, youth work, leisure services and nutritionists. We aimed to assign families to groups within 3 months of randomisation, and invited both parents and all overweight and non-overweight siblings in the target age range. Each group ran on a Saturday in a leisure/community centre. Additional sessions were planned for 1 month and 3 months post-intervention.</p>

We report cost-effectiveness results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), calculated as the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean outcomes (QALYs or change in BMI z-score between baseline and 12 months) between the trial comparators. The non-parametric bootstrap method was used to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves at alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds relevant to decision-makers. Secondary analyses adopted a wider societal perspective for economic costs. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the impact of uncertainty surrounding aspects of the economic evaluation, while subgroup analyses were conducted for the main cost-effectiveness results to explore the effects of trial population heterogeneity.

Of the 194 families assessed for eligibility, 79 were excluded (reasons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514F1">figure 1</xref>). Recruitment took 24 rather than 12 months. Six families withdrew from the trial, four at 3 months and two at 12 months. Reasons for withdrawal were illness, bereavement, child starting secondary school and wanting to manage weight on their own, child disliking study measurements, family feeling the study wasted their time and no reason. Twenty-four families were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. There was 80% retention of families at 3 months and 72% retention at 12 months, with greater loss to follow-up in the UC arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Intervention delivery and attendance</title>
                <p>To recruit sufficient families, seven rather than six FFH programmes were delivered. Three FFH programmes ran for 10 weeks as planned and four for 9 weeks (reasons for session cancellations: bad weather (2); shortage of facilitators (1); poor attendance (1)). Minor adaptations were made by facilitators during delivery. Difficulties in delivery related to small group size and broad age range. Of the 56 families randomised to FFH, 21 (37.5%) waited over 3 months to join a group, mostly due to getting a viable number of families together to run the group at a specific site.</p>
                <p>Families allocated to FFH were more likely to have attended at least one session than those allocated to UC (42/56, 75.0% vs 24/59, 40.7%; p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514F1">figure 1</xref>). In the FFH arm, 62.5% (35/56) of families completed at least five sessions. FFH was well received by attendees with over 90% of parental ratings of the weekly sessions ‘good’ or ‘great’. Topics receiving the most positive comments were food labelling, coping with stress and building self-esteem.</p>

                <title>Baseline characteristics</title>
                <p>With the exception of SES, where the FFH group had higher overall status than the UC group, baseline characteristics were similar (<xref rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514TB2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Eleven families had two or more children participating in the trial. Children from ethnic minority families, single parent families and families where parents were unemployed were a higher proportion of the children recruited than would have been expected from 2011 census data for the localities.</p>

                  <p>At 3-month follow-up, within-group analysis showed that the mean BMI z-score was not statistically different from baseline for UC (−0.042, 95% CI −0.089 to 0.004) or FFH (−0.019, 95% CI −0.093 to 0.054), with no difference between trial arms (p=0.593).</p>
                  <p>There was also no difference between trial arms in mean change in BMI z-score from baseline to 12 months, using unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjusted: 0.114, 95% CI −0.001 to 0.229, p=0.053) (<xref rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514TB4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514F2">figure 2</xref>). Within-group analysis showed that BMI z-score was significantly reduced in the UC arm at 12 months (−0.118, 95% CI −0.203 to −0.034, p=0.007), with no change in the FFH arm (−0.005, 95% CI −0.085 to 0.078, p=0.907). The multiple imputation analysis yielded a very similar estimated treatment difference with a significantly greater reduction in BMI z-score in the UC arm than in the FFH arm (0.113, p=0.026). There was also a significantly greater reduction in BMI z-score in the UC arm (0.134, 95% CI 0.008 to 0.259, p=0.037) in an unplanned secondary analysis adjusting for ethnicity and SES in addition to baseline outcome, gender and locality. Results for the change in children's waist z-score were significantly different between groups in favour of UC, although the change in per cent body fat was not significantly different (<xref rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514TB4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Parent's BMI and per cent body fat showed no significant change (<xref rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514TB4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p>

                <p>Mean (SE) total NHS and personal social service costs over the follow-up period were estimated at £998 (£72) for the FFH group compared with £548 (£73) for the UC group: the cost difference was £450 (bootstrap 95% CI £249, £650; p&lt;0.001). Among children with complete costs and QALY data over the trial follow-up period, FFH was associated with a mean incremental cost of £512 and mean incremental QALYs gained of 0.0009, generating an ICER of £552 175 per QALY gained, far exceeding accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds for an additional QALY.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARCHDISCHILD2016311514F3">figure 3</xref> indicates that, regardless of the value of the cost-effectiveness threshold, the probability that the FFH programme is cost-effective does not exceed 40%. If decision-makers are willing to pay £20 000 for an additional QALY, the probability that the FFH programme is cost-effective is approximately 28%. The economic evaluation remained robust to the choice of study perspective, expression of cost-effectiveness and sensitivity and subgroup analyses exploring the impacts of uncertainty and heterogeneity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">web appendix 1</xref>).</p>

              <p>FFH is designed to increase parenting skills, support family lifestyle change and help children manage their weight. This trial found no difference between trial arms in the change in BMI z-score at 12 months and within-group analysis hinted at the possibility that children in the UC group did better than those allocated to FFH. This was despite higher attendance at FFH than UC, and the FFH programme being rated highly by parents. There was no clear distinction between groups in the changes reported at 12 months by parents from interview data.</p>
              <p>FFH was significantly more costly than UC to deliver, mainly because it required separate groups for parents and children, which UC did not. The results of the economic analysis indicate that FFH is unlikely to be cost-effective.</p>
              <p>The FFH pilot results<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> were not replicated in this trial, and consideration of the reasons is warranted. Other trials of children's lifestyle interventions have also failed to replicate pilot successes (eg, Kipping <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and Croker <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The difficulties encountered during delivery were not more than would be expected if delivering such an intervention routinely. It may be that scaling up the intervention attenuated its effects. In the pilot study, the intervention was delivered by a small team of four experienced facilitators at one site, and so there may have been some reduction in facilitator skills in the RCT when run at scale across three sites by 17 facilitators mostly new to delivering the programme. Additionally, when evaluating the programme in the context of an RCT, a proportion of families had to wait for a viable group to form because one-half of the families were allocated to the control arm, whereas this did not happen in the pre-post pilot. Alternatively, the pilot study may have been a chance false-positive result.</p>
              <p>The parenting components of FFH were based on the Family Links Nurturing Programme (FLNP).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A trial of FLNP was completed during the FFH trial,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> finding no evidence of effectiveness as a universal programme. Other parenting interventions for obesity show mixed results. In an RCT of Lifestyle Triple P (Positive Parenting Programme) with children aged 4–11 years in Australia, BMI z-score reduced by −0.11 at the end of the 12-week programme and −0.19 at 1-year follow-up, in contrast to a reduction of −0.01 for the waiting list control.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, a Dutch study with children aged 4–8 years showed no significant differences in children's BMI z-score between Lifestyle Triple P and the control at 4 and 12 months.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The value of a parenting component to family-based childhood obesity interventions may depend on the baseline parenting styles in trial families. In our study trial, families had good baseline parenting skills, so there was less room for improvement. Families in the trial were also more from ethnic communities, single parents and where parents were unemployed, compared with census data for the localities, which potentially could have impacted on effectiveness and generalisability of the findings to other geographical areas.</p>
              <p>The limitations of the study need to be explored to provide lessons learnt for future research, and specifically for RCTs of complex interventions. The pre-post pilot maybe was an inadequate study design to inform the decision to proceed to a full-scale trial. Instead, a pilot RCT would have highlighted potential difficulties with recruitment and with running the intervention in a trial setting, and would have required further thought about the control arm. The decision to compare FFH with ‘UC’ across three sites within the West Midlands meant that the control arm had very varied interventions, which had been developed and improved to suit the needs of their local communities during the time taken to obtain funding and set up the trial. In effect, we did not have a ‘no treatment’ control group. The length of time it took to recruit 115 families (five less than the target) to the trial was grossly underestimated. Only a third of trials recruit the target number within the time specified and around a third have extensions,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and so this issue is not unique to our study. Campbell <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> identified that three factors were observed in trials that recruited successfully: having a dedicated trial manager, being a cancer or drug trial and having interventions that were only available within the trial. In the current study, we did have a trial administrator, but the UC interventions were available outside of the trial setting, and of course this is a lifestyle intervention. Future research needs to factor in more realistic recruitment targets, and incorporate further strategies to improve recruitment.</p>
              <p>We conclude that FFH is neither effective nor cost-effective for the management of obesity. This trial does not support local or national implementation of FFH.</p>
