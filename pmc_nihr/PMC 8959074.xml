                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">High-flow nasal therapy is a non-invasive form of respiratory support that delivers low-level, flow dependent positive airway pressure. The device can be better tolerated by patients than alternatives such as continuous positive airway pressure. The primary objective is to determine if prophylactic high-flow nasal therapy after tracheal extubation can result in an increase in the number of days alive and at home within the first 90 days after surgery, when compared with standard oxygen therapy. The co-primary objective is to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of high-flow nasal therapy vs standard oxygen therapy at 90 days, from the view-point of the public sector, the health service and patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is an adaptive, multicentre, international parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with embedded cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of high-flow nasal therapy with control in patients at high risk of respiratory complications following cardiac surgery. Participants will be randomised before tracheal extubation and allocated either high-flow nasal therapy or standard oxygen therapy for a minimum of 16 h immediately post extubation. Participants will be followed up until 90 days after surgery. The total sample size needed to detect a 2-day increase in DAH90 with 90% power with an intention to treat analysis is 850 patients. The adaptive design includes an interim sample size re-estimation which will provide protection against deviations from the original sample size assumptions made from the single-centre pilot study and will allow for a maximum sample size increase to 1152 patients.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Evidence to support routine use of high-flow nasal therapy will inform the development of effective enhanced recovery care bundles. Reducing complications should reduce length of stay and re-admission to hospital and provide an important focus for cost reduction. However; high-quality studies evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of high-flow nasal therapy after cardiothoracic surgery are lacking.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par56">Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at significant risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) that may lead to prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The incidence of respiratory complications is three to four times higher in patients with intrinsic respiratory disease and lower airway obstruction (including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), obese patients or current heavy smokers (&gt; 10 pack years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These patients make up around one quarter of those undergoing cardiac surgery, often developing lower respiratory tract infections with impaired oxygenation/ventilation and require prolonged ventilatory support. They are more likely to require postoperative escalation of respiratory support and readmission ICU during recovery from surgery stay longer in hospital and be re-admitted to hospital after discharge due to ongoing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par57">High-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNT) is increasingly used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It delivers low level, flow-dependent positive airway pressure, and is much better tolerated by patients than alternatives such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients can talk, eat, drink and walk whilst using HFNT. However, there is equipoise regarding its prophylactic use to prevent postoperative respiratory complications (as opposed to treating complications where good evidence current exists) and effect on important patient-centred outcomes, hence the rationale for this study.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Recent systematic reviews in non-cardiac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and cardiothoracic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] concluded that HFNT could reduce the need for respiratory support and pulmonary complications, and could be safely administered. The most recent meta-analysis published in 2017, examined the efficacy and safety of HFNT after cardiac surgery compared with conventional oxygen therapy and found that post-extubation application of HFNT was associated with a significant reduction in escalation of respiratory support (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.82; <italic>z</italic> = 3.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the few studies analysed meant methods used to detect publication bias were underpowered. In addition, definitions, strategies and criteria for escalation of respiratory support in studies included in the meta-analysis were non-specific, making validity of the results questionable. Therefore authors recommended that large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were needed.</p>
                <p id="Par59">Our group performed a single-centre randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of HFNT on clinically relevant outcomes in cardiac surgical patients with pre-existing lung disease [including COPD or asthma] or a higher risk for pulmonary complications (including obesity (BMI &gt; 35 kg.m<sup>2</sup>), recent respiratory tract infections (in preceding four weeks) or current heavy smoking) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Prophylactic use of HFNT in these cardiac surgical patients at higher risk for pulmonary complications was well tolerated with a compliance of 75% in the treatment arm receiving treatment (defined as a minimum of 16 h of randomised treatment), with 12% crossover from standard oxygen therapy (SOT) to HFNT and 25% crossover from HFNT to SOT. In total, 99% of patients provided outcome data at 90 days. We demonstrated a 2-day reduction in the median length of hospital stay (median (IQR [range]) 7 (6–9 [4–30]) days in the high-flow nasal oxygen group and 9 (7–16 [4–120]) days in the SOT group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), a reduction in the geometric mean of length of hospital stay by 29% (95% CI 11-44%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) re-admission rate (1/49 in the HFNT group vs. 7/45 in the SOT group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This pilot study provided evidence of feasibility and pilot data to help power and design the larger NOTACS multicentre study.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Hospital and ICU stay are likely to form a large portion of the total cost of patient care and therefore provide an important focus for cost reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However; no studies on HFNT in cardiothoracic surgery have yet provided adequate costing. Whilst related economic papers in the wider literature (pre-term infants, ICU patients) appear to support the potential for cost saving, significant caveats are given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The proposed study will provide not only the first primary data on the cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of HFNT for adult cardiac surgery, but it may also be of interest for HFNT after other types of major operations, such as major abdominal and thoracic surgery.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Burden of disease</title>
                  <p id="Par61">Figures from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] show that, over the last 7 years, an average of 36,505 patients a year underwent cardiac surgery in the UK. Around 26% of these patients would have fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and qualified as high risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and prolonged hospital stay. This equates to approximately 9500 patients at risk for postoperative pulmonary complications per year in the UK.</p>

                <sec id="Sec5">
                  <title>Why this research is needed now</title>
                  <p id="Par62">Enhanced recovery after cardiac surgery is an emerging and important concept in perioperative care, designed to reduce complications, hospital stay and health service and resource use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Evidence to support the routine use of HFNT will inform the development of effective enhanced recovery care bundles. However, before the intervention is recommended for routine NHS use in cardiac surgery patients at high risk of pulmonary complications, the hypothesis that HFNT improves patient-related outcomes and is cost effective in a UK setting needs to be tested.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Potential NHS cost savings</title>
                  <p id="Par63">Data from the pilot study showed that patients, at high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications receiving prophylactic HFNT stayed on average 2 days less in hospital and ICU re-admission was reduced from 15% to 2% when compared to similar high risk patients receiving SOT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If this pilot data is extrapolated to the eligible UK population, there is the potential to save 19,000 hospital bed days and 1235 re-admissions to ICU each year, each with a median ICU stay of 4 days (the target set by the Getting it Right First Time [GIRFT] cardiothoracic report was 3.2 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Such savings in ICU and surgical ward bed days would allow either more patients to be treated within the same cardiac surgery resource in the same number of in-patient beds or alternatively allow a reduction in capacity in NHS cardiac surgery beds, thus freeing up resources to treat other patients (termed ‘notional financial opportunity’ in the GIRFT cardiothoracic surgery report). Using cost data from the GIRFT report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], this new intervention could potentially achieve an NHS cost saving of £6,935,000 per year in surgical ward bed days (at a cost of £365 per day) and a further saving, from reduced readmission to critical care, of £6,224,000 (£1260/day, median 4 days and 1235 re-admissions) per year.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par107">HFNT is increasingly used as a non-invasive form of respiratory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The device provides warmed humidified oxygen mixed with air and has been shown to assist breathing and improve patient recovery. It reduces work of breathing by improving respiratory mechanics and generation of low level positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and also inhibits bronchomotor response and reduces bronchospasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The generation of PEEP level of 3–5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O may also reduce postoperative atelectasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This reduces postoperative hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and pulmonary morbidity, which means complications due to acute exacerbation of chronic lung conditions are potentially reduced.</p>
                  <p id="Par108">HFNT will be compared against SOT of dry oxygen via a facemask or nasal prongs, which is currently standard practice.</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par109">As a pragmatic study, perioperative management (anaesthetic technique, surgical procedure, intra-operative mechanical ventilation strategy, and postoperative invasive mechanical ventilation weaning strategy) will not be affected by patients’ participation in the study and will be conducted according to usual local practice.</p>
                  <p id="Par110">Randomisation will be performed after initiation of cardiac surgery and prior to extubation. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either HFNT or SOT using an online tool (provided by Sealed Envelope). Randomisation will be stratified by centre.</p>
                  <p id="Par111">After cardiac surgery, patients will be transferred sedated and with their trachea intubated to the post-surgical recovery area. This may be an ICU, high dependency unit (HDU) or specific recovery unit as per local practice. Once patients fulfil the local hospital criteria for extubation (for example minimal bleeding via chest drains; temperature &gt; 36 °C; stable cardiovascular status; neuromuscular blockade worn off or reversed; sedation stopped; patients responsive to command and successful spontaneous breathing trial (defined as oxygen saturations (SpO<sub>2</sub>) &gt; 93% with inspired oxygen less than or equal to 60% and adequate spontaneous effort), they will then be extubated following the trial extubation protocol (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and will receive either HFNT or SOT for a minimum of 16 h according to their randomised allocation. Patients will be transferred to the surgical ward as per local practice and will be assessed at least every 24 h as per local practice—if SpO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 93% on air and respiratory rate (RR) &lt; 20 breathes per minute, then HFNT or SOT will be discontinued. If SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 93% or RR &lt; 20, then HFNT or SOT will be continued for a further 24 h then the patient will be re-assessed every 24 h. If a patient deteriorates during HFNT or SOT, then the agreed Trial Escalation of Respiratory Therapy Protocol will be applied (please refer to the “<xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">22</xref>” section).

The choice of primary endpoint (DAH90) is aimed at mitigating potential sources of bias due to the unblinded nature of the study. Following the approach of Myles et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], patients who died within 90 days of surgery will be assigned a zero DAH score irrespective of whether they spent any time at home during the 90 day follow-up period.</p>

We assumed a 3% death rate, and LOS was truncated at 90 days (the maximum for our follow-up period). Finally, DAH90 was computed as 90 minus LOS.</p>
                  <p id="Par128">A total sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 310 has 90% power to detect an increase of 2 days in the median DAH90 using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for the analysis. After adjustment for 12% crossover from SOT to HFNT and 25% crossover from HFNT to SOT as well as an extra 5% loss to follow-up (equally distributed amongst arms), the total sample size needed to detect a 2-day increase with 90% power with an intention to treat analysis is 850 patients.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment {15}</title>
                  <p id="Par129">In addition to an internal pilot phase provided by the sample size re-estimation included in the adaptive design, an internal three-month pilot phase in each study centre to enhance the efficiency and internal validity of the main study will be used. This will focus largely on recruitment, randomisation, intervention and follow-up assessments. The potential timings of reaching the specific sample sizes were estimated via the initial predictive model of patient recruitment numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; however, it is anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the rate of recruitment. Furthermore, there will be at least two points in the study for trial statisticians to aid further discussion on recruitment performance with predictions: at 10 months after the recruitment commences to predict whether the initial interim is attainable and again, immediately after the interim analysis to foresee whether the revisited target is achievable in the time.</p>
                  <p id="Par130">The recruitment monitoring reference has the primary basis on the lower bound of the predicted recruited number. The study team will monitor recruitment performance and prepare for necessary actions. There will be a formal assessment of recruitment at month 15 or after 168 patients have been enrolled. The Trial Steering Committee will assess recruitment against monthly targets to consider whether further sites should be recruited.</p>
                  <p id="Par131">It is expected that each centre will recruit a minimum number of patients per month over each 3 month period to get a ‘green light’ to continue in the study. If this minimum target is not met, the site will go ‘amber’ and be given another 3 months to meet minimum recruitment, then if this is not met the site will go ‘red’ and if recruitment cannot be improved in a further 3 months the site will be removed from the study and another site activated. The Sponsor, CTU and Local CRN Research Delivery teams will give sites labelled amber or red all available assistance to improve recruitment.</p>

We acknowledge that this has the potential to cause bias, particularly for patient-reported outcomes. However, the choice of primary endpoint (DAH90) being collected using blinded central study team members and a blinded database is aimed at mitigating potential sources of bias due to the unblinded nature of the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par136">We have taken the following steps to mitigate detection, procedural and post randomisation bias. Patients will receive the study intervention (HFNT) or SOT immediately after tracheal extubation on the intensive care unit/surgical recovery ward. We have defined a clear study-specific policy for escalation of ventilation support, which includes objective cut points and protocols for oxygen therapy, physiotherapy and other respiratory support that will be used to guide transfer between levels of care. We have mapped out the pathway and specified mild and major non-adherence in an objective way. These deviations will be recorded and reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee.</p>

The effects of adherence, attrition and likely sources of bias on the primary effect estimate will be evaluated using per protocol, safety and sensitivity analyses. In particular, we will perform a sensitivity analysis for the primary end-point to assess the impact of assigning a DAH score of zero to patients that die at any time within the 90 day follow-up period by relaxing this rule and replacing these zero values by the observed DAH value for these patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par154">It is expected that the secondary outcome of days at home up to 30 days (DAH30) will have similar distributional characteristics to that of DAH90.

                  <p id="Par157">The economic evaluation focuses most data collection on the initial in-patient stay, followed by costing of health and social care service use in the follow-up period. This ensures the detail for expected (e.g. LOS and ICU use) and any unexpected change (e.g. treatment of complications) from the surgical stay is collected and any implications for shifting care to other hospitals/residential care or to patients is captured in broader detail.</p>
                  <p id="Par158">The base case economic evaluation will adopt an NHS and personal services view point, with a public sector and patient/family viewpoints included in sensitivity analysis. Intervention costs including set up (e.g. training), initial inpatient care (e.g. length of stay in ward/theatre/ICU including all readmissions, oxygen use by type, treatment of complications, procedures, tests, medication) and follow-up care costs (e.g. readmission to hospital, use of A&amp;E services, appointments and home visits for primary care, use of other community care services, days in residential care by type, medication) to 90 days will be compared with the usual care control. Following discussion with PPI representatives, patient cost data will focus on their largest elements: out-of-pocket expenses for residential care and assisted living, plus days of unpaid caring by family members. Health service and resource use data will be collected from patients and routine sources. Unit costs will be valued using national costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], where available, and literature or local costs where not. Outcomes to be used in the economic analysis will include the primary outcome DHA90 and EQ5D5L QALYs with values taken from the ‘cross-walk’ algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] unless the recent NICE statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] is amended.</p>
                  <p id="Par159">The results will be provided as total and incremental costs and effects and cost profiles by arm, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and net-benefit regression, in accordance with good practice guidance and recommendations by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Regression-based analyses of costs and outcomes will account for missingness, censoring, skewness and correlation between costs and outcomes. The effect of baseline characteristics (e.g. EuroSCORE II, ARISCAT score, gender, age, baseline quality of life, residential status and baseline health service use) and any imbalance in covariates on costs and outcomes will be evaluated. Bootstrapping will be used to reflect uncertainty in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and correlations between costs/effects. A range of deterministic, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will investigate the impact of different assumptions (e.g. for valuation), data and approaches (e.g. view point, methods for dealing with missingness) on conclusions.

As NOTACS is a multicentre study, using a different primary endpoint to the pilot data, we found that the sample size calculation was very sensitive to the standard deviation, level of treatment switches and loss to follow-up assumed. NOTACS has been designed as an adaptive trial with an interim sample size re-estimation planned after 300 patients complete 90 days post-randomisation follow-up. At the interim sample size re-estimation, we will use the data accumulated so far to re-estimate a number of ‘nuisance’ parameters including standard deviation, treatment switch rate, drop-out rate and death rate.</p>
                  <p id="Par161">Treatment efficacy will not be assessed at the interim analysis. Sensitivity analysis will also evaluate the impact of accounting for all days alive and at home (i.e. even if patients die before 90 days) on sample size estimation. This will facilitate discussion of the impact of this assumption on the final estimation of DAH90 and QALYs. These analyses will inform how final analyses for the effectiveness and health economics can be aligned in terms of the primary endpoint definition and used to better address the co-primary questions.</p>
                  <p id="Par162">After the interim analysis, the sample size of the study will be updated with a maximum increase up to 1152 patients. There are several possible outcomes from the sample size re-estimation which are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>.

                  <p id="Par169">In cardiac surgery, postoperative complications are common. Only device-related adverse events (i.e., adverse reactions) and serious adverse events (SAE) that are device-related and/or ‘unexpected’ will be reportable to the sponsor. Please refer to Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

                  <p id="Par170">Adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time of tracheal extubation to discharge. From discharge up to 90 days after surgery, only SAEs will be collected. For events collected from tracheal extubation to discharge, the local PI will conduct medical assessment including the causality of the event. The sponsor also delegates responsibility for ‘expectedness’ assessment to the local PI. Unexpected events are those not listed in the study protocol.</p>
                  <p id="Par171">All adverse events and serious adverse events will be coded using MedDRA version 23.1. Each event will be coded using the MedDRA Hierarchy with a corresponding Preferred Term, High Level Term, High Level Group Term and System Organ Class. All the expected AEs/SAEs were pre-coded where possible and reviewed by a medical professional. The AEs/SAEs will be coded as an ongoing process, with the coding staff communicating with the site or clinical staff as necessary for clarification.</p>

Once completed and peer reviewed, social, professional and mainstream media will be contacted to inform as many people as possible about the study protocol, findings and recommendations for future clinical practice and health policy. It is expected that this multicentre trial will inform national guidelines for cardiac surgical, intensive care and anaesthesia and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical practice guidance. At the end of the study, feedback sessions and webinars will be arranged in order to present the results of the study to the Trial Steering Group and Investigators and Research Nurses from all recruiting centres. In addition, patients who participated in the study and service users will be informed about the final results of the study by newsletters, webinars, patient support groups and by presenting the results at research awareness days.</p>
