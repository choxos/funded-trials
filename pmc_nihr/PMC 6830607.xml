                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Oral emergency contraception (EC) can prevent unintended pregnancy but it is important to start a regular method of contraception. Women in the UK usually access EC from a pharmacy but then need a subsequent appointment with a general practitioner or a sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service to access regular contraception. Unintended pregnancies can occur during this time.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Bridge-It is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial designed to determine whether pharmacist provision of a bridging supply of a progestogen-only pill (POP) plus rapid access to a local SRH clinic, results in increased uptake of effective contraception and prevents more unintended pregnancies than provision of EC alone. Bridge-It involves 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (London, Lothian and Tayside) aiming to recruit 626–737 women. Pharmacies will give EC (levonorgestrel) according to normal practice and recruit women to both intervention and the control phases of the study. In the intervention phase, pharmacists will provide the POP (desogestrel) and offer rapid access to an SRH clinic. In the control phase, pharmacists will advise women to attend a contraceptive provider for contraception (standard care).</p>
                  <p>Women will be asked 4 months later about contraceptive use. Data linkage to abortion registries will provide abortion rates over 12 months. The sample size is calculated on the primary outcome of effective contraception use at 4 months (yes/no) with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. Abortion rates will be an exploratory secondary analysis. Process evaluation includes interviews with pharmacists, SRH clinicians and women. Cost-effectiveness analysis will use a healthcare system perspective and be expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Unintended pregnancy is widely perceived as a major public health problem. Unintended pregnancy commonly ends in abortion and the UK has among the highest abortion rates in Europe.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In 2017, almost 200 000 pregnancies ended in induced abortion.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Unintended pregnancy also ends in childbirth; around 10% of UK births are unintended and 25% mistimed.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Unintended pregnancy is costly to the National Health Service (NHS) (estimated to cost over £1 billion annually)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and can be distressing for women. Unintended pregnancies are more common in young women from deprived backgrounds, contributing to widening health inequalities for both mother and baby, and their families.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Unintended childbirth can have both socioeconomic consequences for women and their families and mental health consequences.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Oral emergency contraception (EC) prevents pregnancy in individual women following unprotected sex or contraceptive accidents. EC is only effective if taken before ovulation as it works by inhibiting or delaying ovulation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Since EC became available from pharmacies in the UK without the need for a prescription, there has been a change in the pattern of access such that women who seek EC now choose to obtain this from a pharmacy rather than a contraceptive provider such as a general practitioner (GP) or sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although trials have shown that this facilitates access to EC and increases use, they have failed to show that this reduces unintended pregnancy rates within the population.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
              <p>There are two types of EC: the most widely used EC contains the progestogen levonorgestrel and should be taken within 72 hours of sex; the other EC contains the progesterone receptor modulator ulipristal acetate and should be taken within 120 hours of sex.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Neither formulation of EC prevents conceptions from subsequent acts of sex and the risk of pregnancy is increased up to threefold among women who have further unprotected sex in the same menstrual cycle after using EC than those who do not.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> An effective method of contraception should, therefore, be started as soon as possible.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> However, the only contraceptives that can be obtained from any pharmacy without a prescription are condoms, which have high failure rates.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This means that women usually need to make an appointment with a contraceptive provider (GP or SRH) and may experience delays in accessing regular contraception or lose the motivation to access a regular method altogether, which in turn may result in unintended pregnancies. In addition, although pharmacists in the UK are supposed to advise women on where to obtain ongoing contraception after EC, in one study fewer than half of pharmacists did so.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is possible that if pharmacists could supply a temporary (bridging) method of contraception to women along with EC, this would bridge the gap until women could get an appointment with a contraceptive provider for contraceptive advice and supplies. The progestogen-only pill (POP) is an effective method of contraception with few contraindications<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> making it safer than the combined contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives for pharmacy provision. However, studies have shown that starting hormonal contraception containing a progestogen within 5 days of ulipristal acetate may reduce the efficacy of EC and so only EC containing levonorgestrel is suitable for use in conjunction with a bridging method of hormonal contraception in this way.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>
</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Pilot</title>
                <p>In a pilot study in Edinburgh of 168 women presenting for EC,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> 11 pharmacies were randomised to one of three groups to provide EC (levonorgestrel) and either (1) standard advice on where to obtain ongoing contraception or (2) 1 month of a POP or (3) the offer of rapid access to a local SRH service. Participants were contacted by telephone 6–8 weeks later to determine their current contraceptive use. Compared with standard care, the proportion of women using effective contraception was significantly greater in both the POP (56% vs 16%, p=0.001) and the rapid access groups (52% vs 16%, p=0.027). This suggests that a supply of 1 month of POP after EC or rapid access from a pharmacy to an SRH service might increase short-term uptake of effective contraception following EC.</p>
                <p>We now propose a large randomised trial to determine whether a pharmacy-based intervention designed to facilitate the uptake of effective contraception after EC increases use of effective contraceptive methods including the most effective long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LARC) such as the contraceptive implant and intrauterine contraception<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> at 4 months when compared with standard care. We will examine contraceptive uptake at 4 months as most POP preparations are packaged as a 3-month supply and so by 4 months the pharmacy provided supply will have ended.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Aim</title>
                <p>The aim is to develop a simple and affordable intervention which facilitates the uptake of effective ongoing contraception among women obtaining EC from pharmacies thereby reducing unintended pregnancy. The primary objective is to determine whether offering women attending a pharmacy for EC, a 3-month bridging supply of POP plus the offer of rapid access to a local SRH service results in increased uptake of effective contraception. The study POP (desogestrel) is commonly used in the UK. In contrast to other POP s, the desogestrel POP reliably inhibits ovulation and has similar effectiveness to a combined hormonal contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives (COCP), yet fewer contraindications than a COCP.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> This combined intervention (POP plus rapid access) offers both a highly safe temporary method of contraception and facilitates access to a specialist contraceptive service where all methods of contraception including the most effective LARC methods can be provided. If this intervention leads to increased uptake of effective contraception including LARC methods compared with standard care alone then we might expect that this would translate into fewer unintended pregnancies for women.</p>

                <p>A pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial with cost-effectiveness including process, outcome and economic evaluation involving 31 pharmacies in three UK regions (15 in London (South and Central), 12 in Lothian (Edinburgh and region) and 4 in Tayside (Dundee and region).</p>

                <p>The members of the patient and public involvement (PPI) group at the SRH service in Edinburgh contributed to the design of this study. The study protocol and documentation were reviewed and approved by the chair and members of the PPI group. The plain English summary was edited by a PPI member and improved as a result. There are three PPI members that participate and contribute to the Bridge-It Trial steering Committee meeting that provides oversight of the study.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The planned intervention is a composite intervention. Each woman in the intervention phase will receive 3 months of POP (in a single package covering 3 months) and an invitation to attend a local participating SRH service to discuss and obtain effective contraception (including LARC methods). Three packets of POP, (75 mcg desogestrel; UK) containing 28 tablets each will be provided at no cost to women as a bridging method of contraception, providing them with 3 months of contraception during which time they can get an appointment with a contraceptive provider to obtain their preferred method of contraception. Locally approved patient group directions (ie, strict criteria to permit provision of specified medicines by non-prescribers) will permit participating pharmacists to dispense the POP to women recruited to the study. Prestudy training will be undertaken with participating pharmacists including identifying medical contraindications to POP, potential drug interactions medications and ‘missed pill’ guidance for POP. Pharmacists will advise women to start the POP the day following intake of EC<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and provide women with a patient information booklet on the POP from the family planning association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fpa.org">www.fpa.org</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Pharmacists will encourage women to attend the participating local SRH service to obtain the contraceptive method of their choice. Participants (intervention phase) will be given a study card to alert staff at SRH services that they are in the Bridge-It study and should be seen as a drop in for contraception that same day. This card will also provide written information about the location and opening hours of the local participating SRH service. These SRH services are within a 5 mile radius of the participating pharmacies and provide all methods of contraception at no cost as is the norm in the NHS.</p>

                <p>A mystery shopper exercise<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> will be undertaken in all 31 participating pharmacies to characterise ‘standard care’ (usually verbal advice to visit a clinic for contraception, with/without written and verbal information) in the control phase. The mystery shopper visits will be conducted when the pharmacy is not recruiting and just before the control phase starts. The mystery shoppers and the scenario used will be chosen by the PPI group. A simple scenario relating to request for EC will be used. Immediately after leaving the pharmacy, the mystery shopper will complete a standard data collection proforma, recording any information given by the pharmacist about use of contraception after taking EC, including provision of written information.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>We will recruit a total of 626–737 women presenting for EC. The final number will be determined based on the observed ratio of the between-period within-cluster correlation (BPC) and the within-period within-cluster correlation (WPC)—with the larger sample size (near the 737 upper limit) required for values of BPC close to zero, and the smaller sample size (near the 626 lower limits) required for values of BPC close to WPC.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Each pharmacy will be expected to recruit an average of 12–13 women to the intervention arm and 12–13 women to standard care.

                <p>Each pharmacy will be randomised to either the intervention phase for approximately 20 weeks followed by standard care phase for 20 weeks or vice versa with a washout period of 2 weeks between the two phases. The order in which pharmacy allocation to each arm is undertaken (intervention or control first) will be randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The order of delivery of intervention or control for each pharmacy was randomised for this cluster cross-over design from a randomisation file prepared by the study statistician in the Data Centre at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT), University of Aberdeen, using SAS V.6.4 for Windows. The method used for generating the random unpredictable mix of permuted blocks was a computer software algorithm that randomly allocated blocks of size 2, 4 and 6; blocking was used to ensure balanced group sizes.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>The study is a pragmatic cluster randomised cohort cross-over trial. Ideally the control and intervention phases should be of roughly equal duration and size, and the sample size is calculated assuming an equal cluster size in both control and intervention periods, and equal across sites (the expected site/period average). In practice, there is variability in EC demand across sites and over time, for example, demand is affected by peak holiday periods (recruitment decreases) and student term times (recruitment increases); and the ability of a pharmacy to translate that variable demand into study recruits depends on many factors, including changes to circumstances at individual pharmacies or loss of/change of pharmacists at multipharmacist stores.</p>
                <p>Informed by our pilot study, we have assumed that effective contraception use in the control would be 30% and we were likely to achieve a 50% relative improvement to 45%. This means the sample size is in the range 626–737, assuming 25% of women do not provide 4-month contraceptive use data, and an average cluster size of 12–13 in each period, and around 25 pharmacies taking part, with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. The uncertainty in the required sample size rests on the assumed BPC and its relationship to the other component of variability, the WPC.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The WPC is the usual correlation (known as the intraclass correlation in a standard parallel groups non-cross-over cluster setting) of two individuals’ outcomes within a cluster (in the same period). The BPC on the other hand is the correlation between two individuals’ outcomes in the same cluster between the two periods. If the BPC is zero, there is no advantage in a cross-over design over the standard parallel groups cluster design; if the BPC equals the WPC then the crossover is as efficient as an individually randomised design. We will finalise the sample size depending on the observed ratio of the BPC to WPC, and the observed rate of attrition, but still assuming the same control rate and treatment effect, once we have 4-month data on at least 500 participants.</p>

                <p>There will be a single analysis at study end (there is no opportunity for any interim analyses given the cross-over design) although an independent data monitoring committee will monitor study progress and any safety issues. This will follow the intention-to-treat principle and will use a hierarchical model appropriate for the specific outcome. For the primary outcome, this will be a mixed-effects logistic regression, using the hierarchical model approach as recommended by Turner <italic>et al</italic> for a cluster cross-over design.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We will prespecify any individual level (or cluster level) covariates that we intend to adjust for, and the comprehensive statistical analysis plan will specify the sensitivity type analyses that will explore how robust the findings are to any missing data at the cluster level (probably unlikely) and the individual level (expected to be substantial for the patient reported outcomes at 4 months). As well as the usual assumption of missing at random, we will try to explore possible mechanisms for non-ignorable (informative missingness) at the individual level, which may well be operating in this context. Subgroup analyses will explore the possible effect modification by LARC (most effective contraceptive methods) versus non-LARC vs no use of contraception.</p>

                  <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                  <p>An economic evaluation will be undertaken comparing the intervention and control arms in a cost-effectiveness analysis. A trial-based analysis will be followed by the construction of a decision model to extrapolate future costs and benefits beyond the completion of the trial. The overall perspective used will be that of the health system. Costs will include the pharmacist training to provide POP, direct and indirect costs of health service use, and the provision and dispensing of POP. We will compare the costs to the NHS in the intervention and control arms. To account for differences in the numbers of women in the two arms, we will compare the cost per woman in each arm. In the control arm, the costs are (1) cost of EC, (2) cost of pharmacist provision of EC, (3) cost of abortions. In the intervention arm, the costs are in addition to these (4) the cost of the POP, (5) cost of pharmacist training to provide POP and (6) cost of pharmacist provision of POP. The costs (1) and (2) are the same in both groups and so the extra cost of the intervention will be the sum of (4), (5) and (6). The cost per women who has an abortion is the same in both groups except that we hypothesise that the abortion rate will be lower in the intervention group. We can then state the outcome as conventional incremental cost-effectiveness ratio that is, for every £100 spent on the intervention results in x fewer abortions for a savings of £Y. If Y is greater than 100 then the intervention is cost-effective. We will examine the sensitivity of the outcomes to variations in the costs of 4, 5 and 6.</p>

              <p>Unintended pregnancy is widely perceived as a major public health problem. The proposed intervention in the Bridge-It study provides both temporary contraception (the POP) and facilitates access to effective contraception at a local SRH clinic. The cluster design was felt necessary for logistical reasons and confirmed in the qualitative work of our pilot study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 23</xref> that an individually randomised trial would simply not recruit, as it was not feasible for pharmacists within a busy pharmacy to take additional time to randomise each individual. The cross-over nature of the cluster design was chosen for efficiency, and by having a different set of women recruited at a pharmacy in the two different periods we avoided contamination by the participant. The purpose of the washoutout period was to minimise intervention effect carrying over from one period to another, as part of any contamination effect mediated by the pharmacist. With the cluster cross-over design, each cluster will act as its own control and fewer pharmacies are required than with a parallel cluster design.</p>
              <p>If our proposed intervention works, then this could prevent more unintended pregnancies for more women. If the intervention is cost-effective then it could have cost savings for the NHS.</p>
