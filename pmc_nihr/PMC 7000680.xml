                <p id="Par1">The PROteKT study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin can inhibit aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). This open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial recruited children and young people aged 6 to 18 years with CF at 13 paediatric CF treatment centres in the UK. Participants were randomised equally to either receive oral rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily) or no intervention (control) throughout clinically indicated treatment with intravenous tobramycin. The primary outcome was the difference between the groups in mean fold-change in urinary Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1). Fifty (rosuvastatin n = 23, control n = 27) participants were recruited between May 2015 and January 2017. Primary outcome data was available for 88% (rosuvastatin n = 20, control n = 24). The estimated mean treatment difference in the geometric mean-fold change of normalised KIM-1 was 1.08 (95% CI 0.87–1.35, p = 0.48). In total there were 12 adverse reactions, all mild, reported by five participants randomised to rosuvastatin, and one serious adverse event in each group. Whilst no protective effect of rosuvastatin was seen, there was a lower than expected level of nephrotoxicity in the cohort. Therefore, we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesis that rosuvastatin protects against aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">In Cystic fibrosis (CF) the resistant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is commonly implicated in secondary bacterial lung infections and colonisation. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, usually combined with a beta-lactam, are frequently used to treat respiratory exacerbations in CF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, as they are effective against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Whilst this approach generally leads to improved patient outcomes, aminoglycoside use is also associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children with CF is increased with current or recent exposure to aminoglycosides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with rates of 20% reported using daily monitoring of serum creatinine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The risk of AKI is higher with longer duration of aminoglycoside use and with recent previous aminoglycoside exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In one cohort of adults with CF, between 31% and 42% had evidence of chronic renal impairment which was significantly associated with cumulative aminoglycoside exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, this has not been replicated in other cohorts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Strategies such as therapeutic drug monitoring and extended-interval dosing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> are only partially effective in preventing aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. It is therefore important to develop further, more effective, strategies.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Aminoglycosides cause targeted toxicity to renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Megalin, a multi-ligand receptor, facilitates the endocytosis and accumulation of aminoglycosides in these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This pathway is activated by intermediates derived from mevalonate, which is formed from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) via the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We hypothesised that inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase with a statin would lead to a reduction in toxicity. Statins are inhibitors of megalin-mediated endocytosis <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and are therefore likely to reduce uptake of aminoglycosides in the proximal tubule. Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in rats have consistently demonstrated a protective effect of statins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In this paper, we describe the first clinical trial to evaluate the repurposing of a statin for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced kidney toxicity. Rosuvastatin was chosen as it is hydrophilic, has minimal hepatic metabolism, and has some renal elimination of the parent drug<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (and therefore theoretically preferable in preventing megalin-mediated uptake rather than a hepatically metabolised statin). In addition, it is highly potent, and licensed for use in children. This trial was designed to test the hypothesis that rosuvastatin can inhibit aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in children with CF.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par13">This is the first randomised controlled trial in man to assess whether rosuvastatin has a protective effect against tobramycin-induced nephrotoxicity. It was designed as an early phase trial using KIM-1 as a surrogate outcome measure. We found little evidence of a protective effect of rosuvastatin in this trial as determined by both primary and secondary outcomes, but this should be interpreted with caution as the control group only demonstrated a mean fold-change of KIM-1 of 1.85. The sample size calculation for this study was, however, based upon an expected mean fold-change in KIM-1 of 3.03 during exposure to tobramycin derived from an early analysis of samples in the URBAN CF study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The trial was powered to detect a difference in fold-change between the groups of 2. The PROteKT and URBAN CF populations were similar, although PROteKT contained a greater proportion of female participants, and had higher mean age, height and weight (due to differences in the inclusion criteria for age). There were no differences in aminoglycoside prescribing practices between the two studies. We do not believe that the differences between the populations used in PROteKT and URBAN CF account for lower than expected levels of nephrotoxicity observed in our randomised controlled trial. Therefore, it is unclear whether this reflects lower than usual levels of toxicity in the PROteKT cohort, or higher than usual levels of toxicity in the cohort upon which the sample size calculation was based. This makes it difficult to definitively exclude the possibility of a protective effect of rosuvastatin. Indeed, some of our secondary outcome measures suggest a trend towards a protective effect. Importantly, the use of rosuvastatin was generally well tolerated.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Urine KIM-1 is a cell membrane glycoprotein upregulated by proximal tubule epithelial cells in response to toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. It was chosen as the primary outcome measure as it has previously shown potential for the identification of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in preterm neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and in children with CF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as well as outperforming other biomarkers of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity in pre-clinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In clinical practice, changes in serum creatinine meeting agreed criteria for AKI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> are more widely accepted for defining nephrotoxicity. However, changes in serum creatinine are a relatively late event in the process of nephrotoxicity, and for the purposes of a phase IIa trial, it was felt that KIM-1 was a good surrogate measure. Indeed, we identified no significant treatment effect upon serum creatinine in this study, consistent with our previous experience in the URBAN CF study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The use of a change in serum creatinine as an outcome measure may be relevant to use in future trials, but given that this is estimated to occur in 14–20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a much larger sample size will be required.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Urine NGAL is a 25 kDa protein expressed by kidney epithelial cells (as well as other tissues, including neutrophils)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It is a sensitive predictor for AKI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and has previously been shown to be elevated during aminoglycoside exposure in neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and in children with CF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Patients in the intervention group had a smaller estimated geometric mean fold-change of normalised NGAL (p = 0.11), and a significantly lower AUC of normalised NGAL. The difference in AUC between the groups must be interpreted in the light of a higher baseline urinary NGAL in the control compared to the intervention group (61.08 ng/mgCr and 22.46 ng/mgCr respectively). This may, in part, be explained by the higher proportion of females in the control versus intervention groups as females have been consistently shown to have higher baseline NGAL concentrations than males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Whilst our results may be interpreted to suggest a protective effect of rosuvastatin, we feel that these should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Published studies in rat models of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity have consistently demonstrated a protective effect with a range of statins, including atorvastatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, simvastatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and rosuvastatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We felt that rosuvastatin was the most promising candidate based upon its pharmacology. It is a hydrophilic statin, and has greater renal excretion than the more lipophilic atorvastatin and simvastatin. It causes more proteinuria than other statins, probably because it is secreted in the proximal tubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and inhibits megalin-mediated endocytosis. We considered whether we should have given the statin for a few days in advance of commencing the tobramycin in order to achieve steady-state concentrations. However, published pre-clinical studies demonstrated a protective effect of statins without the need for this<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The recruitment of children with CF from thirteen different sites in the UK to participate in this trial ensures that differences in practice between centres should be accounted for in the randomisation. The trial was designed to cause the least disruption possible to standard daily care, and for the intervention to be minimally burdensome to patients (requiring only one additional medicine per day for 2 weeks). This was reflected in the good adherence to the randomised intervention, and by a low number of reported adverse reactions.</p>
              <p id="Par18">In conclusion, given the lower than expected level of nephrotoxicity seen in this study we feel that we can neither confirm nor refute the hypothesis that statins protect against aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Given the large amount of pre-clinical data which shows that statins can be protective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, we feel further studies in humans are warranted. These would need to be powered for a clinically acceptable primary outcome measure such as AKI (rise in creatinine). There are of course other interventions which have been attempted to reduce the risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, including extended-interval dosing and drug trough level monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and morning (versus evening) administration of the aminoglycoside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. All these interventions are not mutually exclusive, and it may be that combinations of interventions may be more successful in preventing renal injury when compared with individual interventions, and such a possibility should be investigated in an appropriately designed clinical trial in the future.</p>

The first dose of rosuvastatin was given on the same calendar day and prior to the first dose of IV tobramycin. Subsequent daily doses of rosuvastatin were given prior to that day’s dose of tobramycin. Treatment with oral rosuvastatin continued for the duration of the course of IV tobramycin. If the tobramycin course was shorter than 14 days, rosuvastatin was discontinued after the final tobramycin dose. If the tobramycin course was longer than 14 days, rosuvastatin was continued until the final day of the tobramycin course.

These included adverse event assessment, a symptom-directed physical examination if required, and collection of blood and urine samples. Spirometry was performed at the T + 8 and T + 13 visits.

All samples were stored at fridge temperature (4 °C) for a total of one week (including time spent at the patient’s home) and then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C (or −20 °C for a maximum of 6 months) in the local laboratory.

                <p id="Par30">All the participants who received at least one dose of rosuvastatin were included in the safety analysis. Adverse reactions and serious adverse events were recorded from the point of informed consent and throughout the trial treatment period up until the final assessment (3–5 weeks after the participant had taken the final dose of rosuvastatin).</p>

                <p id="Par31">Urinary KIM-1 and NGAL were measured using validated electrochemiluminescent assays (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), US) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Biomarker values were normalised to urinary creatinine which was determined spectrophotometically as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Serum creatinine, tobramycin concentrations and CRP were measured in the laboratory serving the local hospital site.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Rosuvastatin concentrations were measured centrally at the University of Liverpool. A high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method for the estimation of rosuvastatin in plasma, was developed and validated using rosuvastatin-D6 as internal standard. Sample preparation was accomplished by protein precipitation. The samples were chromatographed on a C-18 Halo column using mobile phases consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The method was validated over a concentration range of 0.5–100 ng/mL for rosuvastatin.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par33">The statistical analysis plan (Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) was written prior to any formal analysis. The trial was designed with a 92% power to detect a difference in fold-change in KIM-1 between the 2 groups at a 5% significance level (two sided). A standard deviation of 1.84 was derived from an early analysis of samples in the URBAN CF study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> from 10 participants receiving a single course of treatment with tobramycin. The same data was also inspected to assess that the assumption of normality is reasonable. Using these assumptions and utilizing a 2-sample t-test, a sample size of 20 in each arm would be sufficient. We planned to include 50 patients in order to compensate for 10% loss to follow up.</p>
                <p id="Par34">The principle of intention-to-treat was the main strategy of the analysis adopted for the primary outcome and all the secondary outcomes. These analyses were conducted on all randomised participants, in the group to which they were allocated, and for whom the outcome(s) of interest have been observed/measured.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The primary outcome was analysed using the method of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The outcome measure was the mean log-transformed fold-change of normalised KIM-1 (ng/mgCr) calculated by dividing the peak value, corresponding to the ‘highest value’ of normalised KIM-1 during exposure to tobramycin, by the baseline normalised KIM-1 value for each participant. The explanatory variables were treatment group and baseline normalised KIM-1 value. 95% confidence intervals will be reported and a p-value of &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. The secondary outcomes were analysed longitudinally using random intercept models with unstructured covariance matrices, including an interaction between treatment group and visit.</p>
                <p id="Par36">In an additional analysis of normalised NGAL (ng/mgCr), an ANCOVA model was used, as for KIM-1 above, comparing log-transformed mean fold-change from baseline to peak NGAL between the treatment groups, controlling for the baseline normalised NGAL. The model estimates were exponentiated to be interpretable on the normal scale.</p>
                <p id="Par37">In an additional descriptive analysis of serum creatinine data, change from baseline serum creatinine during tobramycin exposure was defined according to the KDIGO AKI criteria (Stage 1, increase ≥1.5 and &lt;2 times from baseline; Stage 2, increase ≥2 and &lt;3 times from baseline; Stage 3, increase ≥3 times from baseline)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Pre-specified sensitivity analyses tested impact of missing data; the statistical analysis plan includes full details of sensitivity analyses and analyses of secondary outcomes. Analyses were performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Inc., USA).</p>
