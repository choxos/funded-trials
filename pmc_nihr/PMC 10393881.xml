                  <p>Given the lack of accurate rapid diagnostics for urinary tract infection (UTI) in women, many countries have developed guidelines aiming to support appropriate antibiotic prescribing, but some guidelines have not been validated. We performed a diagnostic accuracy validation study of two guidelines: Public Health England (GW-1263) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN160).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We used data from women with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated UTI from a randomized controlled trial comparing urine collection devices. Symptom information was recorded via baseline questionnaire and primary care assessment. Women provided urine samples for dipstick testing and culture. We calculated the number within each risk category of diagnostic flowcharts who had positive/mixed growth/no significant growth urine culture. Results were presented as positive/negative predictive values, with 95% CIs.</p>

                  <p>Of women aged under 65 years, 311/509 (61.1%, 95% CI 56.7%–65.3%) classified to the highest risk category (recommended to consider immediate antibiotic prescribing) and 80/199 (40.2%, 95% CI 33.4%–47.4%) classified to the lowest risk category (recommended to reassure that UTI is less likely) by the GW-1263 guideline (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 810) had positive culture. For the SIGN160 guideline (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 814), the proportion with positive culture ranged from 60/82 (73.2%, 95% CI 62.1%–82.1%) in those for whom immediate treatment was indicated to 33/76 (43.4%, 95% CI 32.3%–55.3%) in those recommended a self-care/waiting strategy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Half of women report having had a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and each year up to 15% of women are estimated to experience symptoms attributable to an uncomplicated UTI.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Approximately three-quarters of women presenting with UTI in primary care receive antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Early diagnosis can help to improve patient management and guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing,<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> but there remain uncertainties over how UTI can most accurately be diagnosed in women presenting in primary care. This has led to reviews and meta-analyses of candidate symptom risk factors, such as dysuria, haematuria and urinary frequency, in an attempt to combine them into a suitable diagnostic algorithm.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B4" ref-type="bibr">4–8</xref></sup> Other diagnostic algorithms that use a combination of symptom information and urinary dipstick results have also been proposed.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>These studies are conflicting, with one validation study finding low negative predictive values<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and another finding ‘relatively poor diagnostic value of urinary symptoms alone’ when used as part of a decision rule.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Several of the guidelines so produced have not been adequately validated, which may partly explain why they have been poorly taken up into routine care. Algorithm validation is challenging because the long list of components required are not routinely coded in GP records in a way that would allow use of electronic health records datasets for this validation, and few health records systems include data on the outcome of microbiological sample processing.</p>
              <p>Two guidelines that have been proposed for primary care in the UK are the Public Health England guideline GW-1263<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline SIGN160.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These guidelines are presented in the form of diagnostic flowcharts, which classify individuals at different levels of risk of a microbiologically confirmed UTI using combinations of symptom information and urinary dipstick results. Although many of the elements within each flowchart are evidence based, and are combined into a decision aid within the published documents (described in detail in the Methods section), there is limited information to show how these decision aids might perform in a real-world primary care setting. To address this, we performed a diagnostic validation study of these flowcharts, with the aim of providing quantitative information about their diagnostic performance that could assist clinicians’ interpretation in practice and highlight their likely utility as antibiotic stewardship tools.</p>

                <title>Design and participants</title>
                <p>This diagnostic accuracy evaluation uses prospectively collected data from a three-arm randomized controlled trial that assessed urine collection devices in general practices.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The trial, which received ethical approval from the East of England—Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (16/EE/0200), recruited 1264 participants (1174 of whom were included in the primary ITT analysis) from 61 general practices in England and Wales between October 2016 and August 2018. Participants were women aged 18 years or more who presented to participating general practices with symptoms indicative of suspected uncomplicated UTI, including at least one of dysuria, haematuria or frequency. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in the trial publication.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The diagnostic accuracy evaluation was restricted to participants with recorded age and available urine culture results, but inclusion in the current evaluation was based on eligibility for participation in the trial and not on whether the urine culture result was positive or negative. The sample size for this evaluation was dictated by the total number of participants recruited to the parent trial (see the trial publication for sample size considerations)<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and the sample can be considered as a consecutive series of participants among those who were recruited to the trial and met the inclusion criteria.</p>

                <title>Assessments</title>
                <p>Trial assessments included a range of baseline measurements recorded via a participant questionnaire, urine dipstick test (measuring nitrites, leucocytes and RBC count) and urine culture that was performed in a central study laboratory using standard NHS laboratory procedures.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Alongside demographic information, the participant questionnaire collected information (self-reported by the participant) on baseline UTI-associated symptoms such as dysuria, nocturia, urgency and frequency. These symptoms were scored on a discrete 7-point scale (Table <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, available as <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary data</xref> at <italic toggle="yes">JAC</italic> Online). Urine cloudiness was assessed by the recruiting clinician on a 5-point scale (Table <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) during the same patient visit as the dipstick urinalysis was performed and the urine sample sent for culturing. When used in index test flowcharts, key diagnostic symptoms were considered as present if they were scored at a scale point of at least ‘moderately bad’ (≥4 on the 7-point scale or ≥3 on the 5-point scale). Symptoms described in index tests flowcharts as ‘urinary symptoms that are severe’ were considered as present if they were scored at a scale point of at least ‘bad’ (≥5 on the 7-point scale). A sensitivity analysis was performed in which key symptoms were considered to be present if scored at any level above the lowest scale point (≥2). We used the criteria stipulated by the index test flowcharts for interpreting dipstick results based on their three components: positive for nitrites and/or leucocytes (+, ++, +++) and/or RBCs (haemolysis trace or greater).</p>

                <title>Index tests</title>
                <p>Flowcharts from two UK published clinical guidelines were considered to be the index tests for this evaluation. Both of these guidelines aim to assist primary healthcare providers in the diagnosis and management of UTI in women with symptoms consistent with acute, uncomplicated UTI. The first of these, the Public Health England guideline GW-1263, ‘Diagnosis of urinary tract infections: Quick reference tool for primary care for consultation and local adaptation’,<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> uses a combination of symptom information and urine dipstick results to classify women aged under 65 years with suspected non-recurrent UTI into three risk categories, labelled ‘UTI likely’, ‘UTI equally likely to other diagnosis’ and ‘UTI less likely’ (Figure <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Some of these risk categorizations are reached on the basis of symptoms alone, while others additionally require the results of the three dipstick components. As the published flowchart did not allow for the possibility for a symptomatic patient to have positive RBC and negative nitrite and leucocyte dipstick results, we added this as a separate subpath entering the ‘UTI equally likely to other diagnosis’ category.</p>
                <p>This flowchart recommends initially assessing patients for vaginal and urethral causes of urinary symptoms (such as those caused by sexually transmitted infection), sepsis and pyelonephritis. The trial did not collect information required to make this assessment, but it was considered unlikely that clinicians would recruit individuals to a UTI study if they considered them to be at risk of these conditions. Further, although aimed at women aged under 65 years, this flowchart states that it is ‘suitable for some women over 65 years in the community setting’ but does not provide further detail on this point. A separate flowchart for women over 65 years is provided, but sufficient information to evaluate this was not collected, and so the under-65 version is used for all participants, with results stratified by age group (under 65 versus over 65 years) to test the differential effect of symptoms by age.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The second flowchart is the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline SIGN160, ‘Management of suspected bacterial lower urinary tract infection in adult women’ (Figure <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This uses symptom and dipstick test information to classify participants into four groups with associated guidance on clinical guidance. Three of these groups recommend providing self-care advice alongside different management strategies—one suggesting a ‘watch and wait’ strategy, one suggesting performing a urine culture, and one suggesting considering first-line non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. The final group suggests that the clinician explores the possibility of sexually transmitted infections, urethritis and other causes; as for the GW-1263 flowchart, this final group was not considered in the analysis.</p>
                <p>As neither flowchart provides numerical information about the likelihood of a patient having UTI, quantitative assessment of calibration is not possible. However, the categories to which the GW-1263 flowchart assigns patients can be considered as indicative of risk and so a trend in risk across these ordered categories would be expected.</p>

                <p>The reference test was midstream urine culture, with counts of 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> or &gt;10<sup>5</sup> cfu/mL of a pure or predominant organism considered as a positive urine culture indicative of UTI, consistent with UK standards.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> As urine culture results allow for a sample to be returned as mixed growth, the number of these samples is presented separately from the numbers that are returned as positive or negative (no significant growth) for UTI.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Baseline information about participants was summarized using percentages, mean and standard deviation (SD). For each flowchart, we calculated the number of participants who fell into each pathway within the flowchart. For each of these pathways, the number and percentage who received each culture result (positive, mixed growth or no significant growth) was calculated, with 95% CIs. These percentage summaries are equivalent to predictive values. Participants with missing symptom information, or missing dipstick results, were excluded from the analysis for each flowchart that required them, but these were enumerated separately.</p>

                <p>After excluding those without a urine culture and those for whom age was unrecorded, 1103 women were included in the analysis (Figure <xref rid="dkad212-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mean age of the participants was 48.2 years (SD 18.6 years), 852 (77%) were under 65 years old and 23 (2%) were pregnant. At recruitment, the mean time since first symptom was 3.4 days (SD 1.9 days). Table <xref rid="dkad212-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes relevant baseline symptoms. Most patients presented with some level of dysuria, frequency and urgency, consistent with the trial’s inclusion criteria, and there was a broad range of severity of these symptoms. Visible haematuria and/or urine cloudiness occurred in fewer than half of participants.</p>

                <p>In an analysis of diagnostic performance broken down by flowchart subpath (Figure <xref rid="dkad212-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), it appeared that performance was worst in the group that had milder symptoms (neither having any of the three key signs/symptoms nor any other severe urinary symptoms, under the definition used for the primary analysis). In this subgroup, 52/122 (42.6%, 95% CI 33.8% to 51.9%) had a positive urine culture. If these individuals had been reassigned to risk categories on the basis of dipstick results (i.e. in the same way as those recorded as having one key sign/symptom), diagnostic performance in the ‘UTI less likely’ subgroup would have improved, with the percentage with positive urine culture dropping from 40.2% to 29.4% and the percentage with no significant growth rising from 29.1% to 39.5% (Table <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). By comparison, additionally reassigning individuals who fell into the subpath with two or three key signs/symptoms by their dipstick results brought only a modest improvement in performance, with the main effect being to reclassify many more individuals as ‘UTI equally likely to other diagnosis’ (Table <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>).</p>

However, most individuals (377/437, 86.3%) with a positive culture were not classified into this group.

              <p>We performed a diagnostic validation study of two flowcharts for evaluating risk of microbiologically confirmed UTI in symptomatic women presenting in primary care. Our results add context to and quantify the risk associated with different risk categories specified by two flowcharts that are currently published as clinical guidance in the UK.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="dkad212-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our results suggest that bacterial UTI, as defined by a UK standard definition of positive laboratory urine culture, is not satisfactorily ruled out on the basis of patient-reported symptoms and dipstick results used to classify individuals into risk categories in these flowcharts. There is some indication that diagnostic performance is improved compared with symptoms alone when dipstick results are incorporated, but that even after doing so, many symptomatic individuals remain misclassified. This matches other studies, such as a systematic review from 2010 that concluded that ‘no sign or symptom on its own is powerful enough to ‘rule in’ or ‘rule out’ the diagnosis of UTI’.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Other authors have summarized similar findings in even clearer terms, concluding that ‘diagnosis solely based on clinical symptoms is often wrong’.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The 2010 review also found performance was improved when dipstick results were included, especially the nitrite component.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Our results for the SIGN160 flowchart also show that patients who have a combination of multiple symptoms and a positive nitrite dipstick result comprise by far the most specific subgrouping for laboratory-confirmed UTI. If using these flowcharts as a guide to antibiotic prescribing at first presentation, targeting this group as the highest priority for immediate prescribing appears to represent a strategy that cautions against unnecessary prescribing, but may also mean leaving some women who have bacterial UTI without antibiotic treatment (low sensitivity), as most women with a positive urine culture did not have this combination of risk factors.</p>
              <p>Since many women will have already employed a ‘watch and wait’ strategy before seeking healthcare,<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> it is arguable that asking those classified into the lower-risk groups to continue to ‘watch and wait’ is clinically inappropriate since 40% or more in these groups are likely to have a microbiologically confirmed infection. Placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for UTI, where participants are likely to be motivated to avoid antibiotics, have shown that some women with confirmed bacterial UTI allocated to placebo will have resolution of symptoms without antibiotics.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="dkad212-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, there is also evidence that placebo and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are inferior to antibiotics for UTI treatment in terms of incomplete recovery and overall symptom burden, although the effect may be moderated by the presence of RBCs in urine and a positive urine culture.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="dkad212-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The guidelines used in our study used a variety of symptoms commonly associated with UTI. Interestingly, another study found that by far the most predictive patient history variable was a single question: ‘Does the patient think she has a UTI?’ This might be seen as a succinct summary of the patient’s own interpretation of their entire symptom information and clinical history, and in conjunction with dipstick results outperformed all other symptom variables in predictive performance, identifying a well-calibrated high-risk category of patients having &gt;70% UTI risk.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Future guidelines might consider incorporating a global measure of patient experience given the limited diagnostic performance of individual symptoms.</p>
              <p>Of the many diagnostic guidelines and risk tools that have been suggested in this area, few have been validated. Our study has several strengths: by using a large multi-site cohort of participants drawn from 61 general practices in England and Wales, it permits levels of risk to be quantified in a way that has not previously been presented, including in the guidelines themselves. The study used standardized recruitment and dipstick procedures, and followed laboratory procedures for culturing performed blind to patient risk factors, and can therefore be considered to have high internal consistency.</p>
              <p>Calibration measures, which would generally be recommended in evaluations of risk prediction tools,<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> are difficult to interpret here in the absence of guidance as to how to interpret qualitative risk category descriptors such as ‘UTI likely’, although we note that ‘UTI equally likely to other diagnosis’ might be interpreted as referring to a risk of 50%. Our findings might provide benchmark levels of risk that could be explored further in future evaluations.</p>
              <p>The study also has some limitations. Although based on data that were collected prospectively in a trial setting, this trial was not explicitly designed as a diagnostic evaluation. This meant that some interpretation of symptom variables, which were recorded on discrete rather than binary scales, was required in order to match the definitions used in the flowcharts as closely as possible. We explored the impact of these choices in sensitivity analyses, for example by lowering the thresholds for symptom severity under which we considered an individual to be symptomatic for a particular sign or symptom, and this did not have a major impact on the primary findings. The symptom questionnaires were not independently validated but are similar to symptom scales used elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="dkad212-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although consistent with current guidelines,<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> our reference standard of laboratory urine culture may lead to some misclassification of patients who may have had low colony count bacteriuria.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The likely impact is that diagnostic performance in the group of patients assigned as higher risk may be underestimated and diagnostic performance in those assigned as lower risk may be overestimated. The relatively large number of mixed growth culture results is a further source of diagnostic uncertainty, although this mirrors what a clinician might expect to see after requesting a urine culture from general practice. The proportion of mixed growths was relatively stable across different risk groups, suggesting that the chance of a mixed growth culture is not strongly related to risk factor information. Consequently it is plausible that, within each risk category, the proportion of mixed growth samples that are truly UTIs might be similar to the proportion of positive cultures among the samples with definitive (not mixed) culture results in that risk group.</p>
              <p>We were unable to adequately assess comorbidities or alternative diagnoses, such as sexually transmitted infections, sepsis and pyelonephritis, which may be associated with some symptoms in common with UTI, although it is unlikely that a GP would have recruited individuals they considered at risk of these conditions to a study that aimed to address UTI. It is possible that the trial inclusion criteria meant that participants were effectively ‘pre-screened’, and a truly representative primary care population may also have included more individuals at lower risk of UTI. If so, performance in the lower risk sections of the flowchart may have improved. However, the trial’s inclusion criteria (dysuria, frequency, haematuria) are classical signs of UTI that would be expected in the majority of women, suggesting any resulting spectrum bias would be small.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we found that the two algorithms promoted in the UK differ in the proportion of women who are likely to have a positive culture but fall into a category where immediate antibiotics are not advised, suggesting unwarranted variation in care. Remote consulting was the norm for UTI management during the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Our analysis raises questions about the value of returning to a requirement for dipstick testing given that many empirical prescribing decisions for UTI were already being made remotely, balancing the potential added diagnostic value of dipstick testing with the added patient and clinician time needed to deliver samples to the surgery, test them and communicate the results back to patients.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> If the algorithms are used, our findings suggest that clinicians should apply a rigorous safety net for women who do not receive immediate or delayed antibiotics.</p>
              <p>We might further ask whether it is feasible to expect future methodological developments to result in improvements in diagnostic accuracy based on individual symptoms and dipstick results alone. In our opinion, this is unlikely: many symptoms are not specific to UTI, and there appears to be a ceiling on diagnostic performance using this approach. Of future interest would be to assess the gain in performance in using point-of-care tests for diagnostic purposes, which is the subject of one systematic review<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and an ongoing subsequent review.<sup><xref rid="dkad212-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
