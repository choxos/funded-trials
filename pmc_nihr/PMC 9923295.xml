                  <p>In the past 5 years, there have been several advances in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aim for a new guideline to update the most recent guideline published in 2019. We present the prospective operating procedure and technical summary protocol in the manuscript.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>‘Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation’ (GRADE) will be followed in the development of the guideline, approach as laid out in the GRADE handbook, supported by the WHO. The guideline development group is formed by a variety of disciplines, across both primary and secondary care that took part in an online Delphi process and split into key areas. A final consensus list of thematic questions within a ‘patient, intervention, comparison, outcome’ format has been produced and agreed in the final phase of the Delphi process.</p>
                  <p>There will be a detailed technical evidence review with source data including systematic reviews appraised with AMSATAR 2 tool (Assessment of multiple systematic reviews), randomised controlled trial data that will be judged for risk of bias with the Cochrane tool and observational studies for safety concerns assessed through the Robins-I tool. Based on the available evidence, some of the recommendations will be based on GRADE while others will be best practice statements.</p>
                  <p>A full Delphi process will be used to make recommendations using online response systems.</p>
                  <p>This set of procedures has been approved by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee, the British Society of Gastroenterology executive board and aligned with IBD UK standards.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In the past 5 years, there have been several advances in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this effect, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) has commissioned a new guideline for the management of IBD. This is aimed to update the most recent guideline published in 2019.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p>
              <p>This document describes the prospectively agreed methods and operating procedures that will be followed to produce these new guidelines. The final guideline will contain the official recommendations of the BSG on all aspects of IBD care. This set of procedures has been approved by the CSSC, the BSG executive board and aligned with IBD UK standards. No funding has been received from any outside organisation—commercial or otherwise—to produce this document, with some support provided for members time as part of their employment at public higher educational institutions or within their roles as National Health Service funded health professionals.</p>
              <p>We aim for this guideline to cover all aspects of IBD including but not exclusive to Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, IBD unclassified and primary sclerosing cholangitis-related IBD. While primarily designed for use within the UK, the guideline will no doubt have international scope and utility for both healthcare professionals and people living with IBD and, therefore, is presented in a full systematic and transparent fashion. The prospective publishing of this document is part of that process of systematic guideline production.</p>

                <title>Organisation, planning and training</title>
                <p>In April 2021, the BSG appointed a content and field expert as a guideline chair through a competitive process. To meet the best evidence guidance for such leadership, a non-voting GRADE and synthesis methodologist was appointed as co-chair.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Administrative support will be provided from both host higher education institutions of the co-chairs and access to a Cochrane and NICE expert information specialist will be arranged through these institutions. The chairs proposed their approach to the BSG and editor of the journal Gut and received approval. A timeline for the process was prepared with core milestones.</p>
                <p>A plan for a mixed approach to training and support will be made. A planned hierarchy of involvement will consist of the core leadership team and the rest of the GDG. GDG members will support technical reviewing as well as guideline recommendation voting, with others supporting voting alone. The core leadership team will be offered bespoke GRADE training workshops through a collaboration with Professor Schünemann and Dr Miranda Lamgendam at the Department Epidemiology and Data Science, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The wider GDG will have additional resources made available supplemented with drop-in sessions to allow bespoke advice and education.</p>

                <title>GDG membership</title>
                <p>The GDG was formed in September 2021 following a general call, followed by targeted invitations through BSG media channels. This was to ensure a balance of professionals from a variety of disciplines, across both primary and secondary care. These included the following: gastroenterology, gastrointestinal surgery, paediatric gastroenterology, radiology, dermatology, rheumatology, pathology, pharmacy, clinical psychology, dietetics, specialist IBD nursing, charities including Crohn’s &amp; Colitis UK and contributions from service user representatives. A national call out from Crohn’s and Colitis UK facilitated identification of people living with IBD who joined the GDG. The group met online to outline the roles and operating procedures.</p>
                <p>The GDG members will be directed to general guidance in line with general guidance on established national processes from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2012 (NICE).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This will confirm that as members of the team, all GDG members agree to be coauthors of the full guideline, to maintain the confidentiality of open discussion and debate within the guideline process, as well as to the confidentiality of the content of the guideline prior to publication.</p>
                <p>Members will be asked to declare all conflicts of interest in line with BSG guidelines. The BSG will appoint a conflicts of interest chair to oversee the process.</p>

                <title>GDG priority setting and identifying target audience</title>
                <p>The GDG were invited to take part in an online Delphi process in February 2022. To manage this, the GDG was split into key areas, as per the 2019 BSG guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These subgroups included: diagnostics and classification, ulcerative colitis, CD, special considerations and service delivery. The identity and content of the subgroups will be changed based on the nature of the thematic questions identified and brought forward for evidence synthesis.</p>
                <p>The subgroups were given a list of all core thematic topics and specific thematic questions from the previous BSG IBD guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p>
                <p>The results were analysed to identify topics for the new guidelines based on consideration of two major factors:</p>

                <p>Final subgroups will be formed based on the thematic question grouping. Each of the subgroups will have a chair who will represent the subgroup in the core leadership team. They, together with collaborators from within each of the subgroups, will work closely with the core leadership team to produce technical reviews for the thematic questions within their subgroup. These would form the basis for consideration of recommendations within subgroup discussion prior to wider GDG voting. Each subgroup leads will be offered bespoke GRADE training. Both core leadership and subgroup meetings will be held throughout the process.</p>

                <p>The generation of questions has been guided by the GRADE guidelines.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As this is an update guideline, the process of prioritisation has been based on the thematic and PICO questions from the previous guideline. This allows the process to focus on generation of novel questions in areas that have emerged and refinement of existing questions.</p>
                <p>The generation of new questions is a key component of the Delphi prioritisation, asking for any new or uncovered areas to be presented in free text, with justification of the specific question. Analysis of these results has allowed new candidate questions to be considered by each of the GDG subgroups. With new questions added in a standard PICO format.</p>
                <p>Key areas of focus for refinement of all questions have been considered by the subgroups, guided by the framing question guidance.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These core elements of refinement around PICO questions and their specific application have been presented in draft form to the GDG and all feedback considered, with the final list below:</p>

                <p>The GDG determined which PICOs are likely to conducive to evidence synthesis and GRADE assessment of outcomes. This included all forms of evidence (observational and RCT). The GDG does not believe there is enough evidence to make a GRADE assessment for certain areas of interest. The GDG will have a number of options following GRADE guideline production methodology.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
                <p>The first will be to make GRADE recommendations recognising these limitations, justifying the factors that led to this (these may be strong or conditional). The second option is when the GDG will find it difficult or impossible to formally summarise and GRADE the evidence, but guideline panel members are confident that there is unequivocal benefit or harm from the proposed PICO response, a good practice statement may, under strict criteria, instead.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
                <p>At this stage, the GDG has identified PICOs that are likely to fall under the good practice statement context, due to lack of studies.

If risk of bias or GRADE ratings are not included, these will be completed using the approach below. Cochrane systematic reviews will be prioritised for inclusion, but with the same stipulations of updating analyses to include all studies.</p>

                        <p>MAYO score: The Mayo Clinic score is a tool used to evaluate the severity of ulcerative colitis (UC) in patients. It is based on a patient's clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and laboratory results. The score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The Mayo score takes into account factors such as the extent of colon involvement, the presence of ulcers, and the degree of inflammation seen on endoscopy. It is used to determine the severity of the disease, to monitor the response to treatment, and to guide decisions about therapy.</p>

                <title>Measures of treatment effect</title>
                <p>For the dichotomous outcomes, the treatment effect will be expressed as risk ratios with corresponding 95% CIs. For continuous outcomes, the treatment effect will be expressed as mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs. However, if the studies assessed the same continuous outcome differently, we will estimate the treatment effect using the standardised MD (SMD). We will present SMDs as SD units and interpret them as follows: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 a large effect.</p>

                <p>The participant will be the unit of analysis. For studies comparing more than two intervention groups, we will make multiple pair‐wise comparisons between all possible pairs of intervention groups. To avoid double counts, we will divide shared intervention groups evenly among the comparisons. For dichotomous outcomes, we will divide both the number of events and the total number of participants. For continuous outcomes, we will only divide the total number of participants, and leave the means and SD unchanged.</p>
                <p>We will include cross-over studies, but we will only pool their data if they were reported separately before and after cross-over, and we will only use pre-cross-over data. In the case of cluster-RCTs, we only use study data if the trial authors had used appropriate statistical methods in taking the clustering effect into account.</p>
