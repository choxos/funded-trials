                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Overconsumption is one of the most serious public health challenges in the UK and has been linked to increased consumption of food ordered through delivery platforms. This study tested whether repositioning foods and/or restaurant options in a simulated food delivery platform could help to reduce the energy content of users’ shopping basket.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">UK adult food delivery platform users (N = 9,003) selected a meal in a simulated platform. Participants were randomly allocated to a control condition (choices listed randomly) or to one of four intervention groups, (1) food options listed in ascending order of energy content, (2) restaurant options listed in ascending order of average energy content per main meal, (3) interventions 1 and 2 combined (4) interventions 1 and 2 combined, but food and restaurant options repositioned based on a kcal/price index to display options lower in energy but higher in price at the top. Gamma regressions assessed the impact of interventions on total energy content of baskets at checkout.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The energy content of participants’ baskets in the control condition was 1382 kcals. All interventions significantly reduced energy content of baskets: Compared to control, repositioning both foods and restaurants purely based on energy content of options resulted in the greatest effect (-209kcal; 95%CIs: -248,-168), followed by repositioning restaurants (-161kcal; 95%CIs: -201,-121), repositioning restaurants and foods based on a kcal/price index (-117kcals; 95%CI: -158,-74) and repositioning foods based on energy content (-88kcals; 95%CI: -130,-45). All interventions reduced the basket price compared to the control, except for the intervention repositioning restaurants and foods based on a kcal/price index, which increased the basket price.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This proof-of-concept study suggests repositioning lower-energy options more prominently may encourage lower energy food choices in online delivery platforms and can be implemented in a sustainable business model.</p>

              <p id="Par8">Analyses of major UK restaurant chains showed that only 9% of dishes had an energy content of less than 600 kcals a meal, and 47% of dishes were at least 1000 kcals or more, which equates to half of the daily-recommended energy intake for a woman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similar analyses of more discretionary food items on offer at restaurants, including starters, side dishes, and desserts, found over a fifth of foods in each category exceeded 600 kcal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Out-of-home consumption of meals from restaurants, cafes and takeaways, and in particular, consumption of takeaway or delivery food, have been associated with higher energy intake and higher BMI. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given the increasing use of delivery platforms, this is an important target for population-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">The environments in which food is purchased influence our behaviours. Automatic reactions to how options are presented to us in our environment, sometimes lead to choices and behaviours that may detrimentally affect our health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By changing the environment in which food is selected or purchased, it may be possible to increase the likelihood of selecting healthier foods through unconscious mechanisms and without restricting choice. Systematic reviews have identified that changing the positioning of food in physical environments can influence purchasing patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Similar patterns were seen in studies conducted in simulated online supermarkets, where ranking products in order of increasing saturated fat or energy content resulted in less saturated fat and less energy selected by participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Studies looking at the impact of such choice architecture interventions in restaurant-type settings have found that increasing availability of healthy foods, promotion and pricing changes were all effective in changing purchasing decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, similar interventions, which repositioned food items in supermarket settings (e.g. placing or removing items from end of aisles, changing which items were next to each other), found this could affect purchasing patterns, although with mixed effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, little is known about how choice architecture health promoting interventions affect behaviour in the context of food delivery platforms.</p>
              <p id="Par11">This proof-of-concept study explores how interventions repositioning lower-energy options to be more prominent influence food choices in a simulated food delivery platform and if these interventions can help to reduce the amount of energy selected.</p>

After eligibility and screening, participants were randomised to one of five study conditions. On the simulated delivery platform, participants were given the following instructions:<disp-quote><p id="Par30"><italic>Imagine you are using our online delivery platform to order food for a single meal for yourself. You can use our food delivery platform just like you would in real life: you can browse through multiple restaurants, view their menus, and add or remove foods from your basket. Once you are happy with your order you can click ‘checkout’ to complete the task.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="Par31">From here, participants were directed to the online delivery platform and completed the task, with foods and restaurants displayed in accordance with their randomised condition.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Participants received no set budget. They did not pay any money nor did they receive the food items they ordered. Participants were also asked questions about their age, gender, ethnicity, region, income, education level, height, weight, socioeconomic status, and the frequency with which they order from food delivery platforms. Data from these questions was then used for secondary analyses and as covariates in the models. Participants were given a small financial incentive by the panel provider upon completion of the study.</p>

Gamma regression was used for other outcomes and exploratory analyses, including the price of basket at checkout.

Gamma regression and linear regression were used respectively based on the expected skew of the outcome variables, with most expected to have a right-skew to which gamma regression was applied. Data were assessed visually to consider the skew of outcome variables and confirm the appropriate model was applied. R 4.1.3 was used for all analyses.</p>

              <p id="Par65">All the interventions tested in this study reduced the energy content of participants’ baskets, showing as a proof-of-concept that these approaches might have the potential to lower energy purchased from food delivery platforms. The greatest decrease was in the intervention that repositioned both foods and restaurants purely based on energy content. All interventions repositioning options purely based on energy content led to a decrease in total basket price, which may represent an implementation barrier for industry. An intervention designed to mitigate the potential reduction in revenue was successful in its aim, but less effective or no different in reducing the energy content of foods selected than the other price-agnostic interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par66">One of the strengths of this study is its relevance to real food purchasing platforms. The sample was large and broadly representative of the UK population and participants were free to choose a meal from a virtual site that closely mimicked online delivery platforms. The energy purchased in this study was comparable to energy content for takeaway food reported previously (medians for five takeaway food types of 1125–1820 kcal per meal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, this study took place in a simulated environment and participants were not spending their own money and were not receiving the food they ordered, which may limit the extent to which the findings generalise to real-world environments. Additionally, in the control condition, foods were positioned within categories completely at random, whereas in real-world settings, ordering may be determined by other factors (e.g. popularity, sponsored preferences). While this study demonstrates the potential for the effects of ordering, the degree of impact in a particular setting may vary depending on the extent to which it alters the existing ordering. In previous studies where the effect of labelling and other supermarket interventions were tested in online experimental settings, it was found that the online studies had a greater effect size than findings from real-world purchasing, but the trend and pattern of results was generally the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par67">As a proof-of-concept, this study shows the potential impact of repositioning options in food delivery platforms to promote health outcomes and explores strategies to promote health outcomes whilst protecting the bottom line of restaurants and delivery platforms. Voluntary implementation in real-world settings may be challenging, as was previously seen when voluntary food reformulation targets resulted in limited changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], suggesting some regulation may be required for effective implementation. In the absence of existing regulation, we aimed to test whether changes in positioning could be implemented in a manner that also retained revenue, to increase the likelihood of voluntary adoption, but this was less effective in its primary aim to reduce energy intake.</p>
              <p id="Par68">This study focused on prominent positioning of items at the top of the page, based on evidence from previous research that primacy effects are a critical factor in boosting selection in online settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This study did not consider any long-term adaptations to delivery platform changes though it is possible that individuals will adapt to changes in their food environment, and learn to scroll further through the list to find favoured items.</p>
              <p id="Par69">It has been suggested that interventions focusing on changing the choice architecture in people’s environments may reduce disparities due to the universal application of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Some of our findings are in line with this hypothesis. Specifically, there were no significant differences in the effects of interventions F, R, and FR between people from different SEP. However, for intervention FRP we found greater effects for people from higher versus lower SEP, possibly suggesting that these groups would have a greater benefit from these interventions, widening inequalities.</p>
              <p id="Par70">Post hoc we observed two other factors which may warrant further exploration. First, interventions that altered the restaurant position were more effective when participants accessed the study on a mobile phone compared to a desktop computer. This seems plausible since mobile device users may need to scroll further to see the same numbers of restaurants as on a desktop or laptop, and therefore be more likely to click on restaurants nearer the top. Second, the effect of interventions was smaller in the restaurants only repositioning conditions among participants who used food delivery platforms more often. One possible explanation for this is that frequent users may know more about how these platforms work, and more quickly search for what they want to select, rather than browsing.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par71">Repositioning of products and restaurants to make lower energy options more prominent in a simulated online delivery platform effectively reduced the amount of energy in recipients’ baskets. Although all interventions were effective, changing the order of both the foods and the restaurants was more effective than altering either alone. Further research is needed to better consider how to optimise these interventions and expand upon these proof-of-concept findings, but results indicate they could be implemented in a sustainable business model.</p>
