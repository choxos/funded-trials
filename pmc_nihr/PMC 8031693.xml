                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The craniofacial abnormalities found in infants with cleft palate (CP) decrease their airway patency and increase their risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We hypothesise that optimising sleep position in infants with CP may improve airway patency and offer a ‘low-cost, high-impact’ intervention to prevent the negative impacts of OSA. Because cleft centres give inconsistent advice about sleep position: some recommend back-lying and others side-lying, we will compare these in a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The aim is to determine the clinical effectiveness of side-lying as compared with back-lying sleep positioning in terms of reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA in 244 infants aged 3–5 weeks of age, diagnosed with an isolated CP in/by UK cleft centres. Primary outcome is the 4% Oxygen Desaturation Index measured using pulse oximetry during sleep.</p>

                  <title>Research plan</title>
                  <p>1. Multicentre randomised controlled trial of side-lying compared with back-lying sleep positioning in reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA in infants with CP at one month of age. 2. Internal pilot questionnaire-based study to support parents and clinicians regarding study participation, seeking to identify and address any barriers to recruitment. Monitoring data from the internal pilot will be used in the final analysis. 3. Co-development of new UK recommendations with Cleft Lip and Palate Association (CLAPA) regarding sleep position for infants with CP.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The craniofacial abnormalities found in children with cleft palate (CP)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> lead to reduction in airway size, and risk of airway obstruction ranging from intermittent airway collapse during sleep (obstructive sleep apnoea, OSA)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> to potentially life-threatening airway compromise<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> necessitating intubation or a tracheostomy. Children with CP are at increased risk of OSA when compared with otherwise ‘healthy’ children. There is evidence that severe OSA may be found in infants before cleft repair.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> In children and adults, sleep position is known to influence the patency of the airway during sleep. When investigating the effect of sleep position on OSA in infants with CP, the best sleep position would be expected to cause less airway collapse and a reduced frequency of oxygen desaturations resulting from OSA. Altering sleep position in infants with CP may offer a ‘low-cost, high-impact’ intervention to limit the negative impacts of OSA.</p>
              <p>Oxygen desaturations are known to have negative effects on the well-being of children and adults. Children with CP are at increased background risk of impairment in learning, memory and cognition<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with OSA recognised as having a potentially deleterious effect on cognitive development.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> In addition, infants with CP are at risk of poor weight gain and ‘failure to thrive’,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6–8</xref> which can be further exacerbated by co-existing OSA. The increased work of breathing associated with OSA, leads to increased energy expenditure, in infants already at risk of reduced calorific intake due to cleft-related feeding difficulties. Poor nutritional status is a significant, and potentially reversible, barrier to the desired surgical repair of a CP in infancy or early childhood.</p>
              <p>OSA can have significant and permanent negative effects on health and development in infants with CP. An observational study in a group of children with cleft lip and/or palate, reported that severe OSA in infancy had a significant negative impact on neurocognition, quality of life and weight gain measurable at 3 years.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Infant sleeping position is an emotionally charged topic: In 2009, the Department of Health published a leaflet entitled ‘Reduce the risk of cot death’ (<ext-link xlink:href="www.nhs.uk" ext-link-type="uri">www.nhs.uk</ext-link>) which advises parents to ‘place your baby on the back to sleep, in a cot in a room with you.’ We have found that there is a lack of evidence and clinical consensus regarding sleep position for infants with CP (7/12 UK centres advised side-lying and 5/12 back-lying).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This is confusing for parents and health professionals who have repeatedly expressed the need for clear and consistent information about the best sleeping position.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is considered to be an extreme type of CP, associated with a markedly underdeveloped mandible and significantly increased risk of OSA. The standard sleep position advice given for PRS is a side-lying position. Studies in infants with PRS have reported an improvement in feeding difficulty and subsequent weight gain, following early intervention to improve the airway.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Side-lying positioning has been postulated as a simple, low-cost therapeutic intervention to improve airway patency in children with OSA<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and those undergoing general anaesthesia<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> or sedation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
                <p>Cleft lip and/or palate are among the most common birth defects, occurring in approximately 1 per 500–700 births,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> of which approximately 45% have an isolated CP.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The provision of care for these children is organised into Regional Cleft Networks, comprising of one or two surgical centres. The Cleft Networks have a proven track-record of clinical and research collaboration, enhanced by a highly functional lead clinical nurse specialists (CNS) group that serves to facilitate dissemination of knowledge and sharing of best-practice initiatives.</p>

                <title>Aim and objectives</title>
                <p>The aim of this project is to determine the clinical effectiveness in infants with CP of side-lying as compared with back-lying sleep positioning in reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA. This is to develop evidence-based recommendations for cleft centres regarding the optimum sleep position for infants with CP. This will be achieved by:</p>

              <title>Methods and analysis</title>
              <p>This study protocol (V.1.1, 2020) describes the design of a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of sleep position in infants with CP in the UK. The study protocol conforms with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> while the RCT will conform to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for reporting RCTs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>An unblended, RCT of side-lying compared with back-lying sleep positioning in reducing oxygen desaturation resulting from OSA in infants with CP. Infants meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomised to side-lying or back-lying in a ratio 1:1 using a minimisation routine incorporating a random element to reduce predictability. Minimisation factors will be clinical site and syndrome suspected or indicated (yes/no). Allocations will be delivered via a password-protected web-based system. The allocated position will only be used on the night(s) when the infant is monitored for the study purposes. If the first attempt at oxygen monitoring is unsuccessful parents will have the chance to keep the equipment for another night. Thereafter, parents will be free to revert back to the standard sleep position as advised by their cleft centre, should it be different than that used for the monitoring period. All centres represented at our preparatory meeting with the UK Lead CNS group, confirmed that the side-lying position was recommended in some infants at their centre, irrespective of whether it was the standard advice used. As such, all centres had experience of the side-lying position. It was decided not to change the specific advice that centres give to parents regarding how to position the infant in a side-lying position, but any standard written or verbal information would be collected by the study documents. Study is planned to begin recruitment in June 2021.</p>

                  <p>The SLUMBRS2 study is a multicentred RCT. All cleft centres in the UK will be eligible to participate in the study provided that they are prepared to allow sleep position to be randomised. Participating centres will be required to allow for randomisation of the sleep position for their patients participating in the study. Parents will be randomly assigned advice regarding sleep position for their child, either side-lying or back-lying. It is possible that for some parents this advice will be different to that they received from their local cleft centre. Parents will only be asked to follow study related advice during their participation in the study, that is, up to 3 days (2 nights).</p>
                  <p>Participants recruited in the initial 6 months from opening the first study site will be asked to complete an additional questionnaire collecting information about their experience of participating in the study (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>). After 6 months, this information will be analysed and used as a basis for potential changes to the recruitment process and technical information on using the monitor, with the aim of supporting parents to consent to join the study.</p>

The sample size calculation comparing two means with unequal variances for the primary outcome was, therefore, based on a standardised effect size of 0.5. To account for potential unequal variances in each group a variance ratio of 2 was used in the calculations. To detect a difference of 0.5 SDS with 80% power and alpha equal to 0.05 would require 96 infants to be monitored in each arm of the trial (a total of 192 participants). Informed by the multicentre feasibility and oximetry studies the sample size will be inflated to 244 participants in the RCT, to allow for potential attrition of 21%.</p>

The information will enable the study team to identify which baby the recording belongs to once it is downloaded. The nurse will then explain to the parent/s how to switch the monitor on/off and how to attach the SpO<sub>2</sub> sensor to their infant. This will be done either in person if a home visit is possible or via the telephone/video call if a visit is to be a virtual one as part of the local measures for COVID-19. Parents will also be given a written instructions showing how to use the oximeter and web-link to an instruction video which they could view at any time to refresh their knowledge. The parents will be instructed to record in the sleep log if they remove the monitor or the baby wakes for a feed. The SpO<sub>2</sub> probe can be left on while the baby is feeding.</p>
                    <p>It is standard practice to silence the oximeter alarm for NHS home oximetry services. However, for the purposes of this study we will set the alarm at SpO<sub>2</sub> 70% and heart rate 80, a value that we would not expect to normally record during infant sleep.</p>
                    <p>The monitor will record the following parameters:</p>
                    <p>Mean SpO<sub>2.</sub></p>

                    <p>After the monitoring period has finished, parents will remove the SpO<sub>2</sub> probe and switch off the machine (switching off the machine will not lose the data, it will be stored). For safety purposes, all of the sleep oximetry sessions will be reviewed by the study respiratory physiologist or paediatrician within 2 weeks of the date of monitoring.</p>
                    <p>The respiratory physiologist and paediatrician (assessors) who will analyse oximetry readings will be blinded to the sleep position allocation. On the night of oximetry monitoring parents will complete the sleep log, where they will record if the sleep position is as randomised, as well as wake times. The sleep log will be provided to the oximetry assessors to aid with the analysis by helping to identify the sleep and wake times. Sleep log will also measure compliance with randomisation. As such assessors will not know the sleep position and will be blinded.</p>

Sleep monitoring is usually done at home in babies with CP who present with airway problems. Babies recruited to this study will not have airway concerns sufficient to mandate an airway intervention and therefore we would not expect clinically significant desaturation events.

All abnormal readings considered of clinical concern will prompt an urgent written report of the oximetry findings to the responsible cleft team within 2 weeks, and an additional telephone contact may be made with the cleft team dependent on the level of concern. An example of an oximetry finding that would be considered of clinical concern would be an ODI-4%&gt;25.

                  <title>Potential risks</title>
                  <p>SLUMBRS2 is an RCT which means that infants will be randomly allocated to one of the two sleeping positions, side-lying or back-lying. This means that there is a chance that for the 1–2 nights during the study some participants will be asked to follow advice that is contrary to the standard advice given by their cleft centre. This may cause distress to some participants. Current UK practice is that some Cleft Networks recommend side-lying and others back-lying sleep position as standard, and all recommend side-lying in some infants if they are concerned about airway obstruction. As such, both of the sleep positions being compared would represent ‘standard’ practice in some UK centres. The probe from the oximeter will be attached to a toe, to limit the chance of entanglement in the cable.</p>

                <p>The end of the study is defined to be the date on which data for all participants is frozen and data entry privileges are withdrawn from the study database. An end of study notification will be submitted to the Reserach Ethics Committee (REC) within 90 days of this date. An end of the study notification will be submitted to the REC within 15 days if the study is terminated prematurely. Investigators will inform the parents of participants of any premature termination of the study and ensure that the appropriate follow-up is arranged for all involved. A summary report of the study will be provided to the REC within 12 months of the end of study notification.</p>
                <p>All data will be stored for at least 10 years, in accordance with the sponsor’s standard operating procedure (SOP). Any queries or concerns about the data, conduct or conclusions of the study can also be resolved in this time. Limited data on the participants and records of any adverse events may be kept for longer if recommended by an independent advisory board.</p>

              <p>Study monitoring will be carried out to ensure that the rights and well-being of human participants are protected during the course of a clinical trial. The study will be subject to the audit and monitoring regimen of MFT, the study sponsor, in line with applicable MFT SOP and policies. The study will have, as a minimum, an annual survey sent out for completion by a member of the local research team.</p>

              <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
              <p>The study protocol has received the favourable opinion of the West Midlands-South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee. All participating sites must be granted NHS permission by their local Research Office prior to commencing recruitment. On completion of our study, the findings will be incorporated into clinical practice for the benefit of patients via the Lead CNS group (Hudson, chair). CNSs provide ‘hands-on’ care for infants with CP in the home and hospital settings and are ideally placed to highlight research priorities. They have been instrumental in defining and contextualising the research question. In addition, we will disseminate study results through Cleft Network study days and will create a short video which will summarise our study findings and recommendations which will be hosted on the websites <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.clapa.com/news-item/slumbers-sleep-study/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.clapa.com/news-item/slumbers-sleep-study/</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="https://Healthtalk.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://Healthtalk.org</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="https://Mft.nhs.uk" ext-link-type="uri">https://Mft.nhs.uk</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="http://craniofacialsociety.co.uk/" ext-link-type="uri">http://craniofacialsociety.co.uk/</ext-link>, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/</ext-link>. It will be co-developed with parents and CLAPA to inform parents and healthcare practitioners about the best sleep practice for infants with CP.</p>

              <title>Steps to mitigate against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
              <p>The study team acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of clinical research. Wherever possible and safe, the RCT will be delivered as intended. Steps are being taken to ensure that study information (eg, Participant Information Sheet) can be distributed electronically or by mail. Similarly any data that we collect (eg, sleep questionnaires and the sleep log) and informed consent can be collected electronically or by mail, to limit contact between researchers and families. Details of the impact of local and national restrictions at individual sites will be recorded on a monthly basis, using a bespoke impact document that would be available to the SMG, sponsor and funder.</p>
