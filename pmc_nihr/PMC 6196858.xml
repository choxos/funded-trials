                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Circulating prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> levels are elevated in acutely decompensated cirrhosis and have been shown to contribute to immune suppression. Albumin binds to and inactivates this immune-suppressive lipid mediator. Human albumin solution (HAS) could thus be repurposed as an immune-restorative drug in these patients.</p>
                  <p>This is a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT) to verify whether targeting a serum albumin level of ≥35 g/L in hospitalised patients with decompensated cirrhosis using repeated intravenous infusions of 20% HAS will reduce incidence of infection, renal dysfunction and mortality for the treatment period (maximum 14 days or discharge if &lt;14 days) compared with standard medical care.</p>

                  <p>Albumin To prevenT Infection in chronic liveR failurE stage 2 is a multicentre, open-label, interventional RCT. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis admitted to the hospital with a serum albumin of &lt;30 g/L are eligible, subject to exclusion criteria. Patients randomised to intravenous HAS will have this administered, according to serum albumin levels, for up to 14 days or discharge. The infusion protocol aims to increase serum albumin to near-normal levels.</p>
                  <p>The composite primary endpoint is: new infection, renal dysfunction or mortality within the trial treatment period. Secondary endpoints include mortality at up to 6 months, incidence of other organ failures, cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes and time to liver transplant. The trial will recruit 866 patients at more than 30 sites across the UK.</p>

                  <p>Research ethics approval was given by the London-Brent research ethics committee (ref: 15/LO/0104). The clinical trials authorisation was issued by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (ref: 20363/0350/001–0001). The trial is registered with the European Medicines Agency (EudraCT 2014-002300-24) and has been adopted by the National Institute for Health Research (ISRCTN 14174793). This manuscript refers to version 6.0 of the protocol. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. Recruitment of the first participant occurred on 25 January 2016.</p>

              <p>Liver disease is an increasing cause of mortality currently in the UK and is the fifth most common cause of death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These deaths are predicted to double over the next 20 years<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Mortality is mainly seen in the middle-aged group. Liver disease has surpassed lung and breast cancers as the leading causes of years of working life lost, and are set to overtake ischaemic heart disease within 2–3 years<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p>
              <p>Patients with complications of liver failure secondary to liver cirrhosis are described as decompensated patients. They are highly prone to bacterial infection<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> secondary to immune dysfunction,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection rates of 35% compared with 5% in non-cirrhotic patients.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Of those who develop infection with organ dysfunction, 60%–95% will die, often following prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) admission.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There is, however, no medical strategy to restore immune competence.</p>
              <p>It has been demonstrated that elevated circulating prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) levels contribute to immune suppression in acutely decompensated patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The plasma protein albumin binds and catalyses the inactivation of PGE<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The binding capacity of endogenous albumin is known to be defective in cirrhosis<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> and improves following albumin infusions.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Albumin is synthesised in the liver and levels fall as the synthetic function of the liver declines in advanced cirrhosis. Therefore, low albumin levels, with defective binding function, make PGE<sub>2</sub> more bioavailable. We found a serum albumin of &lt;30 g/L predicted plasma-induced macrophage dysfunction in a small cohort of decompensated cirrhosis patients<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and this was reversed when albumin levels were increased to ≥30 g/L. This finding has recently been validated in a multicentre clinical trial<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; however, it is not known if these ex vivo observations translate into an improvement in clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>We propose a novel strategy to repurpose 20% human albumin solution (HAS) as an immune-restorative drug in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis with the aim of maintaining serum albumin at near-normal levels.</p>
              <p>The Albumin To prevenT Infection in chronic liveR failurE (ATTIRE) phase II single-arm, multicentre feasibility trial<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> (n=80) verified that daily intravenous human albumin infusions restored serum albumin levels to near normal in hospitalised patients with decompensated cirrhosis, that it was safe and that there was physician equipoise prior to proceeding to a large randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It has also allowed refinement of our definitions of RCT outcomes.</p>
              <p>This phase III RCT (n=866) will assess the impact of 20% HAS treatment on the incidence of nosocomial infections, organ dysfunction and mortality in patients admitted to hospital with decompensation of liver cirrhosis.</p>

This needs to be clearly recorded in the patient’s CRF, and if HAS is given for any other indication in the Standard of Care arm, this will be considered a protocol deviation.

                <p>Patients who have had a previous diagnosis of liver cirrhosis were involved in the development of the research question and outcome measures. Patient feedback led to the addition of QOL evaluation. The study protocol and patient information leaflets were reviewed by our patient representatives with positive feedback. In addition, an independent patient representative sat on the ethics approval panel. Results will be disseminated to patients via open access publication and our local trials teams.</p>

                  <p>A 30% incidence of nosocomial infection in acute decompensated cirrhosis patients is well documented with up to 30% of these patients developing organ dysfunction<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 29</xref> and an overall mortality of 38% at 1 month.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 29</xref> These figures are supportive of 30% as a conservative estimate for the composite primary endpoint of incidence of new infection, renal dysfunction or mortality up to 14 days from randomisation.</p>
                  <p>We have assumed that the ‘immune-restorative’ albumin treatment would reduce this rate by 30% to a rate of 21%, which would be considered clinically relevant. Three hundred eighty-nine patients per arm would be sufficient to detect such a difference with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05. Allowing for loss to follow-up/withdrawal of 10% from the trial, we will aim to recruit 433 to each arm (866 in total).</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome is the difference in event rates, according to treatment, of the composite endpoint of infection, renal dysfunction and mortality within the intervention period (from ≥24 hours from the start of treatment/randomisation up to a maximum of 14 days or up to discharge if this is prior to 14 days).</p>
                  <p>Since the primary outcome has a binary classification, logistic regression will be used to determine whether there is any difference in rates due to treatment, by inclusion of a binary covariate indicating treatment. The results will be adjusted for predetermined prognostic factors used as stratifying variables in the randomisation, which shall be included as additional covariates in the model. The model coefficient due to treatment will give an estimate of the difference in log odds, or equivalently (exponentiated to give) an estimate of the odds multiplier, that is, the change in odds of a negative outcome on the composite endpoint due to treatment with albumin. It is expected that this effect will be negative, so that treatment with albumin is seen to reduce the odds of a negative outcome. A reduction from 30% to 21% would be associated with a reduction in odds of around 38%. Predicted probabilities will be presented for the composite outcome for each of the treatment arms, adjusted for the model covariates.</p>
                  <p>The effect of treatment on the individual components, infection, renal dysfunction and mortality will be reported separately.</p>

                <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                <p>The economic evaluation will consist of two parts. The primary analysis will be a decision analytic model comparing the expected lifetime costs and benefits of treatment reported in terms of the cost per incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. QALYs will be calculated based on the health-related QOL (HRQL) and mortality data collected during the trial. HRQL will be measured according to the 5 level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.euroqol.org">www.euroqol.org</ext-link>), which we will collect at baseline, discharge, 3 months and 6 months (+/–1 month) for each individual patient. If patients are rerandomised, they will have separate follow-up events for each episode of rerandomisation, unless the patient is rerandomised within the follow-up phase of the study. Utility scores will be calculated using UK-specific tariffs and adjusting for baseline differences in patients in the trial arms if necessary. These will be extrapolated over the expected lifetime of the patient and where necessary will draw on the existing literature. The final form of the decision analytic model will be determined during the trial period. Appropriate methods for estimating changes in health over time, such as state-transition models, will be given consideration.</p>
                <p>The secondary economic analysis will be a ‘within-trial’ analysis, reporting on the incremental cost and benefits observed during the trial period and follow-up periods. The cost-effectiveness measures in the within-trial analysis will be the incremental cost per infection avoided and the incremental cost per QALY gained. Costs will be measured as described below. Infections avoided will be derived from the primary outcome in the trial.</p>
                <p>Patient resource use will be assessed using hospital patient records and a self-complete resource use form, the client services receipt inventory (CSRI). The volume of resource use for each cost component will be measured directly in the trial from patient records and using the CSRI. A detailed economic evaluation analysis plan will be developed for approval by the TSC.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>ATTIRE is a UK multicentre trial that aims to evaluate the repurposing of HAS as an immune-restorative drug. This protocol describes the RCT which will determine if administering daily 20% HAS infusions in order to increase serum albumin to near-normal levels after admission to hospital will reduce rates of infection, renal failure and death in patients with decompensation of liver cirrhosis.</p>
              <p>In liver cirrhosis, current evidence-based guidance<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> advocates the use of HAS in large-volume paracentesis,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> HRS<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and SBP.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> The mechanism behind current usage of albumin is that of volume expansion. However, many hepatologists believe albumin has other medicinal properties; however, a large-scale interventional clinical trial is yet to support this hypothesis. Ex vivo analysis from the ATTIRE feasibility study supported an immune-restorative role for albumin<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; however, it is unknown whether this correlates with clinical outcome. Our inclusion criteria are broad and designed to represent the decompensated cirrhotic population admitted to UK hospitals in order to make trial outcomes highly relevant in an era of soaring liver disease with few available treatment options. Preventing a liver cirrhosis-related infection could potentially provide a bridge to liver transplantation, which represents the only curative option for these patients.</p>
              <p>The design of this RCT has been refined based on the outcomes of an 80-patient interventional feasibility study.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Our targeted infusion protocol (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) was effective at increasing serum albumin, even in patients with a very low starting serum albumin. Many hepatology trials focus solely on 28-day survival; however, mortality requires large sample size and may be caused by other factors unrelated to infection. We considered that endpoints for interventions to prevent infection should be assessed at an earlier stage during the patient admission using ward-based clinical measures and laboratory data. Multiple components of a primary composite endpoint were tested in our feasibility study.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Defining infection according to clinician diagnosis, triggering completion of an infection CRF, with a substantial proportion blindly scrutinised by a microbiology panel worked well in our feasibility study. Patients that developed renal dysfunction as assessed by an increase in serum creatinine had a poor prognosis, as expected. However, only one patient developed cerebral dysfunction reflecting severe hepatic encephalopathy (&gt;grade 3) suggesting under-reporting and the majority of patients that solely triggered respiratory and cardiovascular endpoints had a good outcome. This is counterintuitive as organ dysfunction is a key predictor of poor prognosis and we consider our data cast significant doubt over whether these dysfunctions can be recorded accurately in largely ward-based patients across multiple sites. This precludes their use as part of our RCT primary composite endpoint; although these will be reported.</p>
              <p>Studies evaluating the safety of HAS infusions have generally shown it to be a safe treatment.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 34–36</xref> The main concerns in the cirrhotic population are related to volume overload leading to pulmonary oedema and increase in portal pressure leading to variceal bleeding. A recent interventional trial in septic decompensated patients reported an 8.3% rate of pulmonary oedema in the albumin treatment group.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, the weight-based albumin dosing regimen on days 1 and 3 in this study led to much larger volumes of albumin prescribed than suggested in our protocol for these days. This and other studies in cirrhosis have not reported an increased incidence in variceal bleeding.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 33 38</xref></p>
              <p>A challenge this study faces is the lack of a comparator infusion fluid in the control arm and hence the impossibility of site investigator and patient blinding. We had therefore considered comparison with another fluid such as 0.9% sodium chloride; however, this posed a number of problems. Physician preference for resuscitation fluid varies substantially and, in preliminary discussions, many objected to the additional salt load associated with 0.9% sodium chloride, in the non-albumin arm, if the patient did not require fluid resuscitation. Administration of 20% HAS for SBP, LVP and HRS is standard of care, and therefore, if patients in either arm developed these complications during their admission, they would have to be unblinded to see if they were already receiving 20% HAS as part of the trial. As a significant number of patients do develop these complications, the consequent number of unblinded patients could have rendered the process invalid. Therefore, the RCT had to be an open-label study. This risks biasing adverse event reporting in the treatment arm, making albumin appear unsafe. We therefore felt that an open-label trial design versus a comparator arm of current standard of care was the only pragmatic solution. It could be argued that any improved outcome in the albumin treatment arm may simply be due to additional fluid resuscitation. The mean volume of 20% HAS infused over the treatment period (14 days) was 1 L in our feasibility study.</p>
              <p>The regulation of HAS administration in the standard of care (control) arm poses a challenge as HAS is routinely used in clinical practice based on evidence-based guidelines.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> The protocol allows use for these indications. If HAS is administered to control arm patients outside of current evidence-based guidance, this will be defined as a protocol deviation and the IDMC will be monitoring these events closely.</p>
              <p>The ATTIRE RCT (n=866, up to 40 centres) began recruitment in April 2016 and aims to complete in December 2019. The medicinal properties of albumin in the hepatological community have long been questioned. The outcomes of this large, multicentre, RCT will be highly relevant to improving the care of hospitalised patients with decompensation of chronic liver disease.</p>
