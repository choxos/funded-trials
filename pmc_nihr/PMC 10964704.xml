                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Depression ranks as the foremost mental health concern among childbearing women. Within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), between 20 and 25% of women encounter depression during pregnancy or soon after delivery. This condition impacts not only the mothers but also their offspring. Offspring of women suffering from postnatal depression (PND) exhibit suboptimal cognitive development and increased emotional and behavioural issues throughout their growth. This scenario becomes more pronounced in LMICs, where numerous adversities further jeopardise children’s developmental progress. Despite antenatal services providing a pivotal platform to address women’s mental health needs, PND treatment remains inaccessible in many LMICs. The World Health Organization advocates interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for treating depression. While research from high-income countries has established the efficacy of IPT and group-IPT (g-IPT) for PND, its effectiveness within the LMIC context and its potential benefits for child development remain uncharted. This study seeks to gauge the potency of g-IPT for women with PND in two LMICs.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This multi-site randomised controlled trial is a continuation of two preceding phases—conceptual mapping and a feasibility study executed in Lebanon and Kenya. Insights gleaned from these phases underpin this comprehensive RCT, which contrasts the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of high-quality standard care (HQ-SC) augmented with g-IPT against HQ-SC in isolation. The trial, characterised as an individually randomised superiority assessment, targets women with postnatal depression in Beirut, Lebanon, and Nairobi, Kenya. It aims to determine if culturally tailored g-IPT, administered within community settings in both countries, outperforms HQ-SC in influencing child developmental outcomes, maternal depression, and the quality of the mother–child bond.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The SUMMIT trial, designed with pragmatism, possesses the magnitude to evaluate g-IPT within two LMIC frameworks. It seeks to enlighten policymakers, service commissioners, professionals, and users about g-IPT’s potential to alleviate maternal PND and bolster child developmental outcomes in LMICs. Additionally, the trial will generate valuable data on the clinical and economic merits of high-quality standard care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par51">Post-natal depression (PND) stands as a predominant mental health condition, posing a global challenge to both maternal health and child development, with a pronounced impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Depression represents the most significant portion of the mental disorder burden among childbearing women globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Contemporary pooled prevalence estimates pinpoint that 19.2% of women in low-income countries and 18.7% in middle-income nations grapple with major depression during pregnancy and postpartum, figures nearly twice as high as those in high-income countries (HICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nationally, PND prevalence exhibits a distinct socio-economic gradient. PND rates surge in the context of heightened socio-economic deprivation, gender-based violence, and emotional maltreatment and in settings marked by humanitarian crises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par52">Beyond the suffering and disability endured by women with PND, ample evidence underscores that their children are predisposed to significant cognitive impairments and compromised mental and physical well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These suboptimal developmental outcomes for children are attributed to the deterioration in the quality and sensitivity of mother-infant interactions linked to the mother’s PND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The enduring adverse effects of maternal depression on child development are particularly pronounced when coupled with other risk elements like poverty, limited parental education, and coexistent maternal physical and psychological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These risk elements are more prevalent in LMICs. Consequently, addressing maternal PND emerges as a pressing public health concern and a principal focus for policymakers. Their aim is to improve both maternal well-being and early childhood development, striving to diminish health disparities in alignment with the directives of the Sustainable Development Goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par53">Effective intervention for PND can mitigate the detrimental effects of poverty on child development, given its clear characterisation as a modifiable risk factor often recognised during periods of heightened health service engagement, even in resource-constrained environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For numerous women in LMICs, antenatal and immediate postnatal periods represent unique encounters with healthcare, presenting a pivotal opportunity to diagnose and manage maternal mental health issues and bolster early child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet, notwithstanding the profound consequences of PND for maternal and child health outcomes, and the significant potential gains of effective interventions, there remains a conspicuous paucity of dedicated research and scant formal health service allocation. This dearth is discernible even in HICs, including the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but the discrepancy is most pronounced in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par54">A robust body of evidence endorses the utility of psychological therapies for treating adult depression, with several interventions demonstrating moderate to large treatment effects when compared to waitlist controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Informed by this evidence and its literature review, the UK’s National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) advocates for cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, behavioural activation, and behavioural couples therapy, alongside antidepressant medication, for adults experiencing moderate to severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Similarly, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) mhGAP programme, dedicated to reviewing and disseminating evidence-driven mental health interventions in resource-limited settings, endorses cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and behavioural activation (BA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">Group interpersonal therapy (g-IPT) emerges as a particularly promising modality for addressing postnatal depression within an LMIC milieu. The WHO champions g-IPT as a primary treatment for depression, and its mhGAP initiative incorporates an 8-session group framework deployable by supervised facilitators lacking prior mental health expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A randomised controlled study led by Bolton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] evidenced that g-IPT, when administered by trained local residents, markedly ameliorated depression and functional deficits in a rural Ugandan setting. A Kenyan-based open trial reflected that g-IPT, facilitated by comparably trained personnel, was deemed acceptable, feasible, and induced significant symptomatic and functional enhancements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Qualitative studies have provided support for the experienced relevance of the IPT framework in Kenya and Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In Lebanon, in collaboration with the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, clinicians have prioritised g-IPT for PND as a key training domain, with capacity-building initiatives for individual g-IPT delivery in progress. Notably, while g-IPT has not been extensively employed for PND within LMICs, a 2018 meta-analysis encompassing 28 studies from high-income countries (HICs) ascertained that g-IPT consistently ameliorates depression, anxiety, and interpersonal dynamics in perinatal women, exhibiting notable effect magnitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">Several investigations have tailored g-IPT to cater to socio-economically marginalised women, demonstrating its aptness for low-income women facing treatment accessibility challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The relational emphasis of g-IPT is especially pertinent during the transitional phase of motherhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], offering a structured array of therapeutic interventions that address depressive symptoms while concurrently supporting the mother–child relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The forthcoming trial proposes a culturally adapted g-IPT for PND, building upon prior research and the study team’s preliminary efforts in northern Uganda. Here, g-IPT has been adapted for a financially constrained rural cohort of women with infants and has been incorporated into an NGO-driven nutrition initiative to counteract stunting. This foundation also exploits insights from feasibility studies executed in Nairobi and Beirut. The preliminary stages of the present research initiative have harnessed collaborative endeavours to construct contextually appropriate postnatal mental health care models for depression, delineating locally pertinent care pathways for screening, treatment, and risk management. This has facilitated the culturally sensitive adaptation of g-IPT. The subsequent randomised controlled trial is poised to evaluate the modified g-IPT’s efficacy in enhancing maternal depression and child developmental outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par57">Although there is compelling evidence validating the effectiveness of psychological therapies like g-IPT in managing PND, and robust models are available for tailoring such interventions to resource-limited settings, the proof of their capacity to boost child outcomes by mitigating the impact of the child’s exposure to maternal depression remains inconclusive, primarily due to insufficiently powered investigations. Cuijpers and co-authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] concluded that addressing maternal PND via psychological therapy results in enhanced child outcomes, registering an average effect size of <italic>d</italic> = 0.40. However, only five studies (all originating from HICs) contributed to this effect estimate, characterised by their limited scale (each having group sizes of <italic>N</italic> &lt; 50) and diverse outcomes and intervention methodologies. The relatively expansive trial orchestrated by Rahman et al., which was not initially conceptualised to gauge treatment effects on child cognitive or emotional evolution, subsequently reported no enduring advantages for child outcomes resulting from PND intervention, despite a pronounced positive effect on maternal mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the extended interval between treatment completion and this subsequent evaluation at age 7 circumscribes the inferences that might be extrapolated from this investigation.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Given the substantial evidence linking PND to detrimental effects on child development, especially in LMIC settings, coupled with the paucity and variable quality of evidence on the efficacy of depression treatments in offsetting these impacts, there is an urgent need for well-controlled trials in resource-limited contexts. To drive advances in this field, it is imperative that subsequent PND trials are conducted in LMIC settings, integrated within sustainable healthcare infrastructures. Furthermore, such trials should be methodically designed to possess sufficient power to discern realistic downstream effects on child outcomes (e.g. <italic>d</italic> = 0.40) and should employ rigorous—and, wherever feasible, objective—means of assessing children’s developmental outcomes. The current trial is part of a larger research programme that has involved conceptual mapping work to enhance understanding of how PND is experienced and thought about in both Lebanon and Kenya, as well as a feasibility trial. The feasibility trial, which concluded in November 2022, recruited 87 participants in Kenya and 35 in Lebanon, and randomised them into either the intervention (High-Quality Standard Care plus g-IPT) or control arm High-Quality Standard Care (HQ-SC only), allowing us to test the randomisation system for this RCT. Both interventions were delivered and participants were followed up for 24 weeks. This RCT will draw on the lessons learned during the feasibility phase and will expand the capacity to deliver a full trial.</p>

We aim to recruit mothers with infants aged between 6 and 35 weeks. This specific developmental window allows us to use a consistent set of well-validated measures for this rapidly developing group of children. Additionally, it reflects the peak child age during which PND is most likely to present to services. Clinicians will pinpoint service users within their caseload who align with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will collaborate with researchers to initiate contact.

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par89">Group interpersonal psychotherapy (g-IPT) is a talk therapy developed in the 1970s as a structured and time-bound treatment for adults with depression. Rooted in the interpersonal psychoanalysis of Sullivan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the attachment theory of Bowlby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], it places a significant emphasis on interpersonal relationships, life transitions, and therapeutic alliance. The therapy can be delivered both individually or in groups, as in g-IPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Originally, the treatment was designed to address depressive symptoms, lessen interpersonal conflicts, and enhance interpersonal skills. To date, g-IPT has been recognised as an effective remedy for various mental health disorders and is also deemed valuable as a preventive intervention. Central to g-IPT is the notion that interpersonal adversities, such as grief, disputes, role transitions, loneliness, and social isolation, can instigate and exacerbate depression. The therapy strives for recovery from the current depressive episode by shedding light on the correlation between the onset of depressive symptoms and interpersonal problems, coupled with skill-building to manage these issues more effectively. Given g-IPT’s emphasis on interpersonal role changes, disputes, isolation, and diminished social support, it is particularly pertinent to challenges women might encounter during and post-pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par90">For this study, HQ-SC has been selected as the control treatment. Based on the WHO’s stress management guide titled “Doing What Matters in Times of Stress” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], HQ-SC is a guided psychoeducation intervention administered over two sessions. Ethical standards mandate that once women diagnosed with PND are pinpointed, they should receive some form of support. For our study, it was imperative to opt for a control treatment consistent across both countries, irrespective of differing cultural backgrounds. The conventional treatment (TAU) for PND in both Kenya and Lebanon can diverge in terms of accessibility and modes of delivery.</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par91">After completing the baseline outcome measures, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention arm (HQ-SC plus g-IPT) or the control arm (HQ-SC). All trial participants will receive HQ-SC. Those assigned to the intervention arm will subsequently receive g-IPT.</p>
                  <p id="Par92"><italic>High-quality standard care</italic>: In both Kenya and Lebanon, high-quality standard care (HQ-SC), known as “Doing What Matters in Times of Stress” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], teaches participants how to use a stress management guide over the course of two group sessions, with each taking between 60 and 90 min. This guide aids them in developing practical skills to handle stress effectively. Grounded in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], it is designed for anyone over 18 years of age, with its brief nature allowing for quick reading. This intervention will be extended to all women in the trial, regardless of other available interventions in the pathway of standard care.</p>
                  <p id="Par93"><italic>Group interpersonal psychotherapy</italic> (g-IPT): g-IPT is an evidence-backed, time-limited psychotherapy tailored for depressive disorders, encompassing post-natal depression. It has been practised and validated in LMICs by professionals and trained laypersons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The therapy’s goal is to address interpersonal triggers of depressive episodes, segmented into four problem areas: grief, disputes, life changes, and loneliness/social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has globally disseminated group IPT through a nine-session protocol (1 individual and 8 group sessions), which is employed in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These g-IPT sessions typically last 1.5 h, except for the initial individual session (up to 2 h) and the concluding session (2–3 h). These sessions are held weekly and consist of groups of 6–10 women.</p>
                  <p id="Par94"><italic>Adaptation of g-IPT</italic>: IPT had been previously adapted to the Kenyan and Lebanese contexts for cultural and situational relevance in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, further refinements have been made for this specific study population and regional contexts. These adaptations in content and delivery of g-IPT contemplate each location’s cultural norms for young mothers related to intimacy, authority, daily routines, interactions, child-rearing practices, and communication standards (like expressions of closeness, including mother–child attachment, aggression, assertiveness, etc.). Also considered are the current societal, familial, and individual stressors arising from social instability, increased poverty, and scarce resources, which are prevalent in both regions, albeit in varied forms. Notably, issues like domestic violence and grave livelihood challenges are anticipated to be pertinent for both nations. These adaptations were meticulously documented during the pre-trial and feasibility stages, employing the Framework for Modification and Adaptations-Enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Feedback from participants in the feasibility trial was integrated iteratively, refining the g-IPT model, which culminated in the final clinical protocol to be assessed in the RCT.</p>
                  <p id="Par95"><italic>g-IPT training</italic>: For the sake of sustainability and scalability, the qualifications of g-IPT providers will differ between the two study sites. In Lebanon, in line with recent national regulations for accredited psychotherapy provision, trial providers will be licensed psychologists associated with primary care locations, with one facilitator per group. In contrast, Kenya, which has adopted a task-shifting approach to bolster capacity in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], will utilise community health workers, assigning two facilitators per group. Supervisors across both sites will be professionals previously trained in IPT, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers. The training and implementation of the intervention will be overseen by two US-based g-IPT master trainers.</p>
                  <p id="Par96">We will adopt the apprenticeship model of psychotherapy training, which entails a three-tiered system for sustainable capacity building: master trainers, local supervisors, and g-IPT providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The master trainers, aided by local supervisors, will conduct a 4-day didactic g-IPT workshop for facilitators. This will be followed by a standardised g-IPT knowledge test with a set “pass” threshold. Facilitators who pass this test will subsequently receive supervision in weekly meetings (either onsite or online) for two groups per facilitator. These sessions will be led by the local supervisors, with occasional assistance from the master trainers. Facilitators’ competence will be gauged using a g-IPT fidelity checklist during these supervision sessions. Only facilitators who achieve a mean score per group that meets or exceeds 75% of the “adequately competent” benchmark at designated intervals (one during the pre-group phase, one at the outset, two mid-way, and one at the end) will be certified to conduct the study. Following the completion of their inaugural training case, trainees will attend a 2-day advanced workshop. Orchestrated by master trainers and local supervisors, this workshop will fortify both knowledge and expertise.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Priority will be given to supporting both facilitators and supervisors, especially considering they are contending with persistent socioeconomic challenges in both regions. A communal spirit of mutual support and collaboration will be cultivated via group supervision and inter-site conferences. These gatherings will facilitate the exchange of experiences, ideas, and assistance in applying the IPT model.</p>

                  <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                  <p id="Par98">By agreeing to participate in the trial, participants are giving their consent for intervention, assessments, follow-up, and data collection. However, participants retain the right to withdraw from the study at any point, without the obligation to provide a reason. The study also reserves the right to withdraw participants from treatment under certain circumstances, such as if a designated clinician deems it necessary. Such a decision may arise if there is a notable worsening of symptoms or if the participant develops a new condition that necessitates a different treatment delivered individually. For example, if a participant reports worsening symptoms such as suicidal ideation during their participation in the trial they will be referred to a clinician for review and may be offered additional talking therapy or medication if deemed appropriate.</p>

                  <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                  <p id="Par99">In ensuring the integrity of this study, we adhere to the fidelity domains outlined by the NIH Behavior Change Consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. For the study design, our approach is rooted in the interpersonal theory of depression. Both g-IPT and HQ-SC are meticulously standardised in terms of their duration and frequency. We have designed the recruitment and delivery process to avoid any contamination, and any implementation challenges arising will be reviewed in regular weekly meetings that include representatives from the study sites, the training team, and University College London (UCL).</p>
                  <p id="Par100">g-IPT facilitators are considered competently trained once they achieve predetermined benchmarks. These include attending at least 80% of the training workshop and supervision sessions, scoring 70% or above in the knowledge test, and reaching a 75% benchmark in g-IPT fidelity on the checklists. The delivery of g-IPT is firmly based on a manual. We are open to potential content adaptations, provided they remain true to the original model. Before launching the RCT, any such amendments will be incorporated into the manual. Our monitoring efforts during the implementation phase include offering consistent feedback to facilitators and selecting a random subset for competence evaluation to ascertain their adherence to the model. Supervisors will oversee these evaluations, with oversight from the master trainers. We aim to evaluate the fidelity of approximately 22% of all sessions through a randomised sampling approach.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">Our approach aims to enhance participant engagement from the outset, starting with the pre-group meeting. Our goal is to ensure that every participant not only receives but fully understands the g-IPT skills. We will keep a close eye on session attendance and promptly address any signs that a participant might be at risk of dropping out. The comprehension of participants will be consistently assessed during both onsite and online supervisions, wherein facilitators will elaborate on how they communicated the concepts and how participants responded. Finally, to monitor the enactment of treatment skills, we will observe and bolster participants’ ability to apply g-IPT skills in their day-to-day lives. This will be achieved through regular discussions centred on participants’ practice between sessions, often referred to as “homework”.</p>

Additionally, they will be prompted to answer questions about the health and welfare of their child. Before participants begin the questionnaires, the content will be summarised for them, and they will be reminded of their right to withdraw. This ensures that individuals who might find certain topics challenging or triggering are forewarned and can choose not to participate.</p>
                <p id="Par126">Many of the questionnaires and interview questions have their roots in clinical contexts, ensuring their potential emotional impact on respondents has been thoroughly assessed.

This will cover the entirety of the RCT measures pack, as well as guidelines on engaging with participants, conducting interviews, and inputting data. For this particular study, we will employ live data collection methods. Specifically, outcome measures will be input directly into the REDCap database via the REDCap mobile app. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture, (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures, (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, and (4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].

For those who do not possess a personal phone, we will collect contact numbers of partners, family members, or even neighbours to maintain an open line of communication throughout the study. In Kenya, our study team will leverage the aid of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) to assist with participant engagement. These CHVs will prove invaluable in locating participants, especially in instances where the research team faces difficulties in reaching them by phone. As the CHVs maintain affiliations with both health facilities and the communities where the study is to be conducted, they offer a unique and effective bridge. To further promote retention, our local teams will liaise with participants to ensure that follow-up visits are scheduled with the utmost flexibility in mind.</p>
                <p id="Par129">Should a participant miss any or all of the intervention sessions (be it HQ-SC or g-IPT), our research team will still conduct follow-up.

Participant costs will encompass travel, care-seeking, and opportunity costs. Provider costs will be categorised into set-up and implementation and will be approximated using a combination of bottom-up and top-down methodologies. Both financial and economic costs will be determined by considering indirect costs such as volunteer time and donated goods. The results will display the average cost per participant for both g-IPT and HQ-SC from the viewpoints of the provider, participant, and society (combining both provider and participant). The financial expenditure of implementation will estimate the total amount necessary to provide HQ-SC and g-IPT on a larger scale. All outcomes will be delineated separately for Kenya and Lebanon in both local currencies and international dollars.</p>
                <p id="Par145">These costs will be amalgamated with trial outcomes to compute the cost-effectiveness of g-IPT in comparison to HQ-SC. The primary analysis will have a time horizon of 52 weeks, consistent with the trial’s follow-up duration. Net differences in expenses between g-IPT and HQ-SC will be juxtaposed with net differences in outcomes to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). ICER computations will be rooted in primary (PHQ-9) and secondary (quality-adjusted life years) trial results. Sensitivity analyses will probe the influence of varying factors such as analysis duration, pivotal cost components, and the confidence intervals of trial outcomes. The trial’s equity impact will be assessed by analysing income quantiles and measurements of multidimensional poverty.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par162">PND is a pressing public health concern which impacts substantially on both maternal health and child development. While research from high-income countries has established the efficacy of IPT and group-IPT (g-IPT) for PND, its effectiveness within the LMIC context and its potential benefits for child development remain uncharted and this study will provide a rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to HQ-SC in two LMICs. The design of this study has been strengthened by the conceptual mapping and feasibility phases which have ensured appropriate adaptation of g-IPT for the contexts and populations it is being delivered to, as well as mapping and strengthening local care pathways to ensure the sustainability of the treatment if it is found to be effective and cost-effective. With this phase of the research programme complete, the RCT can proceed with reasonable confidence that the protocol detailed above is acceptable to all the sites and that recruitment, data collection, and training are feasible in all locations. The trial will also deliver data on the clinical and economic benefits of the low-cost control treatment. It is anticipated that the trial’s findings will help to inform future decision-making about policy and services both in Kenya and Lebanon and beyond.</p>
              <p id="Par163">A challenge facing this programme is the current inadequacy of perinatal mental health services at both sites. This is marked within the refugee population in the Lebanon and across the low socio-economic status population in Nairobi. The lack of specialised mental health care resources and community-based mental health services in Lebanon is a major contributor to the treatment gap (WHO-AIMS Lebanon, 2010). Local communities have been under tremendous pressure to meet the high demands, especially with the surge of displaced Syrians, stretching resources and infrastructures that were already insufficient for the hosting communities. In order to meet these needs, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) of Lebanon initiated the National Mental Health Programme in 2015, which initiated a 5-year Mental Health Strategy (2015–2020), currently extended until 2030. The programme’s goal is to provide vulnerable populations with comprehensive, integrated, and responsive mental health services in community-based settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Currently, in Kenya, there is no screening of mental health conditions in the primary health care facilities; most postnatal women who come to the facility for child immunisation or well-child clinic are experiencing mental health conditions, but because there is no screening happening, these women go home with their conditions undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. While this presents a significant challenge to be met during this RCT, it also highlights the urgency of the trial and its relevance to a substantial public health issue affecting a very high proportion of women experiencing PND and their children brought up with limited maternal support.</p>
              <p id="Par164">Although both in Lebanon and Kenya current policy strongly supports the development of mental health provision particularly in perinatal mental health, financial crises in either or both countries could impact the development of new pathways that this research aims to create.</p>
              <p id="Par165">The ongoing economic downturn in Lebanon, exacerbated by escalating fuel prices, has made commuting to the centres a challenge for some SUMMIT patients, especially those living further away. This issue was highlighted during the feasibility phase of this research. To address this, we provided symbolic incentives during data collection periods, assisting participants in offsetting some of their transportation expenses.</p>
              <p id="Par166">Furthermore, the prevailing political environment in Lebanon, combined with the Lebanese government’s deportation policy affecting Syrian nationals, created apprehension among our Syrian participants. This may lead to sporadic attendance in the intervention groups and an increase in cases lost to follow-up in our Syrian population. To mitigate this, we have adjusted session schedules to more convenient times. Fortunately, recent relaxations in deportations and sanctions by the Lebanese government have somewhat alleviated these concerns, resulting in improved attendance and adherence to intervention sessions among the Syrian participants.</p>
              <p id="Par167">Given the current political unrest in Lebanon, particularly the bombings taking place in the South of Lebanon, and in order to safeguard the safety of the SUMMIT team, along with the patients who attend their sessions with their children, the team has prepared a contingency plan to shift sessions and data collection time points online, in case the situation deteriorates and central Beirut becomes affected.</p>
              <p id="Par168">This programme of research, particularly in Lebanon, is strongly embedded within a gender equality social initiative. It is recognised that in many countries in the Middle East, gender equality creates cultural and sometimes political challenges. The long-term success of this programme evidently depends on a political climate favourable to gender equality as a value.</p>
              <p id="Par169">While in Lebanon the control of professional psychological practitioners is strong thus ensuring high-fidelity evidence-based treatments being sustained, in Kenya professional bodies that ensure the technical competence of practitioners are less well established. We hope that this programme will serve to begin to mitigate this issue particularly around the availability of appropriately skilled staff offering services to women with PND.</p>
              <p id="Par170">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adapted our operational approach to ensure the safety of both participants and the SUMMIT team. Measures, consistent with local health guidelines, have been implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission. In Kenya, all members of the SUMMIT team will be fully vaccinated. During all interactions, there should be strict adherence to the Ministry of Health’s protocols.</p>
