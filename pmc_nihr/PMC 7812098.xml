                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs) have a significant negative impact on quality of life and healthcare costs. To date, daily prophylactic antibiotics are the only treatment which have been shown to help prevent RUTIs. D-mannose is a type of sugar which is believed to inhibit bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells, and is already being used by some women in an attempt to prevent RUTIs. There is currently insufficient rigorous evidence on which to base decisions about its use. The D-mannose to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (MERIT) study will evaluate whether D-mannose is clinically and cost-effective in reducing frequency of infection and symptom burden for women presenting to UK primary care with RUTI.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>MERIT will be a two-arm, individually randomised, double blind placebo controlled, pragmatic trial. Participants will be randomised to take D-mannose powder or placebo powder daily for 6 months. The primary outcome will be the number of medical attendances attributable to symptoms of RUTI. With 508 participants we will have 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the chance of a further clinically suspected UTI, assuming 20% lost to follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include: number of days of moderately bad symptoms of UTI; time to next consultation; number of clinically suspected UTIs; number of microbiologically proven UTIs; number of antibiotic courses for UTI; quality of life and healthcare utilisation related to UTI. A within trial economic evaluation will be conducted to examine cost-effectiveness of D-mannose in comparison with placebo. A nested qualitative study will explore participants’ experiences and perceptions of recruitment to, and participation in a study requiring a daily treatment.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection that women consult for in UK primary care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Approximately 40%–50% of women experience one UTI episode during their lives.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Recurrent UTIs (RUTIs) have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, which extends beyond the unpleasant symptoms to distressing and disrupted sexual relationships, persistent unmanageable pain and systemic illness.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> UTI accounts for an important proportion of healthcare costs as a result of outpatient visits, diagnostic tests and prescriptions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In 2007, UTI recurrence accounted for 10.5 million outpatient consultations and 2–3 million emergency department visits in the USA alone. In addition, UTIs are the most common cause of infection in hospitalised patients, accounting for 17.2% of all nosocomial infections in England. Furthermore, UTIs result in considerable patient morbidity and time off work; hence, the management of this condition incurs large financial costs, estimated at US$3.5 billion in the USA per year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>A systematic review of randomised controlled trials identified antibiotic prophylaxis as the only treatment, which has been demonstrated to help prevent RUTIs. Antibiotics taken daily for 6–12 months were more effective than placebo at preventing recurrent infection,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and national guidelines advocate their use for this indication.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, antibiotics also resulted in more severe and unpleasant side effects (eg, vomiting, urticaria, candidiasis). Furthermore, once antibiotic prophylaxis is discontinued, even after extended periods, approximately 50%–60% of women will experience a further UTI within 3 months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Thus, antibiotic prophylaxis does not exert benefit once stopped, and is directly linked to antibiotic resistance in uropathogens.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Antibiotic resistance has been associated with an increased duration of severe symptoms of UTIs, irrespective of the use of an appropriate antibiotic.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 11</xref></p>
              <p>D-mannose is a type of sugar (a monosaccharide isomer of glucose), which is thought to inhibit bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells by binding to a site on the tip of the fimbria<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and has shown benefit in animal models in preventing UTIs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Currently D-mannose is available commercially to the public as a food supplement, and is favoured by many women who have RUTIs, but until recently, there has been little empirical evidence to support its use. An open-label randomised three arm trial including 308 women with RUTI seen in outpatient settings<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found that daily use of D-mannose for 6 months resulted in an absolute reduction in incidence of further UTI of 45% from a proportion of 60% in the usual care arm, with no adverse events. The proportion of women experiencing an RUTI over 6 months was reduced by 11% compared with daily antibiotic use. This finding is supported by recent smaller studies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref></p>
              <p>Although there are indicators of efficacy from small underpowered trials, the only adequately powered study to date<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was not placebo controlled and found an unexpectedly high RUTI incidence in the control arm. Furthermore, a microbiologically confirmed UTI was a requirement for entry to the study, and participants were withdrawn once they developed a UTI on treatment. Therefore, true incidence of UTI could not be established, a measure for women who experience frequent RUTIs, who are also the most likely candidates for prophylaxis. Finally, all women on hormonal contraception were excluded, which may reduce applicability to the women at high risk of RUTI.</p>
              <p>D-mannose is found naturally in small quantities in numerous food sources, such as coffee, baker’s yeast, egg white, fruits such as apples, cranberries and mangos, and also in legumes such as soybeans, kidney beans and peanuts.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the urine.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>D-mannose may offer an alternative to antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience RUTI and in turn to contribute to better antimicrobial stewardship in primary care. However, the current evidence base is inadequate to help women with RUTI to make informed decisions about the use of D-mannose prophylaxis. The high costs (at least £25 a month) associated with its purchase add weight to the need to establish whether general practitioners (GPs) should advise their patients to use D-mannose for this indication.</p>
              <p>The D-mannose to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections (MERIT) double blind placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of D-mannose in women suffering with RUTI presenting to UK primary care and its cost effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Sample size considerations</title>
                <p>A recent study to evaluate prophylactic treatment for RUTI in a similar population<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> found that 26.6% of women in the control arm experienced an RUTI within 6 months. Our patient and public involvement advisors suggested that in order to commit to daily use of a prophylactic regime, they would require evidence of at least a 50% reduction in the chance of a further UTI during the period of prophylaxis. To detect this reduction with a two-sided Fisher’s exact test with 90% power and an alpha of 0.05 we would require 203 participants in each arm. This equates to 508 participants if a 20% loss to follow-up is assumed. This sample size is also adequate to power the key secondary outcome (the number of RUTI’s experienced over 6 months), and detect a relative incidence rate of 0.5 between the treatment and placebo groups, assuming a base rate of 0.36 as estimated by Maki <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> If the estimated percentage of participants who have either withdrawn or failed to respond to any study team communication for an extended period seems likely to rise above the 20% initially allowed for, we will recruit additional participants, up to a maximum of 598 participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The primary outcome, the proportion of women experiencing at least one further episode of UTI symptoms for which they visited their GP within 6 months of study entry, and other binary outcomes, will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis by means of a generalised linear mixed effects model with binomial distribution and log link function, including a random effect for practice and fixed effect for randomisation group. Therefore, treatment groups will be compared on the basis of an adjusted risk ratio. The number of days of moderately bad symptoms of UTI, the number of UTI’s experienced in 6 months, and number of antibiotic courses for UTI in 6 months, will be analysed by means of a generalised linear mixed effects model using the Poisson distribution and log link function, including a random effect for practice and a fixed effect for randomised group. Defined daily ooses (DDDs) will be analysed by means of a linear mixed-effects model including a random effect for practice and fixed effects for randomised group and baseline DDD, treating this outcome as continuous. We will analyse the overall DDD as well as the individual antibiotic DDDs.</p>
                <p>The amount of missing primary outcome data is expected to be very low as it is collected via notes review. The model chosen to analyse the primary outcome implicitly accounts for data missing at random, however, the data missing mechanism will be explored. Summary statistics will be presented for baseline covariates of those participants who completed and those who were lost to follow-up for the primary outcome. Baseline covariates associated with missingness will be identified by analysing each baseline covariate in a logistic regression model to determine which (if any) are associated with missingness of the primary outcome. The associated p value will be reported alongside the summary statistics. Any baseline factors found to be associated with missingness of the primary outcome will be included in a sensitivity analysis.</p>

The primary outcome measure for the cost utility analysis will be the quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Data collection to facilitate analysis includes resource use and health outcomes. Data from the participant diary and electronic medical record review will be the main source of resource use. Unit costs associated with resource use items will be obtained from national standards.

Resource use and unit cost will be combined to calculate healthcare costs for each participant and mean cost for each study arm. EQ-5D-5L utility values will be calculated using the UK-based algorithm. Using the under the curve methods to combine utility values and associated time durations will produce QALYs for each participant and mean QALYs for each study arm during the 6-month study period. Mean differences in costs and QALYs between the study arms will be estimated as incremental cost per QALY gained. Given the fact that antibiotics are currently the mainstay treatment for both acute and RUTIs, the issue of how the cost of antibiotic resistance should be incorporated into economic evaluation will be explored in the analysis.</p>

              <p>The MERIT study will be the first large, publicly funded, double blind randomised trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of daily D-Mannose for preventing RUTI in primary care. This overview of the protocol describes the plans for a pragmatic study recruiting women who suffer from RUTI recruited in UK primary care. This study will fill a major gap in the evidence base about whether women with RUTIs should initiate or continue to use this food supplement to prevent RUTI. If D-mannose is proven to be effective for the treatment of RUTIs this could benefit affected women and also contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. On the other hand, if found to be ineffective, costs spent on an ineffective intervention will be saved and attention can be refocussed on other, perhaps more effective prophylactic approaches, as well as redirected research efforts.</p>
