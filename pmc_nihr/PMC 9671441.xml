                  <p>Respiratory tract infection (RTI) incidence varies between people, but little is known about why. The aim of this study is therefore to identify risk factors for acquiring RTIs.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a secondary analysis of 16,908 participants in the PRIMIT study, a pre-pandemic randomised trial showing handwashing reduced incidence of RTIs in the community. Data was analysed using multivariable logistic regression analyses of self-reported RTI acquisition.</p>

                  <p>After controlling for handwashing, RTI in the previous year (1 to 2 RTIs: adjusted OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.13, p&lt;0.001; 3 to 5 RTIs: aOR 3.89, 95% CI 3.49 to 4.33, p&lt;0.001; ≥6 RTIs: OR 5.52, 95% CI 4.37 to 6.97, p&lt;0.001); skin conditions that prevent handwashing (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.55, p&lt;0.001); children under 16 years in the household (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.12, 1.43, p&lt;0.001); chronic lung condition (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32, p = 0.026); female sex (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.18, p = 0.005), and post-secondary education (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, p = 0.01) increased the likelihood of RTI. Those over the age of 65 years were less likely to develop an infection (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97, p = 0.009). Household crowding and influenza vaccination do not influence RTI acquisition. A post-hoc exploratory analysis found no evidence these subgroups differentially benefited from handwashing.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Previous RTIs, chronic lung conditions, skin conditions that prevent handwashing, and the presence of household children predispose to RTI acquisition. Further research is needed to understand how host and microbial factors explain the relationship between previous and future RTIs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common infection managed by healthcare systems worldwide. RTIs cost the UK economy around £1.7 billion per annum, mainly due to lower RTIs such as pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RTIs also cause considerable morbidity including loss of earnings due to sickness absence, with 38 million working days lost in 2018 [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>On average, adults will have two to five RTIs annually, often the ‘common cold’ or upper respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. RTIs are the most common indication for antibiotic prescribing [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], accounting for around 60% of all antibiotics prescribed in primary care [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is often driven by patient expectations [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and rarely provides clinical benefit to the patient given that RTIs are often viral, and/or self-limiting [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277201.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite this, only a small number of studies have investigated risk factors for community-acquired RTIs in non-pandemic lockdown contexts (<italic toggle="yes">BMC Infect Dis</italic> 2021, submitted). Predisposition to acute infection is likely influenced by multiple factors, including social, behavioural, and environmental. The aim of the present study was to use pre-pandemic data to investigate risk factors for acquisition of community-acquired RTIs in England. We used data from the PRIMIT study, a very large randomised controlled trial demonstrating the effectiveness of an internet-delivered handwashing intervention in reducing the incidence of RTIs in the community between January 2011 and March 2013 [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PRIMIT provides an ideal data set to assess both the risk factors for acquiring infections, and whether those who are at risk benefit similarly from the intervention.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>Data collection was conducted as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, the trial enrolled 20,066 patients aged 18 years or over recruited via 344 primary care practices across England. Exclusion criteria included patients with severe mental problems (e.g. major uncontrolled depression, dementia or severe mental impairment), those who were terminally ill and those reporting a skin complaint which would limit their handwashing. Participants were recruited over three autumn, winter and spring periods (January to March 2011; November 2011 to April 2012; and October 2012 to March 2013), with a 16-week follow-up period.</p>
                <p>At the point of consent, 18,622 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive access to a web-based intervention, which included a baseline questionnaire about current handwashing practices (n = 9350), or no access to the intervention and no baseline questionnaire (n = 9272). In order to understand whether there was a priming effect of asking about handwashing at baseline, an additional cohort of 1444 participants were also randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a control (no intervention but access to the baseline handwashing questionnaire, n = 754), or intervention (access to web-based intervention but no baseline handwashing questionnaire, n = 690). This gave a total of 10,040 participants assigned to the intervention and 10,026 assigned to control.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Southampton, in collaboration with Universities of Oxford, Birmingham and Glasgow, trial registration number ISRCTN75058295.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was binary, defined as participants with one or more reported infections versus no reported infections at 16 weeks. Illnesses were classified as RTIs on the basis of consensus from previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0277201.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], defined as two symptoms of an RTI for at least one day or one symptom for two consecutive days. Influenza-like illness was defined as a high temperature (&gt;37.5˚C), a respiratory symptom (sore throat, cough or runny nose), and a systemic symptom (headache, severe fatigue, severe muscle-aches, or severe malaise).</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Episodes of infection and their duration were self-reported by study participants. All participants were sent invitations to complete the online outcome assessment measures monthly (at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after initial login). Of the 10,040 study participants who were in the intervention groups, 8241 (82%) completed the follow-up questionnaire at 16 weeks. Of the 10,026 study participants assigned to the control groups, 8667 (86%) completed the 16-week follow-up questionnaire.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>For this secondary data analysis, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to explore risk factors for the acquisition of one or more RTIs, as self-reported by study participants over the 16-week follow-up. While this was a complete case analysis of the PRIMIT outcome data, they could only be included in the analysis if they provided follow-up data (at 16 weeks) and did not have any missing data on the covariates we included in our model. Univariable and multivariable odds ratios, and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were reported for each covariate, which included age, sex, education after the age of 10, number of people living in the household, children under 16 years living in the household, any ongoing health problems, number of RTIs in previous year, had influenza vaccination in the current season, and skin condition which could affect handwashing. The model also controlled for randomisation group in the trial. P-values were reported for the multivariable logistic regression model only. A post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate for differential intervention effectiveness in the newly identified risk groups individually and together, by assigning one point per factor, using the appropriate interaction terms.</p>

                <title>Summary of main findings</title>
                <p>In the largest and most rigorously pre-pandemic study of its kind to date, we found the number of RTIs in previous year, skin conditions that prevent handwashing, living with children under 16 years, female sex and post-secondary education each independently predisposed individuals to acquire a RTI. Neither household crowding nor flu vaccination were independently associated with an increased risk of RTI acquisition.</p>

              <sec id="sec014">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this is the largest study to investigate for factors predisposing to RTI acquisition, thereby reducing type II error. The PRIMIT study was a prospectively designed randomised trial with data collection supported by monthly symptom diary follow-up, which minimises any recall bias associated with self-reported outcomes. However, in order to minimise participant burden, there were several unmeasured factors which may be important in predisposition to acquiring RTIs, including occupation, exercise, body mass index, diet, alcohol intake, smoking, use of herbal or over-the-counter treatments, and recent use of antibiotics.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, since participants self-reported RTIs, it is possible that recollection of previous RTIs sensitised recognition of subsequent RTIs. The self-reported nature of the study means that we do not have any information about the RTI which the participant experienced, including the severity of the infection, the cause of the infection (bacterial or viral), the location of the infection (upper or lower RTI) or the duration. Also, some of the questions that participants were asked, were open to definition by them, for example, skin conditions which impact handwashing. Participants were not provided with a clear definition of what constitutes a skin condition, but were asked to decide on this themselves. Therefore, although our secondary analysis found an association between skin conditions that affect handwashing and increased odds of acquiring a RTI, we do not have any information on the specific skin condition they have, or the extent to which this impacts their handwashing.</p>

              <sec id="sec015">
                <title>How this fits with existing literature</title>
                <p>Our result, that age over 65 may protect against acquiring an RTI, contrasts with the literature suggesting older age increases the risk due to waning immunity and immune defence [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, aging is also associated with increased social isolation, which our analyses suggest could have more impact. In addition, our finding that post-secondary education increases the likelihood of acquiring a RTI also contrasts with much of the literature [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It may be that this measurement serves as a proxy for different types or quantities of social interactions, or a proxy for the different threshold at which people self-report RTIs, as this study was reliant on self-reporting of RTI symptoms.</p>
                <p>Female sex was associated with an increased likelihood of acquiring a RTI. A systematic review exploring differences between sexes and incidence of RTIs found that females appeared at increased risk of upper RTIs, though males appeared at greatest risk due to higher rates of lower respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are a number of important social and behavioural characteristics which vary between sexes which could influence our findings. Females are more often carers of young children or vulnerable people, which could in itself increase risk of RTI acquisition. Living with young children was also an observed risk factor for RTI acquisition. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted many of these inequalities between males and females, including increased employment of females in healthcare and social care roles, increased childcare responsibilities at home, and increased difficulty to maintain social distancing [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The role of female sex and increased risk of acquiring RTIs warrants further investigation, taking into account social, behavioural and lifestyle characteristics which may influence the association.</p>
                <p>In addition to female sex, children under 16 years living in the household was associated with an increased likelihood of acquiring a RTI. Our recently published systematic review identified contact with children as a predisposing factor for acquiring community-acquired pneumonia, though only three studies measured this as a risk factor [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is therefore limited evidence on the significance of contact with children as a risk factor for acquiring a RTI, and what kind and frequency of contact may be important. A 2014 study reported that day-care attendance in the first year of life was associated with more upper RTIs and acute otitis media in children compared to those not attending day-care [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This suggests a possible link between increased number of social contacts and increased risk of transmitting and acquiring RTIs. This link has also been demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, where the population were asked to socially distance and limit contact with other households in order to introduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PRIMIT was conducted pre-COVID-19 when social mixing was the norm, and since social distancing measures have been implemented (alongside other public health interventions including handwashing and wearing face masks) there have been significant reductions in the number of reported RTIs in the community [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

                <title>Implications for practice, policy and future research</title>
                <p>It has become evident from the recent global COVID-19 pandemic and UK national lockdown that there are a number of public health interventions which are effective in reducing transmission of RTIs in the community, including handwashing, social distancing and closure of offices, schools and nurseries. The pandemic had a considerable impact on handwashing, compared to when the original PRIMIT study was conducted, so we must take this into account when interpreting our findings. However, our recently published systematic review indicates that we still know relatively little about risk factors for community-acquired RTIs, reaffirming the importance of the study findings [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Handwashing and general hygiene measures have been identified previously as an effective measure to reduce transmission of respiratory infections [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], however the effectiveness of social distancing has not been properly evaluated pre-COVID-19. It may be that some of these interventions may be effective for use in the future during ‘high risk’ periods to prevent infection transmission.</p>
                <p>We still have a limited understanding of the relative contribution of factors which are associated with increased risk of acquiring and transmitting RTIs, and why some people experience more RTIs than others. Future studies must include the social, behavioural and lifestyle factors which play a role in infection acquisition, including contact with children (work and/or household), place of work, and exercise–some of which may be modifiable [<xref rid="pone.0277201.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Better characterisation and measures of the contribution of possible biological and immune factors is also needed, as these are likely to play a role in host susceptibility to infection, and could explain age and sex related differences in susceptibility to infections. Interventions, including those implemented during COVID-19 national lockdowns, must continue to be evaluated for their effectiveness at reducing infection acquisition and transmission.</p>
                <p>Finally, research is needed to understand how host and microbial factors explain the relationship between previous and future RTIs, in particular whether it can be explained by biological mechanisms such as altered host immunity or effects on the host microbiome, or psychological mechanisms, such as recall bias, sensitising people to report infections due to previous family or personal experience.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The objective of this manuscript is a straightforward risk assessement via running a multiple/multivariable logistic regression to binary RTI responses from a dataset generated in England. It is actually a secondary data analyses from a previous randomized study called PRIMIT, which was IRB approved. My comments are as follows:</p>
              <p>(1) Abstract can be rewritten using the following subsections: (a) Objectives, (b) Methods, (c) Results and (d) Conclusions</p>
              <p>(2) Results were generated from a study completed in 2013; not sure what knowledge gain we may have in 2022!</p>
              <p>(3) Outcomes: Primary outcome definition is wrong! Maybe the authors meant that the binary outcome means 1 if participants reported &gt;= 1 RTI at 16 weeks; 0 otherwise?</p>
              <p>(4) Dataset has a decent number of intervention &amp; control participants, and collected from 344 primary care centers. So, why not the center effect was adjusted for via a GEE-type approach, or a random intercept logistic regression model?</p>
              <p>(5) Logistic regression Goodness-of-fit, say via Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, were not presented.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I see that this simple yet rigorous manuscript has adequately explained the whole idea of restriction of social engagements could be protective in a sense of risk of contracting RTI. The clinical criteria for its subject may seem to be too permissive, though; e.g. there is no explanation of the severity of the RTI (new, recurrent, acute, an acute episode of a chronic, or debilitating RTI), there is no description of the location of RTI (upper, lower, or mixed), and there is no description of the duration of the RTI, as there are many kinds of RTI which has different outcome. This should be addressed in the manuscript, at least in a brief text.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript is a secondary analysis of the PRIMIT Study and shows risk factors associated with the incidence of RTIs.</p>
              <p>This is well written and illustrated paper which presents the results from a large self-reported survey, and the relationship between acquisition of RTIs and risk factors described is more straightforward.</p>
              <p>I have some suggestions for improvement;</p>
              <p>1. Regarding the results of "education after the age of 10" (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, p=0.01) shown in Table 2, the text states that years of education do not affect the acquisition of RTI, but it is necessary to discuss this issue further.</p>
              <p>2. Regarding the point that older adults are less likely to acquire RTIs, as noted in the text, there is a discrepancy with the findings in the previous literature. The authors should discuss this point.</p>
              <p>3. The definition of “skin condition that impacted handwashing” should be described in the text, because it is one of the important findings in this paper.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>
