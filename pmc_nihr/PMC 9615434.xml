                  <p>Between 2009 and 2014, 352 patients were randomized. By 5 years 79 died, 58 withdrew, 34 were lost to follow-up and the remaining 182 provided data. AF surgery significantly increased the odds of remaining in SR at 5 years {odds ratio = 2.98 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23, 7.17], <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.015}. There was a non-significant decrease in stroke incidence [odds ratio = 0.605 (95% CI 0.284, 1.287), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.19], but no improved survival [5-year survival: AF surgery 77.3% (95% CI 71.1%, 83.5%), controls 77.8% (95% CI 71.7%, 84.0%), <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.85]. Quality-adjusted survival difference was negligible (−0.03; 95% CI −0.33, 0.27, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.85). The composite of survival free of stroke and AF was better in the AF surgery group [odds ratio = 2.34 (95% CI 1.03, 5.31)]. There were no other differences.</p>

              <title>BACKGROUND</title>
              <p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<xref rid="ezac181-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke and are treated with anti-coagulants, with associated increase in the risk of bleeding, including bleeds related to cerebrovascular events [<xref rid="ezac181-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. AF surgery using radiofrequency, cryotherapy and other energy sources is increasingly used during cardiac surgery to block abnormal electrical signals and correct AF [<xref rid="ezac181-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the Amaze multicentre randomized controlled trial, 352 non-emergency cardiac surgery patients were randomized to either planned cardiac surgery with adjunct AF surgery or planned cardiac surgery alone, to assess whether treating AF in this way increased the probability of restoring sinus rhythm (SR), improved long-term survival and quality of life (QoL) and increased cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The trial showed that adding AF surgery significantly increased the probability of SR restoration but did not significantly affect survival, QoL or stroke incidence at 2 years after surgery [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the associated HESTER study showed that most people for whom SR was restored had good recovery of atrial contractile function, suggesting that survival, QoL and other clinical benefits may accrue over time [<xref rid="ezac181-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This study presents the results of 5-year follow-up of Amaze trial participants to assess whether the early increase in SR restoration was maintained and whether it resulted in longer-term survival and QoL improvements.</p>

              <title>METHODS</title>
              <sec>
                <title>Ethics statement</title>
                <p>This study was approved by the NHS Health Research Authority (reference number 08/H0301/98) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Amaze was a phase III, pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-arm, randomized controlled superiority trial in 11 UK cardiac surgical centres, co-ordinated by Papworth Hospital. Thirty participating consultant cardiac surgeons had at least 2 years’ prior experience in AF surgery. Full details of trial methods and results up to 2 years follow-up have been published [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as has the HESTER study, which looked at atrial contractility after SR restoration [<xref rid="ezac181-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
                <p>Briefly, adult elective or urgent cardiac surgery patients with &gt;3-month documented AF were randomized on the day of surgery to either the planned cardiac procedure alone (control arm) or planned cardiac procedure with adjunct AF surgery (experimental arm). All major cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was included (valve, coronary, combined and others). Patients, cardiologists assessing ECG results and researchers collecting QoL outcomes were unaware of the treatment arm. Surgeons followed local surgery and perioperative management protocols and decided on the ablation method and lesion set. Subsequent management, including follow-on cardioversion, was identical in both arms.</p>
                <p>In the Amaze trial, SR restoration at 1 year after surgery and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 2 years were joint primary outcomes [<xref rid="ezac181-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the trial analysis to 2 years, 93.2% of patients were either wholly in SR or wholly in AF during 4-day continuous ECG recordings and most others were close to these extremes, suggesting that the predominant cardiac rhythm, be it SR or AF, was stable in the overwhelming majority of patients [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, SR restoration at 5 years was assessed by single ECG read by cardiologists unaware of the treatment arm. Five-year QALYs were calculated from serial utility measurements from the UK population valuation of the EuroQoL EQ-5D-3 l, completed at randomization, discharge, 6 weeks, 6 months and 1, 2 and 5 years postoperatively. QALYs were estimated using the area under the curve method.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes were survival, stroke incidence, antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drug usage, permanent pacemaker implantation and cardioversion and New York Heart Association (NYHA) dyspnoea index at 5 years. Definitions of these outcomes have been published [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We also analysed beneficial outcome (at each time point) defined as the composite of alive, in SR and stroke free as follows:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>zero if the patient died or had a stroke before the follow-up time, or if the ECG identified AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia;</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>one if the patient survived and was stroke-free up to the follow-up time, and if the ECG demonstrated SR (including 1 patient with ‘Junctional rhythm’ recorded); and</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analysis was by intention to treat, with patients analysed according to the original random allocation. Repeated measurement of return to SR was summarized as frequencies in each of the 2 treatment arms (AF surgery and control). These longitudinal measurements were analysed using generalized linear mixed models with a logistic link, with SR status (1 if in SR and 0 if in AF) taken as the response variable [<xref rid="ezac181-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We included trial arm, baseline covariates used to stratify randomization (SR on preoperative ECG and procedure type), follow-up time and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and participants and surgeon as random effects. The adjusted effect of adjunct AF surgery on rhythm at each time point was extracted from this model. Initially, only patients and follow-up times with an assessment were included, referred to as ‘Complete Case’ analysis. Analyses were repeated using multivariate imputation by chained equation for missing data [<xref rid="ezac181-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The composite beneficial outcome was analysed using the same methods.</p>
                <p>Responses from EQ-5D-3 l questionnaire were converted to utility scores for the UK population [<xref rid="ezac181-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Analysis was completed for (i) patients who were alive at each time point only and (ii) after zeroes were imputed for people who died and missing utilities were multiply imputed using multivariate imputation by chained equation for survivors. Five-year QALYs were estimated by the area under the curve method. Patients who did not complete baseline EQ-5D-3 l questionnaires, or only completed 1 post-surgery questionnaire were excluded from this analysis (7%). Comparisons between AF surgery and control arms were taken from linear mixed models for QoL, analogous to those for SR.</p>
                <p>Survival analysis used Kaplan–Meier curves, the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for age, baseline utility score and procedure). Censoring time was either the date of completing 5-year follow-up, the date of death, the date of withdrawal or the date of loss to follow-up.</p>
                <p>Stroke incidence was summarized as total number of events during follow-up divided by the total follow-up time in each group. Groups were compared using negative binomial regression models. For other secondary outcome comparisons, Fisher’s exact test was used.</p>
                <p>We used the R version 3.6.3 for all analyses [<xref rid="ezac181-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

                <p>Between February 2009 and March 2014, 352 patients were randomized (176 each) to AF surgery or control arms (Fig. <xref rid="ezac181-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mean (standard deviation) age was 71.9 (7.7) years, and 232 (65.9%) were men. As previously reported, 11 AF surgery patients did not receive their allocated treatment and 2 controls did have AF surgery [<xref rid="ezac181-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>

                <p>Although all patients had a history of AF, 62 (18.1%) were in SR at the baseline ECG (Table <xref rid="ezac181-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), of whom 55 (88.7%) had paroxysmal AF. This compares with 34 (12.1%) paroxysmal patients in 280 patients with AF on the baseline ECG. The proportion returning to SR increased after the procedure but decreased over time thereafter. Of the patients with ECGs available at 5 years, 28/72 (38.9%) in the AF surgery group and 15/67 (22.4%) in the control group were in SR (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.044, Fisher’s exact test, Fig. <xref rid="ezac181-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

                <title>Summary of results</title>
                <p>We investigated the long-term effect on clinical outcomes and QoL of AF surgery as an adjunct to elective or urgent cardiac surgery based on 5-year follow-up data. Although the proportion of patients in SR decreased over time for both arms, AF surgery significantly increased the odds of remaining in SR up to 5 years after operation. Moreover, AF surgery significantly increased the odds of a beneficial outcome, defined as the composite of survival, in SR and free of stroke.</p>
                <p>Surviving patients maintained a similarly high level of QoL in both groups, although estimated average utility decreased after adjusting for deaths. Survival, stroke incidence, NYHA class, antiarrhythmic or anticoagulant drug usage, permanent pacemaker insertion and cardioversion did not differ significantly between the AF surgery and control arms at any point in the 5-year follow-up period.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Only half of the recruited patients completed the 5-year follow-up due to patient death, withdrawal and loss to follow-up. Despite this, we demonstrated the positive effect of AF surgery on SR and the composite of SR, survival and freedom from stroke. All patients contributed to survival estimates and over 93% contributed to calculation of QoL during at least part of the follow-up. Because the proportion of patients who withdrew/were lost to follow-up was similar in the 2 groups (Fig. <xref rid="ezac181-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and results were not sensitive to different ways of addressing missing data, it is unlikely that group comparisons were biased. However, there was reduced power to detect potential treatment effects on other outcomes and we cannot rule out small effects. Furthermore, subgroup analyses by different AF types were not feasible.</p>
                <p>It is likely that a more complete lesion set, especially the LA lesions, will lead to higher rates of SR restoration. The original Amaze trial was a ‘real-world’ study, in which surgeons carried out AF surgery in the way they normally did it, with no restriction on device choice or lesion set. This is a limitation of the study in that it underestimates the success rate that can be achieved, but also a strength in that it reflects what is truly happening in real clinical practice.</p>
                <p>At 5 years, we assessed heart rhythm by a single ECG. This was driven by data from the original study that, on 4-day Holter monitoring, virtually all patients were either wholly in AF or in SR. We therefore opted for the single ECG to improve compliance but recognize this as a limitation in that it could slightly underestimate AF detection.</p>
                <p>Stroke incidence was elicited directly from patients and then reported strokes were verified from hospital records. Retrieval of all hospital admissions, including stroke-related admissions, directly from hospitals was not possible in the timescale of the project, in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have resulted in an underestimate of the actual number of strokes due to patient recall, although this is likely to have been similar in the 2 arms. The likely impact is a reduction in precision of the comparison between groups, rather than a bias in the treatment effect: wider 95% CI and higher <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value for the group comparison. This, and the design of the study, may contribute to our inability to confirm the significant difference in stroke rates reported by the PRAGUE-12 Study [<xref rid="ezac181-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

                <title>Implications for clinical service</title>
                <p>The Amaze trial remains the largest randomized controlled study of the impact of adjunct AF surgery on the outcomes most important to the patient: survival, symptoms, QoL and freedom from strokes. In line with other studies [<xref rid="ezac181-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ezac181-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Amaze showed significantly higher restoration of SR to 5 years in patients receiving adjunct AF surgery. Moreover, the more complex cardiac procedure was not associated with an increase in adverse events in the original trial report. However, we have not shown a clear impact on other key outcomes. This is important, because the outcomes that matter to patients do not relate to the ECG trace, but to QoL, long-term survival and freedom from stroke. The fewer overall strokes and smaller number of patients having a stroke in the AF surgery group were not significant but could be considered encouraging. The composite beneficial outcome of AF-free and stroke-free survival was also better in the AF surgery group, but this must be interpreted with caution as much of the contributory impact on this outcome was related to SR restoration. QoL and survival are not affected, and the crucial question ‘do we save lives with AF surgery?’ still remains unanswered [<xref rid="ezac181-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>Amaze was a pragmatic trial in which individual surgeons selected the method of AF surgery, including device, energy source and lesion set. The intra-class correlation coefficient estimates that 18–20% of the variation in the rate of SR maintenance over 5 years is related to the surgeon. This may be due in part to differences in surgical techniques, such as the choice of AF surgery method and lesion set. A previous randomized controlled trial had shown no significant difference between pulmonary vein isolation alone and a complete maze procedure in SR restoration [<xref rid="ezac181-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but the study may not have been powered to detect such a difference. The original Amaze trial suggested the highest rates of SR restoration were obtained when a complete left atrial lesion set was performed, including the mitral isthmus lesion. It is possible that adopting such a lesion set may reduce the observed inter-surgeon variation in outcomes to some extent, especially in patients receiving AF surgery for non-paroxysmal AF.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Implications for research</title>
                <p>The HESTER study [<xref rid="ezac181-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that restoration of SR after AF surgery for chronic persistent AF is associated in most patients with very good recovery of left atrial function, so that we would expect that a reduction in stroke rate and, with it, better survival and QoL should follow. That our data do not conclusively show that this may be due to the size of the sample, the pragmatic trial design and the limited length of follow-up. Future meta-analyses of pooled randomized controlled trial data should be encouraged.</p>

              <p>Adjunct AF surgery maintained higher rates for return to SR and a better composite outcome of survival free of AF and stroke up to 5 years after surgery compared with controls. There was no difference in pacemaker implantation. Overall survival and QoL were not affected up to 5 years after surgery.</p>
