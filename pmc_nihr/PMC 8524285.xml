              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Young babies requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) present specific therapeutic challenges because of their small size and the current technology available. Publications indicate similar problems faced by clinicians worldwide who use adult devices because of lack of alternatives, and the need for solutions including improved device technology.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref>
</p>
              <p>This clinical investigation protocol is designed to determine the clinical efficacy, outcomes and safety of a novel non-CE-marked infant haemodialysis (HD) machine, the Newcastle Infant Dialysis Ultrafiltration System (NIDUS), compared with currently available RRT in the UK. NIDUS is designed for use in babies between 0.8 and 8 kg. There is evidence from a previous single-centre pilot study to anticipate NIDUS has the potential to contribute significant benefits to small babies needing RRT.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>The proposed clinical investigation is a result of a multicentre collaboration between clinicians, scientists, academics, with significant parent and public involvement, throughout its development; working with a manufacturing company, Allmed. The results will have potential to change clinical practice.</p>
              <p>The NIDUS machine uses a smaller circuit volume than current devices. Pilot data from the development centre have suggested management of fluid overload and renal failure is possible for small infants, with the potential for reduced exposure to blood products, and more precise control of ultrafiltration (UF) and dialysis.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Nurses have reported ease of use of the NIDUS within the design centre but this requires evaluation in standard clinical environments.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background</title>
                <p>There are several populations of babies requiring RRT. Those included in this study are unwell infants in paediatric intensive care units (PICU), who mostly do not have intrinsic renal disease and therefore have good potential for renal recovery. Many are postoperative, especially postcardiac surgery, whose major problem is an acute kidney insult, fluid overload and poor urine output, and others who are septic or have renal failure as part of multiorgan failure. Although mortality and morbidity in PICU varies and is related to the underlying diagnosis, survival of babies in PICU is worse in those with fluid overload<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> or needing RRT,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> of whom up to 20%â40% may die.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â9</xref> RRT is supportive until kidney recovery and although most survivors are independent of RRT at discharge from PICU, data on chronic renal sequelae are lacking. Children requiring RRT in PICU have been reported to have longer length of stay and required more days of ventilator support.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There are over 200 infants per year in the UK receiving treatment with continuous RRT (CRRT) in PICU.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref>
</p>
                <p>Some babies will be excludedâfor example, those with an inborn error of metabolism such as urea cycle defects causing hyperammonaemia, as they require emergency, very rapid removal of toxic metabolites by higher than normal dialysis clearances,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and babies with severe intrinsic renal disease, which is often congenital, who are usually treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) at home.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Current RRT</title>
                <p>PD is used frequently to support infants after open heart surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 13</xref> PD is technically simpler than HD; there is no lower size limit but complications are common in the smallest patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> UF is unpredictable, and chemical clearance less efficient, especially in unstable babies who develop splanchnic vasoconstriction and who also risk developing necrotising enterocolitis. This renders PD impossible, as does abdominal surgery and congenital abdominal wall defects. Larger critically ill infants with multiorgan failure are often treated with a variety of continuously delivered HD modalities (CRRT).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5 9</xref> Vascular access for HD modalities including continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) is problematic as the size of central venous line required for adequate blood flow is disproportionately large for the size of the baby especially when a double lumen line is needed.</p>
                <p>While there are no randomised controlled trials in infants, publications indicate recurring themes of difficulties with vascular access and blood flows, fluid balance, rapid clotting, loss of circuits and hypotensive episodes at initiation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â9</xref>
</p>
                <p>Conventional HD and CRRT machines in the UK are used in PICU unlicensed as they are CE marked for use in adults and bigger children. Manufacturers quote fluid balance control as Â±30 mL/hour,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and they, therefore, are not licensed for babies weighing &lt;8 kg (or approved for use in children of &lt;20 kg in the USA). The recommended minimum 7-French, dual-lumen vascular access lines and continuous 40 mL/min blood flows are difficult to achieve in the smallest babies. Their relatively large circuit volume (50â70 mL) produces sudden dilution of blood on commencing treatment if crystalloid primed, and increases the risk of anaemia with circuit loss. Hypotension on connection is a reported problem.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 15 16</xref> Blood priming risks exposing the baby abruptly to aberrant chemical and pH changes, which are reduced by predialysing the circuit.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Exposure to blood transfusions increases the risk of developing tissue-type sensitisation which may be important if renal function does not recover and renal or other solid organ transplant is considered in the future.</p>

                <title>NIDUS technology</title>
                <p>In 1995, a group in Newcastle designed a novel HD circuit, which operated by different principles that is, by syringes, and uncoupled the babyâs blood flow capacity from the requirements of the dialysis filter.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In 2005, they reported the results of automating this as a miniaturised machine (circuit volume less than 10 mL), with which four babies weighing under 4 kg were treated, using a single-lumen access line, and without the need for blood priming.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This device was subsequently developed into NIDUS,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which is used as the intervention device in the I-KID study. This clinical investigation will contribute to the current knowledge base and further understanding of the effects of RRT and address the need for improved technology to provide RRT effectively and safely for small babies.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 23 24</xref>
</p>
                <p>Safety monitoring is an important focus of this study. The NIDUS makes a downloadable constant recording of all activity data including volumes, flows, pressures, alarms and response to alarms so any alarm or event, however small, can be subsequently analysed. The NIDUS potentially provides a safer way of performing RRT on babies by using a novel circuit that allows precise ultrafiltrate control thus reducing the potential for errors in ultrafiltrate removal that would be trivial for larger children but are not for a baby. Its small circuit volume (&lt;10 mL) potentially avoids the need for blood priming with stored blood which has associated immediate risks and long-term risks of developing sensitising antibodies.</p>

The control periods use conventional therapy (PD or CVVH), with NIDUS used in intervention periods. Each site will be trained in setting up and using the NIDUS before switching to an intervention period. The design means that all participating centres will have the chance to use both treatments during the course of the study. PICU nurses will need to be competency assessed before each site can begin using the intervention; 24 hours on call nurse/clinician is provided from Newcastle for telephone support. Using an SW design permits the phased training on NIDUS and allows within-centre comparisons to contribute to the treatment estimate.</p>

The sample size was determined to detect a ratio of the SDs under the standard therapy and NIDUS of three, with power at least 80% and two-sided type I error of 5%. A threefold improvement in the precision of fluid removal in this population would be sufficiently marked that it would be likely to change practice. The calculation used the methods in Matthews and Forbes,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> adapted to unequal cluster sizes, and found that four periods in the SW design, each of 4.5 months, gave a power of 80% with an assumed intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.1% and 84% for an ICC of 0.05. It was believed that these represented conservative choices for the ICC.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome will be analysed using a linear model with fixed effects for treatment, period and cluster. The use of a fixed rather than random effect for cluster is a response to the interruptions to data collection due to the effect of COVID-19 on PICUs and the subsequent difficulty in defining a suitable dispersion structure. Sensitivity analyses will use a generalised estimating equation and will assess the assumptions about <italic toggle="yes">X</italic>. If these are untenable then <italic toggle="yes">X-A</italic> will be modelled directly, with treatment dependent variances for the error terms. The above linear model will be applied to the non-binary secondary outcomes. Binary outcomes will be analysed using generalised mixed models if possible but using simple tabulations if more sophisticated analyse are infeasible. Questionnaire data will be tabulated by treatment.</p>

                <title>Parent and public involvement</title>
                <p>The NIDUS device was invented because of parental demand in the face of limited options for dialysing their children. Feedback was sought from parents with children on dialysis in Newcastle and the Newcastle University Consumer Research Panel on the study design and parent information. The design uses cluster randomisation for reasons of safety, ethics and acceptability: randomisation by centre, rather than by patient, has been supported by a research consumer group and parents who thought that individual consent for the dialysis method would add to familiesâ stress and anxiety, and they would tend to defer to their clinician for advice. Individual consent is sought for collection and recording of information.</p>

                <p>Recruitment, which commenced in December 2018, has been more rapid in the control period (62 total) than the intervention (ongoing) and the study has been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on NHS workload and staff availability. There have been three pauses to recruitment (May/June 2019; September/October 2019; November/December 2020) instigated urgently by the chief investigator related to problems identified at sites with the device and tubing/filter sets, to allow investigation and resolution. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) temporarily withdrew notice of no objection in March 2020 while awaiting further information from the study team about anticoagulation, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic and recruitment to all non-COVID studies stopped; it was reinstated with additional clarification and no changes. Post-COVID-19 restart was in October 2020.</p>
