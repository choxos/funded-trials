              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite the development and availability of several classes of antihypertensive
drugs, the majority (⩾75%) of patients with hypertension do not achieve blood
pressure (BP) goals with any single agent, indicating a need for combination
therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
The treatment guidelines that were in effect in the United States during the conduct
of the study (e.g. JNC 7) recommend that patients with stage 2 hypertension, defined
as clinic systolic BP (SBP) ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥100 mmHg, begin initial
treatment with combination therapy rather than monotherapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Increasingly, combination
therapy has also been suggested as first-line treatment for stage 1
hypertension.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The combination of a thiazide-type diuretic with a blocker of the renin–angiotensin
system (RAS), such as an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is recommended by clinical guidelines
based on efficacy and safety data from long-term trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr3-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Hydrochlorothiazide, a
thiazide-type diuretic, and chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, are both used
to treat hypertension, although several studies have found chlorthalidone provides
greater BP reductions and has a longer duration of action.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr8-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, chlorthalidone may be
more efficacious than hydrochlorothiazide when used in combination with a RAS
inhibitor. Data from an observational study of 3849 patients with arterial
hypertension treated with either the ARB azilsartan medoxomil (AZL-M) or an ACE
inhibitor showed that AZL-M was more effective in improving control of hypertension.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials have demonstrated that compared with
the ARBs olmesartan and valsartan, AZL-M monotherapy had similar or better efficacy
at 40 and 80 mg doses.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr13-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore AZL-M and
chlorthalidone in combination may have more powerful antihypertensive effects
compared with similar antihypertensive combination therapy. Indeed two phase 3
trials have shown that AZL-M combined with chlorthalidone showed superior
antihypertensive efficacy compared with AZL-M and hydrochlorothiazide treatment as
well as compared with the ARB olmesartan combined with
hydrochlorothiazide.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> AZL-M is currently approved for use as a monotherapy at doses
of 40 and 80 mg,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and approved in a fixed dosed combination (FDC) with
chlorthalidone (AZL-M 40 mg/chlorthalidone 12.5 mg and AZL-M 40 mg/chlorthalidone 25
mg) based, in part, on the data presented in this report as well as other studies in
patients with essential hypertension such as the pivotal 8-week factorial design
phase 3 trial (clinic SBP 160–190 mmHg) and a phase 3 study in patients who were
non-responsive to AZL-M treatment alone (clinic SBP 160–190 mmHg and 24-hour SBP
140–175 mmHg by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM)).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr20-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
              <p>An additional major factor in the decision to select chlorthalidone as the
thiazide-like diuretic to be combined with AZL-M was evidence showing that
chlorthalidone has been utilized in major clinical outcomes trials in hypertension,
and was associated with significantly superior stroke prevention than placebo
(relative risk 0.64; <italic>P</italic>=0.0003),<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and was found to have cardiovascular protective effects similar to those of
an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It should be noted, however, that clinical outcomes studies with hard
cardiovascular endpoints have not been conducted with the AZL-M/chlorthalidone
combination.</p>
              <p>This phase 3 clinical trial was designed as the first clinical trial of a potential
FDC product to assess the additive BP reduction by AZL-M 40 and 80 mg in combination
with chlorthalidone 25 mg, and served as the basis for the AZL-M/chlorthalidone FDC
clinical development programme, that included, among others, the pivotal phase 3
trial, which led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of the
AZL-M/chlorthalidone FDC.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Herein, we report the efficacy and safety of AZL-M co-administered in free
combination with chlorthalidone in patients with stage 2 hypertension.</p>

chlorthalidone 25 mg, AZL-M 80 mg with chlorthalidone 25 mg, or chlorthalidone
25 mg with placebo for 6 weeks. Treatment randomization was stratified by race:
black and non-black. AZL-M was manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company
(Osaka, Japan) and chlorthalidone 25 mg was manufactured by Mylan
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Morgantown, WV, USA). The protocol conformed to the
Declaration of Helsinki and regional regulatory guidelines and the study was
approved by regional institutional review boards. Each patient signed an
institutional review board-approved consent form before any study procedures
were initiated. The study medication blind was maintained using the interactive
voice response system, which was accessed by the study sites for randomization
number and study medication assignments.</p>
                <p>To qualify for randomization, patients were required to be at least 18 years of
age, to participate in a 3- to 4-week washout of previous antihypertensive
therapy if treated previously (with all patients receiving single-blind placebo
during the final 2 weeks of the washout), and to have stage 2 hypertension
defined as a post-washout sitting trough clinic SBP ≥160 and ≤190 mmHg at day –1
(day prior to randomization) and 24-hour mean SBP ≥140 mmHg and ≤180 mmHg by
ABPM at day 1.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Patients were also expected to have within the reference range clinical
laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, hematology and complete
urinalysis) or abnormal results that were deemed not clinically significant for
inclusion by the investigator.</p>
                <p>Patients with any forms of secondary hypertension, known or suspected unilateral
or bilateral renal artery stenosis, severe hypertension (seated clinic DBP

                <p>ABPM was performed prior to randomization on day –1, and at week 6 (or early
termination, if at least 4 weeks of double-blind therapy was completed) with a
Spacelabs 90207 monitor (Spacelabs, Inc, Issaquah, WA, USA). The monitor was
fitted in the morning immediately after trough clinic BP measurement and
in-clinic dosing, and was programmed to measure BP every 15 minutes between
06.00 am and <sc>10.00</sc> pm, and every 20 minutes between 10.00 pm and 06.00
am. The change from baseline to week 6 in SBP and DBP using additional ABPM
parameters included BP mean at 0–12 hours after dosing, and trough mean at 22–24
hours after dosing. A complete schedule of study visits is presented in
Supplemental Table 1. All ABPM studies were to be performed under similar
circumstances (i.e. a working weekday), and patients were to engage in their
usual physical activity levels, but were to avoid strenuous exercise during the
monitoring period. In addition, sleeping during the daytime (e.g. a siesta) was
avoided during the ABPM study period. During BP measurements, patients were
instructed to hold their arm still and remain in place once cuff inflation
began. The patient was instructed to return to the clinic the following morning
to verify the ABPM reading quality. A successful ABPM recording had the
‘beginning of test’ time between 06.00 and 10.00 am, must have been ≥24 hours in
duration, captured ≥80% of the possible readings, had ≤2 non-consecutive hours
with &lt;1 valid reading, and had no consecutive hours with &lt;1 valid reading.
If these criteria were not met, the procedure could be repeated within 4–5 days
while the patient had sufficient drug supplies.</p>
                <p>Trough seated clinic BP measurements were taken at approximately 24 hours past
the previous dose and prior to dosing or blood collection on days of clinic
visits, with the patient sitting with feet on the floor in a quiet environment
for at least 5 minutes. An appropriate sized cuff was applied to the
non-dominant arm (supported at heart level), and three serial measurements were
taken (with at least 2 minute intervals) with an automated, calibrated and
certified device (Omron HEM 705CP, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). The
average of the three sitting BP levels was used to determine eligibility and at
all visits (screening, baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6/early termination). A single
pulse measurement was also taken manually.</p>

least one dose of double-blind study medication. The PPS was defined as all
patients in the FAS except those subjects identified as having a major protocol

variable only when there was both a baseline value and at least one value
obtained during the double-blind treatment period. The last observation carried

analysis.</p>
                <p>The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the 24-hour mean SBP by
ABPM, while the key secondary efficacy variable was change from baseline in
trough clinic sitting SBP. ABPM SBP was chosen as the primary endpoint as
several studies have shown that 24-hour SBP is the best predictor of
cardiovascular risk, even after adjustment for risk factors including clinic
BP.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="bibr26-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr27-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Treatment
group comparisons (AZL-M plus chlorthalidone vs. placebo plus chlorthalidone)
for the change from baseline in efficacy variables were carried out using an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment and baseline value (as
a covariate) in the model. Model estimates, including <italic>P</italic> values,
least squares (LS) means, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for treatment
differences in the change from baseline were developed within the ANCOVA
framework. Type 1 error was controlled for in the primary analysis by using the
closed testing principle. An additional secondary analysis was performed on
change from baseline in 24-hour mean ABPM DBP with treatment as fixed effect and
baseline in 24-hour mean ABPM DBP as a covariate. These analyses were also
performed on other ABPM parameters for SBP and DBP, including daytime mean
(06.00 am to 10.00 pm), nighttime mean (12.00 am to 06.00 am), BP mean at 0–12
hours after dosing, and trough mean at 22–24 hours after dosing. Subgroup
analyses such as age, sex, race and other important baseline factors were also
performed for primary and secondary efficacy variables.</p>
                <p>Sample size was estimated based on SBP by ABPM and clinical sitting SBP as it was
a key secondary endpoint. Assuming a 13 mmHg standard deviation (SD) for the
mean change from baseline in 24-hour mean SBP by ABPM for any treatment and a
15% dropout rate, a total of 540 patients (180 per treatment group) was
determined to be sufficient to achieve at least 90% power to detect a difference
of 5 mmHg between the AZL-M plus chlorthalidone treatment groups and placebo
plus chlorthalidone group by a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test of the mean
change from baseline in 24-hour mean ABPM SBP with a two-sided significance
level of 5%. Similarly, assuming a SD of 14 mmHg for the mean change from
baseline in trough clinic sitting SBP, the sample size provided at least 85%
power to detect a difference of 5 mmHg in trough clinic sitting SBP between the
AZL-M plus chlorthalidone treatment groups and placebo plus chlorthalidone group
with a two-sided significance level of 5%.</p>

                <p>Patients were enrolled at 74 investigative sites in Argentina, Chile, Mexico,
Peru and the United States from September 2007 to March 2009. The disposition of
patients screened and enrolled in the study and the demographics of enrolled

1</xref>, respectively. Patient demographics were comparable between groups.
A total of 1786 patients were screened, and 1344 patients from 74 sites in the
United States and Latin America entered the single-blind period. Of these
patients, 551 were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo with
chlorthalidone 25 mg (<italic>n</italic>=184), AZL-M 40 mg with chlorthalidone
25 mg (<italic>n</italic>=185), or AZL-M 80 mg with chlorthalidone 25 mg
(<italic>n</italic>=182). All but four randomly assigned patients received
at least one dose of double-blind study medication (three in the AZL-M 40 mg
plus chlorthalidone 25 mg group and one in the placebo plus chlorthalidone 25 mg
group). A total of 495 (89.8%) patients completed the study. The most common
reasons for premature discontinuation included adverse events (4.4%) and
voluntary withdrawal (1.8%). There was a higher withdrawal rate in the AZL-M 80
mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg group (13%) versus the other groups (8.6–8.7%),
primarily due to more patients who voluntarily withdrew or were lost to
follow-up. Among the randomly assigned participants, the mean age was 58.7
years, with males and females similarly represented; the baseline mean 24-hour
BP (151.4/89.7–153.2/90.5 mmHg) and mean clinic BP (165.6/93.4–166.4/94.8 mmHg)
were similar across the groups. There were no major differences with respect to
other demographic characteristics.</p>

reductions in SBP by 24-hour ABPM observed in the AZL-M 40 mg plus
chlorthalidone and AZL-M 80 mg plus chlorthalidone co-administration groups were
similar in magnitude (−31.7 (1.0) and −31.3 (1.0) mmHg, respectively), but
greater than that of the chlorthalidone-alone group (−15.9 (1.0) mmHg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320318795000">Figure 2</xref>). A statistically
significant LS mean difference was observed for the change from baseline in

chlorthalidone groups (−15.9 (95% CI −18.5, −13.2) mmHg;

                <p>Clinic SBP observations were similar to those observed with 24-hour ABPM. At

                <p>The baseline 24-hour LS mean (SE) DBP by ABPM was also similar between the

chlorthalidone (90.5 (0.9) mmHg) and AZL-M 80 mg plus chlorthalidone (90.1 (0.9)

greater for AZL-M 40 mg plus chlorthalidone (the differences in the LS means are
−10.3 mmHg (95% CI −12.0, −8.6)) and AZL-M 80 mg plus chlorthalidone (−10.5 mmHg

80 mg (94.5 (0.9) mmHg) plus chlorthalidone groups. After 6 weeks of treatment,
reductions in clinic DBP in both the AZL-M 40 mg plus chlorthalidone and AZL-M
80 mg plus chlorthalidone groups were similar in magnitude (−16.2 (0.7) mmHg and
−16.0 (0.7) mmHg, respectively) but greater than that observed in the
chlorthalidone-alone group (−8.9 (0.7) mmHg) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470320318795000">Figure 2</xref>). The differences in the LS
means of the change from baseline (−7.3 mmHg (95% CI −9.3, −5.3) and −7.1 mmHg
(95% CI −9.1, −5.1)) were statistically significant for the AZL-M 40 mg and 80
mg plus chlorthalidone co-administration groups, respectively, relative to the
chlorthalidone-alone group (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 for both individual
comparisons). Significantly greater reductions in mean clinic DBP were also
observed in both AZL-M plus chlorthalidone groups relative to the
chlorthalidone-alone group at week 2 and week 4.</p>
                <p>At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences across treatment
groups for any of the mean ABPM SBP or DBP parameters (trough, daytime,
nighttime and 0–12 hours after dosing). At week 6, ABPM parameters for both SBP
and DBP showed greater reductions in the nighttime and trough measures in the
chlorthalidone-alone group compared with daytime measures, whereas the opposite
was true for the co-administration therapy groups. However, co-administration
therapy yielded incremental reductions in SBP/DBP for each measure, and there
were statistically significantly greater reductions in favor of each AZL-M plus
chlorthalidone group relative to chlorthalidone alone for all ABPM parameters
(<xref rid="table2-1470320318795000" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
Results were similar between the FAS analyses described above and the analyses
based on the PPS (Supplemental Table 2). The mean SBP values observed at each
hour of the week 6 ambulatory recording are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320318795000">Figure 3</xref>. Both AZL-M plus chlorthalidone
co-administration groups’ 24-hour and 12-hour trough to peak ratios for SBP and
DBP were &gt;0.5 (range 0.52–0.63) and slightly higher than those of the
chlorthalidone-alone group (range 0.37–0.56). Patients aged ≥65 years tended to
have a higher baseline 24-hour SBP compared with those aged &lt;65 years;
however, treatment responses were similar in both groups.</p>

of ⩾20 mmHg from baseline, clinic DBP &lt;90 mmHg and/or reduction of ⩾10 mmHg

(chlorthalidone alone (51.9%) and AZL-M 40 mg and 80 mg co-administration groups
(52.2%) and (51.6%), respectively); however, there were notable variations in
the reporting rates of individual TEAEs. Commonly reported TEAEs (⩾2% of
patients in any of the treatment groups), such as dizziness, hypotension,
increased blood creatinine, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, hematuria,
asthenia and muscle spasms were more frequent in the AZL-M with chlorthalidone
groups, whereas headache and hypokalemia were reported more frequently in the
chlorthalidone-alone group. Increased serum plasminogen activator inhibitor and
elevated hs-CRP, which were exploratory variables, were also commonly reported
and more frequent in the AZL-M plus chlorthalidone groups.</p>

                <p>The percentage of patients with a TEAE that the investigator considered related
(possibly, probably, or definitely) to the study drug was higher in the AZL-M
plus chlorthalidone groups relative to chlorthalidone alone, primarily due to
increased reports of dizziness in the co-administration arms. The majority of
TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. Reports of TEAEs that led to
discontinuation and serious TEAEs were infrequent. The incidence of TEAEs that
led to permanent discontinuation was slightly higher in the AZL-M plus
chlorthalidone groups than with chlorthalidone alone. A total of seven patients
across treatment groups reported serious TEAEs, including one death in the
chlorthalidone-alone group (due to cardiogenic shock). There were two serious
TEAEs of syncope, one in each AZL-M plus chlorthalidone group, but these events
did not result in discontinuation. TEAEs related to signs and symptoms of
hypotension (such as dizziness) were reported more frequently in the AZL-M plus
chlorthalidone groups.</p>
                <p>Among laboratory parameters, a mean increase from baseline in serum creatinine
tended to be greater in the AZL-M plus chlorthalidone groups compared with
chlorthalidone alone, whereas the mean decrease from baseline in serum potassium
was greater in the chlorthalidone-alone group compared with AZL-M 40 mg and 80
mg plus chlorthalidone co-administration groups. Moderate increases of uric acid
were observed in all groups, with slightly greater mean increases in the AZL-M
plus chlorthalidone groups. Small increases of glucose and creatine kinase were
observed proportionally in all groups. There were no significant mean changes
from baseline in liver function parameters in any treatment group (Supplemental
Table 4).</p>
                <p>Creatinine elevations that met certain criteria (⩾30% and ⩾50% from baseline and
&gt;ULN) were reported by investigators as TEAEs of special interest, and
patients with ≥50% ULN elevations were considered for discontinuation. All
patients with creatinine elevations meeting either criteria were followed up
until normalization or stabilization. An analysis of the relationship between
creatinine elevations and BP reduction showed that patients with serum
creatinine elevations had a higher mean SBP at baseline and also experienced
greater reductions in SBP at week 6 than patients without serum creatinine
elevations. Among patients with serum creatinine elevations who had available
follow-up data, serum creatinine returned to or near baseline levels in all but
one patient.</p>

              <p>In this study of patients with stage 2 hypertension, co-administration of AZL-M 40
mg/chlorthalidone 25 mg and AZL-M 80 mg/chlorthalidone 25 mg produced clinically
meaningful and statistically significant reductions in 24-hour mean SBP and clinic
trough SBP relative to chlorthalidone alone. In addition, both combination doses
were more effective than chlorthalidone alone in achieving BP responses for clinic
SBP, DBP, and joint SBP and DBP targets. Importantly, the treatment effect observed
in the chlorthalidone 25-mg alone group (–21.8 mmHg) was consistent with previously
reported reductions between 15 mmHg and 20 mmHg in patients with mild to moderate
hypertension.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Likewise, reductions in 24-hour mean SBP in the
chlorthalidone-alone arm (–15.9 mmHg) were consistent with those observed in an ABPM
study of chlorthalidone 25 mg (–12.4 mmHg), albeit in a small cohort of subjects
with less severe hypertension (mean baseline clinic SBP 145 mmHg).<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that as monotherapy, chlorthalidone was more effective in
controlling hypertension than hydrochlorothiazide.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr8-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, AZL-M alone has
been shown to be more efficacious compared to olmesartan and valsartan.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr13-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, these two drugs
were selected as combination therapy in this study as they represented the most
effective antihypertensive agents in their respective classes. The current study was
the first clinical trial of the AZL-M/chlorthalidone FDC clinical development
programme and led to further clinical trials including a phase 3 trial composed of
1714 patients treated with AZL-M (20, 40, or 80 mg) and/or chlorthalidone (12.5 mg
or 25 mg) for 8 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Patients treated with AZL-M and chlorthalidone in combination showed greater
reductions in both clinic SBP and ABPM SBP when compared with AZL-M or
chlorthalidone monotherapy. Compelling clinical interest led to the immediate
drafting and publication of two other clinical trials of AZL-M/chlorthalidone FDCs
immediately on study completion.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In a study of 1071 patients
with stage 2 hypertension, patients treated with fixed-dose AZL-M 40 mg with
chlorthalidone 25 mg showed a greater reduction in both clinic SBP (5–7 mmHg) and
ABPM SBP (7–9 mmHg) following 12 weeks of treatment compared with fixed-dose
olmesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In another study of 609 patients with stage 2 hypertension, treatment with
fixed-dose AZL-M 40 mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg provided greater and clinically
meaningful reductions in clinic SBP compared with co-administration of AZL-M 40 mg
plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg treatment (35.1 mmHg vs. 29.5 mmHg;
<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The current study, although completed prior to Cushman et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and Bakris et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> is clinically relevant as these data provided the basis for a full phase 3
clinical development programme resulting in the approval of FDC AZL-M/chlorthalidone
in the United States and Mexico, and in other countries in South America, Europe and
Asia. In keeping with the antihypertensive results observed in this study, we also
note that azilsartan and azilsartan in fixed combination with chlorthalidone used in
the SPRINT trial of 9351 patients with SBP ≥130 mmHg, in which patients achieved a
mean SBP of 136.2 mmHg (<italic>n</italic>=4683; standard treatment group) or 121.4
mmHg (<italic>n</italic>=4678; intensive treatment group) following one year of treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Taken together, AZL-M plus chlorthalidone combination therapy provides
effective and additive BP reductions in patients with stage 2 hypertension.</p>
              <p>Examination of BP reduction by subgroup, including age, race, sex and BMI, did not
reveal evidence of heterogeneity in response to AZL-M plus chlorthalidone treatment.
In particular, the response to AZL-M 40 mg or 80 mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg
therapy was comparable among black and white patients, with absolute reductions in
24-hour SBP ranging between 31.4 mmHg and 34.2 mmHg across both subgroups and doses.
Decreases in 24-hour SBP with AZL-M plus chlorthalidone relative to chlorthalidone
alone were not substantially different in either subgroup (range –14.9 to –16.6
mmHg), although interpretation of these data are limited by the relatively small
number of black patients in the subgroup analyses.</p>
              <p>Overall, AZL-M/chlorthalidone co-administration was well tolerated and the incidence
of TEAEs was low among all three treatment groups. The majority of TEAEs were mild
or moderate in severity. Patients in the chlorthalidone-alone group experienced
higher rates of headache and hypokalemia, compared with combination therapy. In
fact, the use of AZL-M largely mitigated the hypokalemic effect caused by the
diuretic chlorthalidone, thus providing an approach for utilizing the
antihypertensive efficacy of chlorthalidone while minimizing its adverse effect on
potassium metabolism. A greater proportion of patients experienced dizziness in the
combination therapy groups compared with chlorthalidone alone. The types of TEAEs
and discontinuation rates in this study were similar to those reported in previous
studies and confirm the safety and tolerability profile of azilsartan plus
chlorthalidone.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Notably, while previous phase 3 trials examining the antihypertensive effects of
AZL-M alone tended to display a consistent though modest pattern of dose
differentiation between 40 mg and 80 mg,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> these trends were not
observed in this study; however, this study did not formally evaluate
differences in efficacy between AZL-M 40 mg and AZL-M 80 mg co-administered with
chlorthalidone. A similar pattern of blunted dose–response has been observed
with other ARB–diuretic combinations.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1470320318795000" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>

              <p>Co-administration of AZL-M 40 mg and 80 mg with chlorthalidone 25 mg was associated
with a positive benefit to risk and tolerability profile relative to chlorthalidone

chlorthalidone 25 mg alone in reducing BP. This study confirms that combination
therapy with AZL-M and chlorthalidone is an effective antihypertensive treatment in
