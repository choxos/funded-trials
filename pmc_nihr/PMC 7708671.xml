                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>We undertook a secondary analysis of mirtazapine (MIR): a placebo-controlled trial of the addition of mirtazapine to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotoninânorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in primary care. We subdivided participants into three groups by baseline generalized anxiety disorder score (GAD-7): severe (GAD-7 â©¾ 16), moderate (GAD-7 = 11â15), no/mild (GAD-7 â©½ 10). We used linear regression including likelihood-ratio testing of interaction terms to assess how baseline anxiety altered the response of participants to mirtazapine as measured by 12-week GAD-7 and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) scores.</p>

Participants with severe generalized anxiety receiving mirtazapine had lower 12-week GAD-7 score (adjusted difference between means (ADM) â2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) â0.69 to â4.95) and larger decreases in BDI-II score (ADM â6.36, 95% CI â1.60 to â10.84) than placebo. Conversely, there was no anxiolytic benefit (ADM 0.28, 95% CI â1.05 to 1.60) or antidepressant benefit (ADM â0.17, 95% CI â3.02 to 2.68) compared with placebo in those with no/mild generalized anxiety.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression the largest cause of disability globally (<xref rid="bibr33-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together (<xref rid="bibr7-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fava et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr15-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 1996</xref>) and the patient burden and complexity increases when both are present (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">McLaughlin et al., 2006</xref>). Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with poorer chances of response to treatment, increased severity of depression (<xref rid="bibr24-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Nutt, 1999</xref>) and increased chance of suicide (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett, 1988</xref>). The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressants prescriptions increasingly yearly, with 67.5âmillion antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017 (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">ONS, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (<xref rid="bibr10-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Gambi et al., 2005</xref>), panic disorder (<xref rid="bibr28-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro et al., 2001</xref>), obsessive compulsive disorder (<xref rid="bibr17-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Koran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Pallanti et al., 2004</xref>), post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref rid="bibr6-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>) and social anxiety disorder (<xref rid="bibr22-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Muehlbacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr30-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Schutters et al., 2010</xref>). Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions on relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and Barkin, 1998</xref>), while a small study has shown promising anti-depressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder (<xref rid="bibr11-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Goodnick et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
              <p>These trials did not, however, examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.</p>
              <p>There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines around treating depression with comorbid anxiety. Most evidence-informed guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not offer any specific advice on treating comorbid psychiatric conditions or preferred augmentation agents (<xref rid="bibr23-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">NICE, 2020</xref>). This issue is recognized by a recent guideline from the French Association for Biological Psychiatry: âAlthough the issue of comorbidity is recognized by evidence-based guidelines, few specific recommendations are provided regarding acute treatment with antidepressant drugsâ. This guideline, based on expert consensus, suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, NbN: SERT) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, NbN: SERT and NET) as first-line therapy for depression with any comorbid anxiety disorder, with mirtazapine recommended as a possible second-line agent (<xref rid="bibr4-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Bennabi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>The mirtazapine (MIR) trial (<xref rid="bibr14-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>) investigated the effectiveness of the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI in 480 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) recruited from primary care. Treatment-resistance was defined pragmatically as failure to respond to at least six weeks of an SSRI/SNRI at an adequate dose; in the event, 90% of patients in MIR had been on antidepressants for more than six months. The MIR trial did not find evidence of a meaningful clinical difference between Beck Depression Inventory score (BDI-II) scores at 12âweeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (adjusted difference between means (ADM) â1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) â3.92 to 0.27, primary outcome). It did, however, find a small difference in GAD-7 scores at 12âweeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (ADM 0.98, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93, secondary outcome), although it is not clear whether this is clinically meaningful. GAD-7 is a questionnaire which captures the features of GAD â a syndrome with the core symptoms of excessive, difficult to control and disruptive anxiety and worry with associated features such as restlessness and lack of sleep (<xref rid="bibr1-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). Similarly PANDA, a recent primary care trial of sertraline for depression, showed clear improvements in generalized anxiety, despite less convincing evidence of a superior antidepressant effect compared with placebo (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>The frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety means targeted prescribing for this group is a potentially valuable objective. The MIR participants had high levels of generalized anxiety, with 48.6% scoring greater than 10 on GAD-7 at baseline, the normal cut-off point for screening for GAD (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>). This is consistent with the previous research finding that 46% of those with depression have moderate to severe anxiety (<xref rid="bibr7-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fava et al., 2004</xref>). The MIR trial thus represents an important resource to examine a possible rationale for targeted prescribing in a common and difficult to manage cohort. Using data from the MIR trial, we aimed to investigate whether there was a differential effect on generalized anxiety and depression symptoms at 12 weeks according to baseline severity of generalized anxiety. Because there is evidence of mirtazapineâs effectiveness in anxiety disorders (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Katzman et al., 2014</xref>) and preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in depression with anxiety symptoms (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and Barkin, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Goodnick et al., 1999</xref>), we hypothesized that mirtazapine may be more effective in individuals within the MIR trial with greater generalized anxiety symptoms at baseline.</p>

                <p>The MIR study (<xref rid="bibr14-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>) was a multicentre pragmatic randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruiting 480 adults aged 18 years or more from general practices within four sites in England. Participants fulfilled International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) criteria for depression with an initial BDI-II score of &gt;14, despite using an SSRI or SNRI for at least six weeks. Patients with dementia, bipolar disorder, psychosis or any substance misuse disorder were excluded. Participants were identified through interrogation of GP records for those receiving antidepressant prescriptions on repeat or recruited opportunistically during GP consultations. These patients were then screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and invited to join the study.</p>
                <p>In MIR, 241 participants were randomized to mirtazapine and 239 to placebo, both given in addition to usual SSRI or SNRI treatment. Participants were stratified by centre and minimized by baseline BDI-II score (<xref rid="bibr3-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1996</xref>), sex and current psychological therapy. The primary outcome was BDI-II score at 12âweeks, with the GAD-7 score at 12âweeks a secondary outcome measure.</p>

                <title>Stratification</title>
                <p>This analysis was a hypothesis-driven secondary analysis using data from the MIR trial. Participants were stratified into groups based on their initial depression and generalized anxiety scores. To ensure clinically relevant categories, BDI and GAD-7 were stratified according to the scoring criteria used in validation studies (<xref rid="bibr3-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Beck et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>). We wanted to optimize power of our analysis and so aimed to minimize the number of categories to preserve the ability of interaction terms to find differences. Previous research suggested that 10 was an optimal cut-off to ensure optimal sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of generalized anxiety (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we combined the GAD-7 categories of 0â5 and 6â10 to provide our low/no anxiety baseline group. Resulting participants were stratified into three anxiety groups: mild generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 â©½10, <italic>n</italic> = 245), moderate generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 11â15, <italic>n</italic> = 133) and severe generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 â©¾16, <italic>n</italic> = 99). Three participants had no baseline GAD-7 measure and, thus, could not be included. BDI-II was stratified according to its standard clinical groupings: mild depression (BDI-II 14â19, <italic>n</italic> = 69), moderate depression (BDI-II 20â28, <italic>n</italic> = 138) and severe depression (BDI-II &gt;29, <italic>n</italic> = 273) (Beck et al., 1996).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Chi-square tests were used to examine differences in baseline characteristics between groups stratified according to GAD-7 scores as described above. Univariable regression was employed likewise for continuous measures. Three categorical baseline variables were found to differ across generalized anxiety severity strata above our threshold level for inclusion (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05): education level, suicidal ideation and financial situation.</p>
                <p>We used multivariable linear regression models to compare the mirtazapine and placebo groups, adjusting for stratification and minimization variables and the corresponding baseline value. This approach was based upon the model used in MIR. In the models examining GAD-7 at follow-up, we adjusted for baseline GAD-7 using the three-level categorical measure. We used likelihood ratio tests of an interaction term between treatment group and baseline anxiety strata to model the effect that baseline generalized anxiety had on each outcome as described in the below section.</p>
                <p>We ran the analysis with two models. The primary model was identical to the original MIR analysis to ensure comparability. The second, fully adjusted model additionally adjusted for education level, suicidal ideation and financial situation â the three baseline variables that differed by anxiety strata. All of these models adjusted for baseline depression level.</p>
                <p>We used categorial variables in our interaction term as we decided that these would enable any findings to be easily interpretable and relevant to clinical practice.</p>
                <p>To check if our results were specific to severe generalized anxiety rather than general symptom severity, we repeated all the linear regression models described above, substituting baseline depression group for baseline generalized anxiety group in the interaction term to see if the response to mirtazapine compared with placebo was moderated by increasingly severe baseline depression.</p>
                <p>All analyses were performed with STATA v15.</p>

                <p>As a sensitivity analysis, we ran our main models with logged values of the baseline and 12-week symptom scale scores. This enables a regression model assessing a ratio of baseline to 12-week score and, thus, the percentage change in symptoms to assess if our results still applied in this scenario. We also ran a missing imputation using chained equations (MICE) regression model on our data to check for effects of missing data as in the original MIR study. This model was run with 30 iterations, as guided by the fraction of missing information on the initial model.</p>

                <p>The original MIR analysis found a small overall benefit in reducing generalized anxiety at 12âweeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (ADM â0.98, 95% CI â0.03 to â1.93, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04).

Mirtazapine had a higher GAD-7 response rate compared with placebo in both those with moderate and severe generalized anxiety.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our analysis found that the reduction in generalized anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) at 12âweeks after addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI in TRD was moderated by baseline anxiety. Furthermore, there was weak evidence that baseline generalized anxiety moderated reduction in depression as assessed by BDI-II scores at 12âweeks. Additional analyses also showed some evidence that baseline generalized anxiety moderated change in depression as measured by PHQ-9, and social functioning (SF-12) but not quality of life scores (EQ-5D-5L).</p>
              <p>The benefit of mirtazapine over placebo was the most pronounced in people with severe generalized anxiety (GAD-7 â©¾16). In this group, the benefit was apparent in BDI-II, PHQ-9 and SF-12 scores as well as GAD-7. Conversely, in the group with minimal/mild generalized anxiety (GAD-7 â©½10), estimates of difference between adding in mirtazapine versus placebo were close to zero across all relevant outcome measures (BDI-II, GAD-7, PHQ-9, SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L) despite a larger group size of 227. This suggests that in the TRD group with mild generalized anxiety, there appears to be little benefit for adding in mirtazapine to an SSRI/SNRI. This group represents around half the study population.</p>
              <p>There was no evidence of moderation by baseline depression severity as measured by the BDI-II. However, those with severe generalized anxiety symptoms had, on average, severe depression on the BDI-II, while those with low levels of generalized anxiety had only moderate severity depression. While our results do not support mirtazapine being more effective than placebo in those with greater severity of depressive symptoms in isolation, it is possible that its benefits are more apparent in patients experiencing a greater severity of illness expressed as a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms.</p>
              <p>In the most anxious group (GAD-7 â©¾16), depression scores as assessed by BDI-II were 6.11 lower than the placebo group on average. This difference is sizeable and likely to be clinically important. Meanwhile, the improvement of 2.8âpoints on GAD-7 compared with placebo found in the most anxious group in our analysis compares favourably to the improvement found in PANDA of sertraline over placebo (1.3) (<xref rid="bibr19-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, recent unpublished work based on the PANDA cohort suggests that an improvement of 1.5 on the GAD-7 is a clinically meaningful change whereby patients are likely to feel better (<xref rid="bibr18-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kounali et al., 2020</xref>), a threshold our findings exceed. However, the population in PANDA were not treatment-resistant, and a higher threshold for meaningful clinical improvement might apply to the MIR trial population (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Button et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>We found that mirtazapine appears to decrease depressive symptoms and improve mental-health-related social functioning in people with more severe generalized anxiety, but not in those without generalized anxiety, in the context of a trial that did not find overall treatment group differences (<xref rid="bibr14-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>). A possible explanation for this is that augmentation of mirtazapine in depressed patients with comorbid generalized anxiety helps relieve anxious symptoms, which then may lead to reduction in depressive symptoms and better general functioning. This was observed in the PANDA trial where decreases in anxiety levels were seen at six weeks, while decreases in depressive symptoms took 12âweeks to occur (<xref rid="bibr29-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Salaminios et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, the MIR trial did not measure GAD-7 levels at six weeks, so we were unable to test this hypothesis in this study.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Limitations of this paper include that this was an unplanned secondary analysis of a trial, which can be susceptible to hypothesizing after results are known (<xref rid="bibr13-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kerr, 1998</xref>) and multiple testing. However, previous literature has explored mirtazapineâs effect in anxiety (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and Barkin, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and this led to the hypothesis-driven nature of this analysis of a single moderating factor.</p>
                <p>The post-hoc nature of the analysis means that the trial was not originally designed to examine the relationships explored in this paper and, hence, was underpowered. This explains the wide confidence intervals found in our analysis, which cover differences that may or may not be clinically relevant.</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited based on depression diagnosis and high BDI-II scores. A sizeable proportion of the participants, therefore, had lower generalized anxiety scores as assessed by GAD-7. These participants have less scope for improving anxiety symptoms due to a floor effect. However, although this effect may contribute to the observed interaction when examining GAD-7 scores, it is not sufficient to explain the observed moderating effects of baseline generalized anxiety on PHQ-9, SF-12 or BDI-II scores, even when adjusting for baseline depression.</p>
                <p>The strengths of this analysis are that this large, randomized controlled trial was pragmatically recruited, with a definition of TRD easy to operationalize in a primary care setting. Furthermore, this tests the treatment in the setting where it is most used: primary care. Additionally, our participants had a range of generalized anxiety symptoms representative of findings in previous research (<xref rid="bibr7-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fava et al., 2004</xref>). These factors make our findings more generalizable.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, our regression analyses adjusted for baseline differences including all the minimizing factors involved in randomization and baseline depression scores. Additionally, our analyses survived last observation carried forward, log transformation and further adjustment for other baseline differences across baseline anxiety stratum. This suggests a robust observed effect.</p>
                <p>Another strength is the large size of the trial, which meant there were substantial numbers in each sub-group, allowing for direct comparison of effectiveness across anxiety groups in one trial â which has not previously been examined. Furthermore, unlike previous evidence (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and Barkin, 1998</xref>) that used subscales of depression scores to assess anxiety, MIR examined generalized anxiety with GAD-7. This is a specific, well-validated measure used widely in screening for GAD, with a cut-off score of 10 on GAD-7, having a 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>). The effects found here would be clinically important if they were to be replicated.</p>

              <title>Implications</title>
              <p>Clarifying effective treatment for patients with treatment-resistance in primary care is key, as these patients are a common group that suffer from poorer quality of life, are harder to manage and utilize substantial healthcare resources (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek et al., 2014</xref>). When depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur, they represent a more severe end of the population of depressed people (<xref rid="bibr27-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Pandarakalam, 2018</xref>). This is reflected in the baseline characteristics of participants in our high generalized anxiety group (GAD-7 â©¾16) who had higher baseline depression, rates of suicidal ideation and rates of struggling financially in addition to lower quality of life measures.</p>
              <p>These results add support to existing evidence that mirtazapine is a useful treatment in managing generalized anxiety in those with depression (<xref rid="bibr9-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Fawcett and Barkin, 1998</xref>). Additionally, this analysis suggests the possibility that this use of mirtazapine in those with severe generalized anxiety may improve both depressive symptoms and social functioning. This result was achieved by the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI, a strategy previous trials did not examine. These findings suggest a possible path to selectively targeting the addition of mirtazapine based on comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms when first-line treatment fails. This is in line with existing expert-consensus-based guidance on the use of mirtazapine in those with anxiety-predominant depression (<xref rid="bibr4-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">Bennabi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>Conversely, these findings did not find any evidence for adding in mirtazapine in those without generalized anxiety symptoms, who have failed to respond to first-line antidepressant therapy. This is important, given the increase in prescriptions of antidepressants, to identify groups where antidepressants fail to work, in addition to those in whom they might be effective (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881120965939" ref-type="bibr">ONS, 2018</xref>).</p>

Obtaining individual-patient-level data in previous trials for mirtazapine in TRD would help determine if the effects found here can be replicated. A formal study to assess the benefits of mirtazapine in treating TRD with severe symptoms of generalized anxiety might then be warranted.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In this secondary analysis, the addition of mirtazapine was more effective at treating generalized anxiety than placebo in patients with TRD and severe anxiety symptoms. Mirtazapine may also be more effective at treating depressive symptoms and improving social functioning in those who have higher levels of anxiety. Conversely, there appears to be little clinical utility in adding mirtazapine in those without any concurrent anxiety. This should be formally assessed in trials in the future but may represent a strategy for stratifying treatment of resistant depression depending on symptom subtype.</p>
