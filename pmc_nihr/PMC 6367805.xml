                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">While the majority of seriously ill people wish to die at home, only half achieve this. The likelihood of someone dying at home often depends on the availability of able and willing lay carers to support them.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Dying people are usually unable to take oral medication. When top-up symptom relief medication is required, a clinician travels to the home to administer injectable medication, with attendant delays. The administration of subcutaneous injections by lay carers, though not widespread practice in the UK, has proven key in achieving home deaths in other countries.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Our aim is to determine if carer-administration of as-needed subcutaneous medication for four frequent breakthrough symptoms (pain, nausea, restlessness and noisy breathing) in home-based dying patients is feasible and acceptable in the UK.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This paper describes a randomised pilot trial across three UK sites, with an embedded qualitative study. Dyads of adult patients/carers are eligible, where patients are in the last weeks of life and wish to die at home, and lay carers who are willing to be trained to give subcutaneous medication. Dyads who do not meet strict risk assessment criteria (including known history of substance abuse or carer ability to be trained to competency) will not be approached. Carers in the intervention arm will receive a manualised training package delivered by their local nursing team. Dyads in the control arm will receive usual care. The main outcomes of interest are feasibility, acceptability, recruitment rates, attrition and selection of the most appropriate outcome measures. Interviews with carers and healthcare professionals will explore attitudes to, experiences of and preferences for giving subcutaneous medication and experience of trial processes. The study has obtained full ethical approval.</p>

                <title>Introduction</title>
                <p id="Par38">Caring for the dying during their last few days of life, in a place of their preference, is an essential part of health and social care. The majority express a wish to die at home (79%); however, only half of those achieve this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The likelihood of patients remaining at home often depends on availability of able and willing informal carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These carers take on numerous care tasks, often including the responsibility of assisting patients to have their oral as-needed medications. Extending the role of carers to include administering subcutaneous (SC) injections has proven to be key in achieving home death in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par39">Pain, nausea/vomiting, restlessness/agitation and noisy breathing (rattle) are common symptoms in the dying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition to regular (background) medication, given via continuous SC infusion using a syringe pump, guidelines suggest using additional (â€˜as -neededâ€™) medication for symptoms that â€˜break throughâ€™ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As dying patients are commonly unable to take oral medication, as-needed medication is most often given as a SC injection by a healthcare professional (HCP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], usually a district nurse (DN) in the UK.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Medication for breakthrough symptoms is usually prescribed in advance (anticipatory prescribing) and kept in the patientâ€™s home. Medication administration can be severely delayed by HCPsâ€™ travel time to the home and/or the non-availability of anticipatory medication in the home. Delays happen even with dedicated out-of-hours (OOH) â€˜rapid responseâ€™ nursing services for home-based dying patients. Our local audit revealed long waits. The median wait from call to OOH service for symptom control to as-needed medication administration by HCP was 86 min (mean = 99 min, range = 35â€“167 min), not including time from administration to onset of action or symptom control. Breakthrough pain is usually quick in onset with a median duration of 30 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Long waits mean that pain is often not adequately managed in the home setting, as shown in the National Survey of Bereaved People (VOICES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">This project focuses on timely administration of as-needed medication for dying patients being cared for at home, particularly whether lay carer role-extension (to be trained to give as-needed SC injections) is feasible and acceptable in the UK.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par42">Although carer administration of medication (including strong opioids) is lawful and practical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is not currently part of usual care everywhere in the UK. This practice is much-needed: the national Palliative and End of Life Care Priority Setting Partnership (PeolcPSP) surveyed 1403 people including patients within the last years of life, current and bereaved carers, and HCPs on their unanswered questions about palliative and end-of-life care. They accorded highest priority to research into the provision of palliative care, including symptom management, outside of working hours to avoid crises and help patients to stay in their place of choice. The survey noted the information and training needs of carers and families to provide the best care for their loved one who is dying, including training for giving medicines at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Data from the PeolcPSP indicated that UK patients are being denied the opportunity to die at home due to lack of access to adequate symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">Carers across the world embrace this as an option, as evidenced through the published literature as well as evidence from our Patient Public Involvement (PPI) group consultations. In Australia, the practice is well-established (&gt; 30 years) and highly acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A manualised educational package and evidence-based guidelines are available.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Successful carer-administration of as-needed SC medication for breakthrough symptoms in a dying patient may:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par45">â–ª improve the experience (and thus increase the likelihood of a â€˜good deathâ€™) for the patient who chooses to be at home by providing speedier symptom control and supporting their wish to die at home;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">â–ª empower lay carers through the personal fulfilment of having supported a patientâ€™s wish to stay at home, increase satisfaction, and reduce anxiety and frustration related to poor symptom control;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">â–ª reduce inappropriate emergency (crisis) admissions due to uncontrolled symptoms and their associated costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">â–ª free up community staff time to address other needs of patients and families, contributing to sustainability of services.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par49">This practice appears acceptable and has become embedded in Australia. However, as per our rapid review, there are no randomised studies testing carer-administered non-oral medication in the last days of life for home-based patients anywhere else in the world.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Equipoise is emerging on this topic in the UK. Carer-administration of as-needed non-oral (including SC) medication for breakthrough symptoms in home-based dying patients is practised in a limited way in some areas in the UK and has been for a number of years. For this to be widely available to all carers who are considering supporting a loved one at home, it must be tested in a UK environment, with the support of an evidence-based carer education programme and resources. Not all family, carers or patients at home will want to be involved in this practice; the research will help to ascertain the proportion of those who are interested and how to train and support those who are willing.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>How does the existing literature support this project?</title>
                  <p id="Par51">A. Carers prioritise rapid symptom control and are willing and able to administer injectable drugs, including controlled drugs such as morphine: a narrative literature review of family carer perspectives on supporting a dying person at home illustrated the desire of families to provide immediate symptom relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our review found that caregivers are willing to learn to overcome reservations about administering SC medications. The ability to alleviate their loved onesâ€™ symptoms and support them to stay at home was of paramount importance.</p>
                  <p id="Par52">B. There is an existing evidence-based education package and medication resources: a Brisbane group developed and evaluated an educational package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and a randomised trial of who prepares the SC injections (carer, nurse or pharmacist) was completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Singapore, a colour-coded pre-prepared â€˜Comfort Care Kitâ€™ is in use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with oral and non-oral as-needed medication for caregiver administration. A telephone survey of 49 family carers showed that 67% used the kit, all family members found it easy and 98% found it effective for symptom management. All except one patient died at home. In Canberra, the provision of an Emergency Medical Kit (including for use by lay carers) was largely viewed as an effective strategy in giving timely symptom control and preventing inpatient admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par53">C. There is growing UK evidence about the carer-role for patients in the last months/year of life, but there are few studies focusing on the last days of life (as reiterated by the Neuberger Review into the Liverpool Care Pathway) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The evidence that is beginning to accumulate mostly focuses on patients who have capacity within the last year of life. UK/Australian research includes â€˜Unpacking the homeâ€™ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The Cancer Carers Medication Management work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the SMARTE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and IMPACCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our project, in contrast, focuses on the last few days of life, where capacity is likely to be absent, with very different implications and issues for carer-administration.</p>

It was jointly developed and published by the National Partnership for Palliative and End of Life Care (27 national organisations) and has widespread support, especially as the Partnership included the Patientsâ€™ Association and charities with large PPI groups. They identified eight foundations for the six ambitions; one of these foundations relates to â€˜Involving, supporting and caring for those important to the dying personâ€™, acknowledging their importance in the caring team. Each ambition has a set of building blocks â€“ the one on â€˜practical supportâ€™ in ambition 6 is particularly applicable to CARiAD as it calls for finding â€˜new ways to give the practical support, information and training that enables families â€¦ to helpâ€™. There has been strong positive reception to the framework and many localities are using it to consider their local strategies. Its message about shared ownership and responsibility is particularly pertinent;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">â–ª in the UK, this practice is not widely accepted as usual care.

                  <p id="Par59">HCPs in all three sites have been universally positive towards testing the intervention; if found to be beneficial, this could make their patients more comfortable and their jobs more manageable. In the longer term, this innovation could relieve some pressure on Emergency Departments by reducing inappropriate emergency (crisis) admissions due to uncontrolled symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par60">Pressure on DN time could also be relieved as extra visits (in addition to the daily check) to administer as-needed medication would decrease, contributing to sustainability of services.</p>

                  <p id="Par61">To inform the development of the intervention and specific processes at each site, three expert stakeholder workshops were conducted, one in each recruitment site. Half-day face-to face workshops were convened, based on the successful model used in the El-CID trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Each workshop had 10â€“15 participants representing patients, carers, general practitioners (GPs), DNs, pharmacists and specialist palliative care (SPC) clinicians. Two research team members facilitated, setting the context and background to the proposed intervention. Notes were kept which allowed a report of proceedings to be generated.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Participants discussed trial procedures, which were then developed based on the consensus reached. The issues covered were: Identification and risk assessment, and approach to potential participants; Consent; Prescription, supply and storage of drugs; Delivery of the intervention; Monitoring and accountability; Outcome measures collection; Post-bereavement interviews; and Ethical considerations.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">Trial-specific materials were also developed to reflect the consensus reached: for HCPs â€“ prescribing advice (relating to patients and carer in the intervention arm), competency checklist, risk assessment; for carers â€“ Carer Diary, carer information booklet â€˜Subcutaneous medication for breakthrough symptoms in the last days of life: a Guide for carersâ€™, step-by-step guides.</p>

The three pilot study sites have been chosen as they are representative of the range of sites for a future definitive study.</p>
                <p id="Par71">The trial was funded by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research (National Health Service). It has received a favourable ethical opinion from the Wales 1 National Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 17/WA/0208, IRAS project ID: 227970) and the Bangor University Research Ethics Committee. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised that this pilot RCT is not a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP). The study is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry (ISRCTN11211024). Approval was granted from the Research and Development departments of all three sites. SPIRIT 2013 recommendations and CONSORT 2010 statements (including those specific to randomised pilot and feasibility trials) guided protocol development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

A risk assessment screening tool has been refined for CARiAD, based on existing self-medication tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The initial patient approach will be done separately from the carer, unless otherwise requested by the patient and if the attending HCP deems this appropriate, i.e. there is no perceived risk of patientâ€“carer coercion. As the project involves sites in Wales, the Participant Information Sheets and consent forms will be translated into Welsh for the Welsh centres and offered bilingually to comply with the Welsh Language Act 1993. Dyads will be given as much time as they need to consider the information sheets and discuss with family, friends or the healthcare team until they decide whether to take part. They will be told that they can refuse participation without giving reasons.</p>

                    <p id="Par85">A researcher will seek advance consent separately from both the patient and their lay carer at a time judged to be suitable by the attending HCP. This gives the patient and carer as much time as they need to understand the nature of the research, ask questions and make their feelings clear on trial participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

As the risk assessment will exclude dyads where there are concerns about relational issues between patient and carer, the carer can act as Personal Consultee.</p>
                    <p id="Par87">If the carer does not wish to act as the Personal Consultee and there is no additional family member or close friend to take on this role, we will appoint a Nominated Consultee (e.g. a HCP not associated with the research) who will act for all patients in this situation in the trial.</p>

This will be made clear to all potential participants at the time they consent to participation and throughout their time in the trial. Non-completion of the follow-up questionnaires will not constitute formal withdrawal from the trial; unless the participant requests withdrawal of their data completely, it may be used to impute values for the analysis.

Lay carers will receive training on: common symptoms that may occur in the last days of life and how to assess if their loved one needs medication for a particular symptom; how to prepare (draw up) medication and dispose of sharps (glass ampoules and drawing up needles); how to administer SC medication by needle-less technique (utilising a â€˜butterflyâ€™ SC catheter); how to assess the effect of the medication; and support available, including primary care team as well as dedicated 24/7 SPC support. If a symptom occurs for which medication is deemed necessary (either as expressed by the patient, if able, or as assessed by the carer), the carer can use the training outlined above to administer the appropriate medication.</p>

CARiAD recruitment sites will be advised to follow usual prescribing practice.

                  <p id="Par94">â€˜Usual routesâ€™ for support in each recruitment area are different. For some areas, there is direct access to a 24/7 SPC advice line for carers in addition to support from the patientâ€™s primary care team within or out-of-hours. In other areas support for the carer will be via their primary care team, while the GPs and DNs can call on advice from SPC clinicians.</p>
                  <p id="Par95">In the intervention arm, carers will be trained to administer as-needed SC medication, although they will not be obliged to do this. If the carer needs the support of a HCP, either because they would feel more confident having a HCP present when they administer medication or they wish the HCP to assess and give medication, they can obtain it via the usual routes in their area. If the carer has reached the limit of the number of injections which can be given in 24 h (maximum three injections for each indication per 24 h period unless the prescribing clinician advised a maximum of fewer than three), they will be asked to contact a HCP as review is indicated. Usual routes for support might include DN team, GP, GP/DN out-of-hours, Hospice at Home team or a hospice advice line.

Outcomes will be measured for patients, their lay carers and HCPs. System barriers will also be noted. These measurements will be made at baseline, on a daily basis for symptom control and lay carer confidence, at 6â€“8 weeks after bereavement and at 2â€“4 months for a sub-sample (carer interviews).</p>
                <p id="Par99">Recruitment measurements are: the number of eligible patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and are willing to be randomised expressed as a percentage of the numbers screened; the number who withdraw after baseline assessment and randomisation; the number who complete the various outcome measurements at baseline and at later time points; and reasons for any non-completion.</p>
                <p id="Par100">Patient measurements are: baseline information (including demographic information, medical history, capacity assessment, preferred place of care in the last days of life, current drug management) and a daily Carer Diary during the study related to the presence and treatment of breakthrough symptoms (for use in both study arms). Data points in the diary will include: initial time breakthrough symptom triggered perceived need for an additional SC dose; whether noted by patient or lay carer; medication and dose, and time given; reason for medication (pain, nausea, restlessness, noisy breathing); symptom score before and 30 min after medication administration; and when symptom control/reduction of symptom to acceptable level was achieved. Hospital or hospice admissions during last illness and actual place of death will also be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par101">Carer measurements are: demographic information at baseline; Quality of Life in Life Threatening Illness â€“ Family Carer Version (QOLLTI-F) (at baseline, after the first as-needed SC medication, then every 48 h until the patientâ€™s death); whether HCP support was sought; Carer Experience Scale at baseline and after bereavement; Family Memorial Symptom Assessment Score â€“ General Distress Index (MSAS-GDI) at 6-8 weeks' post-bereavement visit; and qualitative interviews for a sub-sample at 2â€“4 months after bereavement. Specific to the intervention arm, confidence (in administering injection) and competence at intervals after training will be recorded.</p>

Safety outcome measures include the risk assessment, competency checklist and Significant Event reporting. Significant Event reporting will include the following: the appropriateness of administration (is administration accompanied by evidence of need?); proportionality (has the correct dose been administered?); side effects both anticipated and not anticipated; drug accountability (do stocks tally?); and carer events (e.g. distress, needle stick injury, accidental or purposeful self-administration).</p>
                  <p id="Par104">An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a trial participant (either patient of carer) and includes incidents that are not necessarily caused by or related to the trial. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is otherwise medically significant.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">All AEs and SAEs will be captured via Significant Event form. SAEs must be reported to the Principal Investigator (PI) and Sponsor within 24 h. As this is a study in patients who are terminally ill, death is an expected outcome. It will be recorded and reported to the sponsor, but will not be considered a SAE if, in the opinion of the PI, it was a natural conclusion to a patientâ€™s terminal illness. Due to the nature of the study, events of death will not require immediate reporting to the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC).</p>

                <p id="Par123">While the DCE (aiming to ascertain carersâ€™ preferences for their administration of SC medications) will be conducted as part of a future main study, the preparatory work required to identify relevant attributes and levels will be done as part of the embedded qualitative study component of the randomised pilot study. This will be done with each of the three carer groups in the second part of the interviews and will take up to 20 min. Attributes may feasibly include cost, time, perceived competency, confidence and potential risks. The process of attribute development will be informed by best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par124">The use of interviews for the determination of DCE attributes enables a greater opportunity for in-depth exploration of particular issues and concepts than would otherwise be possible in focus groups (which are more common in DCE development). Individual interviews are also better suited to discussions concerning sensitive topics. Within the first five interviews in each group, carers will be presented with a range of attributes, identified by the research team as being likely to affect carersâ€™ choice for own versus HCP administration of SC medications. Interviewees will have an opportunity to add other factors of their own choosing to the list and be asked to identify and rank attributes in order of importance. Thereafter, we will use the interviews to pilot the presentation of the highest ranked attributes. The ordinal ranking across each group will be determined and those ranked highest will be taken forward for DCE development. We have successfully implemented this method in previous DCEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and it is consistent with the reductiveness approach of attribute development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par125">We will also pilot the Carer Experience Scale as a means to estimate carer utility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The index values derived from this scale offer a preference-based approach to incorporate the effects on carers in economic evaluation, focusing on care (rather than health)-related quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par126">A fully justified sample size is not required; size has been justified by estimating what a future definitive RCT will need. Assuming an important difference of 0.4 (SD=1) on the Family MSAS-GDI a sample of about 216 is required to achieve 90% power to detect a difference of this size with a significance level of 0.05 using a two-sided test. Equivalently a sample of about 550 would be required to detect a difference of 0.5 points (SD=2) using the QOLLTI-F.</p>
                  <p id="Par127">Using the larger of these estimates for the feasibility trial, we will assume about 9% of the main trial size, to give an 80% confidence interval to exclude a clinically important difference, requires ~â€‰25 in each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Sim and Lewis recommend a sample of about 50â€“55 to ensure robust estimates of the variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Using estimates of dropouts, we predict we need to approach 200 potential participants to achieve 100 randomised participants, with 50 completers. (â€˜Completerâ€™ is defined as a dyad who completed all the study measures from baseline to follow-up at 6â€“8 weeks after bereavement.) We will therefore need to approach 5.5 dyads per month from each of the three sites and randomise 2.7 dyads per months from each of the three sites to meet our recruitment target. Assuming we will recruit equally between the three areas, we need to approach 66, randomise 33â€“34 and have 16â€“17 available per area for analysis (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: Trial flowchart).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial <italic>flowchart</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3179_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                  <p id="Par128">As per the 2013 Office of National Statistics data described earlier, we know that 8.6% of all deaths are home deaths due to neoplasms in those aged &gt;â€‰15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Deaths due to neoplasms are seen as a useful proxy for expected deaths.

              <p id="Par175">Empowering lay carers to support a loved oneâ€™s wish to die at home is an important part of care in the last days of life. Role extension for lay carers allowing them the option to give SC PRN injections is already practised and valued in other countries. It is important and timely to study this in the UK setting. In order to design a definitive study of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of carer administration in this context, rehearsal of the study procedures and logistics is required. The study we describe will fulfil this aim and will provide an exemplar for conducting RCTs in the last days of life by contributing to the emerging methodological development of palliative care research.</p>
              <p id="Par176">Specific design considerations resulted in the decision to propose a stand-alone (external) randomised pilot trial. These include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par177">â–ª the current UK context (post-Shipman, post-Liverpool Care of the Dying Pathway and with the ongoing euthanasia public debate), calling for careful attention to its impact on consent mechanisms and attitudes of carers, patients and HCPs to this innovation;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par178">â–ª the lack of clear UK-wide guidance on carer-administration of as-needed SC medication to dying home-based patients: though the practice is lawful, current guidance is not detailed nor specific enough for wide adoption;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par179">â–ª the lack of a clear and widely accepted training package for lay carers, adapted for the UK context;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par180">â–ª the uncertainty about the primary outcome measure for a definitive trial.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par181">These are unpredictable barriers until the re-worked Australian manualised intervention is introduced and trial processes are tested. If the intervention is proven feasible and acceptable, we anticipate a phase of ensuring new guidance is developed and put in place at national level in UK health systems to enable the practice before rolling out a full trial quickly. We have demonstrated a clear path towards a definitive RCT as per the Medical Research Council Framework for the evaluation of complex interventions principles, further informed by the Methods of Researching End of Life Care guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p>

Their involvement will be fundamental in disseminating the research results to patients, carers and healthcare professionals. Two additional groups of bereaved carers have been consulted and their suggestions on consent mechanisms, drug safety, training and ongoing support have been incorporated into the study design.

              <title>Authorsâ€™ contributions</title>
              <p>Authors are co-applicants on the NIHR HTA funding application. MP and CW conceived and designed the study with ZH, LR, BW, AB, PP and JOâ€™C providing guidance on the pilot trial methods. ZH provided guidance on sample size, statistical considerations and analysis, and PP, LR and RJ on outcome measures. AN and JH advised on the embedded qualitative study and DH on discrete choice experiment/health economics. AN and JH led on public contribution, with support from BF and JOâ€™C. Experience of UK Primary care clinical practice was provided by CW, and of SPC practice by BW/PP (England), AB/MP (Wales) and LR/SH (Australia). The UK policy context was illuminated by BW, AB and RJ, and ethical issues (including consent mechanism) by RR, BW, PL and BF. Network Support advice (including on Excess Treatment Costs) was gained from RR, medicines management advice from SJ (UK), and LR, SH (Australia). For the running of the trial, CW and MP will fulfil CI responsibilities, including supporting the Trial Manager and linking with â€˜championsâ€™. AB, PP and MP have PI responsibilities, including disseminating training to the trainers. All co-applicants will attend TMG meetings. Methodological/statistical oversight will be provided by ZH, BW, with ZH also supporting as Clinical Trials Unit Lead. AN is qualitative lead, with JHâ€™s support; both will oversee the qualitative researcher. DH is responsible for DCE/Health Economic outcomes elements; BF and JOâ€™C will lead on public contribution, supported via Wales Cancer Research Centre PPI mechanism. SJ will advise on medication management and RJ and BF will provide dissemination support. CW will continue to advise on primary care clinical practice; AB, PP, BW and MP on SPC practice; JH on sociological aspects; SJ and DH on pharmacy aspects/medicines management protocol generation; and RR and PL on ethical issues.MP, CW and JLR drafted the manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p>
