                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">In the context of COVID-19, NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and other children’s mental health services have faced major challenges in providing psychological treatments that (i) work when delivered remotely and (ii) can be delivered efficiently to manage increases in referrals as social distancing measures have been relaxed. Anxiety problems are a common reason for referral to CAMHS, children with pre-existing anxiety problems are particularly vulnerable in the context of COVID-19, and there were concerns about increases in childhood anxiety as schools reopened. The proposed research will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a brief online parent-led cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) delivered by the OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) platform with remote support from a CAMHS therapist compared to ‘COVID-19 treatment as usual’ (C-TAU) in CAMHS and other children’s mental health services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a two-arm, multi-site, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of OSI with therapist support compared to CAMHS and other child mental health services ‘COVID-19 treatment as usual’ (C-TAU) during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore parent and therapists’ experiences.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">If non-inferiority is shown, the research will provide (1) a solution for efficient psychological treatment for child anxiety disorders while social distancing (for the COVID-19 context and future pandemics); (2) an efficient means of treatment delivery as ‘normal service’ resumes to enable CAMHS to cope with the anticipated increase in referrals; and (3) a demonstration of rapid, high-quality evaluation and application of online interventions within NHS CAMHS to drive forward much-needed further digital innovation and evaluation in CAMHS settings. The primary beneficiaries will be children with anxiety disorders and their families, NHS CAMHS teams, and commissioners who will access a potentially effective, cost-effective, and efficient treatment for child anxiety problems.</p>

                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par80">More than a quarter of the population will experience an anxiety disorder at some point during their life, and for half of these people, this first occurs by the age of 11 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Anxiety disorders in childhood often continue into adolescence and adulthood and put these children at increased risk for other serious mental health disorders and impaired quality of life in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, societal costs for anxiety disorders are substantial, with estimated total costs in England of £8.9 billion, expected to rise to £14.2 billion by 2026 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par81">Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for children with anxiety disorders has been shown to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but only a minority of children with anxiety disorders access treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A recent UK survey found that more than 60% of children with anxiety disorders had not received any professional support, and only 2% had received CBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Families face extensive barriers accessing professional support for child anxiety disorders, including high demands on services, limited available support, and long waiting lists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par82">Traditional CBT for child anxiety disorders is typically lengthy (e.g. 10–20 h of therapist contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) and involves specialists working directly with the child. We have developed a briefer version of the traditional treatment that involves working directly with parents/carers (hereafter ‘parents’), and supporting them to help their child overcome their difficulties with anxiety. This brief parent-guided treatment has similar outcomes to the traditional approach despite being delivered with about 5 h of therapist contact and can be delivered by non-specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, improving treatment efficiency further could enable more families to access effective treatment when they first need it. Online delivery of parent-guided treatment offers a means to do this by substantially reducing the amount of therapist contact time needed. Delivering treatment online also has the potential to increase access to families who may experience barriers to accessing traditional treatment approaches. In a recent survey of parents of children with elevated anxiety in England, all parents had some form of Internet access, and more than 85% of parents reported that online treatment delivery would reduce stigma for families and allow families to use it at any time, and from home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par83">We have worked in collaboration with families, NHS clinicians, and a tech-company to co-design an online version of our parent-guided treatment for child anxiety disorders called OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. OSI comprises a parent website, an accompanying therapist case management system, and an accompanying child game app (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osiresearch.org.uk/osi/">https://osiresearch.org.uk/osi/</ext-link>). Modules are supported by 7 × 20-min telephone sessions between the parent and a therapist and a review session 4 weeks after the final treatment session.</p>

                  <title>Importance in the context of COVID-19</title>
                  <p id="Par84">The Health Innovation Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] highlighted that children with existing anxiety issues are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the UK Co-SPACE study, which has been tracking child and adolescent mental health throughout the pandemic, identified high levels of fear and worry about COVID-19 among children, including fears about leaving the house, and a significant increase in emotional symptoms in primary school-aged children during lockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and parents raised concerns about an increase in child anxiety at key stress points during the pandemic, including as restrictions eased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par85">In the Co-SPACE study, parents reported that they wanted help via online materials and personalised support from a professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; however, there are limited evidence-based platforms available to CAMHS to do this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. During the pandemic CAMHS therapists moved to typically delivering ‘face to face’ therapy via phone/videocall but have had little evidence-based guidance about how to do this most effectively and efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. OSI provides a potential means to address the challenges of meeting the needs of children with anxiety problems and their families; it can be delivered as intended despite social distancing measures and is sufficiently flexible to address COVID-19-specific fears/worries. However, it has not yet been subject to systematic evaluation, and we do not know whether outcomes are as good as those CAMHS are currently achieving through their usual practice and whether OSI with therapist support enables further efficiencies.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par86">The proposed research will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of OSI with therapist support for the treatment of child anxiety problems, compared to ‘COVID-19 treatment as usual’ (C-TAU) in CAMHS and associated children’s mental health services (from here on ‘CAMHS’) throughout the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further aims are to explore the trajectory of change as reported within the OSI platform, to inform further developments, and to understand therapist and parents’ experiences of treating child anxiety problems (across both arms) in the current context. This will maximise learning to (a) enable rapid implementation of remote treatment delivery in CAMHS in any subsequent periods of social distancing and (b) maintain the use of online platforms (such as OSI) in CAMHS as ‘normal service’ resumes.</p>

                  <p id="Par107">The study intervention is OSI (Online Support and Intervention for child anxiety) with therapist support. OSI is an online adaptation of an evidence-based brief parent-guided CBT programme for the treatment of anxiety problems in preadolescent children. OSI comprises a parent website, an accompanying therapist case management system, and an accompanying child game app (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osiresearch.org.uk/osi/">https://osiresearch.org.uk/osi/</ext-link>). The 7 modules are supported by weekly* 20-min telephone/video call sessions between the parent and a therapist and a review session 4 weeks after the final treatment session (*although this may be adjusted by parents/clinicians if required).</p>

                  <p id="Par113">It is also possible that the clinical team might withdraw the participant from the research treatment (OSI+therapist support) if allocated. If the therapist delivering treatment feels the child should not continue with OSI+therapist support (e.g. due to serious comorbidities arising that need to be addressed), we will retain the data and continue to invite the participant to take part in further assessments, unless the participant requests otherwise.</p>

For each domain, the respondent has to indicate whether they experience no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, or extreme problems. It also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) for participants to rate their overall health on a scale from 0 (“worst imaginable health”) to 100 (“best imaginable health”).

To further promote participant engagement, families who are active in the study will be emailed a monthly parent bulletin, containing updates about the trial. There will also be a Twitter account that families will be invited to follow. In terms of completing follow-ups, there will be a scheduled series of emails, text messages, and telephone calls made to the families during the 1-month window that their 14-week and 26-week questionnaires are due.

An interaction between time and randomised group will be fitted as a fixed effect to allow estimation of treatment effect at all time points. Non-inferiority is claimed if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval around the standardised effect size is −0.33. A <italic>P</italic>-value for non-inferiority will also be calculated.

                  <title>Health economics analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par230">In order for a new intervention to be widely adopted in the NHS, it is necessary to assess not only its clinical effectiveness but also its cost-effectiveness, namely whether the new intervention is good value for money compared with current practice. In other words, the performance of an economic evaluation alongside this RCT will allow us to establish whether OSI+therapist support is worth doing compared with C-TAU and whether we are satisfied that the health care resources required for OSI+therapist support to be made available to those who could benefit from it should be spent this way rather than some other way, i.e. C-TAU in this specific case. Therefore, the results of the economic evaluation will be invaluable to inform NHS decisions for treating child anxiety in such challenging circumstances and beyond.</p>
                  <p id="Par231">The economic aspects of the study are summarised in this protocol. Details will be fully described in a health economics analysis plan (HEAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which will be finalised before any analysis takes place.</p>
                  <p id="Par232">The economic evaluation will comprise cost-utility analysis (CUA) as primary analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) as secondary analysis. They will be conducted from the NHS and personal services perspective (base-case analysis) as per NICE recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A wider societal perspective (including parental health care resource use and work productivity and school impacts) will be adopted in sensitivity analyses. We will follow best-practice guidelines for conducting and reporting economic evaluation analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Both an intention-to-treat and per-protocol approach will be adopted for primary and secondary analyses, as it is common in inferiority trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Missing data will be imputed by use of conditional mean imputation for missing values deemed highly deterministic (e.g. online/ face-to-face therapist contacts), and multiple imputation for other variables (e.g. GP consultations) under the assumption of missing at random. In the cost-utility analysis, the health outcomes will be quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for the child (base-case analysis), and for the parent-child dyad (sensitivity analysis). QALYs will be derived from the collected measures CHU-9D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] for the child, and EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] for the parent.</p>
                  <p id="Par233">In the secondary cost-effectiveness analyses, two outcomes will be considered, namely the primary clinical outcome (CAIS-P), and the percentage of school attendance. For each participant, components of treatment costs and other individual, family, and wider societal costs (as collected using the economic logs completed by therapists/ parents) will be computed by multiplying units of resource use by their unit costs and then summed to obtain a total cost per patient. Unit costs for health, social care, and other resources will be mainly derived from local and national sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and estimated in line with best-practice. Costs will be expressed in pounds sterling at current prices. Given the short time-frame of the trial and follow-up, discounting will not be applied to costs or effects. The incremental costs and effects will be reported using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), where appropriate, and presenting cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty surrounding ICERs will be also conducted.</p>
                  <p id="Par234">It is important to note that we originally planned to have two co-primary economic outcomes (cost-utility analysis (CUA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)); however, after initiating the trial, following consultation with expert colleagues, we decided that it would be better to have a single primary economic analysis, i.e. the CUA, and consider both the two CEAs as secondary. This is not only because the outcome of the CUA is what NICE prefers, but also to avoid not being able to come to a meaningful conclusion should the CUA and the CEA show contrasting results. This change was approved by the study ethical approval body on 20/9/2022.</p>

                  <p id="Par273">The 14-week and 26-week assessments will include questionnaires to monitor participants’ functioning and quality of life; therefore, information on some of the potential adverse events identified in this document will be routinely collected. Therapists will also be asked to indicate the presence of an SAE or AE that arises during the course of treatment. Further investigation will be made by the clinical team and the PI and the SAE/AE procedures will be followed where applicable. Specifically, the clinical team and the PI will assess the frequency and severity of the adverse event(s) and determine whether the participant should be withdrawn from the trial. The decision of the clinical team will be followed in the event that a consensus is not reached. Participants will also be given the opportunity to report adverse events anonymously after the parent and child complete questionnaires at 14 and 26 weeks and in person (remotely) after the qualitative interviews (for the parents). The research team will regularly review responses to identify any responses that indicate the presence of an adverse event and will report summaries of these responses to the Trial Steering Committee for review.</p>

                  <p id="Par274">All AEs and SAEs will be recorded, logged, and monitored by the PI and TMG. If an AE is reported more than once for a participant, or more than three times during the study, it will be treated as an SAE.</p>
                  <p id="Par275">A serious adverse event (SAE) occurring to a participant will be reported to the REC that gave the favourable opinion of the study where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator the event was ‘related’ (resulted from administration of any of the research procedures) and ‘unexpected’ in relation to those procedures. Reports of related and unexpected SAEs will be submitted within 15 working days of the Chief Investigator becoming aware of the event, using the HRA report of serious adverse event form.</p>
                  <p id="Par276">In the event that a complaint is received from a participating parent or child, the therapists, or their managers, the CI will attempt to resolve the issue as far as is possible. If this is not possible, and the issue remains unacceptable to participants, formal complaints will be logged and dealt with by the sponsor’s representative in liaison with the CI. Those indicating an AE or SAE will be logged accordingly.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par280">This study has been designed to be a pragmatic trial embedded in the services which would be the typical users of this type of brief intervention for child anxiety problems. This is a definite strength of the trial design, as it maximises the likelihood that the results will reflect the outcomes that could be expected in clinical practice outside of a trial. Designing the trial to be almost entirely managed using online platforms will enable us to have large numbers of trial sites spread across the UK, and to involve clinical teams who have previously not taken part in the research.</p>
              <p id="Par281">If non-inferiority is found, the research will provide the following: (1) a solution for efficient psychological treatment for child anxiety disorders while social distancing (for the current context and future pandemics); (2) an efficient means of treatment delivery as ‘normal service’ resumes to enable CAMHS to cope with the anticipated increase in referrals when social distancing measures are relaxed and schools re-open; and (3) a demonstration of rapid, high-quality evaluation and application of online interventions within NHS CAMHS to drive forward much-needed further digital innovation and evaluation in CAMHS settings. The primary beneficiaries will be children with anxiety problems and their families, NHS CAMHS teams, and commissioners who will access a potentially effective, cost-effective, and efficient treatment for child anxiety problems.</p>

                <title>Limitations and barriers</title>
                <p id="Par282">Conducting a trial during the COVID pandemic is challenging. From a structural perspective, support during this period for clinical teams taking part in the trial may not always be available, and also an increased, and in many cases more severe, number of referrals is likely to put significant pressures on clinical teams. We are reliant on parent and child reports of treatment outcomes and do not have the capacity to conduct systematic clinical assessments within the trial procedures. We are also reliant on clinical teams and families to confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria; however, this does mean that the participants reflect families who would likely be offered the novel intervention within routine clinical services.</p>
