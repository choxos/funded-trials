                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Liver transplantation is a complex operation that can provide significant improvements in quality of life and survival to the recipients. However, serious complications are common and include major haemorrhage, hypotension and renal failure. Blood transfusion and the development of acute kidney injury lead to both short-term and long-term poor patient outcomes, including an increased risk of death, graft failure, length of stay and reduced quality of life. Octreotide may reduce the incidence of renal dysfunction, perioperative haemorrhage and enhance intraoperative blood pressure. However, octreotide does have risks, including resistant bradycardia, hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia and QT prolongation. Hence, a randomised controlled trial of octreotide during liver transplantation is needed to determine the cost-efficacy and safety of its use; this study represents a feasibility study prior to this trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We describe a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled feasibility study of continuous infusion of octreotide during liver transplantation surgery. We will recruit 30 adult patients at two liver transplant centres. A blinded infusion during surgery will be administered in a 2:1 ratio of octreotide:placebo. The primary outcomes will determine the feasibility of this study design. These include the recruitment ratio, correct administration of blinded study intervention, adverse event rates, patient and clinician enrolment refusal and completion of data collection. Secondary outcome measures of efficacy and safety will help shape future trials by assessing potential primary outcome measures and monitoring safety end points. No formal statistical tests are planned. This manuscript represents study protocol number 1.3, dated 2 June 2021.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Liver transplantation is a potentially life transforming intervention with excellent outcomes (1-year and 5-year survival of 94% and 84%, respectively).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is, however, a major operation in patients with multiple comorbidities and is associated with a 3% perioperative mortality rate and 70% complication rate. Intraoperative haemorrhage is serious and commonly occurs during mobilisation of the diseased liver, exacerbated by coagulopathy and abnormal vasculature due to portal hypertension. Bleeding can cause hypotension, reduced perfusion of the transplanted graft and increased incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Blood loss and transfusion are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and cost of transplantation and can have a long-term detrimental effect on patient well-being and quality of life.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref></p>
              <p>Octreotide is a synthetic analogue of somatostatin with an excellent safety profile<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> that may improve renal outcomes, reduce perioperative bleeding and increase exogenous vasopressor sensitivity during liver transplantation. AKI following liver transplantation occurs in 25%–60% of patients with normal renal function prior to surgery, with half of these patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) after surgery.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> The need for post-transplant RRT increases the length of hospital stay and the risk of early allograft dysfunction, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mortality.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Risk factors for renal dysfunction following transplantation include intraoperative hypotension, lower quality donor grafts, hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury, blood transfusion and preoperative renal disease.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Octreotide has been shown to enhance renal blood flow, glomerular filtration and urine output in decompensated liver cirrhosis,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> hepatorenal syndrome<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and may also reduce the incidence of post-transplant renal injury.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref></p>
              <p>Major haemorrhage and transfusion during and after liver transplantation reduce patient and graft survival as well as increasing length of stay and the need for RRT.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4 16–18</xref> Haemorrhage risk during liver transplantation is multifactorial, including cirrhotic coagulopathy, portal hypertension and hyperfibrinolysis. Bleeding is driven by the presence of widespread dilated collaterals and a hyperdynamic splanchnic circulation. Octreotide causes splanchnic vasoconstriction thereby reducing splanchnic blood flow, collateralisation and portal venous pressures which may reduce surgical blood loss.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This correction of the abnormal blood distribution and venous pooling increases systemic blood pressure<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and, when combined with a vasopressor, correlates with improved renal function.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, increased systemic pressures and vasopressor sensitivity help preserve renal function and reduce myocardial injury.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 22 23</xref></p>

                  <p>Octreotide is not currently licensed for use in liver transplantation. Common risks of octreotide include changes in blood sugar levels, heart rate and rhythm. The side effect profile of octreotide during liver transplantation is unknown. The studies to date did not compare safety or adverse events between the octreotide and placebo arms,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> have not been fully published<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> or did not assess adverse events.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>

                  <title>Rationale for this study</title>
                  <p>The background literature for the use of octreotide in liver transplantation is inconclusive and the current use in this setting is clinician and institution dependent. While there is reasonable evidence to support its use in this setting, octreotide has harmful effects which need to be considered against its efficacy and cost. Furthermore, patients may be unwilling to have non-essential medication and clinicians may not support its use in all transplant settings. In addition to determining the feasibility of a multisite drug trial in liver transplantation, secondary end points will provide clinically relevant data on which to design a subsequent cost-effectiveness study.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of recruiting patients to a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous octreotide during liver transplantation. We will recruit 30 adult patients at two liver transplant centres; The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (Royal Free Hospital, RFH; National Health Service, NHS), and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (University Hospital Birmingham). A blinded infusion will be administered during transplantation surgery. Patients will be allocated in a 2:1 ratio to octreotide or placebo. All members of the research, anaesthetic, surgical, intensive care and nursing teams will be blinded to patient allocation; this includes all outcome assessors and data analysts. Patients will be blinded to their allocation and will have the option to find out which intervention they received after the study is complete. Unblinding will be carried out once data cleaning and analysis has been completed.</p>

                <p>Patients will be identified and recruited in two ways, depending on whether they are undergoing assessment for suitability for liver transplantation or have already been accepted onto the waiting list for transplantation.

                <p>i. Patients undergoing assessment for liver transplantation will be sent the patient information sheet (PIS) for this study. Patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be approached during their in-patient assessment process to explain the study and for preliminary informed consent.</p>
                <p>ii. Patients already listed for liver transplantation who meet the inclusion criteria will be sent the PIS. These patients will be contacted by phone, the study and PIS explained, and preliminary informed consent taken.</p>
                <p>Due to the waiting time for transplant and the fixed duration of this study many patients who would be willing to enter the study will not be able to participate because a donor organ does not become available. Both groups of patients will therefore have their consent confirmed on the day of admission for surgery at which point, once the transplant surgery has been confirmed, the patient will be considered to be enrolled.</p>

                <p>Patients will follow the standard protocol for liver transplantation at each study centre with the only study intervention being the provision of octreotide or placebo infusion. The study infusion will commence after induction of anaesthesia and prior to surgical incision. There will be no cross-over or dose escalation. The study infusate will be administered intravenously through an electronic infusion pump until completion of 50 mL of study medication or transfer to ICU, whichever is sooner. The maximum total dose of octreotide infused will be 1 mg, including an initial slow bolus followed by an infusion. Similarly, the maximum dose of 0.9% saline placebo administrated will be 50 mL. Where the infusion is completed prior to the end of surgery then no further study drug or placebo will be given.</p>

Patients will be stratified within the randomisation process by source of liver graft (brain death, DBD, or cardiac death donor, DCD) to ensure that patients are balanced for these factors across the two treatment groups. Patients will be randomly allocated to either the octreotide or placebo study groups in a 2:1 ratio. The randomisation list will be held centrally at a dedicated and independent off-site facility that will be contactable 24 hours a day.</p>

The role of the TSC is to provide oversight for the trial and provide advice through its independent Chair to the Chief Investigator, the TMG, trial Sponsor, Funder, and host institutions on all aspects of the trial. The TSC will recommend any appropriate amendments/actions for the trial as necessary. The TSC is independent of the TMG, Funder and Sponsor and members have declared no competing interests.</p>

All SAEs within 90 days of patient enrolment will be recorded in the eCRF with clinical symptoms, a brief description and date of the event. SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours. Where the event is unexpected and thought to be related to the intervention, this will be reported to the Health Research Authority within 15 days. Participants suffering an SAE will be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to expected values, or until the event has stabilised. Follow-up will continue after completion of trial follow-up if necessary. For the purpose of analysis, SAEs prior to discharge, within 30 days and within 90 days of enrolment will be analysed and published.</p>
                  <p>The sponsor will notify the REC and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of all SUSARs within 15 days. SUSARs that are fatal or life threatening will be notified to the MHRA and REC within 7 days of the sponsor learning of them.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Interviews and engagement with liver transplantation patients and their families has been a key motivator behind this study and a source of knowledge to identify outcomes that have been actively promoted in study design. A reduction in perioperative complications, especially haemorrhage, was identified by patients as a main research priority as well as physical and psychosocial well-being and quality of life after surgery. The PROM questionnaires were assessed during patient and family interviews to ascertain their accessibility, value and feasibility. The PIS has been reviewed with preoperative patients and family to obtain feedback on its clarity, readability and content. A transplant recipient patient expert is a coapplicant to this grant and will be an active member of the TMG. Our patient expert will assist us in providing effective communication with patients and public with a patient-centred viewpoint.</p>
