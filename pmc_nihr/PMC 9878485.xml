                  <p id="Par1">This study aims to explore the feasibility of using serial MRI without contrast in the monitoring of Charcot neuroarthropathy to reduce duration of immobilisation of the foot, in order to decide whether a large-scale trial is warranted.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A multicentre, randomised, prospective, two arm, open, feasibility study (CADOM) of people with diabetes with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of Charcot neuroarthropathy. Participants were randomised (1:1) to âstandard care plusâ, including repeated foot temperature measurements and X-rays, or the intervention arm, with additional three-monthly MRI, until remission of Charcot neuroarthropathy or a maximum 12âmonths (active phase). Participants were then followed-up for a further 6 months, post remission to monitor for relapse of the Charcot neuroarthropathy (follow-up phase). Feasibility outcomes were recruitment, retention, data completeness, adherence to study procedures and safety of the intervention MRI. We also collected clinical efficacy outcomes, this included time in cast/off-loading device which will be the primary outcome of a future definitive trial. Finally, we collected patient reported outcomes, and data on health and social care usage.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">One-hundred and five people were assessed for eligibility at five sites. 64/105 potential participants meet the eligibility criteria to participate in the study. Forty-three participants were randomised: 20 to standard care plus and 23 to MRI intervention. The main reason for ineligibility was a previous episode of Charcot neuroarthropathy. Thirteen participants were withdrawn post-randomisation due to an alternative diagnosis being made. Of the remaining 30 participants, 19 achieved remission, 6 had not gone into remission at the end of the 12âmonth active phase so exited the study. Five participants were lost to follow-up. Of the MRIs that were not disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic 26/31 (84%) were completed. For the visits that were conducted face-to-face, completion rates of patient-reported outcome measures were between 71 and 100%. There were no safety incidents associated with the intervention MRI.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">As this was a feasibility study it was not designed to test the effectiveness of serial MRI in diagnosing remission. The time in cast/off-loading device was 235 (Â±108.3) days for the standard care plus arm compared to 292 (Â±177.4) days for the intervention arm. There was no statistical difference in the time in cast/off-loading device between the two arms of the study: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.405 (95% CI 0.140â1.172), <italic>p</italic>â=â0.096.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">The findings support a definitive randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of MRI in diagnosing remission in Charcot neuroarthropathy. The rates of recruitment, retention, data, and MRI completeness show that a definitive study is feasible.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">Charcot neuroarthropathy is a relatively rare but serious complication that can affect people with peripheral neuropathy. It is most commonly diagnosed in people with diabetes, usually affecting the foot. There is uncontrolled inflammation, bones become weakened, and this can lead to fractures and joint dislocation.</p>
              <p id="Par34">In 2018 a regional survey of 205,033 people with diabetes in the East Midlands, England reported a point prevalence of 0.04% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Population-based studies have estimated a lifetime cumulative incidence for Charcot neuroarthropathy of 0.4 to 1.3% in people with diabetes, and 13% in those attending diabetic foot specialist clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Usual care for people with Charcot neuroarthropathy is to offload pressure and immobilise the foot with a non-removable cast or boot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This aims to stop the inflammatory process, relieve pain, and maintain foot architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Studies from the UK and Brazil show a median time to remission of up to 12âmonths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other studies report shorter times to remission: 3â5âmonths (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and 3â6âmonths (Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">Guidelines for Charcot neuroarthropathy management state that off-loading and immobilisation should be continued until the temperature difference between the affected and unaffected foot is &lt;â2âÂ°C, with no further radiological changes on X-ray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, this recommendation is based on low quality level IV evidenceÂ â i.e., case series and expert opinion, rather than higher quality evidence from systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, case control, or cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">Skin temperature measured with infrared thermography is recommended as a monitoring technique in Charcot neuroarthropathy, as it involves inflammation of the soft tissue and bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Skin temperature is a proxy measure of inflammation measured over the site of injury and may not reflect the degree of inflammation within affected bones and/or joints. X-rays show damage to the foot skeleton rather than disease activity and are a measure of foot deformity. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed pictures of bone and soft tissue structures and can show abnormalities not evident on X-rays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Emerging evidence from case series and observational data suggests that MRI may be useful for monitoring active Charcot neuroarthropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and that MRI findings could be adopted as the criterion standard for assessing disease activity and remission. However, evidence supporting a definitive trial is currently lacking. We conducted a study to assess feasibility outcomes; eligibility, recruitment, retention, withdrawal rates, acceptability of serial MRI for participants, and clinical efficacy outcomes. As this is a feasibility study, we did not investigate the cost effectiveness of the intervention.</p>

              <p id="Par38">This study aims to explore the feasibility of using serial MRI without contrast in the monitoring of Charcot neuroarthropathy to reduce duration of immobilisation of the foot, in order to decide whether a large-scale trial is warranted.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par39">Full details of the protocol are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This was a two arm, multicentre, open, randomised controlled feasibility study. Participants were recruited from specialist diabetic foot clinics. The study was divided into two phases. Phase one, the active phase, until the Charcot neuroarthropathy was in remission, or a maximum of 12âmonths. Phase two, the follow-up phase, for 6 months after the apparent remission of the Charcot neuroarthropathy. The study was approved by East Midlands - Derby Research Ethics, 04/10/2017, ref.: 17/EM/0288. All participants provided written consent.</p>

                <p id="Par40">Participants were aged over 18âyears old with diabetes as defined by the World Health Organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of Charcot neuroarthropathy. The full inclusion and exclusion criteria is shown in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We decided to exclude people with a previous history of Charcot neuroarthropathy as new and relapsed cases of Charcot neuroarthropathy may have different healing times. We chose a cut off period of six-months based on the opinion of clinical experts within the trial management team, as we thought that this would ensure that only true new cases of Charcot neuroarthropathy were recruited to the study. As a confirmed diagnosis of Charcot neuroarthropathy can take several weeks, participants were recruited as early as possible to accurately collect the duration of wearing an off-loading device. This was because âtime in cast/off-loading device â is the proposed primary outcome. If the clinical team decided on an alternative diagnosis, the participant exited the study.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Inclusion Criteria</th><th>Exclusion Criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Participants who are willing and have capacity to give informed consent.</td><td>People who have received a transplant and others receiving immunosuppressant therapy or using long-term oral glucocorticoids other than in the routine management of glucocorticoid deficiency.

                  <p id="Par43">Participants received usual care for assessment and management of Charcot neuroarthropathy. We standardised assessment of foot temperature to monitor Charcot neuroarthropathy by using the same device for all the measurements taken during the study, the Thermofocus 01500A3Â® (Tecnimed, Varese, Italy). Every 14âdays a research team member measured the temperature of both feet at five different sites. Temperatures were collected four times after removal of the off-loading device: 0, 5, 10, and 15âminutes. It was not possible to control ambient air temperature, in the clinical rooms used in this study. In this feasibility study the first timepoint at which the temperature difference was assessed as â¤2âÂ°C at the site overlying the Charcot neuroarthropathy was used as the marker for remission. At remission participants received a study specific MRI. We used the term âstandard care plusâ for this arm of the study to highlight differences to usual practice in the protocol for temperature measurement, and the additional study specific MRI at remission.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par44">In addition to standard care plus, intervention participants received serial MRIs at 3, 6, 9 and 12âmonths. They did not receive further MRIs once remission was diagnosed. The median time for remission of Charcot neuroarthropathy is reported as between 3 and 12âmonths. Therefore, we decided that the time to first intervention MRI should reflect the shortest reported median time to remission. As this was a feasibility study, we did not seek to standardise the MRI sequencing protocol.</p>

                <p id="Par45">The schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments is shown in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Potential participants were approached when attending their regular foot clinic appointment. After giving written informed consent participants attended visits every 14âdays until remission. Participants received usual care for Charcot neuroarthropathy regardless of randomisation arm. At the baseline visit participant characteristics, Charcot neuroarthropathy characteristics and type of off-loading device were collected. At each visit foot temperatures were measured, and clinical efficacy outcomes such as new ulceration, foot infection, and amputation (major and minor) were collected. Participants received a patient diary every fortnight to record all health and social care use. The main purpose of the patient diary was to inform how the data on costs and effects would be collected within a definitive trial. We will estimated completion rates and sought to identify big cost drivers, in order to inform this decision. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires EQ-5D-5L (Euroqol 5D), Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Questionnaire (SF-12) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) measuring health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression were collected at enrolment and every 3 months. During the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic (MarchâAugust 2020), approval was granted for sites to post questionnaires to participants and be returned to the sponsor, instead of collection during face-to-face study visits. Where research visits were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but clinical visits continued, the study sponsor approved the use of information collected from clinical visits.</p>

We measured feasibility, clinical efficacy, and patient reported outcomes. At every visit we issued participants with a diary to collect health and social care usage (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The proposed primary outcome time in cast/off-loading device was assessed to provide an initial efficacy estimate to inform the sample size of a future definitive study. We also collected data on ulceration, infection, and amputation. The safety of the intervention was assessed. The intervention (MRI) was assessed as low risk and consisted of increased frequency of MRI scans without contrast, so a pragmatic approach to safety reporting was used. MRI scans were performed in NHS hospitals under routine clinical protocols. Adverse safety events resulting from MRI scans were reported by the research teams in line with the Hospital Trustâs clinical incident reporting policy. These were forwarded to the Chief Investigator, for review by the Trial Management Team.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Feasibility, clinical efficacy, patient reported and health and social care usage</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Feasibility outcomes</th><th>Clinical efficacy outcomes<break/><bold><italic>Collected â all study visits</italic></bold></th><th>Patient reported outcomes<break/>Collected â baseline, 3 monthly until remission, then at 1 and 6-months post remission</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The proportion of patients who meet the eligibility criteria</td><td>Time in cast/off-loading device</td><td><p>Health related quality of life measured:</p><p>â¢ SF-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p><p>â¢ EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], analysed using the crosswalk methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></td></tr><tr><td>The number of eligible participants recruited</td><td>Number of new ulcerations on the index foot</td><td>HADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td>The number of participants in which an alternative diagnosis is made during the active phase of the study</td><td>Number of new ulcerations on the index or contralateral foot</td><td>VAS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">The proportion of participants that withdraw or are lost to follow up.

                <p id="Par47">In standard care plus, remission was defined as a temperature difference of â¤2âÂ°C between the affected and unaffected foot which was maintained or improved on two separate consecutive occasions for a period of at least 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or at the discretion of the clinical team when temperature difference was not valid; e.g., in the presence of bilateral foot disease. This triggered a final MRI. In the intervention arm, remission was defined as an absence of sub-chondral bone marrow oedema on MRI. The clinical team will interpret the results of the MRI report to determine remission.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par59">This feasibility study recruited 43 participants with a suspected or confirmed Charcot neuroarthropathy diagnosis. Despite not achieving the recruitment target of 60 participants, and study interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our sample size was sufficiently large enough to draw conclusions about the feasibility of a definitive trial.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Our participants were representative of the wider Charcot neuroarthropathy population, with more men, being in their fifth decade, and diabetes duration &gt;10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In this study the most common site for the Charcot neuroarthropathy was Sanders and Frykberg II (tarsometatarsal joints), this is consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The main reason for ineligibility was a previous Charcot neuroarthropathy within the last 6 months. We argue that it is not possible to reduce this as it may affect the results with the inclusion of relapsed Charcot neuroarthropathy, which may have aÂ different time to remission than new cases.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Two-thirds of eligible participants agreed to take part. We recruited similar participant numbers to observational studies on monitoring techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and recent randomised controlled trials on pharmacological treatment of Charcot neuroarthropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. More participants than anticipated were withdrawn from our study due to an alternative diagnosis. This reflects the difficulty in diagnosing Charcot neuroarthropathy at Eichenholtz stage 0. During the active phase the attrition rate was 12% which is within acceptable limits and does not affect the results of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par62">Two-thirds of participants had an Eichenholtz Classification stage 0 at baseline with no changes on X-ray. This highlights the need to use MRI as an adjunct to X-rays in Charcot neuroarthropathy diagnosis and monitoring. Excluding the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on MRIs, 84% of intervention MRIs were completed, and no safety incidents reported. No participants declined an MRI. This supports the feasibility, safety, and participantsâ acceptability of serial MRIs.</p>
              <p id="Par63">Participants experienced multiple episodes of concurrent ulceration and infection. This highlights the previously recognised limitations of using infra-red thermography to monitor Charcot neuroarthropathy. If similar findings were replicated in a definitive trial this further justifies the need to use MRI as a monitoring technique for Charcot neuroarthropathy.</p>
              <p id="Par64">The signal from this feasibility study does suggest that MRI may extend the time in cast/off-loading device. However, this feasibility study was not powered to detect a difference between the two arms of the study. As this was not an effectiveness study, the observed trend may change in an adequately powered definitive trial. The COVID-19 pandemic changed clinical practice, and reduced adherence to study procedures. We do not know how these changes affected the proposed primary outcome. Therefore, at this stage uncertainty remains and the trial is warranted as the sample size cannot exclude the possibility of a worthwhile effect.</p>
              <p id="Par65">Disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in participants being transferred from non-removable to removable devices, reduced data collection, and intervention completeness. This means that the planned modified ITT Cox regression analysis cannot be relied upon to calculate an accurate simple size. We plan to re-analyse the data using a per protocol analysis to mitigate for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also review the literature and use a focus group to work withÂ patient and public involvement, healthcare professionals, and statisticians to agree the minimally important clinical difference for a reduction in âtime in castâ. This information will then be used in a future sample size calculation.</p>
              <p id="Par66">The results related to patient-reported outcomes need to be interpreted with caution: this is a feasibility study not powered to detect between-group or longitudinal differences. We showed that receiving treatment for Charcot neuroarthropathy has physical, emotional, and socioeconomic ramifications and are results are consistent with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The minimum clinically important difference which people perceive as beneficial and should result in a change in management for EQ-5D has been estimated to be 0.03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this study the change in the EQ-5D index score from baseline to remission showed an improvement in health status of +â0.155 (Table S<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). This increase shows that using serial MRI to diagnose Charcot neuroarthropathy remission has potential to be cost-effective. We also showed the important and unrecognised burden of informal care for people with Charcot neuroarthropathy. In a definitive study we will seek to capture the cost of this informal care and include this in a cost effectiveness analysis.</p>
              <sec id="Sec24">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par67">The strength of this study is the recruitment of study participants who are representative of the wider population of people living with Charcot neuroarthropathy. The study was embedded within clinical practice and study visits were designed to align with pre-existing clinical pathways for Charcot neuroarthropathy. The clinical team took responsibility for both clinical care and the research. This approach increased the number of people who were willing to participate in the research and contributed to the high retention levels observed in this study.</p>
                <p id="Par68">One potential limitation of this study was that MRI sequencing protocol was not standardised; however, this study did not seek to provide a definitive answer as to the efficacy of using serial MRI to diagnose remission so was not necessary. The non-study MRIs that were completed may have contaminated the results, diluting the relationship between intervention and outcome. We do not know whether these MRIs reflected a change in practice due to study participation.</p>
                <p id="Par69">The COVID-19 pandemic reduced data and intervention completeness and the clinical efficacy and patient reported outcomes that were collected. During the first wave of the UK COVID-19 pandemic, some hospitals involved in the study stopped or restricted research radiology imaging, reducing the number of completed study MRIs. This may have resulted in either an underestimation or overestimation of the time in cast/off-loading device. Our participants were considered a âclinically vulnerableâ group and advised by the UK government to only attend essential clinical visits which excluded study visits. Consequently, the end point time in cast/off-loading device and other outcomes were not always collected. Some clinical teams transferred participants from non-removable to removable offloading devices to reduce the number of follow-up appointments. Wearing removable devices is associated with increased time to remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This may have increased the end point time in cast/off-loading device. We do not have data on whether the two arms of the study were equally affected by this.</p>

              <sec id="Sec25">
                <title>Implications for a definitive study</title>
                <p id="Par70">A definitive study on serial MRI in people with Charcot neuroarthropathy attending multidisciplinary foot clinics is justified and feasible, based on recruitment and retention rates, and acceptability of the intervention and study visit schedule to participants.</p>
                <p id="Par71">In a future study randomisation should be stratified for the type of off-loading device. Normal plain X-rays, widespread inflammation, and participants awaiting their baseline MRI meant that it was sometimes difficult for investigators to classify the location of the Charcot neuroarthropathy at baseline. To address this missing data, we will modify the data collection tool to ask investigators to confirm or record the location of the Charcot neuroarthropathy at baseline and the 3 month follow-up visit. We found low levels of data completeness in the patient diary. Therefore, in a future study we will modify the patient diary and collect a more complete picture of participantsâ costs. The diary will be co-produced with patient and public involvement to ensure the diary is relevant to and reflects the priorities of people with Charcot neuroarthropathy and other key stakeholders.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Prior to any future definitive trial, we will undertake a Delphi consensus study to optimise and standardise the intervention serial MRI. Finally, we will seek to capture the reasons forÂ any non-study MRIs.</p>
                <p id="Par73">A continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic may disrupt a future study. To prepare for the possibility of this we will seek to maximise data collection through additional participant reported outcomes. This could include the type of off-loading device being used, self-monitored foot temperatures when participants are transferred from non-removable to removable devices to reduce the number of hospital appointments they need to attend, and outcomes such as ulceration and infection.</p>
                <p id="Par74">If a future definitive study proves that MRI is a more effective way to monitor Charcot neuroarthropathy, then this could save healthcare providers money. People would regain their independence and go back to work sooner.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par76">This feasibility study showed that a future definitive trial to evaluate the effectiveness of MRI to identify disease remission in CN is warranted, feasible and acceptable, to potential participants, healthcare, and research professionals. We recruited 67% of potentially eligible participants and 88% of these completed the active phase of the study. Excluding the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 94% of study visits and 84% of the intervention MRIs were completed. The absence of any safety incidents supports the feasibility and safety of serial MRIs as the intervention. The results of this study will inform the design, of a full randomised controlled trial.</p>
