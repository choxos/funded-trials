                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Improving the Wellbeing of people with Opioid Treated CHronic pain (I-WOTCH) randomised controlled trial found that a group-based educational intervention to support people using strong opioids for chronic non-malignant pain helped a significant proportion of people to stop or decrease opioid use with no increase in pain-related disability. We report a linked process evaluation of the group-based intervention evaluated in comparison to a usual-care control group that received a self-help booklet and relaxation CD.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We interviewed 18 intervention facilitators, and 20 intervention and 20 control participants who had chronic non-malignant pain and were recruited from general (family) practices in the UK. Quantitative data included change mechanism questions on the trial questionnaires which explored motivation, expectations and self-efficacy. Fidelity was assessed by listening to a sample of audio-recorded group sessions and nurse consultations. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated using ‘follow a thread’ and a mixed-methods matrix.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Four overarching themes emerged: (1) the right time to taper, (2) the backdrop of a life with chronic pain, (3) needing support and (4) the benefits of being in a group. Delivery fidelity was good, adherence (83%) and competence (79%) across a range of intervention groups. Staff delivering the intervention found three typical responses to the intervention: resistance, open to trying and feeling it was not the right time. The group experience was important to those in the intervention arm. It provided people with a forum in which to learn about the current thinking about opioid usage and its effects. It also gave them examples of how feasible or personally relevant coming off opioids might be.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>The process evaluation data showed that the I-WOTCH intervention was well delivered, well received and useful for most interviewees. Being ‘the right time’ to taper and having support throughout tapering, emerged as important factors within the context of living with chronic pain.</p>

                  <p>As 95% of participants in the process evaluation were white, the reach of the study was thus limited and given interviews were 12 months after the intervention, recall bias may be a limitation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Embedded process evaluations of complex interventions in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are critical to increase understanding of how and why interventions may or may not work, as well as how practical interventions are when implemented in service contexts. They increase confidence in trial results and provide guidance on their implementation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref></p>
              <p>In the landmark Improving the Wellbeing of people with Opioid Treated CHronic pain (I-WOTCH) trial (n=608), we demonstrated that a self-management support intervention helps people using strong opioids become opioid-free at 1 year: 29% intervention versus 7% control, OR 6.55 (95% CI 3.42 to 12.55) with no increase in pain interference.</p>
              <p>The I-WOTCH intervention included educational, behavioural and psychological components, combining group and one-to-one support. Papers reporting the intervention development, the trial protocol, the main results and process evaluation protocol have been published.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref> Here we report the I-WOTCH process evaluation, specifically.</p>

              <p>We explored experiences of the participants and intervention delivery staff as well as key areas of process evaluation: context (contextual factors which may affect the implementation), fidelity (whether the intervention was delivered as conceived), dose delivered (the amount of the intervention delivered) and dose received (the amount of the intervention received by participants).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The group sessions took place once a week for 3 weeks. There was a face-to-face consultation between the second and third group sessions. After the third group session, there were two telephone conversations and then a final face-to-face consultation over a total period of 9–10 weeks. The process evaluation ran alongside the main study from May 2017 to March 2020.</p>
              <p>The I-WOTCH trial recruited participants with chronic non-malignant pain from general (family) practices from midlands and northeast of England (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>. Once randomised all participants received a self-help booklet ‘My Opioid Manager’ and a relaxation CD. The intervention group also received a 3-day group intervention, run by a specially trained nurse/other HCPs and lay person with chronic pain who had tapered their own opioids, with two additional face-to-face nurse consultations and telephone support.</p>

Other more practical sessions were checked for content presence but not rated in terms of delivery competence. We used bespoke assessment forms for group and individual sessions across a range of facilitators. Adherence items were scored as taking place: yes (2), partially (1) or no (0). Competence items were scored as: evident (2), partially evident (1) or not evident (0) (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 5</xref>). Scores were summated and averages calculated for adherence and competence of each session.</p>

If audio recordings were missing or inaudible, then the same sessions as those missing would be taken from the next group or one-to-one consultation in the same area (northeast or midlands).

                    <p>Most interviewees spoke about their GP in relation to their opioid use and tapering and the role of GP is presented in <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>. In the I-WOTCH study, intervention participants were given a tapering plan which was also sent to their GP and people were encouraged to make an appointment and discuss the plan. It was the GP who then actioned the plan if acceptable to both parties. The self-help booklet also suggested control participants could discuss tapering with their GPs. We have thus used quotations from intervention and control groups for this section on the role of the GP. There were five themes: (1) GP as information giver and sounding board, (2) trust in doctor, (3) teamwork, (4) GP reluctance and (5) access to GP. <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> gives exemplar quotes.</p>

                    <p>Looking back on the group intervention, most interviewees found that being in a group was beneficial. They spoke about the groups as a shared experience where they were with people in similar circumstances which included the lay facilitator with whom they could share experiences. There were social comparisons within the group with participants noticing that others were like, or not like, themselves. Social support from the group was a key theme with evidence of people encouraging others especially when they were experiencing difficulties. Interviewees often talked about the commitment to the group and or the trial. Group numbers seemed important, less than three members limited discussion. Lay group facilitators were seen either as good examples of how people cope with chronic pain or, alternatively, that they were somehow not the same and may not have had the same long-term experience of opioids and pain. The former perception allowing greater identification with the lay facilitator. Not all groups ran smoothly especially if they included disruptive individuals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                        <p>Venues varied greatly, particularly in community settings. There were instances when even working to a lone worker risk-assessment protocol, facilitators were asked to lock up, being last in the building. On a few occasions, telephone back up with the I-WOTCH team was compromised by a lack of signal. IT problems were mitigated by facilitators having written scripts as backup.</p>

                        <p>Facilitators mostly worked well together, with only occasional disagreements over differences in delivery or choice of sessions. Most would have preferred to work in the same pairings which was not possible within the intervention delivery design. Nurses felt the days were quite ‘full on’ having little downtime because even in breaks and meal-breaks everybody still chatted. Lay facilitators who were having to deal with their own health issues commented that the travel and full days (09:00 to 15:00) left them tired. However, all the facilitators said that the lay facilitator role was key to the groups running well. ‘… do not remove the lay facilitators if you’re going forward, they have to be there…’ N02</p>

                    <p>Nurse facilitators spoke of the tapering app being straightforward to use, although at times they were unable to get a mobile phone signal and occasionally the opioid the patient was taking was not included in the tapering app. Hard copies of the tapering plan were also written. On discussing the tapering plans suggested on the app algorithm, nurses and participants often wanted to taper more slowly for example, tramadol tablets decreasing by 50mgs but with no smaller dosages available, lack of confidence or having withdrawal effects. This was supported and nurses felt that it was important that the participant felt in control of the process.</p>

                <p>The two baseline only questions (2 and 3) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 6</xref>) were: Baseline expectation: I expect that, in 4 months’ time, I will have reduced my opioid use and Baseline self-efficacy I am confident I could reduce my opioid use a lot over 4 months which showed a trend of low expectations of successful tapering within 4 months and low self-efficacy/confidence in tapering (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material 13</xref>).</p>
                <p>The motivation to reduce opioids question showed a trend for more participants wanting to cut down or stop their opioids at baseline.

                <list-item>
                  <p>Life with chronic pain is often complex with many having multiple health problems and medications. This means that participants were living life around their pain, pain relief, healthcare appointments and procedures as well as social and family commitments. Each of these could affect their decision about when or whether to taper.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>Support is needed at all phases of tapering. This could come from their family, GP or from a tapering intervention such as I-WOTCH which agreed a tailored tapering programme. If family members or their GPs were ambivalent or against tapering, people were less keen to try it.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>The group effect allowed for people taking opioid medication to come together to gain more information and skills in pain management as well as choosing whether to start on a tapering path as a joint group goal. They were given the opportunity to discuss and explore their fears and motivations about decreasing their medication.</p>
                </list-item>
              </list>
              <p>The interaction between the overarching themes can be seen in our model. See <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>. Participants make decisions about tapering based on whether it is the right time for them, their current pain experiences and healthcare and the support available to them. Helping participants to identify and discuss potential barriers while fostering knowledge, motivation, confidence and self-management skills means that tapering is more likely to take place.</p>

              <p>The I-WOTCH main trial results showed that 62/225 (29%) of participants in the intervention group stopped taking opioids, compared with 15/208 (7%) in the usual-care group at 12 month follow-up without any difference in pain, or pain related disability, between the study arms. The process evaluation data indicate that the intervention was delivered as intended with good fidelity scores. There was evidence of participants attributing their opioid reduction to the I-WOTCH study. Participants and staff alike felt the package as whole was acceptable and deliverable. However, poor attendance was an issue with 90 participants randomised to the intervention not attending any group.</p>
              <sec id="s5-1">
                <title>The secret ingredient?</title>
                <p>No one factor or ‘secret ingredient’ was identified but rather a combination of active ingredients as enablers of opioid tapering. The I-WOTCH intervention seemed to have a synergistic, summative effect from its different components which could be specific to the individual. The qualitative data indicate that the intervention served to inform and provide a forum where discussion in groups and in one-to-one sessions could help people decide whether to reduce their opioid use. The final decision was the participant’s, and no judgements were made about whether or when they might start tapering.</p>
                <p>The I-WOTCH intervention provided a space in which people could fill gaps in their knowledge of opioids. The intervention also enhanced motivations to taper, including intrinsic motivations that participants brought to the sessions. Information provided by the intervention about the lack of long-term effectiveness and side effects developed motivation. This was emphasised in staff interviews which highlighted how provision of information about opioid use consequences was, for some participants, a turning point in becoming motivated to change. Support from their GP, their family, the I-WOTCH one-to-one meetings, the tapering plan and group peers also enhanced motivation. Exploring pain management skills in a group over three sessions allowed them to try things out and swap ideas, so establishing the skill base needed for change.</p>
                <p>The Information, Motivation and Behavioural Skills model<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> provided the theoretical foundation and guided our understanding of key components of change that would support action towards opioid tapering. The qualitative data confirm the utility of identifying sources of information, developing motivation at the right time and skill development, including use of the lay facilitator as a role model, as critical precursors of change. This process evaluation reveals how the I-WOTCH intervention provided all three of these critical supports. Barriers to change may be specific to the individual but supporting people to become informed and to develop motivation and skills optimises the chances of behaviour change. The main barriers were that it might not have been the right time for participants to consider tapering and other things in life often took priority. Fears of returning to uncontrolled pain were common alongside multiple other potential barriers.</p>
                <p>These findings correspond to a wider literature. A 2020 qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography (31 studies) looking at experiences of people taking opioids for chronic non-malignant pain by the current authors,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> found five themes, four of which resonated with our findings. The fifth theme was around societal stigma, which did not emerge from the data in this English study but was common in North American studies, where law enforcement agencies can be involved.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
                <p>Our findings are also broadly supported by recent literature. Goesling <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> who held focus groups with former opioid users about their experiences before, during and after opioid cessation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Motivators to stop included concerns about a lack of opioid efficacy, addiction and quality of life impact. Quinlan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> noted that 60 patients undertaking a pre tapering survey found there were more barriers given than motivators.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The main areas of concern were around quality of life, pain and withdrawal which the authors suggest need to be addressed for successful tapering to take place. Henry <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> conducted focus groups and interviews with 21 adults with chronic pain at different stages of opioid tapering.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They explored the complex contextual backdrop of life with chronic pain describing changes or fluctuations in many areas including pain, social relationships, health status, emotional state and the perceived need for opioids at any given time. They recognise the substantial effort involved for people undertaking the tapering journey, the effect on their day to day lives and the strategies used. They suggest early anticipatory guidance about tapering and that tapering should be patient centred and responsive to the patients’ needs.</p>
                <p>We identified GPs as integral to tapering support. Three 2020–2022 papers from healthcare providers perspective<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> throw light on the complex challenges involved in tapering opioids, especially the importance of maintaining a good patient/provider relationship. Hamilton <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> also cite patient motivation to be a central factor for successful tapering.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> GPs are seen as authoritative experts in relation to health behaviour and patients often welcome behaviour change advice from their GPs, especially when such advice may have a positive effect on long-term condition management.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
                <p>There is a long history of successful use of small groups to develop support, share common health problems, build trust, share ideas, enhance information, change attitudes and develop motivation and skills to promote health behaviour change.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> This evaluation shows that the I-WOTCH intervention successfully applied these group processes in supporting individual change. Participants often had a strong sense of shared experience around opioid use and the challenges of use reduction. They felt as if they were all in the same boat. This is a key foundation for successful group interventions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There is also evidence of participants experiencing social support and social learning both key to individual change. Facilitation of interaction in small groups is critical to optimising change and interviews revealed that the lay facilitator role was very important to participants and nursing facilitators alike. Facilitators did not underestimate the challenges some participants might face and appreciated the lay facilitator’s personal experience with which participants could identity and then learn from. The challenges of group facilitation observed also emphasise the importance of careful skill-based training for group facilitators.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> At least minimum compliance was achieved with 62% of participants, and full compliance with 47%. All three group sessions were attended by 54%. We note that even with this level of compliance, clinically important differences were found. Even though adherence was less than we had hoped we have got a very clear positive result on one of the trial primary outcomes. It seems likely shared decision making between patients and GPs could be important to increasing compliance, although this would need to be evaluated. For future delivery, this study demonstrated that group sessions were an important part of the intervention, The one intervention that had the least positive feedback was mindfulness. However, we are reluctant to suggest this could be removed as not all facilitators felt comfortable explaining this element of the programme.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our conceptual model shows the active ingredients involved in an ideal pathway to successful tapering. This may look straightforward at first glance; however, the reality is that there are multiple contextual issues and barriers which influence someone’s ability to taper. The I-WOTCH intervention gave practical strategies, information, support, room for discussion and a tailored tapering plan to help participants navigate this difficult journey.</p>
