                  <p id="Par1">The sample size required to power a study to a nominal level in a paired comparative diagnostic accuracy study, i.e. studies in which the diagnostic accuracy of two testing procedures is compared relative to a gold standard, depends on the conditional dependence between the two tests - the lower the dependence the greater the sample size required. A priori, we usually do not know the dependence between the two tests and thus cannot determine the exact sample size required. One option is to use the implied sample size for the maximal negative dependence, giving the largest possible sample size. However, this is potentially wasteful of resources and unnecessarily burdensome on study participants as the study is likely to be overpowered. A more accurate estimate of the sample size can be determined at a planned interim analysis point where the sample size is re-estimated.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This paper discusses a sample size estimation and re-estimation method based on the maximum likelihood estimates, under an implied multinomial model, of the observed values of conditional dependence between the two tests and, if required, prevalence, at a planned interim. The method is illustrated by comparing the accuracy of two procedures for the detection of pancreatic cancer, one procedure using the standard battery of tests, and the other using the standard battery with the addition of a PET/CT scan all relative to the gold standard of a cell biopsy. Simulation of the proposed method illustrates its robustness under various conditions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The results show that the type I error rate of the overall experiment is stable using our suggested method and that the type II error rate is close to or above nominal. Furthermore, the instances in which the type II error rate is above nominal are in the situations where the lowest sample size is required, meaning a lower impact on the actual number of participants recruited.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">We recommend multinomial model maximum likelihood estimation of the conditional dependence between paired diagnostic accuracy tests at an interim to reduce the number of participants required to power the study to at least the nominal level.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par16">An assessment of diagnostic accuracy is crucial in the development of medical testing procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Comparing the accuracy of these procedures in terms of their sensitivities and specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] relative to a gold standard, is essential to ensuring that the most appropriate tests are deployed in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The focus of this paper is sample size re-estimation in the comparison of two candidate tests to a gold standard. However, diagnostic accuracy studies do not necessarily involve comparisons; many such studies report the accuracy of a single test.</p>
              <p id="Par17">At the outset of a study, a sample size is calculated based on assumptions made about the expected changes in sensitivity and specificity and, in a prospective design, the likely prevalence of the condition to be tested for in the sample. However, the initial assumptions about parameters in the study, especially the conditional dependence between the two tests, may be revealed to be inaccurate, resulting in a potentially over- or under-powered study. A planned interim analysis can allow the study’s sample size to be updated based on the data already collected. This involves utilising the information observed at the interim stage to refine the sample size estimate. A resulting increase in sample size allows the time, cost and patient discomfort already invested in the study to yield valid results while a decrease in sample size means that less time and cost will be expended overall and patients will not needlessly undergo unnecessary testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">There are well-established methodologies for interim sample size re-estimation in treatment studies for continuous and normally distributed response variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], some of which provide mechanisms to maintain blinding in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Methods also exist for the re-estimation with binary response variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and mechanisms to maintain blinding have been proposed in this more complex situation where the variance and mean parameters are not separable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Proschan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] gives an overview of sample size re-estimation procedures based on a nuisance parameter. Specifically, procedures for determining the difference of means between two samples with a common, unknown, variance and difference in proportions between two groups, with an unknown overall proportion, are considered. In the case of normally distributed data, the independence of the sample variance and sample mean ensures that the validity of estimates is unaffected by the interim sample size re-estimation and this is shown to hold asymptotically in the binary case. However, Proschan does not consider the case of paired data which is the focus of the current paper. Furthermore, the implications of sample size re-estimation in the context of comparative diagnostics studies, inherently different from those in treatment (randomised controlled) studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], have not been fully explored in the statistical literature.</p>
              <p id="Par19">A number of salient differences in interim analysis between studies comparing diagnostic tests and those comparing treatments are highlighted in Gerke et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Gerke et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Firstly, in paired diagnostics accuracy studies, full blinding is often not possible, specifically, certain types of test may not be able to be blinded from the patient, the person administering the test, the person interpreting the test, or the person measuring the outcome. However, as long as the results of the two-tests which are being compared are temporarily blinded from the person measuring the outcome, this is not a major threat to a study’s validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In fact, it has the advantage that the patients can benefit from their clinicians knowing the results of both diagnostic tests after testing has taken place. Secondly, in diagnostic accuracy studies, early cessation of the study due to futility is not as easy to establish as in treatment studies. The reasons for this are 1) the fact that treatment studies often test a single outcome while diagnostic studies test two outcomes, sensitivity and specificity, and futility must be established for both simultaneously, and 2) patient outcomes may only be seen further downstream from the test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thirdly, the sample size required for a hypothesis test in diagnostic studies, powered to a given level, is closely related to the conditional dependence between the two testing procedures which has been shown to present problems in a number of contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. More specifically, the lower the conditional dependence between the tests, the greater the sample size will be, with the largest sample size being implied by the maximum negative dependence, given the specified alternative hypotheses. This level of conditional dependence between the tests is one of the primary factors driving the required sample size estimate and it is often difficult to estimate a priori. Gerke et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] assert that for comparative diagnostic studies, as long as an interim sample size re-estimation is planned it bears no threat to the validity of the study. However, Gerke et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] do not provide justification for this assertion and, furthermore, their assertion does not take the inherent uncertainty of the interim data into account. This study aims to present a method and give practical guidelines for its application, for the initial estimation and interim re-estimation of sample size in a paired diagnostic study which will allow utilisation of information on the conditional dependence between tests at the interim to potentially reduce the required sample size while maintaining the approximate nominal statistical power of the experiment as a whole. While we present a method of estimating the size of the conditional dependence to reduce sample size, it should also be noted that there is a body of literature dealing with the problems caused by conditional dependence in other areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">The remainder of the article is organised as follows. The methods section outlines sample size estimation methods for paired diagnostic test studies, introduces a motivating example application, and then goes on to propose a new method for re-estimation based on a multinomial likelihood. The results section first provides extensive simulations of the method under various real world conditions and then moves back to apply the sample size re-estimation method proposed in this paper to the motivating example. The article then continues with a brief discussion of the place of this study in the literature and the optimal interim sample size to choose. Finally, the conclusion, summarises and restates the major outcomes of this study.</p>

              <p id="Par22">A possible initial sample size calculation, using a normal approximation of the logarithm of the ratio of sensitivities and specificities, and assuming a comparison between a new test, test A, and an existing test, test B, follows from Alonzo et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and a full derivation can be found therein. The experiment, as a whole tests jointly both sensitivity and specificity improvement to pre-specified levels, the sample size is calculated for each and the largest sample size is chosen to power the study. Note that this paper concentrates on the situation in which superiority is tested for both sensitivity and specificity.

              <p id="Par25">It is interesting to note that, following the notation of Vacek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and considering the population 2 × 2 table (in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the conditional dependence of the two tests can be denoted by <italic>e</italic>

<sub><italic>a.</italic></sub>, the conditional covariance when the gold standard disease status is positive or negative, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, the probability of both tests being positive can be expressed as <italic>TPPR</italic> = <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> ∙ <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> + <italic>e</italic>

<sub><italic>a</italic></sub>. When <italic>e</italic>

<sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and/or <italic>e</italic>
<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> ≠ 0 the response on one test changes the probability of that response on the other test. For example, when <italic>e</italic>
<sub><italic>b</italic></sub> &gt; 0 an individual who responds positively on test A is more likely to respond positively on test B.</p>
              <p id="Par26">For initial estimates of <italic>TPPR</italic> and <italic>TNNR</italic>, from Alonzo et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] we can use the fact that <italic>TPPR</italic> ≥ (1 + <italic>γ</italic>

<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>. The sample size implied by using these levels of <italic>TPPR</italic> and <italic>TNNR</italic> would very likely overpower the study, i.e. more participants will be recruited than is strictly necessary to achieve the power specified by <italic>β</italic>. The required sample size is smallest when the conditional dependence between tests A and B are maximal, conditional on the fixed values of <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, i.e. when <italic>TPPR</italic> = <italic>TPR</italic>

<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>. The implied sample size in this case would likely underpower the study, i.e. too few participants recruited to reach the power specified by <italic>β</italic>. The sample size in this “best case scenario” can be substantially lower than that in the worst case scenario. Conservatively, it might be thought a good idea to always use the “worst case scenario” implied sample size estimate which will always power the study sufficiently. However, in cases where the recruitment and testing of participants comes at a premium, both financially and in terms of discomfort to the patients, it might be preferable to apply a more nuanced strategy. Furthermore, the sample size implied by the “worst case scenario” implies the highly unlikely condition of a maximal negative conditional dependence between two tests, which are performed on the same patients to detect the same disease. The implied sample size based on this condition is not recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One possibility, to enable a more accurate evaluation of the conditional dependence between the two tests, and thus the required sample size, is to perform a planned interim sample size re-estimation using this information to refine the sample size estimate.</p>
              <p id="Par27">At a planned interim, where a proportion of the overall sample size has been collected, we would have some information about the true values of <italic>TPPR</italic>, <italic>TNNR</italic>, <italic>π</italic>, <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> and <italic>TNR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, however, these values would only come from a limited sample size. The crucial parameters to use in re-estimation are those related to the conditional dependence between the tests, i.e., <italic>TPPR</italic> and <italic>TNNR</italic>, as these values are difficult to estimate and, for these parameters, it is unlikely that research exists which can provide an approximate value. Conversely, the values of, <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> and <italic>TNR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, the sensitivities and specificities of an established test, may have known values in the literature and these should preferably be used over those from the relatively small interim sample. For the value of <italic>π</italic>,the prevalence, a judgement must be made as to whether the researcher feels that any pre-existing estimate of prevalence would be a more accurate reflection of the true prevalence in the specific study population than any interim estimate. In the example given below, we use values for <italic>TPPR</italic>, <italic>TNNR</italic> and <italic>π</italic> at the interim in the sample size calculation.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Naively, it might appear that interim sample size re-estimation would entail a straightforward replication of eqs.

However, this approach does not effectively take into account the inherent uncertainty in the interim parameter estimates of <italic>TPPR</italic>, <italic>TNNR</italic> and <italic>π</italic>, nor the fact that only a specific range of values for <italic>TPPR</italic> and <italic>TNNR</italic> are actually possible under the alternative hypothesis. An approach which does take these factors into account is re-estimation of the sample size based on maximum likelihood estimation, at the interim, of the parameters in question under a multinomial model.

                <p id="Par36">In order to verify the integrity of the method for sample size re-estimation described and applied above a series of simulation studies were carried out. The objectives of these studies were to assess the implications of re-estimating a sample size based on data already collected on the type I and II error rates under various permutations of parameters. The type II error rate should be as close to nominal as possible (i.e. 0.8 in the example above), and the type I error rate should be minimally affected by the re-estimation.</p>
                <p id="Par37">It should be noted that the statistical power provided by the sample size implied by the Alonzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] method (when no re-estimation is undertaken) is related to the level of conditional dependence between the tests, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates this relationship. In total 100,000 replications were generated under the specified true alternative hypothesis (i.e. <italic>γ</italic>
<sub>1</sub> = 0.9/0.81 = 1.11), for the example situation above, at various levels of conditional dependence between the two tests. The number of replications 100,000, is more than required, however as the computing time to calculate these was trivial, there was little cost in simulating to this level of accuracy. This number of simulations was used throughout this paper. In all cases in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> the simulated power was higher than nominal but where the conditional dependence was highest the power was greatly over specified. As the conditional dependence tends towards becoming maximally positive, i.e. as TPPR tends towards its maximal value, the cell <italic>n</italic>
<sub><italic>C</italic></sub> tends towards 0. This means that the asymptotic assumptions underlying formulae 1 and 2 and those underlying the significance test no longer hold. However, this should not be of too great a concern, with regards to balancing the minimisation of the required sample size estimate with the statistical power of the experiment, as the instances where the power is over specified are when the sample size is lowest. Additional conservatism at positive levels of conditional dependence has a significantly lesser impact on the overall sample size than it would have at the end of the continuum where the conditional dependence is negative. Whatever the case may be, it should be noted that the results of re-estimation will follow a similar pattern.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Simulated power of sample size specified by the true TPPR in equation <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> when TPR<sub>A</sub>=0.9, TPR<sub>B</sub>=0.81 and π=0.45</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12874_2017_386_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

                <p id="Par40">An increasing interim sample size does not have that great an impact on the average estimated sample size. However, it does have a large impact on the RMSE. Thus, choosing a larger interim sample size at which to re-estimate will ensure a more accurate sample size re-estimate in individual cases, meaning that the experiment will be more likely to be powered to the appropriate level while recruiting as few participants as possible. Of course, if the interim sample size is chosen to be too large then there is a risk of having already recruited too many participants at the interim. Therefore, some sensible trade-off is required. The bias and coverage seem to be at acceptable levels although the coverage does dip when the conditional dependence between the tests is high.</p>

<sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> and <italic>π</italic> in both true alternative and null cases. Regarding the best sample size to specify at the interim, a possible balance to be struck between a suitably large interim sample, which would increase the precision of the measure of conditional dependence, and minimising the overall experimental sample size would be to take the minimal possible sample size for the experiment as a whole at the interim. In this way, the interim sample could never be larger than the overall required sample size, which means that it is impossible to collect more data than actually needed. Yet, the minimum possible overall sample size represents a significant proportion of the total experimental sample size. Thus, for the values in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, the sample size re-estimate was conducted at the number implied by equation <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>, when <italic>TPPR</italic> is at maximal value given the marginals. The maximum positive, mid-range and maximum negative levels of <italic>TPPR</italic> were reported to show a range of values across different levels of <italic>TPPR</italic>. The mean sample size is provided in parentheses in order to allow intuition about the reduction in the sample size this method brings. In all cases, where data were generated under the true alternative hypothesis, the simulated power is above or very close to the nominal value. Furthermore, in all cases where data were generated under the true null hypothesis the size is close to the nominal value. Comparing the mean sample sizes given for the maximal and mid-point <italic>TPPR</italic>s against the fixed values that would be used if Alonzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] had been followed we can see that the sample size re-estimation method outlined above can dramatically reduce the required sample size to power an

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">This paper has presented a robust method of sample size re-estimation for use in paired diagnostic accuracy studies where the conditional independence between the two tests may be unknown or inaccurately estimated at the start of the study. In terms of the recommendation of sample size estimation for the experiment as a whole a specific protocol is suggested given the results. Rather than basing the estimate for the experiment as a whole on the case where there is the maximal negative conditional dependence between tests – thus the largest possible sample size - as suggested in Alonzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we would suggest an alternative strategy, the robustness of which is highlighted in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Specifically, initially estimating the sample size at the maximal positive conditional dependence between tests, i.e. using <italic>TPPR</italic> = <italic>TPR</italic>
<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> - giving the smallest possible sample size - then, re-estimating the final sample size using the method simulated in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. As long as the initial estimate for prevalence is close to accurate, this protocol is deemed appropriate as it balances the risk of collecting more participants than might actually be needed with collecting the most information about the true conditional dependence at the interim. Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> provides strong evidence for the integrity of this method in providing at minimum the nominal power while reducing the sample size when we have a higher than maximally negative true conditional dependence. Should the interim sample size be some other value, the maximum likelihood method will still be appropriate, although it should be kept in mind that the larger the interim sample size, as a proportion of the total possible sample size, the more accurate the interim sample size estimates will be, for individual cases.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Interestingly, the sample size values in the table seem to be somewhat greater, even when using our method than those typically seen in the literature in diagnostic test accuracy studies, see for example van Enst et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] Although it is difficult to know the specifics of the 859 studies mentioned in the van Enst collection of meta-analyses, e.g. clinically significant differences, sample size estimation and hypothesis testing procedures, it is striking that the 50% covariance sample size is only 87 (IQR 45–185) participants. Very few of our sample sizes in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> are this low for the size of effect (ratios) we are considering, even using our method of sample size reduction. It may be that many diagnostic accuracy studies commissioned do not carefully consider their sample sizes. While the method discussed here of estimating the conditional dependence between the tests via maximum likelihood, given constraints imposed by the specified marginals and under a multinomial model, is pertinent to paired diagnostic accuracy tests, there is little reason why similar processes could not be extended to similar problems. The kernel of the method, maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter related to the conditional dependence using a constrained multinomial model, is equally valid in other applications involving sample size re-estimation for paired binary 2 × 2 tables.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par48">In this paper we have described a sample size re-estimation procedure that can be applied in an interim analysis for a diagnostic test study that is comparing two methods of testing on patients that are being followed up over a period of time. The procedure uses information on the levels of conditional dependence between the two tests at the interim in order to refine the required sample size for a paired diagnostic accuracy study with a binary response. Evidence from simulations has been provided to demonstrate its functionality under various parameter values thought to reflect a range of commonly occurring situations. The procedure can be applied in the case of paired comparative diagnostic accuracy studies in order to more accurately gauge the sample size required for a given power thereby reducing both the costs associated with this kind of study and also the burden on patients.</p>
