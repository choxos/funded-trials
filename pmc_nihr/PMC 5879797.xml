                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomised to a control (lifestyle booklet) or 12-week
intervention arm where they were given one face-to-face counselling session, four
telephone consultations and web-based support. A goal of 5% reduction in body
weight was set, and a personalised diet and physical activity (PA) programme was
provided. Behavioural change techniques (motivational interviewing, action and
coping plans and implementation intentions) were used.</p>

                  <p>Feasibility measures: recruitment, programme implementation, fidelity measures,

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 480 patients approached, 196 (41%) expressed interest in the study, and of
those, 78 (40%) patients were randomised. Implementation of the programme was
challenging within the time allotted and fidelity to the intervention modest
(62%). Qualitative findings indicated the programme was well received.
Questionnaires and anthropometric data were completed by &gt;98%. Accelerometer data
were attained by 84% and 54% at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Retention at
12 weeks was 76%. Overall, 36% of the intervention group (vs 0% in control)
achieved 5% weight loss. Favourable increases in PA and reduction in
dietary fat were also reported.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>A lifestyle programme for people with a family history of cancer is feasible to
conduct and acceptable to participants, and indicative results suggest favourable
outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It is recognised that cancer arises from an interaction between genetic and
environmental factors (nature and nurture), although there may be more emphasis given to
genetics and family history in the National Health Service (NHS) rather than health
behaviour profiles. Clearly, it is desirable that people who are at greater risk of
cancer due to a family history of the disease (which may reflect shared genetic and
behavioural profiles) are supported to follow recommendations for cancer surveillance
and lifestyle. NHS genetics centres in Scotland offer early detection and counselling
for people with a family history (FH) of breast cancer (BC) and
colorectal cancer (CRC),<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> but there is
little evidence of lifestyle advice.</p>
              <p>Current estimates for the role of lifestyle in postmenopausal BC suggest that around 38%
of the disease could be prevented by increased physical activity and decreases in
alcohol intake and excess body weight.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A number
of studies show that BC risk is lowered with intentional weight loss<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and recent data from bariatric surgery<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> show that weight loss is correlated with
significant decreases in the incidence of cancers at several sites—notably
postmenopausal breast, colon, endometrium and pancreas. Gramling <italic>et
al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> reported from the Women’s
Health Initiative Observational study that participating in healthy lifestyles (greater
physical activity, lower alcohol intake and lower body mass index (BMI)) led to risk
reduction in postmenopausal women, and the degree of this benefit was the same for women
with and without an FH of BC. A recent review by Pettapiece-Phillips <italic>et
al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reports evidence of a protective
role of a healthy body size and regular activity among mutation carriers notably in
adolescence and early adulthood.</p>
              <p>It is estimated that around 45% of CRC could be prevented by diet and other lifestyle
behaviours (dietary fibre intake and physical activity and low intakes of red and
processed meat, alcohol and body fatness).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For
CRC, people with an FH may be more susceptible to lifestyle-related risk. For example,
in a pooled analysis, Cho <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
reported that the relative risks of CRC with alcohol consumption
of ≥30 g/d were 1.23 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.57;
Not Significant) among those with no FH and 2.02 (95% CI
1.30 to 3.13) among those with an FH of CRC. The importance of excess
weight and increased risk of developing CRC has been highlighted by Movahedi <italic>et
al</italic>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> who reported that in patients
with Lynch syndrome, CRC risk was increased by 7% for each 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
increase in BMI. A recent review of alcohol, obesity and other nutritional factors in
people with familial CRC by Fardet <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> present a clear case for why modifiable risk factors could offer
new perspectives on prevention.</p>
              <p>Akhtar <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reported, in a UK
survey of relatives of patients diagnosed with CRC, that most (88%) said they were
prepared to make lifestyle changes if given enough information. In the BeWEL<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> study (lifestyle intervention for people at
higher CRC risk due to an adenoma), around half (49%) of 997 patients showed an interest
in finding out more about the lifestyle (weight loss) trial.</p>
              <p>It is also noteworthy that, for patients subsequently diagnosed with BC or CRC, obesity
is associated with poorer prognosis, increases in disease recurrence and overall
mortality.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref></p>
              <p>Identifying increased risk of developing a disease is unlikely to be sufficient to
change behaviour,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and knowledge of FH per se is
unlikely to be sufficient to initiate sustained weight management behaviours. In a
questionnaire study of 237 (49%) people attending family history clinics in the East of
Scotland, Anderson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
reported that while smoking rates were modest (11%), most respondents had a
BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, low levels of physical activity and
high alcohol consumption. Interview data in a subgroup of these respondents highlighted
doubts about the link between lifestyle and cancer, and few were familiar with the
current evidence. While lifestyle advice was considered interesting in general, there
was little appetite for non-tailored guidance.</p>
              <p>Marteau and Lerman<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> argues that motivation to
change behaviour may be achieved by increasing beliefs that changing behaviour can
reduce risks by increasing beliefs in the individual’s ability to change.
However, it is more likely that self-efficacy and self-regulatory techniques (eg, goal
setting) play a greater role in achieving effective behaviour change.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence guidelines on familial BC recommend that standard written information for
people with concerns about familial BC risk should include ‘lifestyle, including
diet, alcohol etc’,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> but the reasons for
this choice of communication is unclear. Genetic counsellors (GCs) receive little
if any training in promoting healthy lifestyles, and there is little evidence that
advice is routinely provided.</p>
              <p>This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a 12-week
lifestyle intervention programme (LivingWELL) for people with an FH of BC and CRC
initiated within the FH setting in order to inform the design of a definitive randomised
controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this
intervention.</p>
              <p>Specific objectives were to estimate recruitment rate for a full RCT, assess the
feasibility of data collection procedures and protocol adherence, explore participant
experience and establish a power calculation required for a full-scale study</p>

                <title>Recruitment and randomisation</title>
                <p>New attendees at genetics clinic were informed about the study by the GCs and given a
brief information sheet, clinician endorsement letter, non-participation
questionnaire and reply slip with stamped addressed envelope. They were also
offered the opportunity to discuss the study with the research team. Where low-risk
patients did not attend the clinics in person, postal versions of the study materials
were sent. Low initial recruitment after 3 months resulted in a protocol amendment to
allow study information to be passed to established patients returning for
mammographic or endoscopic procedures in one centre (not considered feasible in the
other centre).</p>
                <p>GCs/clinical staff recorded the numbers of patients attending clinics and informed
patients with an FH of BC or CRC about the study. Staff noted when they felt it
inappropriate to provide information about the study and recorded any reasons that
patients gave for non-participation. Interested patients were given a brief
information sheet and an endorsement letter from the relevant lead clinician. They
were asked to provide their contact details. An opt-out slip and non-participant
feedback form were included for those who decided not to participate.</p>
                <p>Research nurses made contact with interested patients to assess eligibility and
provide a full information sheet. All those written to (or given packs) could also
respond by telephone/postal reply slip. Eligible participants were adults,
age ≥18 years, with an FH of BC or CRC and measured
BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria were severe
cognitive impairment, or conditions where physical activity was contraindicated,
pregnancy, breast feeding or currently undergoing active treatment for
cancer.</p>
                <p>Once continued interest and eligibility were established, an appointment was made for
a baseline measurement visit where informed consent was obtained. Postbaseline visit,
participants were allocated (by the study administrator who informed the participant
and lifestyle coach (LC) of the outcome) into usual care (control) or
intervention groups 1:1 using a computer-generated random allocation list. The
research nurse was blinded to the randomisation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The 12-week intervention, ‘LivingWELL’, aimed to help participants
increase physical activity, modify diet, achieve weight loss towards 5% of body
weight and avoid weight gain. Personalised advice was given on a 600 kcal
deficit dietary intake as recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines
Network (SIGN)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and a graduated approach
aimed at increasing activity to 225–300 min per week by 12 weeks. The
theoretical basis for the intervention draws on Leventhal’s Self-Regulatory
Theory<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> (which highlights the importance
of the individual’s beliefs regarding illness cause, identity, control/cure,
timeline and consequences), Social Cognitive Theory,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which emphasises the importance of self-efficacy, and the Health Action
Process Approach,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> which emphasises the
importance of action and coping planning.</p>
                <p>The ‘LivingWELL’ programme was delivered by LCs personnel (with a
nursing background) who received bespoke training on the delivery of the intervention
programme. Intervention participants received one face-to-face session plus (up to)
four telephone consultations over the 12-week programme, a ‘LivingWELL’
information pack, pedometer and walking programme. Participants were also offered a
web-based support programme. The face-to-face session was designed to be interactive
and included a 10 min ‘walk and talk’ session during which
pedometer use and walking goals were discussed, self-identification of BMI category
and a portion weight estimate task.</p>
                <p>Participants received a personalised energy deficit diet, a personalised graduated
walking plan and guidance on setting personal goals, how to make changes habitual and
relapse prevention strategies for times of deviation.</p>
                <p>Motivational interviewing techniques were used to explore self-assessed confidence to
change and self-perceived benefits. Behavioural change techniques (goal setting,
action and coping plans and implementation intentions) were also used. The importance
of self-monitoring pedometer data, diet and drink logs and weekly body weight was
emphasised. These data formed the basis for the 15 min phone consultations,
which checked well-being, self-monitoring behaviours, actions and coping plans.

distributed at clinic appointments, and over 300 were posted with study
information packs. A total of 28 questionnaires were returned. Most responders
were women (86%), and the average age was 51.2 years (range 25–72). Of
those, 21 people reported a weight and height: 9 had a normal BMI and 12 were
overweight or obese. The majority of respondents were from areas of low
deprivation (59%). The most common reasons for not taking part were that
‘their lifestyle was already good’ (29%) and ‘too little time
to participate’ (14%).</p>

face-to-face session with a LC. The mean time for the face-to-face visit was

mean time for telephone calls at all time points was 15 min (range

perceived patient engagement, receptivity and motivation highly: 89%, 92%, and 89%

                  <p>Acceptability data were obtained from 47 (80%) anonymised patient satisfaction
questionnaires (23 control and 24 intervention) and from the 20 participant
interviews. Results from the questionnaire showed that most (89%) participants
reported that they found study participation quite/very easy and 38
(81%) reported that they would recommend ‘LivingWELL’ to
others. Most (80%) of the intervention group expressed a high degree of
satisfaction with intervention components. The following suggestions for change
were made: feedback of results, further contacts with coaches and longer term
follow-up.</p>
                  <p>The qualitative interview data revealed that intervention staff were perceived by
participants as professional, knowledgeable, helpful and approachable.
Appointments at the centre with LCs were largely perceived as convenient in terms
of duration, scheduling and travel incurred. The various measurements were not
considered invasive or inappropriate. However, a few participants found the
activity monitors heavy and uncomfortable. Overall, most participants were
satisfied with the study and recommended few improvements. Participants reported
the following barriers to change:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>everyday routines</p></list-item><list-item><p>sedentary occupations</p></list-item><list-item><p>family commitments</p></list-item><list-item><p>poor physical or mental health</p></list-item><list-item><p>stressful events such as exams, bereavement or family illness</p></list-item><list-item><p>long-standing complex relationships with food.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p>In general, participants appeared to find it easier to change physical activity
than diet.</p>

                <p>The aim of this study was to determine feasibility, not to evaluate statistically
significant change. However, changes in physiological measures suggest a favourable
effect of the intervention on the primary outcome of body weight loss and diastolic
blood pressure (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). These findings are
reflected in the proportions achieving 5% weight loss (37% in the intervention
group compared with 0% in control group) and 10% weight loss (10% of the
intervention group).</p>

                <p>Using the data from the current study, where we observed a mean body weight of

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>Despite evidence for the importance of lifestyle in the aetiology of BC and
CRC, counselling on diet, physical activity and weight management is not routinely
provided for people with a family history of these conditions referred to NHS
genetics clinics. While cancer preventability estimates suggest that healthful ways
of life could significantly reduce cancer risk, the impact of lifestyle interventions
in this patient group is unknown and randomised controlled trial data is needed to
examine the cost, benefits and harms. The results from this pilot study show that it
is feasible to recruit, randomise and retain patients and to implement and evaluate a
weight management programme combining diet and physical activity advice with
behavioural change techniques that is acceptable to patients. The results also
indicate that implementation of this programme is associated with favourable
outcomes. However, the current work has highlighted the importance of face-to-face
approaches for study recruitment and the cautious approach taken by genetic clinic
staff to introducing the study. The findings have also enabled the collection of data
that allows a power calculation to be performed for the design of a definitive
randomised controlled trial.</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
                <p>The main strength of the study is that (to the best of our knowledge) the current
work is the first attempt to offer a comprehensive lifestyle programme (diet,
alcohol, physical activity and body weight) for people referred to FH clinics for CRC
and BC risk assessment. The main weakness of the study is the sociodemographic
profile of participants recruited who were predominantly Caucasian and &gt;50%
were from the two lowest deprivation quintiles (eg, higher socioeconomic status).
Although this distribution reflects the general demographic for high-risk attendees
for breast mammography clinics in this region<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> (where there is little ethnic diversity), it highlights the
difficulties in offering both surveillance and lifestyle interventions to affected
people from more deprived areas.</p>
                <p>The sample size was less than planned due to fewer patients being referred to the
service than previous years (on which our estimate was based), fewer informed about
the study than estimated (despite input from clinic staff in study design) and fewer
being seen face to face than anticipated. The current results underline the need for
feasibility work. Overall, study retention was high but further efforts to reduce
loss to follow-up in people living in areas of higher deprivation should be explored.
Attempts to increase recruitment from existing patients demonstrate that both new and
returning patients have some interest in the topic, but in general a greater
awareness of the relevance of lifestyle in cancer prevention would be beneficial to
recruitment. Other weaknesses include the time allocation for the face-to-face
meeting, which was insufficient for the intended content, resulting in the LCs
deviating from the original protocol. In addition, retention was only assessed over a
12-week period, and a longer test period is likely to be associated with higher loss
to follow-up. Independent assessment of fidelity also suggests scope for improvement
in time allocation as only 62% of intervention components were delivered per
protocol.</p>

                <p>No fully powered trials of lifestyle interventions in people with family history of
cancer have yet reported and those that have been described in the literature focus
primarily on physical activity<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> in
Breast Cancer, early onset (BRCA) mutation carriers. Ongoing trials of weight
management to decrease BC risk are being undertaken in women already diagnosed
with the disease<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–38</xref> but
are not exclusive to people at increased genetic risk. Pilot and formative work on
weight loss and reducing markers of BC has been undertaken<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> (notably on the intermittent energy diet
approach) in women with family history of BC, demonstrating significant changes in
insulin sensitivity and body fat reduction, but no work has been reported for
patients with a family history of CRC. Postintervention interviews with
participants<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> have highlighted the
importance of providing a credible rationale for weight control and weight loss that
underlines the need for health professionals working in this area to introduce and
endorse the importance of lifestyle to aid recruitment.</p>

                <title>Implications for clinicians and policymakers</title>
                <p>This pilot study has highlighted a number of perceived challenges for NHS staff
discussing lifestyle issues among patients with a family history of BC and
CRC but has also demonstrated that there is an interest in being able to offer
more help that could usefully be developed. Indicative results suggest the
intervention had a favourable effect on body weight, physical activity and fat intake
score with potential for clinically relevant benefits for both cancer risk reduction
and long-term health (with or without a cancer diagnosis). While the qualitative data
highlight the complexity and challenge of changing health behaviours, the measured
changes in physical activity and weight loss suggest that small but significant
changes can be achieved, at least in the short term. Support for habitual and
sustained lifestyle change is essential as part of long-term intervention design.</p>

                <p>The generalisability of the current findings are unclear. However, work to date
suggests that the intervention is feasible to deliver and evaluate and could be
tested in a large RCT, subject to modifications. In a fully powered trial, the first
stage would be to assess the magnitude of lifestyle change that can be achieved by
this type of programme. In turn, this fully powered trial would act as a
‘pilot’ for a full trial of reduction in CRC markers. Adenomas
(number and size) might be an appropriate end point depending on funding for the
length of follow-up.</p>
                <p>It would be desirable to increase patient recruitment, and the current findings
suggest that overall uptake could be increased with better training, support and
endorsement from the GCs and other clinical staff. This area of study was almost
entirely new and met with scepticism from staff and indeed patients. Our earlier work
suggests ambiguous attitudes about the importance of lifestyle with little evidence
that these topics have been previously discussed with clinicians.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>The programme was received enthusiastically by participants, but further work is
needed to refine intervention components, particularly dietary aspects that were less
appreciated than the physical activity aspects and may need tailoring for ethnic
groups. Measurements were successfully attained and appropriate for a full study
protocol, although a review of accelerometry approaches is warranted. The numbers
required for a full trial with weight change as a primary outcome would require a
multicentre approach with a minimum recruitment period of at least 12 months.
Overall, the main uncertainties required for planning a definitive randomised
controlled trial have been addressed.</p>
