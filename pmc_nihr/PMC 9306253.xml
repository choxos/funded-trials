                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mobility problems and some cancers, and its prevalence is rising. Men engage less than women in existing weight loss interventions. Game of Stones builds on a successful feasibility study and aims to find out if automated text messages with or without endowment incentives are effective and cost-effective for weight loss at 12 months compared to a waiting list comparator arm in men with obesity.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A 3-arm, parallel group, assessor-blind superiority randomised controlled trial with process evaluation will recruit 585 adult men with body mass index of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more living in and around three UK centres (Belfast, Bristol, Glasgow), purposively targeting disadvantaged areas. Intervention groups: (i) automated, theory-informed text messages daily for 12 months plus endowment incentives linked to verified weight loss targets at 3, 6 and 12 months; (ii) the same text messages and weight loss assessment protocol; (iii) comparator group: 12 month waiting list, then text messages for 3 months. The primary outcome is percentage weight change at 12 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes at 12 months are as follows: quality of life, wellbeing, mental health, weight stigma, behaviours, satisfaction and confidence. Follow-up includes weight at 24 months. A health economic evaluation will measure cost-effectiveness over the trial and over modelled lifetime: including health service resource-use and quality-adjusted life years. The cost-utility analysis will report incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years gained. Participant and service provider perspectives will be explored via telephone interviews, and exploratory mixed methods process evaluation analyses will focus on mental health, multiple long-term conditions, health inequalities and implementation strategies.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The trial will report whether text messages (with and without cash incentives) can help men to lose weight over 1 year and maintain this for another year compared to a comparator group; the costs and benefits to the health service; and men’s experiences of the interventions. Process analyses with public involvement and service commissioner input will ensure that this open-source digital self-care intervention could be sustainable and scalable by a range of NHS or public services.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par49">This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will address the increasing prevalence of obesity, consequent morbidity and engaging men in interventions to achieve and maintain clinically significant weight loss, particularly in areas where there are health inequalities. Men die sooner than women and year-on-year mortality improvements have slowed, particularly in disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Men engage less often than women in existing weight loss interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and sustainable interventions with broad reach are needed for men who do not like, or cannot access, weight management groups. Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, mobility problems and some cancers, leading to multi-morbidity and mental health consequences. Weight loss can reduce premature all-cause mortality and reverse the early stages of type 2 diabetes; hence, reducing obesity is a UK Government priority. Recent evidence shows that obesity and health inequalities are risk factors for worse health outcomes for people with Covid-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">This trial will therefore be important to the public, the National Health Service (NHS) and society. In 2019, 28.0% of adults in England were living with obesity and a further 36.2% were overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In 2019/20, 27% of adults in Northern Ireland were obese, with a further 38% overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Scottish Health Survey (self-reported weight over telephone) reported that 27.5% of adults were obese and a further 34.7% were overweight, with 77% of Scottish men aged 65–74 overweight or obese in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2020/21, 26% of women and 22% of men in Wales reported being obese, with more men than women being obese or overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Testing innovative, scalable, digital interventions for reducing obesity is recommended to increase reach to men and promote self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These can then be offered within current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended tiered weight management services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to span primary, secondary and tertiary disease prevention.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Game of Stones (GoS) is a parallel, 3-arm RCT that delivers automated Short Messaging System (SMS) texts over a 1-year period, with or without financial incentives, and compares weight change at 12 months (M) from baseline with a waiting list comparator group, for men living with obesity. The GoS feasibility study was over-subscribed and demonstrated broad acceptability, and 60% of the 105 men participating lived in the two most disadvantaged Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) postcode quintiles, a higher proportion than in other UK obesity trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Fewer men living in disadvantaged areas dropped out compared to men living in more advantaged areas. An independent Trial Steering Committee (TSC) judged that progression criteria for a full RCT had been met and this full RCT follows a similar trial protocol with some modifications to take account of the advent of Covid-19.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The research team were invited to apply for additional funding from NIHR to investigate UK policy priority areas: mental health and multiple long-term conditions within the Game of Stones Trial.

              <title>Rationale</title>
              <p id="Par53">The research question is as follows: Are automated SMS texts, delivered to support behaviour change, with or without endowment incentives, effective and cost-effective for weight loss at 12 M compared to a waiting list comparator arm in men with obesity? Four systematic (ROMEO) reviews were conducted of the quantitative, qualitative and economic evidence for the weight management of men living with obesity, and the rationale for the SMS texts and incentive interventions in GoS was supported by this evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This led to a promising feasibility study of GoS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and a systematic review of text messages for weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">The systematic review with meta-analysis of 15 RCTs examining SMS-delivered interventions for weight loss (<italic>n</italic> = 12) and weight loss maintenance (<italic>n</italic> = 3) was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The weight loss trials had an effect at intervention end (median duration 6 months) with a mean difference − 2.28 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] − 3.18 to − 1.36 kg). Men accounted for 41% of trial participants, higher than for other interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There were no men-only trials and data relevant to health inequalities were not reported. The ROMEO reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] suggest that interventions need to be designed together with men in the target population. A more recent systematic review concluded that socioeconomic factors were rarely considered during intervention design, conduct and reporting of men’s weight management trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In GoS, Men’s Health Forum (MHF) charities and men in the target population were involved in writing the text messages to ensure the language, content, frequency and timing were acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. GoS SMS texts can be delivered to any mobile phone at any time or place and are scalable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In 2019, 93% of men and 89% of adults in financially vulnerable households had access to a mobile phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Commercial group-based weight management interventions may be particularly unappealing to men from disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and individual, remotely delivered interventions like GoS are potentially able to engage these men. GoS SMS texts appealed to the men participating in the feasibility study as they encouraged autonomy and were non-stigmatising and low burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The infrequent assessment visits (4 over 1 year) and minimal time commitment were also attractive to men living in disadvantaged areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">Systematic review evidence of financial incentives shows their potential to change habitual behaviours and help reduce health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, the evidence for financial incentives for weight loss is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and deposit contracts can be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. But deposit contracts, where people put their own money into an account, and lose it if weight loss targets are not met, may increase health inequalities for the cash poor. In GoS, incentives were designed drawing on evidence, behavioural economics, PPI input and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with 1045 men with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The incentives “endow” participants with a (hypothetical) deposit thereby mimicking a deposit contract. The feasibility trial demonstrated the acceptability and promise of the incentive intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Offering an incentive was valued by men on low incomes for a variety of reasons, such as weight loss resulting in them needing to buy new clothes. This trial is running concurrently with a UK cost of living crisis with inflation in the costs of food and fuel. A Food Foundation report in 2020 highlights that if people follow Public Health England’s healthy eating advice, those in the bottom 10% of income would need to spend 74% of their household income on food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], further highlighting the importance of health inequalities.</p>
              <p id="Par56">This trial will provide evidence on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and impact on health inequalities relevant for policy makers and service commissioners. Participants living with obesity and mental health conditions and/or multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) are a particular focus, as there is a gap in the evidence for weight loss interventions in populations of men with MLTCs and poor mental health. Addressing health inequalities, mental health and MLTC are key government priorities, together with understanding the mediators and moderators for weight management. These are all inter-related, and casual pathways are complex and multi-directional.</p>
              <p id="Par57">In summary, GoS will target a clear evidence gap in weight management services and health inequalities for men. Obesity, health inequalities and prevention are all UK policy priorities in the NHS Long Term Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, particularly with new evidence emerging about risk factors for Covid-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The implementation focus will involve public service technology experts so that SMS texts and incentives can, in future, be delivered centrally or locally, together or separately. This self-care intervention can accommodate future technological advances in digital scales linked to databases to minimise staff resource requirements. The GoS trial will produce evidence for NHS service commissioners to show whether financial incentives with or without SMS texts can improve outcomes for men living with obesity.</p>

Participants can choose whether to try to lose weight or not during the 12 months. No weight loss targets will be set, and comparator participants do not have access to a self-monitoring page. The comparator arm will be as close as possible to “doing nothing”, whilst remaining ethical by providing information, free choice to lose weight and later assistance (after 12 M follow-up) via SMS texts to reduce disappointment bias.

                    <p id="Par92">The SMS texts were designed in collaboration with nine men from the University of Stirling Public Engagement Group and MHF and informed by the following: evidence-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs); systematic review of effective SMS text studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and analysis of qualitative data on acceptability and men’s preferences in the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The SMS texts are written in a conversational tone and clustered around weekly weight management themes. They include reflections, encouragement and tips from other men together with web links to relevant information sources. The source of texts from the perspective of participants was the GoS feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. They are not based on a cast of characters or a story. Further refinement of the texts was undertaken with PPI at the three trial centres during trial set-up and the editorial and creative consultant of MHF GB, who has provided award-winning health guides and online material for men on weight and other health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. SMS texts delivered over a 12 M period are embedded with evidence and theory-based BCTs based on the Health Action Process Approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], Self-Determination Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and the Behaviour Change Maintenance Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Daily SMS texts target automatic processes by acting as a consistent prompt and cue reminding participants of their intention to lose weight, thus aiming to reduce impulsive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The following feedback from men in the target population was incorporated: include concrete tips, facts and links to information websites; include a range of perspectives and approaches as no one approach will suit everyone all the time; introduce engagement elements such as questions to prompt reflections and humour. Men liked texts to read as if they were based on experiences from other men taking part.</p>

Engagement is encouraged by asking direct and rhetorical questions on weight management and employing general communication techniques such as agenda setting or use of humour. Some texts embed links to relevant websites for more information and self-monitoring sites (e.g. weight, step count). Participants will be invited to reflect on and implement changes to their normal diet and activity in line with evidence-based recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The sequencing of SMS texts covers weight loss (until 6 M), followed by more weight loss maintenance topics (6 M-12 M). Individual SMS texts are non-consecutive and stand-alone: they do not require paying attention to or engaging with previous content. After each weight assessment at 3 M, 6 M and 12 M, the SMS-only and SMS + I participants receive a personalised SMS text including the participant’s name and weight change.</p>

                    <p id="Par100">The novel endowment incentive for verified weight loss in addition to the SMS texts was based on theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In the feasibility study, the incentive structure was decided by considering evidence from multiple sources: a DCE completed by 1045 men in the target population; extensive Patient and Public Involvement (PPI); systematic review evidence; psychological and economic theory and analysis of qualitative interview data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The incentive draws on behavioural economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] which shows that people ascribe more value to something because it belongs to them (endowment effect) and are more motivated to avoid losses than they are to achieve similarly sized gains (loss aversion).</p>

Money can only be accessed at 12 M (no withdrawals) if weight loss targets are met.

Detail is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The top-level weight loss target suggested by NICE is 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and this was endorsed by PPI. The full incentive can be secured by meeting all verified weight loss targets: 5% of body weight lost (from baseline) at 3 M, 10% lost at 6 M and 10% lost at 12 M. At 6 M and 12 M, some money for each % weight loss not attained between 5 and 10% will be lost. Weight must be objectively measured by a fieldworker on research calibrated scales within 3 weeks of the target date. The incentive will be calculated automatically when verified weight is entered into the centralised database. Participants then receive a personalised SMS text with the amount of incentive secured/lost and will be encouraged to keep trying as they can still secure money. Weight and incentive status will also be presented on their personal private webpage. All participants will be given a wallet sized GoS appointment card with their personalised target weights for each appointment date and fieldworkers will fill in objectively measured weight at each assessment.</p>

Participants who stop the SMS texts by default will remain in the trial, unless they also request to withdraw from attending follow-up appointments, being weighed, or both. The offer of an endowment incentive may be declined by participants: they will remain in the trial unless they also request to withdraw from attending follow-up appointments, being weighed, or both.</p>

With an expected 25% loss to follow-up as observed in the feasibility study at 1 year, a total of 585 men will need to be randomised: 195 per trial group and approximately 195 (65 per trial group) at each of the three centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The sample size calculation was based on detecting a mean difference in weight between intervention groups and comparator of at least 3.3 kg, assuming a pooled standard deviation of 8 kg. A minimum clinically important weight loss of 3% is recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and the mean difference of 3.3 kg is derived from 3% of 109 kg (the mean baseline weight in the feasibility study).

                <p id="Par131">The schedule of assessments is summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Participants will be sent a reminder of their appointment by text (or preferred contact method) the day before. Non-attenders will receive two reminders to contact the team and given the opportunity to arrange another appointment. Reminders will be sent using different methods, e.g. SMS text, email, phone, post, because mobile phone numbers may change, men may run out of phone credit and some men may unpredictably work away from home. Flexibility of approach is both valued by participants and required in any study aiming to address health inequalities. Relevant information about preferred methods of contact will be documented by fieldworkers on the HIC recruitment tracker. Fieldworkers will measure height and weight using standardised procedures developed and written for the study and following device instruction manuals within a 3-week window of their personal weight target date (in order for the SMS + I group participants to qualify for the linked incentive at 3 M, 6 M and 12 M). Height will be measured using a portable standing stadiometer (Marsden HM-250P, Rotherham, UK) to the nearest 0.1 cm. Weight will be measured on mobile flat scales with double display (Seca 878, Birmingham, UK) to the nearest 0.01 kg. If the surface is uneven, a board will be placed under the scales. Weight will be entered manually onto the Case Report Form (CRF) which participants will be asked to sign to confirm the accuracy of the entered weight.</p>
                <p id="Par132">In the event of a face-to-face verified assessment not being possible for the primary outcome assessment at 12 M (e.g. participant out of the country), every effort will be made to gain a satisfactory verified weight via video assessment, or via an independently confirmed weight by a third party, e.g. a pharmacist, community or health worker. Methods will be documented, to enable a sensitivity analysis to be undertaken.</p>
                <p id="Par133">Self-report questionnaires (participant choice, online via a secure password-protected research tablet, paper, telephone if visual impairment or literacy issues), completed when attending weight assessments, will be uploaded to CHaRT databases. The questionnaires will be completed by the participants with fieldworkers present in case they require help, e.g. visual or literacy issues. Assessments use validated tools where available and follow quality standards for measurement procedures.</p>

                <p id="Par134">To maximise completeness of data, participants who do not attend assessments within the 3-week time window permitted, but who have not withdrawn from the trial, may be contacted (by their preferred method) and requested to complete a questionnaire (paper copy or via email link) and provide a self-reported weight. This will not qualify for an incentive payment. A letter will be sent to those who do not attend the 12 M assessment reminding them that they will be invited to attend an appointment at 24 M. All participants will receive a £20 retail voucher as reimbursement of expenses for attending the 12 M and 24 M assessments, consistent with evidence that financial reimbursement can improve retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. This trial will also host a nested study within a trial (SWAT) RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This will investigate the effect of participant-trial staff relationships on retention up to the time of the primary outcome assessment. Retention is the primary outcome for the SWAT study. Participants randomised to the intervention groups (SMS + I and SMS-only) of the main trial will immediately be randomised again (using same randomisation as described above) to receive one of two protocolised weight assessment approaches (task-oriented group or relational group) using random permuted blocks.</p>
