                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Patient-maintained propofol TCI sedation (PMPS) allows patients to titrate their own target-controlled infusion (TCI) delivery of propofol sedation using a handheld button. The aim of this RCT was to compare PMPS with anaesthetist-controlled propofol TCI sedation (ACPS) in patients undergoing elective primary lower-limb arthroplasty surgery under spinal anaesthesia.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this single-centre open-label investigator-led study, adult patients were randomly assigned to either PMPS or ACPS during their surgery. Both sedation regimes used Schnider effect-site TCI modelling. The primary outcome measure was infusion rate adjusted for weight (expressed as mg kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>). Secondary outcomes measures included depth of sedation, occurrence of sedation-related adverse events and time to medical readiness for discharge from the postanaesthsia care unit (PACU).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Eighty patients (48 female) were randomised. Subjects using PMPS used 39.3% less propofol during the sedation period compared with subjects in group ACPS (1.56 [0.57] <italic>vs</italic> 2.57 [1.33] mg kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), experienced fewer discrete episodes of deep sedation (0 <italic>vs</italic> 6; <italic>P</italic>=0.0256), fewer airway/breathing adverse events (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.94 [1.31–6.64]; <italic>P</italic>=0.009) and were ready for discharge from PACU more quickly (8.94 [5.5] <italic>vs</italic> 13.51 [7.2] min; <italic>P</italic>=0.0027).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Patient-maintained propofol sedation during lower-limb arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia results in reduced drug exposure and fewer episodes of sedation-related adverse events compared with anaesthetist-controlled propofol TCI sedation. To facilitate further investigation of this procedural sedation technique, PMPS-capable TCI infusion devices should be submitted for regulatory approval for clinical use.</p>

            <p id="p0040">Procedural sedation facilitates diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, while reducing the negative patient experiences associated with anxiety and pain.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Sedation is commonly achieved using propofol, delivered by target-controlled infusion (TCI). Propofol TCI administration is typically titrated to effect (i.e. depth of sedation) by anaesthetists supervising the drug regimen, and such sedation is termed anaesthetist-controlled propofol sedation (ACPS). For longer sedation episodes, ACPS offers a smoother and more titratable and predictable patient sedation compared with clinician-administered intermittent bolus administration of propofol. An alternative TCI propofol sedation technique is to allow patients themselves to exert a degree of control over their sedation depth, termed patient-maintained propofol sedation (PMPS). Patient-maintained propofol sedation was first described in 1997,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and appears to facilitate safe and effective procedural sedation in a variety of clinical settings.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The application of TCI technology differentiates PMPS from patient-controlled propofol sedation (PCPS), which uses bolus propofol administration (i.e. in mg) using non-TCI patient-controlled devices. We have recently published a scoping review on this topic, which identified that there is no commercially available TCI device capable of PMPS and that the literature is dominated by studies of PCPS.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although some experimental evidence exists from three previously published RCTs of PMPS (enrolling a total of 173 participants), our review identified no previous trials testing PMPS against ACPS during arthroplasty surgery. Our group therefore developed a PMPS-capable research-ready infusion device to undertake this trial.</p>
            <p id="p0045">We conducted a prospective RCT with the aim of assessing the clinical performance of PMPS in the setting of elective, primary lower-limb arthroplasty performed under spinal (subarachnoid) anaesthesia. The primary research objective was to compare total propofol infusion rate adjusted for weight when TCI sedation was patient-maintained <italic>vs</italic> when it was anaesthetist controlled. Propofol infusion rate was chosen as the primary outcome measure because it is a measurable and clearly defined endpoint. It is also relatively free from observer or reporting bias, both of which can affect the validity of endpoints, such as patient satisfaction or depth of sedation, when applied to clinical trials of sedation techniques. The primary objective of the study, expressed as a null hypothesis (<italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub>) was that there is no difference in propofol infusion rate (normalised for body weight and sedation duration) when sedation is patient maintained <italic>vs</italic> anaesthetist controlled. Secondary objectives included examination of between-group differences in calculated TCI model propofol compartment concentrations, depth of sedation, patient-reported outcome measures, occurrence of sedation-related adverse events, and time and quality of recovery from sedation.</p>

After obtaining written consent, the participants underwent randomisation on the morning of surgery to either ACPS or PMPS for surgery. The participants were provided with group-specific descriptions of their allocated sedation regime. The safety of the participants in both groups was supervised at all times by a study-independent clinical anaesthetist who was not part of the investigative trial team. On the morning of surgery, an investigator collected baseline data, including previous experiences of surgery and anaesthesia, attitudes to medical care, the six-item abbreviated Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> modified Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale, abbreviated Krantz Health Opinion Survey,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> baseline Quality of Recovery-15,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and health-related utility scored using the crosswalk valuation of EuroQoL® EQ-5D-5L responses.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> On arrival in the operating suite, i.v. access and noninvasive monitoring was secured, and a spinal anaesthetic was performed by the independent clinical anaesthetist using hyperbaric bupivacaine hydrochloride. After confirmation using ethyl chloride spray of an adequate dermatomal sensory block, the participants commenced their allocated sedation regime using propofol 1% (Propofol-Lipuro® 1%; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany). All participants received supplemental oxygen 4–6 L min<sup>−1</sup> via a face mask with exhaled carbon dioxide monitoring (Sentri™; Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK). Ventilatory frequency, arterial oxygen saturations, HR, and BP were recorded at baseline and at 5-min intervals from the commencement of sedation until the participant was deemed medically fit for discharge from the PACU. This time was defined as a modified Aldrete score<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> of 9 or greater. Depth of sedation was measured at 5 min intervals using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (mOAA/S) scale.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The sedation regime was discontinued at the end of surgery once skin clips had been applied to the surgical wound. In the PMPS group, the handheld button was taken away from the participant and the PMPS infusion was stopped. In the ACPS group, the TCI infusion was stopped. The sedation period was thus defined as the time from the commencement of sedation after spinal anaesthesia to the discontinuation of sedation at the end of surgery. Once participants were medically ready for discharge from PACU, a group-specific postoperative questionnaire was administered. This questionnaire sought feedback on participant experience, including retrograde amnesia, and incorporated a trial-specific unweighted version of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> to produce subjective self-reported workload estimates from users of the PMPS regime with possible responses ranging from 0 (very low workload) to 100 (very high workload). After discharge from hospital, all participants were contacted by telephone to conduct a final group-specific postoperative questionnaire. On completion of telephone follow-up, the patient's enrolment in the trial was complete. Patients, outcome assessors, and supervising clinical anaesthetists were not blinded to treatment allocation in this open-label study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0180">Subjects undergoing lower-limb arthroplasty using the PMPS regime used 39% less propofol than subjects undergoing ACPS. Subjects using PMPS consequently experienced fewer instances of deep sedation and airway/breathing sedation-related adverse events compared with subjects undergoing ACPS. Subjects using PMPS experienced less amnesia and were ready for discharge from PACU more quickly than those sedated by ACPS. Participants in both groups reported themselves highly satisfied with their sedation experience. There were no detected differences in patient-reported satisfaction or quality of recovery between the groups. Subjects randomised to PMPS during their surgery reported very low NASA Task Load Index scores for the sedation technique.</p>
              <sec id="sec3.1">
                <title>Context of results</title>
                <p id="p0185">There have been three previous RCTs of PMPS. Leitch and colleagues<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> compared the technique with clinician-bolus midazolam sedation in oral surgery, Stonell and colleagues<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> compared it with clinician-bolus propofol in colonoscopy, and Rodrigo and colleagues<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> compared it with PCPS in oral surgery. Comparisons between studies require caution, as each trial reported different propofol TCI models, compartment targeting, PMPS algorithms, and outcome measures. Nevertheless, the present finding that PMPS reduces propofol infusion rates and depth of sedation compared with non-PMPS procedural sedation is in keeping with all three previous experimental investigations. This finding is similar to previously reported observations using PCPS techniques, including in comparison with ACPS<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and fixed-rate propofol infusion.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0190">One possible explanation for the between-group difference in propofol infusion rate is that patients using PMPS wanted more sedation, but were unable to press their button successfully and so used less propofol compared with ACPS; however, this is unlikely because only one patient who received PMPS achieved the algorithm ceiling effect-site concentration of 2.0 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, it is known that healthy volunteers remain capable of activating handheld buttons during PMPS despite effect-site concentrations of propofol in excess of the 2.0 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> ceiling used in our work.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Another explanation is that patients using PMPS both wanted and were capable of giving themselves more sedation, but were reticent to do so (e.g. because of fear of ‘over-sedation’). Again, this is not supported by patient feedback, which showed that all patients felt safe and were positive about their sedation experience. A further explanation may be that patient control is an important factor. Perhaps unsurprisingly, patients using PMPS reported feeling significantly more in control of their sedation compared with their ACPS counterparts. It might be that for some patients, the knowledge they can increase their sedation at any point is important, and ownership of the locus of control means they request more sedation only when actually required. A final explanation may be that anaesthetists delivering ACPS overestimate the amount of propofol patients require to achieve satisfactory sedation. This practice may arise from a fear that under-sedation may result in patient complaint, as many patients preoperatively express a desire to ‘not hear or see anything’ during their procedure. In the absence of significant medical comorbidity or specific risk factors for complications of deep sedation (such as obesity), clinicians may decide to cautiously increase sedation depth for fear of leaving patients unsatisfied with the experience. This trial was not designed to test this hypothesis, but it is offered as one possible explanation for the differences in practice seen between PMPS and ACPS propofol usage.</p>
                <p id="p0195">Possible confounding factors in the relationship between propofol administration and study outcome measures include the block height achieved by spinal anaesthesia (higher blocks are known to potentiate the sedative effects of propofol)<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> and the administration of additional non-propofol sedative agents at the discretion of the supervising clinical anaesthetist. The spinal anaesthesia block heights achieved for surgery were similar between PMPS and ACPS groups (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); therefore, this is unlikely to play a significant role in subsequent between-group differences in outcome measure. The administration of anxiolytic doses of midazolam (typically &lt;25 μg kg<sup>−1</sup>) before spinal anaesthesia is recognised in clinical practice<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and was pragmatically accommodated into the trial methodology at the discretion of the supervising independent clinical anaesthetist. There was an unexpectedly higher incidence of midazolam administration in group ACPS, although the doses administered did not differ between groups, as reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Midazolam is known to influence the pharmacodynamics<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and pharmacokinetics<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> of propofol, but such interactions are described at larger midazolam doses than reported in the current work. Furthermore, even if interaction were to occur, we would expect this to cause decreased propofol dosage in group ACPS than would otherwise occur, and thereby make the trial null hypothesis more difficult to reject.</p>
                <p id="p0200">The finding of the present study of fewer episodes of deep sedation and airway/breathing-related complications using PMPS is consistent with data presented in all three earlier RCTs. Stonell and colleagues<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> reported a mean [<sc>sd</sc>] number of deep sedation events of 3.0 [3.2] in the anaesthetist-controlled group <italic>vs</italic> 0.8 [1.4] in the PMPS group. Rodrigo and colleagues<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> reported two episodes of deep sedation in the patient-controlled non-TCI propofol infusion group <italic>vs</italic> zero in the PMPS group, and Leitch and colleagues<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> reported one episode in the midazolam group <italic>vs</italic> zero in the PMPS group. This consistent finding may be attributable to lower peak drug concentrations compared with control arms, and also to the programmed dose ceiling in PMPS algorithms, preventing patients from incrementing their sedation above a predetermined level. The feedback loop of reduced levels of consciousness preventing patients from incrementing their target concentrations of propofol even higher is another explanation of the apparent safety of PMPS in this regard.</p>
                <p id="p0205">The occurrence of 23 airway and breathing and 35 circulatory adverse events during 40 episodes of ACPS sedation in patients appears high, and some clinicians would likely view their own sedation practice as not incurring such a high rate of side-effects and complications. However, this trial has used TROOPS adverse events reporting criteria for these events, which detect and report with stringent criteria, including such events as ventilatory frequency &lt;8, which some clinicians in their day-to-day practice may not consider adverse events.</p>
                <p id="p0210">Our trial reported medical readiness for discharge from PACU using modified Aldrete scoring, with both groups achieving medical readiness quickly after cessation of sedation. This scoring system did not take into account the degree of regression of spinal blockade, which will have continued to regress after admission to the postoperative ward, as per the usual practice of our centre.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p id="p0215">This study used an open-label design, placing the results at risk of performance or observer bias affecting internal validity. Although participant and anaesthetist blinding to group allocation (using sham buttons) has been reported in a previous trial of PMPS,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> other researchers have not blinded subjects, arguing that a key component of PMPS is the element of control and empowerment that a handheld button provides, and that this, in itself, may provide some of the psychological benefit and anxiolysis for patients.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> If subjects who received ACPS were given a button, this could alter their psychological response to sedation, and provide additional anxiolysis and comfort (or the reverse), meaning they are no longer receiving normal ACPS. The clinical examination of PMPS is therefore akin to the assessment of psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which are rarely blinded to participants or healthcare staff. As a pragmatic evaluation of PMPS in a ‘real-world’ clinical setting, the benefits of conducting research in this environment needed to be weighed against the practical restraints of doing so. One such restraint is that effective blinding of outcome assessors to the intervention received was deemed not feasible in this clinical perioperative environment,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and it is highly likely that participant, supervising anaesthetist, and outcome assessor unblinding would occur in the perioperative period because of the physical restraints of the operating theatre and verbal conversations giving clues to treatment identity. This is a well-known limitation of effective blinding.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0220">To mitigate the risk of observer bias, the study used objective outcome measures to test the trial hypotheses, rather than novel or subjective outcome measurements. In addition to providing more comprehensive reporting and reducing observer bias, this will facilitate incorporation of the study results into subsequent meta-analyses.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> These include measured total propofol infusion rate adjusted for weight, mOAA/S, TROOPS criteria for sedation-related side-effects, modified Aldrete score, the NASA Task Load Index, and the six-item Spielberger STAI. The study outcome measures closely align with the recommendations of the Sedation Consortium on Endpoints and Procedures for Treatment, Education, and Research recommendations whose guidelines on outcome measures in sedation trials were published after the study methodology had been determined.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="p0225">Although this trial was conducted at a single UK centre, the conduct of anaesthesia in both trial arms replicates the International Consensus on Anaesthesia-Related Outcomes after Surgery Group recommendations,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> so we believe the trial results have international external validity.</p>
                <p id="p0230">A further limitation is that this trial did not seek feedback on the quality of sedation provided from operating surgeons or feedback from clinical anaesthetists on the usability of the PMPS-capable infusion device. The rationale for decision-making by anaesthetists regarding the administration of additional sedatives (specifically midazolam in this trial) was not requested as part of the current work. It is possible that the lower administration of midazolam doses amongst participants randomised to PMPS may be a response by clinicians to uncertainty regarding the safety or efficacy of PMPS as a sedation technique. The extent to which clinician behaviour was influenced by group allocation cannot be answered with certainty, as this feedback was not sought. Further specific research should be conducted to obtain feedback from anaesthetists on the usability and functionality of PMPS as a sedation technique administered by a PMPS-capable infusion device.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="p0235">The findings of this study support the further advancement of PMPS as offering an benefit to the perioperative care of patients undergoing hip or knee replacement under spinal anaesthesia. The main barrier to implementation of PMPS into clinical practice is the current absence of a CE-marked commercial infusion device capable of such sedation. It is likely that this situation will change in the future, with device manufacturers thought to be pursuing PMPS as a technology for commercialisation, although the path from scientific justification to international market adoption is slow and tortuous in healthcare generally and with regard to TCI technology in particular.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
