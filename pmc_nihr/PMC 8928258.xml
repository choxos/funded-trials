                  <p>RETurn to work After stroKE (RETAKE) is a multicentre individual patient randomised controlled trial to determine whether Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) plus usual care is a clinically and cost-effective therapy to facilitate return to work after stroke, compared with usual care alone. This protocol paper describes the embedded process evaluation.</p>

                  <p>Intervention training for therapists will be observed and use of remote mentor support reviewed through documentary analysis. Fidelity will be assessed through participant questionnaires and analysis of therapy records, examining frequency, duration and content of ESSVR sessions. To understand the influence of social and structural contexts, the process evaluation will explore therapists’ attitudes towards evidence-based practice, competency to deliver the intervention and evaluate potential sources of contamination. Longitudinal case studies incorporating non-participant observations will be conducted with a proportion of intervention and usual care participants. Semistructured interviews with stroke survivors, carers, occupational therapists, mentors, service managers and employers will explore their experiences as RETAKE participants. Analysis of qualitative data will draw on thematic and framework approaches. Quantitative data analysis will include regression models and descriptive statistics. Qualitative and quantitative data will be independently analysed by process evaluation and Clinical Trials Research Unit teams, respectively. Linked data, for example, fidelity and describing usual care will be synthesised by comparing and integrating quantitative descriptive data with the qualitative findings.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Approximately 100 000 people in the UK suffer from a stroke every year,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and around one in four are of working age.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Returning to work after a stroke is a major goal for stroke survivors, contributing to social identity, emotional and financial well-being and conferring a sense of purpose and has benefits for the individual, the individual’s family and the economy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Despite this, only half of working age stroke survivors make a successful return to meaningful work, and they are two to three times more likely to be unemployed 8 years after their stroke than the general population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although impairments in the stroke survivor’s physical, cognitive and communication abilities can affect this,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> social and environmental factors such as personal and employer beliefs and attitudes, job type and organisation size and the benefits system also play an important part.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref></p>
              <p>Vocational rehabilitation (VR) is defined as whatever helps someone with a health problem to return to, or remain in, work and includes both work <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> work-related education.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It involves helping people find work, helping those who are in work but having difficulty as well as supporting career progression in spite of illness or disability. The primary aim is to optimise work participation.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Existing research suggests that VR may help stroke survivors return to their previous job or find new work,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> however, trials to date involve small samples in non-UK settings.</p>
              <p>RETurn to work After stroKE (RETAKE) is a multicentre individual patient randomised controlled trial, which aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) intervention in addition to usual National Health Service (NHS) rehabilitation on stroke survivors’ return to work (RTW) at 12 months postrandomisation, compared with NHS rehabilitation alone.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Acceptability and utility were assessed in a feasibility trial.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> ESSVR combines conventional occupational therapy (OT) with case coordination. The intervention commences within 2 weeks of randomisation and lasts up to 12 months postrandomisation. It is intended for delivery in the community as often as required by individuals, as determined by a stroke specialist OT with additional VR training. ESSVR includes the following: (a) assessing stroke impact on the person and their job, (b) educating individuals, employers and families about stroke impact on work and strategies to lessen impact (eg, memory aids, fatigue management), (c) work preparation, including opportunities to practice work skills and (d) liaison with employers to plan and monitor a phased RTW (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>). The target number of participants for the trial is 760 participants (420 ESSVR and 340 usual care) from 20 UK hospitals and linked early supported discharge/community services. The RETAKE trial and embedded process evaluation commenced in June 2018 and will complete in March 2022. This period includes a funder approved extension of 7 months necessitated by an unplanned pause in recruitment during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

              <p>Failure to implement evidence-based stroke rehabilitation interventions in clinical practice may result in unnecessary suffering and disability.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Trialists must consider future implementation in the real world when designing clinical trials, paying particular attention to the context for intervention delivery and factors likely to influence its uptake and use.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This is especially true for trials of complex rehabilitation interventions, which comprise multiple interacting components and target a number of different organisational levels, making them particularly challenging to implement. An embedded process evaluation provides for an in-depth exploration of factors influencing the implementation of complex interventions.</p>
              <p>The Medical Research Council (MRC) argue for a systematic approach to designing and conducting process evaluations, drawing on clear descriptions of intervention theory and the identification of key process questions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Mixed methods approaches to process evaluation are increasingly common and consistent with the MRC framework’s emphasis on exploring and understanding the important relationship between context, mechanisms and implementation. Theory-driven process evaluations are recommended alongside complex intervention trials to measure what is delivered. These measurements include fidelity (whether the intervention was delivered as intended), dose (the quantity of intervention implemented) and ‘reach’ of interventions to understand how the intended audience interacts with the intervention.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Fidelity data are necessary to interpret intervention outcomes, but despite an extensive literature supporting its importance, fidelity is commonly under-reported in studies of complex rehabilitation interventions. While most trials of VR have not raised particular concerns about fidelity, ESSVR in the RETAKE trial is an example of a particularly complex intervention that crosses organisational boundaries, involves interactions between multiple stakeholders, is highly individually tailored and requires behavioural change by the patient, their family and employer. Therefore, in the process evaluation for the RETAKE trial, we have included specific methods to measure fidelity. Alongside a focus on fidelity, in-depth qualitative exploration of participants’ experiences of an intervention and of the social and structural context, in which an intervention is provided, are essential elements of process evaluation of complex interventions. This ensures any adaptations made to tailor intervention to the individual and/or differing contexts, which might undermine fidelity can be evaluated. Understanding and reporting how the intervention (including training and support, communication and management structures) is delivered is important for replication in clinical practice.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Such evaluation aims to reduce the chance of discounting effective interventions (type II error) or erroneously attributing outcomes to treatment effectiveness, when interventions are not delivered as intended (type III errors).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> The approach is designed to improve trial design and knowledge translation interventions enhancing clinical implementation and reducing research waste.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref></p>

The process evaluation will draw on the intervention logic model developed by the Trialists (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) and will be underpinned by normalisation process theory (NPT), an implementation theory built on four constructs (coherence, cognitive participation, collective action and reflexive monitoring) each informed by four components.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> NPT will be used in the development of data collection tools (interview topic guides and observation checklists (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>)) and as a sensitising lens in qualitative data analysis and interpretation. NPT constructs will underpin the process evaluation and provide insights into the implementation and integration of the intervention into participating stroke services. This will include how the intervention is received, understood, implemented and how it could be normalised into the current healthcare system.</p>

Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. When a participant is randomised to the case study element, a researcher will contact the participant to gain consent for interview and observations. Consent will be reaffirmed at the start of interviews. This process will be the same for carer, employer, OT and NHS staff interviews. For employer interviews, additional consent to contact the employer will be requested from the case study participant before the employer is contacted. OTs who will deliver the ESSVR intervention and mentors supporting these OTs will be recruited prior to intervention training. NHS staff involved in the management, commissioning or delivery of stroke rehabilitation in each site participating in the RETAKE trial will be recruited.</p>

                <p>To check on fidelity in terms of (early) intervention within 2 weeks of recruitment, initial session case report forms (CRFs) (one per participant) record the intervention start date and whether this occurred within 8 weeks of stroke. Participant summary CRFs record the number of sessions attended out of those proposed and whether there was an agreed ending for the OT-led RTW support. To ascertain intervention dose and describe intervention content, data will be extracted from intervention CRFs for all participants (see <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Therapists record each intervention session against predefined components, on the Intervention content CRF.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> These data will be used to identify which components of the intervention were delivered, to what extent therapists adhered to the intervention process described in the RETAKE manual and to what extent participants adhered to the intervention. For case study participants only, content data will be cross-referenced with the OT’s clinical case notes and additional data extracted to explain how the RETAKE intervention interacts with usual care and other services such as employment services. Participants’ consent includes permission for members of the trials team to access their therapy records.</p>

                  <p>Following attendance at a 2 day, manualised face-to-face training session with VR expert trainers and again at refresher training 6 months later, retake OTs competence will be assessed using OTs written responses to questions based on vignettes depicting novel RTW after stroke scenarios. Model answers developed by the training team will be used to measure competence using criteria based on knowledge of the intervention process (40%), clinical reasoning (50%) and written communication (10%). Scores will be mapped to a rubric identifying OTs as highly competent (≥70%), competent (50%–69%) or needing additional support (≤49%) (see <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2</xref>). In addition, as mentors meet with mentees on a monthly basis, informal monitoring of OT competency can occur. If required, action can be taken to addresses issues of concern identified by mentor or mentee. After 12 months of delivering the intervention, RETAKE OTs competence will be reassessed by evaluating the intervention delivered in a random selection of completed intervention case records (one participant per RETAKE OT) against the trainer’s expert opinion. The trainer will review the selected case records against the intervention mechanisms identified in the logic model and confirm whether the intervention delivered is consistent with the intervention that would have been delivered by the trainer as an expert RTW-related OT.</p>

RETAKE OTs will be able to discuss any difficulties they are experiencing, ask questions and share best practice with other OTs and their mentor. This process will also facilitate communication between the trial team and enable barriers to implementation and contamination risks to be reported.
