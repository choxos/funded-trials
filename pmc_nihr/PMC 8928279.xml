                <sec>
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>To describe the design, development and pilot of a multicomponent intervention aimed at supporting withdrawal of opioids for people with chronic non-malignant pain for future evaluation in the Improving the Wellbeing of people with Opioid Treated CHronic pain (I-WOTCH) randomised controlled trial.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>The I-WOTCH intervention draws on previous literature and collaboration with stakeholders (patient and public involvement). Intervention mapping and development activities of Behaviour Change Taxonomy are described.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>The intervention development was conducted by a multidisciplinary team with clinical, academic and service user perspectives. The team had expertise in the development and testing of complex health behaviour interventions, opioid tapering and pain management in primary and secondary care, I.T programming, and software development—to develop an opioid tapering App.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>The I-WOTCH trial participants are adults (18 years and over) with chronic non-malignant pain using strong opioids for at least 3 months and on most days in the preceding month.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>A multicomponent self-management support package to help people using opioids for chronic non-malignant pain reduce opioid use.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>

                  <p>Receiving information on the impact of long-term opioid use, and potential adverse effects were highlighted as important facilitators in making the decision to reduce opioids. Case studies of those who have successfully stopped taking opioids were also favoured as a facilitator to reduce opioid use. Barriers included the need for a ‘trade-off to fill the deficit of the effect of the drug’. The final I-WOTCH intervention consists of an 8–10 week programme incorporating: education; problem-solving; motivation; group and one to one tailored planning; reflection and monitoring. A detailed facilitator manual was developed to promote consistent delivery of the intervention across the UK.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Pain, and pain related disorders, continue to be the leading cause of disability and disease burden globally,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with low back pain making the largest contribution to years lived with disability. In England, at least 8 million people (15% of the population) have moderate-to-severe persistent (chronic) pain<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> defined as <italic toggle="yes">pain that lasts or recurs for more than 3 months</italic>.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Over the past few decades, there has been a global epidemic of opioid prescribing for chronic non-malignant pain. A 2020 systematic review found that 30% of people with chronic non-malignant pain are prescribed opioid medication and, globally, this has steadily increased until recently with time.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the UK, prescribing rates have decreased slightly over recent years; however, the number of prescriptions remains high.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Long-term use of opioids leads to tolerance and loss of effective pain relief. Adverse consequences include opioid-induced hyperalgesia, endocrine hypogonadism, drowsiness, a high risk of dependency, opioid use disorder, sleep apnoea, immune suppression, falls leading to increased fractures (particularly a risk in the elderly population) and increased risk for overdose and death.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There are limited strategies to help with risk mitigation and evidence based interventions to help people with chronic non-malignant pain withdraw from opioids.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A 2020 systematic review found ten randomised controlled trials (n=835) of patient-focused opioid de-prescribing interventions targeting people with chronic non-malignant pain. These included: dose reduction protocols (weekly reduction of 10%); opioid replacement including (buprenorphine, morphine sulphate or oxycodone hydrochloride or varenicline; non-pharmacological therapies including mindfulness (vs active control or support group); therapeutic interactive voice response programme (vs usual care); meditation; cognitive–behavioural therapy (vs usual care); and electroacupuncture (vs sham). The primary outcome was mean reduction of daily dose in morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Only one study reported a statistically significant difference in the daily dose between groups in favour of the intervention (a study using a dose tapering protocol) (mean difference −27.9 MME/day, 95% CI −41.1 to −14.7).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> None of these interventions reported increases in opioid cessation in the intervention groups. Overall, the authors were unable to recommend any particular deprescribing strategy due to the small number of studies and heterogeneity of the data.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Current recommendations on opioid tapering are based on the best practice and guidelines which need to be supported by further evidence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Here, we describe the development of a multicomponent opioid tapering programme (incorporating group and one to one sessions) as part of the I-WOTCH study (Improving the Wellbeing of people with Opioid Treated CHronic pain), funded by the National Institute of Health Research (14/224/04). The I-WOTCH study protocol has been published previously.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

              <p>The I-WOTCH intervention was developed in collaboration with the target population (those with chronic non-malignant pain and experience of opioid use). It employed theory and evidence-based implementation (with a view to implementation in the real world should it be effective) and included digital technologies to generate opioid tapering plans.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The Medical Research Council Framework<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> for designing complex interventions, evidence-based interventions<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and core theoretical principles were used to inform the design of content, structure and delivery of the intervention.</p>

                <p>During the development stages of I-WOTCH, we held two PPI meetings with the Clinical Research Network (North East and Cumbria) at The James Cook University Hospital (South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust). A total of 19 volunteer participants (people with chronic pain and experience of opioid therapy and/or opioid tapering) attended. Discussions were facilitated by members of the study team (HS, DC, JS and SE) and included, intervention structure and design, content (topics to cover which would potentially increase motivation and confidence to taper opioids), length of programme, where the intervention should be delivered, support during opioid tapering (including frequency of contact with healthcare professionals) and delivery of the intervention (who should deliver the intervention) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). In addition to this, two lay advisors who were part of the I-WOTCH study recruited via Universities/User Teaching<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> gave considerable input into the design of, and training to deliver, the intervention.</p>

                <title>Opioid tapering and behaviour change</title>
                <p>The target behaviour change was defined as the participants engaging in the I-WOTCH intervention: reducing participant opioid use, and implementing non-pharmacological strategies of pain management. The biopsychosocial framework,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Michie’s taxonomy of behaviour change and the COM-B framework for behaviour change (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation) were consulted.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Capability includes psychological capability (eg, can patients engage in the necessary thought processes needed to commit and adhere to the tapering processes?) and physical capability (eg, do participants have the capacity to engage in the tapering?). Psychological capability is broken down to cognitive functioning and executive functioning. To promote cognitive functioning (which includes a range of mental abilities such as learning, problem-solving and attention), we produced handouts of material covered on each day of the programme. This allowed opportunity for participants to recap over the core messages and information in their own time. We also included time for group reflection at the start of each session and summarising discussions at the end of each of the group days (with opportunities for questions). In addition to this, we developed an educational DVD, a mindfulness CD and relaxation CD for each participant (at the time we developed the intervention DVDs and CDs were still in common use). By providing material to take home, we were giving participants an opportunity to revisit and take in the information at their own pace.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Executive functioning includes the capacity to plan and think, explore challenges that may occur (eg, fear of withdrawal symptoms), stay focused on the goal (opioid reduction) and resist temptation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the I-WOTCH intervention, we gave participants opportunity to set goals (through an educational session and support in generating goals related to opioid tapering and their general life). We also encouraged self-reflection to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to tapering and gave further guidance to overcome the perceived barriers in the tailored one to one support sessions with the clinical facilitator. Physical capability refers to whether the participants exposed to the I-WOTCH intervention felt they had the right skills to engage in the tapering of their opioids, this may include management of withdrawal, confidence and having structure and support in place. The I-WOTCH intervention was designed to help participants adapt and put into place lifestyle changes.</p>
                <p>Opportunity is the second component of the COM-B model. For this, we explored factors external to the individual that would promote opioid tapering. For example, physical opportunity includes costs of opioids and travel, access and availability, developing a tapering plan (clear and informative) and enhancing communication between the clinical facilitator and participant through motivational interviewing (MI) during the tapering processes. In relation to social opportunity, we referred to what other factors may impact the decision to taper such as stigma and cultural beliefs.</p>
                <p>Motivation, this refers to both the cognitive motivation and emotional processes to energise and direct the behaviour change of opioid tapering. Reflective processes included exploring perceptions and meaning of chronic pain during the group sessions as well as beliefs about tapering, possible outcomes concerns and self-efficacy. There was opportunity to evaluate and be reflective during the group sessions as well as one to one support. Automatic processes refer to the emotional responses which may occur during the I-WOTCH intervention and these include anxiety, fear, stress and low mood.

                <p>Funding from the Hambelton and Richmond Clinical Commissioning Group for a community pain management service allowed us to test the feasibility of the I-WOTCH intervention. Seven people were trained by the study team to deliver the intervention (three community team clinicians, two nurses and two volunteer patients). Two courses were observed by a member of the study team to evaluate how the course content was delivered and received by both the group facilitators and the group participants (five participants in total). Discussions included, what worked well, what did not work well, and whether participants felt that the aims and objectives of the programme were met and suggestions for changes.</p>
                <p>The second stage of feasibility was part of the pilot phase of the randomised controlled trial and involved facilitator training for the trial. Two groups were delivered in Coventry. From both stages of feasibility testing, feedback was taken on board and adaptions implemented for the training (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>) and course content and structure (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p>

                <p>Overall, the feedback regarding the content of programme was positive. Participants felt that the distraction techniques worked well and helped break up the sessions. They also valued understanding the link between mood and pain and found the case studies useful in helping to motivate them to start reducing their opioids. Facilitators and participants in both pilot phases reported that it was an informative interactive course. Observations showed good delivery and interaction between facilitators and participants, good use of questions and answer sessions and role play. Both facilitators and patients agreed it may have been more interactive had the group been larger.</p>

                <p>The final I-WOTCH intervention (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>) consists of group day 1 (delivered week 1), group day 2 (delivered week 2), a one-to-one consultation with an I-WOTCH trained nurse (also in week 2 and after group day 2), group day 3 (week 3) and then two telephone consultations and a final face-to-face consultation to offer continual support for tapering. Each component of the intervention builds on previous knowledge and experience, and where the one-to-one consultation allows consolidation and tailoring of advice and support for tapering. At the beginning of the intervention, the learning is centred on pain and opioid education, with day 2 of the programme then introducing changes in beliefs and adapting different strategies as reduction of opioids occur. It is at this point tailoring support and MI to action a change in beliefs is promoted through the one-to-one support sessions with an opportunity for further regulation and group cohesion/support on the wider impact of opioid reduction and long term behaviour change (group day 3). The additonal one to one support, self-regulation, reflection and monitoring.</p>

                <p>The one-to-one sessions with a trained I-WOTCH nurse were based on a MI model.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The aims of MI are to enhance behaviour change through a patient-centred framework, where the patient is able to explore personal goals, ambivalence to change and reach self-actualisation in a supportive environment. We trained the I-WOTCH nurses on the five principles of MI: (1) expressing empathy through reflective learning, (2) expressing empathy through reflective listening, (3) developing discrepancy between participant goals or values (related to opioid tapering and pain management) and their current behaviour, avoiding argument and direct confrontation, (4) adjusting to participant resistance to reducing opioid reduction rather than opposing it directly and (5) supporting self-efficacy and optimism. The one-to-one consultations included a review of medication, reflection on the opioid education and group session where case studies and information were presented and exploring any challenges to opioid tapering such as concerns about withdrawal. Nurses were also trained to calculate total opioid daily dose and how to use that to produce a tapering regime according to the I-WOTCH study protocol. Although MI has been widely applied in substance misuse, there are limited data available for its use in opioid cessation for people with chronic non-malignant pain. A 2020 pilot study testing MI to support opioid tapering in post joint arthroplasty surgery found a 62% increase in the rate of participants returning to baseline opioid use after surgery (HR 1.62; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.46; p=0.03).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Opioid tapering conversations maybe challenging and each participant will bring their own experiences and motivation to change; however by using MI as a tool, we encouraged I-WOTCH facilitators to support participants in their tapering.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>

                <title>One-to-one tapering: App</title>
                <p>We adopted an opioid tapering regimen based on the Mayo Clinic experience as it provided some evidence to support the notion that slow tapering is unlikely to be associated with severe withdrawal symptoms and therefore likely to facilitate adherence.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This consisted of a 10% reduction of the original total daily dose every 7 days until a 30% of the original daily dose is reached. This is followed by a weekly decrease by 10% of the remaining dose. The 10% was rounded up to suit prescribing. For the calculation of equianalgesic doses, we used the tables from the Faculty of Pain Medicine.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In order to ensure standardisation of tapering methodology across sites and various opioid preparations, the team developed a tapering App for use by the I-WOTCH trained nurses across sites. The I-WOTCH tapering App was developed by JN and SE working with the University of Warwick's Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) programming team (HA, CM and AW) and provided to the nurses on a handheld tablet. The I-WOTCH tapering App was based on a mathematical algorithm applying the Mayo Clinic tapering regime while accounting for UK commercial preparations. Nurses used the App to generate a participant specific tapering plan, which was synchronised to the I-WOTCH Trial database. The study team at Warwick CTU then logged into the centralised trial management website, printed and posted the tapering plan to the participant for their information and general practitioner for prescribing.</p>
                <p>The I-WOTCH trained nurse entered the total daily dose of the participant-specific opioid preparation into the home screen of the App (eg, 60 mg oxycodone/day). The App algorithm then calculated 10% of the total daily dose and rounded this up or down to suit prescribing. All tablet, capsule or patch denominations of all opioid preparations were tabulated and added to the App to ensure the algorithm not only produced a 10% per week tapering regime but also recommended various prescribing methods (eg, oxycodone 35 mg could be prescribed as 30 and 5 mg or 20, 10 and 5 mg tablets or 10, 10, 10 and 5 mg tablets).</p>
                <p>For patch preparations, we advised participants to taper using their original opioid if 10% was not achievable (eg, 12 μg of fentanyl being the smallest step down), the app algorithm was adjusted to recommend a 20% taper at 2-week intervals. Lowest dosage patch preparations were finally converted to slow release morphine equianalgesic doses and tapered accordingly.</p>

                <title>My opioid manager</title>
                <p>The My Opioid Manager Book and App is the output of a project of Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, University Health Network. In 2010, Dr. Andrea Furlan, a Physician and Scientist at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, developed a tool for physicians prescribing opioids for patients with chronic non-malignant pain. In 2012, the Opioid Manager was converted to an App for smartphones and tablets. The My Opioid Manager Book (and App) is intended to complement the Opioid Manager by providing the same information in a format that can be used by people with chronic pain who are on opioids, or by people who are not on opioids but who might be considering this option to help manage their chronic pain. The goal of My Opioid Manager is preparing the patient for upcoming consultations with their healthcare provider. Some of the topics discussed include: understanding the causes of various types of pains, uses of opioids and the side effects and risks, managing pain by tracking opioid usefilness, and tips on using opioids. For this study, we Anglicised the content in terms of language used as well as the name of medication brands and pictures to be more representative of the UK population.</p>

                <p>Where possible, the I-WOTCH intervention is delivered in the community. Factors to consider when booking a venue included, access to a building, parking and public transport links, a room to accommodate participants and facilitators with chairs and equipment, stairs, lifts, kitchen facilities and room for equipment such as a flipchart, laptop screen, speakers and internet access.</p>

                <p>The delivery–receipt–enactment chain of the I-WOTCH intervention provided a framework for training of facilitators and defining dosage received for participants to promote behaviour change (opioid tapering).<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The I-WOTCH training included two full days for all facilitators (clinical and lay facilitators) and an additional day for clinical facilitators only, to learn the clinical aspects of tapering, opioid specific education, generating tapering plans and MI for the one-to-one consultations. The design of the training package and implementation was adapted to Kolb’s experiential learning cycle (training, experience and reflective observation).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The training days gave all facilitators exposure to the different components of the intervention through education and use of case studies. Trainers were given copies of the I-WOTCH manual and all participant intervention materials. Throughout the training days, facilitators had the opportunity to ask questions and get clarity on any of the topics being covered. At the end of the training, a short assessment was completed by each trainee. If any of the trainees scored below 70%, they were then contacted by phone to go over any areas needing further explanation and offered further training if needed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have used a theory driven approach to developing an intervention for opioid reduction for people with chronic non-malignant pain. Based on the COPERS intervention for the management of pain, the best available empirical evidence at the time, and consultation with lay people, we have developed a manualised intervention and training package. It has been piloted, revised and adapted considering all feedback received. The I-WOTCH intervention has the potential to help people reduce their opioid use and improve their overall quality of life. We are not aware of any other programme of analogous interventions targeting similar populations. Previous non-pharmacological interventions have included mindfulness, cognitive–behavioural therapy and meditation and the use of electroacupuncture which showed no reduction in the number of participants who ceased their opioid use.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The I-WOTCH intervention differs in that it combines group and one to one support, with the mechanisms of change and opioid reduction targeted through peer support, education, case studies, reflection and MI. It is a time and resource intensive intervention, however, having a multicomponent intervention will increase the potential to address the complex psychological, social and physical aspects of opioid tapering. We have developed an opioid tapering App which can be used to calculate individual opioid tapering plans.</p>
              <p>The roll out and scalability of the I-WOTCH training have been considered, a step-by-step manual with materials to set up and deliver the programme was created. The I-WOTCH facilitator training can be delivered to groups of clinicians and ongoing support given throughout the delivery of the intervention. The I-WOTCH trial will allow us to assess: the delivery of the intervention on a large scale, the training of multiple facilitators and managing the group element of the programme.</p>
