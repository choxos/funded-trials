                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is a pre-malignant condition leading to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). Treatment of neoplasia at an early stage is desirable. Combined endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative to surgery for patients with BE-related neoplasia.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We examined prospective data from the UK registry of patients undergoing RFA/EMR for BE-related neoplasia from 2008 to 2013. Before RFA, visible lesions were removed by EMR. Thereafter, patients had RFA 3-monthly until all BE was ablated or cancer developed (endpoints). End of treatment biopsies were recommended at around 12 months from first RFA treatment or when endpoints were reached. Outcomes for clearance of dysplasia (CR-D) and BE (CR-IM) at end of treatment were assessed over two time periods (2008–2010 and 2011–2013). Durability of successful treatment and progression to OAC were also evaluated.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>508 patients have completed treatment. CR-D and CR-IM improved significantly between the former and later time periods, from 77% and 56% to 92% and 83%, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). EMR for visible lesions prior to RFA increased from 48% to 60% (p=0.013). Rescue EMR after RFA decreased from 13% to 2% (p&lt;0.0001). Progression to OAC at 12 months is not significantly different (3.6% vs 2.1%, p=0.51).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Clinical outcomes for BE neoplasia have improved significantly over the past 6 years with improved lesion recognition and aggressive resection of visible lesions before RFA. Despite advances in technique, the rate of cancer progression remains 2–4% at 1 year in these high-risk patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patients with Barrett's oesophagus (BE) are at increased risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). BE arises in response to chronic acid reflux and has a population prevalence in the region of 1.6%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The incidence of OAC continues to rise in the Western world.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> Despite advances in medical care, the prognosis from this disease is poor with a 5-year survival of 7% in England and Wales. Although metaplastic BE confers a low risk of progression to OAC in the region of 0.12–0.40 per year,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> the presence of dysplasia in BE can increase this risk significantly. High-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal cancer (IMC) (collectively referred to as BE-related neoplasia) arising in BE are now generally believed to carry a 40–60% risk of progressing to OAC.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The treatment options for patients with BE-related neoplasia have shifted dramatically over the past few years, from radical surgery with oesophagectomy towards minimally invasive endoscopic therapy.</p>
              <p>For many years the preferred strategy for managing these patients has been either intensive endoscopic surveillance until cancer develops or surgery with oesophagectomy to cure the disease. Indeed, in patients undergoing surgery for HGD, more advanced disease used to be found in 40% of cases,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> although more recently with better endoscopic imaging this has fallen to 17%.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Surgical techniques continue to improve and, although the operative mortality has fallen from as high as 12% in the 1990s,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> it remains not insignificant at the present time. Data from the UK National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit (NOGCA) in 2012 demonstrated an intraoperative mortality of 2–4% for all patients, although for patients undergoing surgery for HGD the surgical mortality is lower at 1%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In addition, the subsequent morbidity can be 40%<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and it usually takes at least 9 months before patients return to a normal quality of life.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Given the morbidity and mortality that may be associated with oesophagectomy, less invasive endoscopic treatment modalities have emerged. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) has recently released guidelines recommending that patients with BE-related neoplasia and disease confined to the mucosa (T1a) should be offered endoscopic therapy as first-line treatment. It should be offered only in specialist high volume centres where the expertise and support is in place to carry out these interventions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>The rationale for endoscopic therapy is that the risk of distant metastasis is low.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Once there is submucosal involvement (T1b disease) this risk is greater (up to 20%), and endoscopic therapy should no longer be considered curative.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Published data from limited randomised studies<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> have been followed up by several larger series from prospective studies showing short-term efficacy and encouraging long-term durability while maintaining a good safety profile for endoscopic therapy with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Real-life data demonstrating the effectiveness of these therapies in large volume registry populations has again shown sustained promise.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref></p>
              <p>The aims of the present study were: (1) to assess the long-term clinical efficacy of RFA/EMR as first-line treatment for over 500 patients with BE-related neoplasia within the UK registry since its inception in 2008; (2) to establish whether, after 6 years of endoscopic therapy, there has been any change in clinical outcomes for these patients by comparing patients treated in the first 3 years of the registry with those treated in the second 3-year period; and (3) to determine factors that may be associated with changes in outcome.</p>

                <title>Inclusion criteria</title>
                <p>All patients were referred for consideration of endoscopic management of dysplastic BE at a specialist centre within the UK registry. Only men and non-pregnant women over the age of 21 years with no contraindications to endoscopy were considered. All patients gave written informed consent and agreed to attend at regular intervals for treatment and surveillance procedures.</p>

              <sec id="s2b">
                <title>Pretreatment staging</title>
                <p>All patients with a diagnosis of BE neoplasia were discussed within specialist multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings at designated centres within the UK Upper GI Cancer Network in compliance with BSG guidelines. Those diagnosed at smaller local hospitals were referred on and restaged at the regional specialist centre performing RFA/EMR.</p>
                <p>The registry captures data on all patients treated regionally at the designated centres. These centres are selected by each regional cancer network and have the necessary training and support infrastructure to carry out safe and effective endoscopic therapy on any patients with BE neoplasia referred to them. Although the registry protocol describes recommended best practice, there is invariably variation in treatment and follow-up intervals depending on local service limitations. The data are collected through an online anonymised database where demographic variables are captured together with treatment-specific information on type of treatment (RFA/EMR), resection histology, outcomes and adverse events. These data capture real-life outcomes of high quality novel endoscopic therapy offered within the confines of challenging service provision.</p>
                <p>At endoscopy the BE segment was mapped and measured using the Prague classification<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> in centimetres. Enhanced endoscopic imaging techniques were used where available, such as narrow band imaging (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany), i-scan (Pentax, Hoya Corporation, Japan) and flexible spectral imaging colour enhancement (FICE) (Fujinon, Saitama, Japan) to help highlight potential dysplastic lesions for assessment and treatment. All investigators used the Paris classification<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> to classify visible lesions. Endoscopic ultrasound was performed at the discretion of the operator if visible lesions were identified to exclude T2 disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy which would preclude endoscopic therapy. The registry protocol mandated that EMR should be carried out for all visible lesions and nodules where identified for therapeutic as well as staging purposes. All nodularity was removed before RFA to the residual flat BE segment. The BE mucosa was sampled using the Seattle 4 quadrant biopsy protocol.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> If invasive cancer was demonstrated, patients were referred via their regional cancer MDT for consideration of radical or palliative therapy.</p>
                <p>A minimum of two endoscopies showing HGD or IMC was mandatory prior to performing RFA. EMR could be carried out at any time. Histology was reviewed by two expert gastrointestinal histopathologists at the individual centres. The modified Vienna classification<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> was used to categorise pathological findings before treatment decisions were made.</p>

                <title>Registry endoscopy protocol</title>
                <p>RFA was commenced with either the circumferential ablation device (HALO 360) or with one of several focal RFA devices for shorter non-circumferential areas of BE (HALO 90, HALO 60, HALO ULTRA, Channel HALO device). The first RFA treatment was deemed the start of the treatment protocol for all patients, even after previous EMR. The treatment protocol is identical to that used in our previous publications and has remained unchanged over the two time periods being analysed here.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The protocol has been designed to mirror the algorithm set out in the first randomised controlled trial on RFA in patients with BE neoplasia with the recommended end of protocol defined as 12 months at which stage patients were said to have completed treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In some patients with very short segments of BE where clearance of disease was achieved sooner than the suggested 12 months, the endpoint was the first endoscopy after the completion of treatment where there was no neoplasia and BE on biopsy.</p>
                <p>The mean number of RFA sessions was 2–3 during the treatment protocol in both time periods.

                <p>Patients free of dysplasia or BE at end of protocol were entered into a post-RFA surveillance protocol and were followed up at 3-month intervals for the first year, 6-month intervals for the second year and annually thereafter. Biopsies were taken from 1 cm below the neo z-line and from the previously treated BE segment using the Seattle protocol in line with the BADCAT recommendation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Endoscopy with enhanced imaging was advocated in all these cases to look for recurrences.</p>
                <p>In cases where there was residual dysplasia at the end of the suggested treatment protocol, further endoscopic therapy was offered with either RFA or EMR depending on the morphology of the remaining neoplasia at endoscopy.</p>
                <p>If biopsy-proven recurrence of dysplasia occurred after initial successful therapy and was amenable to further RFA/EMR, this was offered to the patient. Recurrence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) after successful endoscopic eradication was judged to be a true recurrence only when there was histological confirmation of IM proximal to the neo-oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) (&gt;5 mm) in the previously treated BE segment. This mirrors similar long-term follow-up studies where recurrence was defined as IM in biopsies 3–10 mm above the neo-squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
                <p>Following RFA, the biopsy protocol recommended samples were taken above and below the neo-OGJ. Focal IM distal to the neo-OGJ and from the gastric cardia was not deemed to be true recurrence or criteria for retreatment. The presence of IM in the gastric cardia or at the GOJ is a common pathological finding at endoscopy and can occur in 5–18% of the normal population.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> There is evidence that individuals with IM at the cardia or GOJ have a significantly lower cancer risk than patients with BE and therefore, if this was found on follow-up biopsy, it was not re-treated.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p>
                <p>If the patients progressed to invasive disease at any time and were no longer curable with endoscopic therapy, they were referred back to the regional specialist MDT to discuss eligibility for surgery or chemoradiotherapy. For patients who progressed to invasive disease within the 12-month protocol period, data were censored at their last procedure.</p>

                <p>The primary outcomes for the registry are clearance rate (CR) for all dysplasia (CR-D), which was defined as no biopsy-proven residual dysplasia of any grade in the previously treated Barrett's segment. Clearance of all BE (CR-IM) was defined by no evidence of IM on biopsy at end of protocol from their index RFA treatment. In addition, progression to invasive cancer and overall cancer risk were observed in all patients in the registry. Long-term outcomes and durability for reversal of dysplasia for those with a favourable outcome at end of protocol were also assessed. Clinical outcomes, patient demographics and treatment trends were then analysed and compared between those who started treatment in 2008–2010 and those enrolled in 2011–2013.</p>

                <p>Between 2008 and 2013 a total of 920 patients were treated in the UK registry at 25 centres nationwide. Of these, 508 have now completed treatment (266 patients in 2008–2010 and 242 patients in 2011–2013). Demographic data are shown in <xref rid="GUTJNL2014308501TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. There was no significant difference between the two time periods with regard to patient age, number of RFA treatment sessions or baseline length of BE being treated. Baseline histology was not significantly different in both groups between the two time periods. The majority of patients (overall 73%) were treated for HGD with the remainder being treated for IMC, apart from 3% who were treated for low-grade dysplasia. This has not changed over the 6-year period.</p>

Furthermore, the use of EMR prior to RFA increased to 60% (p=0.016). Conversely, the requirement for rescue EMR after the start of RFA treatment was reduced from 13% to only 2% (p&lt;0.0001). In 2011–2013 the progression to invasive cancer at 12 months was 2.1% and this did not change (p=0.51). For this group, the KM calculated cancer risk at almost 34 months was 3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GUTJNL2014308501F3">figure 3</xref>).

                <p>The logistic regression model found that the previously significant influence of age, initial length of BE and rescue EMR on achieving CR-D did not remain in this period. No other variables were found to influence outcomes significantly.</p>
                <p>When the logistic regression model was applied to the entire dataset for 2008–2013, increasing age (OR 1.316, 95% CI 0.685 to 2.529), prior EMR (OR 1.358, 95% CI 0.776 to 2.337) and shorter lengths of BE at baseline (OR 1.103, 95% CI 1.023 to 1.190) were more likely to achieve CR-D.

              <p>There is now consensus that first-line treatment for mucosal neoplasia arising in BE should be endoscopic therapy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Following the first randomised controlled trial demonstrating efficacy and safety of RFA in carefully selected patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and HGD,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> there have been numerous further large-volume multicentre prospective series demonstrating similar rates of efficacy worldwide.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Surgical outcomes for those undergoing oesophagectomy have also improved and, for those with more advanced neoplasia infiltrating the submucosa and beyond, this should be considered if there is no distant spread. Recent guidelines from the BSG endorse this management.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>Our data demonstrate that clinical outcomes for patients with mucosal BE neoplasia undergoing endoscopic therapy have improved since 2008. Furthermore, the practice of EMR being more widely used prior to initiating RFA may explain the improved outcomes. The manner in which the registry data are collated does not capture the extent of EMR before RFA and whether this changed over time. One could argue that, if larger areas were resected at baseline in the later time period, this would leave less residual BE which would require fewer RFA treatment sessions. The higher proportion of patients undergoing EMR may therefore account for the observed difference, although the number of RFA sessions did not actually fall in the second time period.</p>
              <p>An alternative explanation from our data is that EMR eradicated the visible and nodular neoplasia, making treatment more successful in the latter time period. In our opinion, lesion recognition and resection are paramount to successful outcomes in patients with BE neoplasia. Visible and nodular lesions are more likely to harbour more advanced neoplasia, so early resection is key to both definitive staging and eradication prior to possible RFA. However, despite the known efficacy of combined RFA and EMR for these patients, treatment can be limited by the ability to find the areas that need to be treated. The accurate detection of neoplasia is an important objective that incorporates both new technologies in endoscopic imaging and continuing understanding of recognising abnormalities of the mucosa and microvasculature by the endoscopist.</p>
              <p>Endoscopic imaging has dramatically improved over the past 5 years, allowing endoscopists to assess mucosal anomalies in detail and enabling accurate sampling of suspected areas of neoplasia and direct therapy. White light endoscopy alone, with random sampling of the tubular oesosphagus, can often overlook lesions that require resection. High-resolution video endoscopes with high-quality charge-coupled device chips (up to 1.2 million pixels) allow inspection of minute details of the mucosal and vascular architecture that were not readily visible with previously used white light endoscopes. High-definition endoscopy with various imaging enhancements is now practised at most high-volume centres performing therapy for BE neoplasia. There are increasing data to support improved diagnostic yield with enhanced imaging. In 2012 Sharma <italic>et al</italic> compared narrow band imaging (NBI) with standard high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) to detect IM and neoplasia in patients undergoing BE assessment and found that neoplasia detection was higher with NBI than with HD-WLE (30% vs 21%, p=0.01).<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Pohl <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> demonstrated that, by targeting biopsies with HD-WLE and image enhancement, the sensitivity and specificity rates for BE neoplasia were 96.7% and 66.5%, respectively.</p>
              <p>The use of chromoendoscopy as an adjunct to enhanced imaging technology and high-definition endoscopy has become more widespread and allows more accurate diagnosis of neoplasia. Several studies have shown that the use of acetic acid in patients with BE can improve neoplasia yield.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
              <p>Improved lesion recognition with advancements in endoscopic technology and training of endoscopists has led to more aggressive and widespread use of EMR prior to RFA. The more widespread use of EMR in the past 3 years of the registry has, in our opinion, led to improved clinical outcomes and can be seen to provide two potential benefits. First, it serves as a larger and deeper biopsy specimen, allowing more precise determination of the depth of tumour penetration than any other method currently available. Most specimens contain significant portions of the submucosa, allowing differentiation of mucosal from submucosal tumours. EMR has been shown to have improved sensitivity over endoscopic ultrasound for differentiating submucosal involvement in patients with BE neoplasia.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Submucosal involvement in patients with visible lesions carries a significant risk of lymph node metastasis at 5 years. Those with neoplasia confined to the superficial 500 μm of the submucosa (T1b, SM1 disease) still have a rate of lymph node metastases of 1–4% at 5 years.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> With increased use of EMR before RFA, patients with submucosal disease can be filtered out and offered surgery rather than further endotherapy with curative intent as they are less likely to have a favourable outcome. Second, it can be performed with curative intent for visible lesions allowing for RFA of the residual flat BE segment. Indeed, EMR has been shown to be very effective alone in the treatment of BE-related neoplasia<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> as well as when combined with RFA. Within the registry the increased use of EMR prior to RFA in the past 3 years has seen a dramatic fall in the need for rescue EMR. One could postulate that the limited use of EMR in the first 3 years of the registry experience meant that more patients needed rescue EMR, and this corresponded to the less impressive clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p>While improved endoscopic imaging and more EMR could explain the improved outcomes, other parameters may have also contributed. These include increased physician awareness, improved disease staging, better patient selection and improved endoscopic skills in this novel area of therapeutics. Over the next few years it is conceivable that long-term outcomes for these high-risk patients may improve further.</p>
              <p>Recent publications have explored predictors of successful RFA treatment and predictors of disease recurrence. Van Vilsteren <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> identified four predictive factors for a poor initial response after circumferential RFA at 3 months. These were active reflux oesophagitis, regeneration of BE over the site of a previous endoscopic resection, pre-existing oesophageal narrowing before RFA and the number of years of neoplasia pre-RFA. Pasricha <italic>et al</italic> showed from the US RFA registry that more advanced pretreatment histology was associated with an increased recurrence rate. They also demonstrated that patients with recurrence were more likely to be older, have longer BE segments, be non-Caucasian, have dysplastic BE before treatment and require more treatment sessions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p>We have shown in our previous data that CR-D was 15% less likely for every 1 cm increment in BE length (OR 1.156; SE 0.048; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.26; p&lt;0.001).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In our current series the BE length was marginally shorter in the later time period (4.7 cm in 2011–2013 vs 6.0 cm in 2008–2010) and may also therefore have been a contributing factor to the improved disease reversal rates observed.</p>
              <p>Overall progression to invasive disease in patients with BE is quoted to be in the region of 0.12–0.40% per annum.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> In our registry data the rate of progression in all patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for BE-related neoplasia fell to 2.1% at 12 months in the past 3 years compared with 3.4% in the initial time period. The durability of cancer-free survival between the two groups does not appear to be significantly different. However, the follow-up periods are different. These patients are biologically at high risk despite endoscopic intervention. It remains to be seen whether the better reversal rates of dysplasia translate into a long-term reduction in cancer incidence.</p>
              <p>Combined RFA and EMR for carefully selected patients with BE neoplasia is now an established alternative to more invasive surgery. Most importantly, as experience accumulates over time with improved endoscopic imaging and therapeutic skill levels, the clinical outcome for these patients continues to improve. While the advantages of a less invasive approach to treatment for BE neoplasia are appealing, less obvious is the anxiety to the patient that comes with the need for repeated endoscopic interventions compared with surgery. Surgical resection remains a viable option for those with disease extending beyond the mucosa and may also remain appropriate for those with early disease who choose not to have multiple endoscopies.</p>
