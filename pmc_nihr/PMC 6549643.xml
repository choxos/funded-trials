                  <p>Replacing meat with alternative plant-based product is a randomised controlled trial comparing a behavioural intervention to reduce meat consumption with a no intervention control condition. Eligible volunteers will be recruited from the general public through advertisement and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive no intervention or a 4-week intervention comprising the provision of free plant-based meat alternatives, written information on the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat, success stories of people who reduced their meat consumption and recipes. The primary outcome is the change in meat consumption at 4 weeks (T1) from baseline. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include changes in meat consumption at 8 weeks (T2) from baseline and changes from the baseline to both follow-up in other aspects of participants diet, putative psychosocial determinants of eating a low meat diet and of using meat substitutes and biomarkers of health risk, including blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, weight and body composition. Linear models will be employed to explore whether the changes in each of the aforementioned outcomes differ significantly between the control and intervention group. Qualitative interviews on a subsample of participants receiving the intervention will evaluate their experiences of the intervention and help to identify the mechanisms through which the intervention reduced meat consumption or the barriers preventing the intervention to aid this dietary transition.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>While meat is a source of important nutrients and can be part of a healthy diet,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> red and processed meat consumption is also associated with an increased risk of developing some forms of cancer,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> cardiovascular disease<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> and type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9–11</xref> Furthermore, producing meat can negatively affect the natural environment and contribute to anthropogenic global warming,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> which may also detrimentally affect human health.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref> Reducing meat consumption couldhelp to promote public health and protect the natural environment, but a recent report identified ‘a remarkable lack of policies, initiatives or campaigns’ designed to tackle the demand for meat.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This state of inaction is partly due to the scarcity of evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce meat consumption<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–23</xref> warranting more experimental research to develop and evaluate such interventions. The rising availability of alternatives, such as textured vegetable proteins and mycoprotein-based alternatives,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> could help to reduce meat consumption, as these products resemble meat in their gastronomic function, appearance and preparation. Nevertheless, uptake of meat alternatives remains low in many developed countries,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–27</xref> which might partly be due to a lack of familiarity with these foods.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 28 29</xref> Interventions increasing people’s familiarity with meat alternatives could, therefore, help to overcome this barrier and, in turn, reduce meat consumption. A recent systematic review of experimental studies concluded that interventions that supplied plant-based alternatives were associated with reductions in meat consumption during, and several weeks after, the interventions.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Nevertheless, this evidence is based on small uncontrolled pre–post intervention studies<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> and more systematic evaluations of the behavioural impact of such interventions is warranted. Additionally, there is currently no evidence from randomised trials on the psychosocial and health consequences of interventions aiming at reducing meat consumption through the replacement with meat alternatives.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary aim of the replacing meat with alternative plant-based products (RE-MAP) trial is to examine the effectiveness of a behavioural intervention to reduce meat consumption compared with a no intervention control condition. Additionally, this study will evaluate the impact of the intervention on the consumption of other food groups, the nutritional composition of participants’ diets, the putative psychosocial determinants of eating a low meat diet and of using plant-based meat alternatives and on biological markers of health risk, including blood lipid profiles, blood pressure, weight and body composition. This study also aims to qualitatively investigate participants’ experiences of the intervention, the mechanisms through which the intervention reduced meat consumption, and/or the barriers preventing the intervention to aid this dietary transition.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>The Re-MAP study will employ a two-arm parallel group individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a 4-week behavioural intervention to reduce meat consumption. The primary endpoint is defined as the change in average daily meat consumption at 4 weeks form baseline, assessed through self-reported 7 days food diaries.

During this appointment, an appropriately trained member of the research team will seek written informed consent (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary file 1</xref>), witnessing this by means of dated signature. After gaining informed consent, the enrolling member of the research team will set up participants’ online food diaries to include six possible meal entries per day (breakfast, mid-morning, lunch, mid-afternoon, dinner and postdinner) and to allow the research team to remotely access participants’ food diaries by means of a password. The recruiting member of the research team will also train participants in how to appropriately use the online food diaries and estimate portion sizes.</p>

                <p>Due to lack of research studies directly comparable to ours, pragmatic considerations have guided the decision to terminate recruitment once a sample of at least 100 volunteers has completed the 4 weeks follow-up. A power analysis based on this pragmatically selected sample size suggests that 100 participants completing the primary outcome will allow detection of a medium effect size of d=0.6 with a power of 1-beta=0.84 and a two-tailed alpha criterion of 0.05.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Participants’ group allocation will be based on a computer-generated randomisation sequence, produced by an independent statistician. The randomisation sequence was designed to individually allocate participants to the intervention or control condition in a 1:1 ratio and to achieve a proportional gender balance in the two conditions through blocking and stratification by sex. The research team is blinded to the randomisation sequence and to its block sizes and sequence. Allocation will be revealed to the researcher performing the randomisation only after the first food diary has been returned. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants and some members of the research team cannot be blind to participants’ group allocation. The members of the research team analysing the food diaries will be blind to the group allocation. Due to the nature of the outcomes, the risk of investigator bias will be low. To address the risk of social desirability bias in participants’ reporting of foods intake and questionnaire responses, participants will be reminded during the enrolment visit and before each questionnaire that there are no right or wrong answers.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Re-MAP is a 4-week behavioural intervention, which aims to reduce meat consumption, defined as non-seafood meat products, among regular meat eaters. Following an analysis of the target behaviour, that is, a reduction in meat consumption, we included five psychosocial variables as the intervention’s targets: attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective social norms of eating a low meat diet, as well as attachment to meat, and eating identities (eg, ‘meat eater’ or ‘vegetarian’). We then selected four intervention functions from the Behaviour Change Wheel<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> with the aim of influencing these psychosocial variables<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>: environmental restructuring enacted through providing meat alternatives for 4 weeks,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> training enacted through recipes,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> education enacted through infographics on the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat, and<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> social modelling enacted through written vignettes outlining the story of people who reduced their meat consumption. These success stories were developed following an online patient and public involvement (PPI) activity. This PPI activity involved asking people who consciously reduced their consumption of meat to share their motives to do so, their strategies to enact this dietary transition, and the way they overcame the challenges associated with this transition. A logic model of the intervention is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p>

Participants will be asked to select enough meat alternatives to have a meat-free product available on every occasion on which they would normally have meat for 2 weeks. Participants will be free to order enough foods to cater for themselves and other members of their household, if they wished to do so. The meat alternatives will be delivered to participants’ homes by a food retailer on up to two occasions over the intervention month: the first delivery will be scheduled immediately after participants are allocated to the intervention condition. The second delivery will be scheduled 2 weeks after the randomisation for participants who wish to top up their stock of meat alternatives. <break/>Training: A printed booklet containing 11 illustrated recipes of meat alternatives will be delivered immediately after participants are allocated to the intervention condition. These recipes will incorporate some of the meat alternatives used as part of this study. A second cookbook predominantly reporting on more general meat-free recipes (ie, not focussing on meat alternatives) will be provided during the fourth intervention week. All participants received the same recipes. <break/>Education: Participants will receive eight printed pages of illustrated information on the health (four pages) and environmental implications(four pages) of eating less meat and two introduction pages and references delivered per post to their home over the course of the intervention month. The infographics were developed using publicly available information from peer-reviewed literature and relevant environmental or health organisations (eg, cancer research UK). Immediately after being allocated to the intervention condition, participants will receive an illustrated binder, which they will use to collect the information leaflets. The binder will include two pages of introductory information and the sources from which the information was drawn. <break/>Success stories: Participants will receive three illustrated success stories vignettes delivered per post to their home during the last intervention week. The success stories will cover a range of different demographics (sex and age), different motives for eating less meat, and different strategies to transition to lower meat diets. The narratives will be about eating less meat rather than about ceasing to eat meat entirely. Participants will also receive a sheet on which they could report their own success story if they wish to do so. Participants will be asked to add this information to their illustrated binder.</td>

We invited five meat eaters and five meat reducers to attend the discussion group, aiming to include people representing the target population of the intervention as well as people that successfully reduced their meat consumption. Public contributors were recruited using an established mailing list.

Our main analysis will employ unadjusted models and only include data from participants completing the relevant follow-up. Sensitivity analysis will be performed with a baseline observation carried forward assumption for missing data and adjusting for baseline variables. The intervention effect will be reported with 95% CI and p values. A two-tailed criterion p value of alpha=0.05 will be used to assess the statistical significance of the results. The same procedure will be employed to assess whether changes in the other prespecified dietary, nutritional, psychosocial and biophysical outcomes between the baseline and both follow-up differ significantly between the control and the intervention group. Detailed main, subgroup and sensitivity analyses plans will be finalised before conducting any specific outcome analysis. No interim analysis is planned.</p>

                <title>Qualitative study</title>
                <p>After the 8-week follow-up, a subsample of participants receiving the intervention will be invited to take part in a semistructured interview. This qualitative study aims to understand participants’ experiences of the intervention, the mechanisms through which the intervention helped reducing meat consumption or the barriers preventing the intervention to aid this transition. The semistructured interviews will follow a discussion guide while also remaining sensitive to unsolicited themes. The interview will set the context by asking participants to elaborate on their motivation to volunteer for the trial and on their thoughts and feelings towards reducing meat consumption prior to enrolling into the study. Participants will then be encouraged to elaborate on the mechanisms through which they felt that the intervention helped them eat less meat or the barriers preventing the intervention to do so. In doing so, participants will be prompted to think about the intervention in its entirety as well as about each individual intervention component. Participants will be encouraged to elaborate on their perceived ability and motivation to maintain a lower consumption of meat after the intervention period and beyond the context of the study. Whenever possible we will use open questions to encourage participants to elaborate on their thoughts and feelings freely and in depth. We aim to avoid questions of evaluative nature to minimise the risk of social desirability bias. We anticipate interviewing 20 participants, however, sampling will be extended should new themes emerge during the interviewing process. We will employ a purposeful sampling technique aiming to achieve a sex balance. Participants will be free to decide whether or not to be interviewed. No additional compensation will be offered to participants agreeing to be interviewed. Qualitative interviews will be conducted in person and transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions will be analysed using NVivo and employing a data-driven thematic analysis to identify codes and to group these codes into broader themes.</p>
