                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There has been a recent steep growth in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) use for musculoskeletal conditions, but findings from high quality clinical trial data are lacking in the literature. Here, we describe the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the Platelet-rich plasma in Achilles Tendon Healing 2 (PATH-2) trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">PATH-2 is a pragmatic, parallel-group, multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, superiority trial. The study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute Achilles tendon rupture in terms of muscle-tendon function. Patients are identified in the orthopaedic/trauma outpatient clinic. The primary outcome is muscle-tendon work capacity from the Heel Rise Endurance Test result, expressed as the Limb Symmetry Index (work, in joules), at 24 weeks post randomisation. Multivariate linear regression adjusting for the stratification factors (centre and age) and additional prognostic factors will be used to investigate the adjusted effect of the intervention. The analysis will be by modified intention-to-treat. Sensitivity analysis will assess the internal validity of the trial results by performing a per-protocol analysis. Safety will be summarised by treatment arm for all patients who started treatment. Secondary patient-reported outcome measures will be analysed using linear mixed effects models to allow all data collected at all follow-up points to be considered. Missing data will be summarised and reported by treatment arm. Missing data imputation will be performed, if appropriate.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The PATH-2 trial will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT statement. This SAP publication will avoid bias arising from prior knowledge of the study results. Any changes or deviations from the current SAP will be described and justified in the final report.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Despite the lack of high quality clinical trial data, there has been a recent steep growth in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) use for musculoskeletal conditions given it is of relatively low cost and minimally invasive. In 2015, the European PRP market was valued at over US$ 35 million, and is projected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of more than 6% between 2016 and 2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is also empirical evidence that PRP injections are being introduced in National Health Service (NHS) clinical practice, as evidenced by the increasing appearance in the media, for its potential application in the treatment of traumatic musculoskeletal injury.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Without evidence of efficacy, the consequences of this increased use range from the NHS incurring extra costs for a treatment with unproven clinical effects to the non-deployment of an effective autologous intervention. A recent meta-analysis of PRP for orthopaedic conditions stated the need for adequately powered studies to investigate the effect of PRP using disease-specific and patient-important outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is therefore a pressing need to undertake an adequately powered and robustly designed study before the use of PRP becomes widely adopted.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Here, we describe the details of the statistical analysis plan for the Platelet-rich plasma in Achilles Tendon Healing 2 (PATH-2) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par21">PATH-2 is a pragmatic, parallel-group, multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial. The study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PRP in acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) recovery in terms of muscle-tendon function. The PATH-2 study is taking place in 18 NHS hospitals across the UK. Patients are identified in the orthopaedic/trauma outpatient clinic, usually following an emergency hospital attendance for an ATR. Two sub-studies are embedded within the main study to investigate the mechanism of PRP in tendon healing. Additional details on the PATH-2 study design can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

                <title>Trial objectives and endpoints</title>
                <p id="Par22">The primary outcome is muscle-tendon function, as estimated by the limb symmetry index (LSI), a measure obtained with the Heel Rise Endurance Test (HRET), which is a validated objective assessment of calf-muscle work capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The HRET involves the participant standing on one leg, and raising and lowering the heel repeatedly until fatigued. The uninjured leg is tested first. Data from the movements are obtained using a computer-controlled linear encoder. The linear encoder measures the height of each heel rise executed and this information is used in conjunction with the participant’s body weight to calculate the work performed during the test. The work during the HRET is measured for each lower limb in joules (J). The performance of each limb is then used to generate the LSI according to the following formula:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par28">A total number of 214 patients (107 per arm) will provide 90% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.5 in the LSI measured at 24 weeks post treatment, with 5% (two-sided) significance and allowing 20% losses to follow-up. This is based on data from the non-surgical arm of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], where a clinically important difference of 10% with a standard deviation (SD) of 20 was observed. This sample size will also provide 90% power and 5% (two-sided) significance to detect a standardised effect size of 0.5 in the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score (ATRS; patient reported outcome) between the two intervention groups, based on a difference of 11 and an SD of 21.4.</p>
                <p id="Par29">However, this sample calculation was inflated as a result of a pre-specified blinded check of the assumptions for the primary outcome variability, which took place approximately halfway through recruitment using the overall population data (total sample, rather than intervention groups separately), as recommended by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). As of June 2017, approximately half of the patients had reached their primary end-point and recruitment was still ongoing. Using cleaned and validated data from 75 patients, the observed SD was 24. Based on this observed SD of 24 (being aware that this could go up or down with the addition of further patient data), the sample size was recalculated.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Therefore, based on a minimum of 80% power, and allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 226 patients would be required to identify a clinically important difference of 10% with an SD of 24. The DSMC advised us during this process, and it was decided that the recruitment should overshoot to a minimum of 230 patients (to account for further minimal fluctuations on sample size assumptions) as a feasible target in the remaining timelines of the trial. This approach was supported by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par31">Patients are identified in the outpatient trauma/orthopaedic clinic. Information about the study is given to suitable patients who are willing to participate, as well as an invitation to further discussion with a member of the research team so they have the opportunity to ask questions.

                <title>Initial and current randomisation scheme</title>
                <p id="Par32">After informed consent and baseline measurement have been completed, participants are randomly assigned to either PRP injection or imitation injection via a central computer-based allocation randomisation system provided by OCTRU, in a 1:1 allocation ratio, using undisclosed variable permuted block sizes with stratification by recruiting site and age group (&lt; 55, ≥ 55 years).<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par33">Until 16 April 2016, using variable blocks of undisclosed bock size stratified by study site. At this time, 43 patients were randomised.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">From 17 April 2016, using minimisation, stratified using study site and age group, with a probabilistic element of 0.8 being included to ensure balance at the end of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par35">The reason for changing the original randomisation scheme was that, during a routine monitoring of the randomisation system, it was discovered that the online system was incorrectly taking information from the age group field prior to it being populated. This led to the age strata not being considered and a slight imbalance of treatment allocations in the different age group strata.</p>
                <p id="Par36">To allow randomisation recovering from this imbalance, the randomisation system was updated to include minimisation (using site and age group entered manually to the system).</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p id="Par37">Participants should remain blind to allocation throughout the study. The study staff involved in treatment delivery are aware of treatment allocation due to the nature of the intervention. Blinded assessors unaware of treatment allocation will carry out study follow-up (including the HRET at 24 weeks). When any hospital notes are updated relating to treatment or General Practitioner letters dictated, it is recorded that an injection was delivered as per the random allocation assigned by the PATH-2 study without specifying the type of injection.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Participants are invited to participate in a secondary 24-month extended follow-up and therefore are not informed of their allocation after the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up. After the extended follow-up is complete, participants may be informed of their treatment allocation by post, text or email if a request is made. The James et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and Bang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] indices, designed to assess whether participants were successfully blinded to the intervention they received, will also be calculated and reported with respective 95% confidence intervals.</p>

                <title>Data collection, quality control and data validation</title>
                <p id="Par39">Baseline data is collected from participants and site personnel via paper case report forms (CRFs), which are then returned to the central trial office by post using a Freepost address (pre-paid). In some cases, CRFs may be collected during a site visit/face-to-face meeting with a member of the local team. Data collection at the 4, 7 and 13 week follow-up points is done by telephone call or during a face-to-face outpatient appointment with responses recorded directly onto the CRFs. Where necessary, a member of the central research team in Oxford carries out telephone follow-up. A postal option of data collection may be used as necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Blood and needle biopsy samples sent for analysis are anonymised at source and only identified using the unique study number and participant initials. Blood samples are stored at the Centre for Translational Inflammation Research at the Birmingham University Research Laboratory, and will be disposed of at the end of the study. Needle biopsy samples for those participants taking part in sub-study 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 16) are stored in the Oxford Musculoskeletal Biobank. Any data provided from the blood sample analysis or biopsy samples analysis are entered into the study database in Oxford. Data will be transferred using appropriate password protected and/or encrypted files.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The HRET data is collected from the participant during a face-to-face visit at 24 weeks. Movement data during the HRET are recorded via the linear encoder linked to a study-dedicated laptop, then transferred to the study-dedicated database in Oxford. A study-specific version of the MuscleLab software (Ergotest Innovation AS, Norway) is used to run and record the HRET data. Since the encoder is a very sensitive device, it records even minimal movements that might not correspond to actual heel rises. To dismiss potential measurement errors, where a participant provides consent, a video is made of the ankle/leg movements associated with the HRET. The video file contains no identifying details; only the unique study number is used. The file is sent to the central coordinating team in Oxford where two members of the study team blinded to treatment allocation independently review them, discounting any invalid repetition included in the HRET data (e.g. minimal movements that do not consist in actual heel rises, but that are captured by the assessment device). To ensure validity of data, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for the two revised measurements before consensus on the number of valid heel rise repetitions is achieved.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The central study office receives the CRFs and the coordinating team carries out appropriate data quality and validation checks. The data is entered into a study-dedicated database developed and maintained by OCTRU using OpenClinica software. To identify manual entry errors, a 10% double entry check of follow-up questionnaires is carried out at regular intervals during the data collection phase of the study. No data will be considered spurious in the analysis since all data will be checked and cleaned before analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par56">If data on the primary outcome is not normally distributed, the first approach will be data transformation (such as logarithm, exponential or other type of transformation). If normality cannot be achieved by data transformation, a non-parametric statistical test (e.g. Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test for testing whether the population medians of the two groups are the same) will be used. In this case, no adjustment will be made.</p>

                <title>Missing data</title>
                <p id="Par57">There are two main categories of missing data for the HRET assessment, namely (1) missing data for specific repetitions of heel rise (values of displacement missing or recorded as zero by the software) and (2) missing data for entire assessments (for one or both legs; derived from missing appointments, refusal or inability to perform the test appropriately, and missing data files). The first approach to handling missing data will be to impute the average (mean or median values, depending on the data distribution; checked for the total population during the blinded analysis) concentric displacement (upwards movement) for missing measurements due to the unlikely event of technical device failure during the conduct of an assessment (first group of missing data). Multiple imputation by chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] may be used to estimate the LSI for those patients with entire files compromised or unavailable for any reason (second group of missing data) and for the prognostic variables, in case of substantial amount of missing data (e.g. &gt; 20% for a single variable). If multiple imputation is used, then this will be regarded as a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. In this case, multiple imputation by chained equations will comprise the same variables included in the fully adjusted model used to investigate the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome (i.e. the stratification and other prognostic factors such as sex, body mass index, smoking status and use of antiplatelet medication), plus an indicator of treatment group and the outcome. This process creates a series of complete datasets (observed + imputed data) in which the analyses described in this document will be performed individually. The regression parameter estimates plus corresponding standard errors obtained from the analyses of each imputed dataset will then be combined using Rubin’s Rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Where missing data imputation is used, imputed values will also be verified using the validation checks described above to ensure the missing values have been imputed within the limits of the data.</p>

For the analyses of the secondary outcomes a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 (5% significance level) will be used to indicate statistical significance and treatment effects reported with 95% confidence intervals.

                <p id="Par61">Linear mixed effects regression models will be used to allow the data collected at all follow-up time-points to be considered and adjusting for pre-injury and baseline scores where applicable. This is a robust procedure capable of dealing with some missing values, either due to missed visits or to a patient leaving the study prematurely. Time elapsed from the intervention to the outcome measurement will be included in the models as a random effect factor, considering that not all patients will have their follow-up assessments at exactly the same time. These analyses will be adjusted for the stratification factors and, if applicable, for the same prognostic factors included in the adjusted analysis of the primary outcome. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals will also be reported. If normality is not observed for any of the continuous secondary outcomes, the first approach will be data transformation. If normality cannot be achieved by data transformation, the same strategy adopted for the primary outcome will be used.</p>

Sensitivity analysis will be performed on a PP basis to examine robustness of conclusions based on the results observed for the ATRS. This will be to investigate different assumptions about departures from randomised policies, as well as to check the validity of multiple imputation assumptions where applicable.</p>

A difference in speed of healing, if evident, will be seen when the tendon is in the recovery phase; the primary outcome measure at 6 months after injury is timed to capture this data. However, restoring the final level of function, sport and work occurs over a longer period following ATR, with an overall recovery time of 2 or more years post injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. If PRP affects the quality of the repaired tendon, we would expect to see this at 2 years post injury. Academic/employment status and physical activity-related data will also be collected at 24 months and exploratory analysis will be performed. These supplementary analyses will be published separately from the main study results.</p>
