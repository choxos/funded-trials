                  <p>Adenomyosis can adversely reduce chances of pregnancy in couples undergoing assisted conception. We aim to evaluate the effect of two different downregulation protocols on the reproductive outcomes in women with moderate and severe adenomyosis undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FTET).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will conduct a two-armed pragmatic randomised clinical trial comparing modified downregulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue for 6 weeks to standard downregulation with GnRH analogue for 1 week prior to FTET. Our primary outcome is clinical pregnancy, defined as a viable intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound at greater than 6 weeks gestation, with other secondary reproductive, neonatal and safety outcomes. We aim to randomise 162 patients over 3 years to achieve 80% power for detecting a 20% difference in the primary outcome at 5% significance.</p>

                  <p>To date there is no consensus on the optimal protocol for management of subfertile women with adenomyosis. Modified downregulation could improve the clinical pregnancy rate by reducing the endometrial inflammatory reaction and/or myometrial contractility and their impact on uterine receptivity in women with moderate and severe adenomyosis of the uterus undergoing FTET. The MODA trial is designed to offer pragmatic, real-life evaluation of the optimal protocol for downregulation for this population during assisted conception treatments. Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific meetings and congresses. Ethical approval was granted by the NHS Research Ethics Committees (19/LO/1567).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adenomyosis is characterised by the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma located within hypertrophic and hyperplastic myometrium, affecting up to 20.9% of women at reproductive age.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Recent advances in ultrasound and MRI technology have facilitated the diagnosis of adenomyosis with a reported accuracy of up to 81% using two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Two meta-analyses have suggested that women with adenomyosis have lower implantation, pregnancy and live birth rates with higher miscarriage rates, thus its impact on fertility is marked.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> This impact is directly linked to the severity of the adenomyosis with rate of clinical pregnancy decreasing from 42.7% (95% CI 37.1% to 48.3%) in women with no adenomyosis on ultrasound to 22.9% (95% CI 13.4% to 32.6%) for those with four features and 13.0% (95% CI 2.2% to 23.9%) for those with all seven features.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Several theories have been suggested to explain its negative impact on fertility, such as abnormal uterotubal transport due to anatomical distortion of the uterine cavity and disturbed uterine peristalsis.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Ultrastructural myometrial abnormalities may cause hyperperistalsis and increase the intrauterine pressure due to a disturbance in normal myocyte contractility with subsequent loss of normal rhythmic contraction.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Several molecular alterations have also been noted in the eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis. These include increased levels of inflammatory markers, increased oxidative stress, reduced expression of implantation markers, lack of expression of adhesion molecules and changes in the sex steroid hormone pathway, resulting in impaired implantation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for prolonged periods could reduce the amount of inflammatory reaction in the eutopic endometrium of women with adenomyosis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It is also possible that prolonged downregulation may improve abnormal uterine peristalsis seen in women with adenomyosis. A study examining the impact of prolonged downregulation in women with adenomyosis undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment first showed increased clinical pregnancy rates a decade ago.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> More recently, three large retrospective studies suggest a significant benefit in the reproductive outcomes of women with adenomyosis following prolonged downregulation prior to frozen embryo transfer, in contrast to one retrospective analysis that showed an adverse impact of prolonged downregulation on pregnancy rates, and another retrospective study that showed no difference in outcomes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref> The true benefit of prolonged versus standard downregulation in this population remains imprecise.</p>

                <p>Enrolment of participants will involve coordinated registration and allocation of participant trial numbers by the trial coordinator. All participants will be asked by a member of the research team to complete a written consent at least 24 hours after providing the trial’s participant information sheet (see model consent form in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file</xref>). All consents will be recorded in the medical notes including signatures from both partners undergoing the IVF/ICSI procedure. A member of the research team will explain that participants are under no obligation to enter the trial and that they can withdraw at any time during the trial, without having to give a reason. No trial procedures will be conducted prior to the participant giving consent by signing the consent form.</p>

                <p>Once consent has been granted a transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) will be performed by a member of the research team. The scan will be performed in a systematic fashion starting from the uterus in longitudinal plane with measurement of the endometrial thickness. The probe is then rotated to the transverse plane and the uterus scanned from the cervix to the fundus with any uterine pathologies noted and measured in three orthogonal planes. A 3D ultrasound volume is then obtained and saved starting with the uterus in longitudinal view making sure to include all uterine tissue in the 3D volume sweep. Any congenital or acquired uterine anomalies are diagnosed according to published diagnostic criteria. Adenomyosis is diagnosed according to a standardised diagnostic criteria<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and graded for severity according to the number of adenomyosis features present (assign a score of 1 for each of: (1) asymmetrical myometrial thickening, (2) parallel shadowing, (3) myometrial cysts, (4) irregular endometrial–myometrial junction, (5) linear striations, (6) hyperechoic islands, (7) adenomyoma). Patients with four or more features of adenomyosis are considered to have moderate or severe adenomyosis.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Videosonography for a period of 4 minutes will be performed and recorded to assess uterine peristalsis. The operator will then sweep to the adnexae, starting from the left to identify and measure the ovaries in three orthogonal planes and document the antral follicle count. Each ovary is examined for the presence of cysts as well as for mobility and tenderness by gentle pressure with the ultrasound probe. Once the ovaries have been assessed the operator examines the pouch of Douglas for the presence of free fluid as well as any evidence of endometriosis such as obliteration, endometriotic nodules and endometriomas, as previously described.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Once the ultrasound scan is concluded all information is added to the clinical database (REDCap - Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University).</p>
                <p>After the scan and once eligibility is confirmed participants will be asked to confirm if they want to participate in the trial. Those that confirm their consent will proceed with FTET preceded by the downregulation protocol allocated at randomisation. If an eligible participant undergoes a fresh transfer they will be followed through their cycle to determine pregnancy outcome and will be offered the opportunity to participate in MODA for their subsequent FTET.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Women with moderate/severe adenomyosis undergoing assisted conception are known to have a reduced clinical pregnancy rate; there is currently no consensus regarding their treatment and the existing literature is conflicting. Retrospective studies have identified benefit in prolonged downregulation for these patients however these are subject to selection and publication bias and therefore may not offer a realistic assessment of this protocol modification.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Others have reported a reduction in pregnancy rates with prolonged downregulation but again this is retrospective data which may have underestimated the positive effect of the intervention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>One retrospective study showed increased clinical pregnancy rates in women with adenomyosis following GnRH agonist treatment for 2–3 months prior to frozen embryo transfer, whereas no benefit was noted in women who had prolonged downregulation prior to fresh embryo transfer.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The hyperoestrogenic state following controlled ovarian stimulation in a fresh embryo transfer cycle is postulated to diminish the effect of GnRH agonist pretreatment. A higher dose and longer duration of gonadotrophins were required during controlled ovarian stimulation to overcome the prolonged downregulation effect.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Another retrospective study in which women with adenomyosis received 3 months downregulation with GnRH analogue prior to fresh embryo transfer found a reduction in clinical pregnancy rates, with a significantly lower endometrial thickness in the pretreatment group that did not fall pregnant.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, prolonged downregulation for a less extended duration of 6 weeks prior to FTET has previously been shown to improved clinical pregnancy rates, without any negative effects on endometrial preparation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We are therefore evaluating a similar protocol in the MODA trial.</p>
              <p>Coexisting undiagnosed endometriosis is a substantial confounding factor, as not all patients with adenomyosis undergo surgical diagnostic procedures. There is also potential for variability in the diagnosis of adenomyosis by ultrasound. In the MODA trial we have only included fertility centres with an expert ultrasound operator and will review ultrasound images to ensure quality of diagnosis. This approach should also reduce the risk of undiagnosed moderate or severe endometriosis as this can be reliably diagnosed on transvaginal ultrasound. Randomisation should ensure confounding due to endometriosis coexistence is balanced. We will report the frequency of ultrasound diagnosed endometriosis in the control and treatment arm of the study.</p>
              <p>There is an urgent need to prospectively evaluate prolonged downregulation as an option for couples with adenomyosis undergoing assisted conception both to confirm or refute the validity of this approach. The MODA trial is designed to offer pragmatic, real-life evaluation of the optimal use of downregulation in affected women. Our modified downregulation protocol is a practical, simple and readily available treatment option that could help women with adenomyosis to improve their chances of conception.</p>
