                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Guidelines recommend that clinicians should make brief opportunistic behavioural interventions to patients who are obese to increase the uptake of effective weight loss programmes. The objective was to assess the effect of this policy on socioeconomic equity.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">One thousand eight hundred eighty-two consecutively attending patients with obesity and who were not seeking support for weight loss from their GP were enrolled in a trial. Towards the end of each consultation, GPs randomly assigned participants to one of two 30-s interventions. In the active intervention (support arm), the GP offered referral to a weight management group. In the control intervention (advice arm), the GP advised the patient that their health would benefit from weight loss. Agreement to attend a behavioural weight loss programme, attendance at the programme and weight loss at 12âmonths were analysed by socioeconomic status, measured by postcode using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Mean weight loss was 2.43âkg (sd 6.49) in the support group and 1.04âkg (sd 5.50) for the advice only group, but these effects were moderated by IMD (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.039 for the interaction). In the support arm, weight loss was greater in higher socioeconomic groups. Participants from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more likely to accept the offer and equally likely to attend a weight loss referral but attended fewer sessions. Adjusting for these sequentially reduced the gradient for the association of socioeconomic status with weight loss from +â0.035 to ââ0.001âkg/IMD point. In the advice only arm, 10% took effective action to promote weight loss. The decision to seek support for weight loss outside of the trial did not differ by socioeconomic status, but weight loss among deprived participants who used external support was greater than among more affluent participants (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.025).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Participantsâ responses to GPsâ brief opportunistic interventions to promote weight loss differed by socioeconomic status and trial arm. In the support arm, more deprived people lost less weight because they attended fewer sessions at the programme. In the advice arm, more deprived people who sought and paid for support for weight loss themselves lost more weight than more affluent people who sought support.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">The history of economic development shows that, broadly speaking, the prevalence of obesity rises with national wealth very probably because, as populations shift from rural to urban areas, the variety and amount of food available increases and manual tasks are replaced by automation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Obesity emerges first in the most affluent parts of society, but when a large proportion of the population become obese, a new trend is evident in which the most deprived have the highest prevalence of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This gradient contributes to the observed inequities in economic productivity, health outcomes and life expectancy. This situation calls for a wide-ranging and comprehensive policy response, designed to bring proportionally greater benefits to the most deprived groups. Part of the response will require interventions to treat established obesity if we are to avoid an unsustainable toll of morbidity and mortality in the next 50âyears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, there are concerns that individually focused interventions, particularly those that rely on high levels of individual voluntary effort and organisation, termed agency, may exacerbate inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have established that modest weight loss can prevent weight-related morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although implementation in routine practice has proved challenging, RCTs have established that widely available commercially provided weight loss programmes can achieve greater weight loss and health benefits than self-management approaches, are cost-effective and can be cost-saving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the UK, for example, some local areas can provide free referrals to community weight loss groups, usually for 12âweeks, as part of healthcare provision. Despite this, those from more deprived areas are less likely to use these community group weight loss programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], even where participation is offered at no cost as part of a trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">It has been hypothesised that interventions such as these weight loss programmes which require a high level of agency to enact may widen social inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Agency refers to motivation, organisation and capacity including material resources to enact behavioural responses. Social inequalities in the uptake of weight loss programmes, even when offered by GPs at no cost to the participant, all rely on agency to obtain health benefits. Inequalities in the response to intervention may arise at multiple stages of the pathway, including doctors offering a referral, patientsâ acceptance of the referral, attendance at the programme, continued engagement with the programme and ability to enact the advice of the programme and continued attendance at it, all of which may affect eventual weight loss. Hence, despite being an effective weight management strategy at a population level, these weight loss programmes may also serve to increase inequalities between social groups.</p>
              <p id="Par9">We published an RCT showing that when GPs opportunistically endorse, offer and facilitate referral of unselected patients who were obese to a commercial weight management programme, this is well-received and results in greater weight loss at 1Â year than when GPs advised weight loss alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this pre-planned but exploratory subgroup analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we examine whether the outcome differed by deprivation and, if so, where in the pathway this occurred in both the support arm, where GPs suggested a referral, and the advice arm, where they simply advised weight loss would be beneficial. Both arms arguably require agency on the part of the participant to engage with and enact the advice offered in order to lose weight and improve health.</p>

In brief, this study was a parallel, two-arm, randomised trial of a brief intervention for obesity conducted in primary care. Researchers screened consecutively attending patients waiting to see 137 different GPs across the south of England. We sought to enrol anyone who had a BMIââ¥â25âkg/m<sup>2</sup> if they were Asian or â¥â30âkg/m<sup>2</sup> from all other ethnic groups, and 83% of such people agreed. We excluded people already attending weight loss programmes or those attending their GP for the purposes of weight loss support.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Participants had their consultation with the GP as normal and towards the end were randomised to one of two opportunistic brief behavioural interventions. In the âsupportâ arm, GPs endorsed, offered and facilitated a referral to one of two community weight management services, which were offered free to participants for 12âweeks. These services were provided commercially by Slimming World and Rosemary Conley. In the âadviceâ (control) arm, GPs advised participants to lose weight to benefit their health. The aim was for GPs to deliver both interventions within 30âs. The trial had approval from the NHS Research Ethics Service and is registered ISRCTN: 26563137.</p>

                <p id="Par12">The independent variable was socioeconomic status, measured here by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score. IMD score is calculated based on census data for each lower level super output area (LSOA) that contains the participantâs postcode. Each area has an average of 1500 residents. The deprivation score is based on income, employment, education, health, crime, housing and living environment of people within that area. Each area is given a score from 1 to 100. A higher IMD score indicates higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation.</p>

                <p id="Par13">For this analysis, we used the primary outcome of the trial, weight change between baseline and 12âmonths, and incorporated self-reported weight if the measured weight was missing. We weighed 1419 (75%) participants at 12âmonths and had self-reported weight on an additional 141 (7%). Otherwise, we imputed data using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method for people whose weight was completely missing at 12âmonths (<italic>n</italic>â=â320, 17%).</p>
                <p id="Par14">Researchers recorded whether participants accepted a referral at the time of the initial consultation, and therefore, there were no missing data. We obtained data from Slimming World on attendance for the majority of those accepting referrals (94%). Data was collected through routine systems and used to measure whether participants attended and the number of sessions attended for all participants that attended at least once.</p>
                <p id="Par15">We collected data by telephone or in-person interview on whether participants took action to lose weight at 3 and 12âmonths. Effective action was defined as taking action where there is evidence from trials that using that approach will lead to greater weight loss than self-directed weight loss efforts. We classified effective actions as attending a weight loss programme, prescription of orlistat or alli (orlistat bought without prescription), or following a total or partial meal replacement weight loss programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p id="Par34">Socioeconomic deprivation moderated the effect of a brief opportunistic behavioural intervention on weight change at 12-month follow-up. In the support group, less deprived participants lost more weight, while in the advice group, more deprived participants lost more weight. In the support group, socioeconomically deprived participants were more likely to accept the referral but attended fewer sessions than those who were less deprived. Adjusting for the number of attendances accounted for the relationship between deprivation and weight change in the support group. In the advice group, 10% of people took effective action to lose weight (predominantly via attending a commercial weight management programme). The probability of taking effective action did not differ by level of deprivation. However, weight loss among those taking effective action and who lived in deprived localities was much greater than among those taking action who lived in more affluent areas. Thus, more deprived participants were just as likely to take effective action when compared to less deprived participants but achieved greater weight loss by doing so.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par35">The unique feature of this study is that the data come from a trial in which advice to lose weight or the offer of a referral to a weight management programme was given to the large majority of patients consulting a physicianâa true test of opportunistic interventions delivered at scale. We might presume that most patients were not particularly motivated to lose weight, since we excluded patients who were already actively engaged in a programme or seeking help to lose weight from their doctor. It therefore provides the only data of its kind on the impact of opportunistic weight loss interventions on obesity-related inequalities, which current guidelines advocate. A strength of the study is the rate of follow-up data at 12âmonths (75% weighed, with an additional 8% reporting their weight), which is much higher than the typical follow-up rate of weight loss trials at 12âmonths (63%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">A limitation of the study is that, for practical reasons, we mostly recruited general practices within 90âminâ drive of Oxford, UK. As such, most areas were more rural and more affluent than England as a whole. The only large conurbation that we recruited from was Bristol. There was no evidence of a difference in enrolment to the trial by age, gender or BMI, but we could not collect postcode, which we used to assess differences by deprivation score, on people who declined to participate. However, only 17% of potential participants declined to take part, meaning that any bias in the uptake by socioeconomic deprivation is unlikely to have greatly affected the associations we observed. Although we planned this exploratory analysis, we did not base the sample size calculation on the ability to detect associations by socioeconomic deprivation, in common with most trials. Moreover, we did not plan a complementary qualitative investigation to specifically understand the socioeconomic differences we observed. Finally, it should be noted that the IMD score used in the study represents the levels of deprivation based on participantsâ reported postcodes. Thus, IMD indicates the deprivation of the geographical area in which the participants live, rather than the individuals themselves.</p>

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p id="Par37">A previous systematic review considered a range of interventions to promote healthy eating and reported on the effects on the outcome by socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Among studies focused on âpersonâ interventions (i.e. individually based information and education), the results were mixed; eight studies suggested the intervention effect was lower in the more deprived, five found no evidence of a difference and five suggested better outcomes for the more deprived. While the interventions examined in this review differed from the brief interventions we studied, we too observed a mixed picture. In our study, advice to lose weight, but not providing support to do so, was associated with better outcomes in the more deprived populations, primarily because some deprived people paid for support to lose weight and were much more successful than more affluent people who did likewise. However, in the support arm, the GP actively offered their patients a free weight loss programme and booked the patient into the programme without the participant needing to do anything other than agree. This manifestly requires participants to exercise less agency than in the advice arm. Nevertheless, in this arm, people who were more deprived lost less weight than the more affluent. The results do not support the proposal that low agency interventions necessarily widen socioeconomic inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Cross-sectional research suggests that people from more deprived areas are less likely to use community weight management programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, in a trial testing a commercial weight loss programme where people received a letter from their GP encouraging participation which comprised free treatment, people who lived in more deprived areas were less likely to enrol than their more advantaged peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, in the present analysis where the offer of referral was made in person by the GP, we found that patients living in more deprived areas were more likely to accept a referral. Offering the referral within a consultation led to a fourfold higher uptake. This suggests that a direct offer is not only more acceptable overall, but is particularly so to people in more deprived circumstances. In contrast to our findings in the support arm and the advice arm, another investigation of people referred by GPs to a commercial weight loss programme showed no evidence of socioeconomic differences in weight loss outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Taken together, it remains somewhat unclear whether commercial weight loss programmes have equal retention, and weight loss by social group and large-scale evaluations have not reported on this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Implications for research and practice</title>
                <p id="Par39">Although this was a trial-based analysis, the aim was to assess the impact of current health policy in several countries, which advocates clinicians give opportunistic brief interventions to refer people to weight loss programmes. Given the high rate of recruitment into this trial and that GPs received only light-touch training, the trial represents the enactment of current health policy, which is otherwise largely unadopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This is important because obesity is more prevalent in people living in more deprived circumstances, and mass provision of weight loss support is likely to be an important part of an effective public health response to the problem of obesity. Even modest weight loss reduces the incidence of weight-related morbidity and improves cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Ensuring people in more deprived areas are able to benefit from these services is a key component of a system of proportionate universalism to reduce inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Community weight management programmes are an effective intervention with the advantage of an established infrastructure to support mass delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, if the provision of these services is to avoid widening inequalities, careful attention needs to be paid to the rollout of this support.</p>
                <p id="Par40">This analysis shows clearly that more deprived populations will gain greater benefit from in-person offers of support and facilitated access to services, rather than by a letter and likely also, by inference, informal advertising of services, which require a proactive response. Moreover, since most of the inequity arises because of poorer retention in the programmes, attention needs to be paid to the barriers to attendance and greater efforts by the programme providers themselves for their more deprived users. Previous research has explored potential barriers to initial attendance and adherence to community weight management programmes in populations from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Frequently cited barriers have included cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], work commitments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and childcare commitments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, there is a paucity of research into barriers that are specific to individuals from deprived areas. Thus, future research should aim to unpick specific facilitators and barriers in this population.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par41">When GPs actively offer brief opportunistic interventions to unselected patients who are obese, more deprived people seem more likely to accept support but attend less frequently and lose less weight than more affluent patients. However, when GPs offer advice to lose weight, subsequent use of support does not differ by levels of socioeconomic deprivation but weight loss is greater among the more deprived population.</p>

                <p>Slimming World and Rosemary Conley donated free weight loss programmes to support the trial by covering NHS treatment costs but otherwise had no role in the study or the decision to submit the manuscript. PAv and SAJ are investigators on a trial funded by Cambridge Weight Plan. PAv and SAJ have conducted another publicly funded trial where Weight Watchers donated free weight loss sessions to the NHS to support NHS treatment costs and where Weight Watchers paid for additional biochemical analyses. DL and PAv were investigators on a publicly funded trial where Slimming World donated treatment programmes to the NHS in support of NHS treatment costs. PAv has done half a day of consultancy for Weight Watchers and received no personal payment. All other authors declare no competing interests bar the involvement of Slimming World and Rosemary Conley in the trial. None of the investigators received personal payments for these relationships.</p>
