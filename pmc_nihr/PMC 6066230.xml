                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Measuring accurate thresholds in children can be challenging. A typical psychophysical experiment is usually too long to keep children engaged. However, a reduction in the number of trials decreases the precision of the threshold estimate. We evaluated the efficiency of forced-choice paradigms with 2 or 4 alternatives (2-AFC, 4-AFC) in a disparity detection experiment. 4-AFC paradigms are statistically more efficient, but also more cognitively demanding, which might offset their theoretical advantage in young children.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We ran simulations evaluating bias and precision of threshold estimates of 2-AFC and 4-AFC paradigms. In addition, we measured disparity thresholds in 43 children (aged 6 to 17 years) with a 4-AFC paradigm and in 49 children (aged 4 to 17 years) with a 2-AFC paradigm, both using an adaptive weighted one-up one-down staircase.</p>

                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Simulations indicated a similar bias and precision for a 2-AFC paradigm with double the number of trials as a 4-AFC paradigm. On average, estimated threshold of the simulated data was equal to the model threshold, indicating no bias. The precision was improved with an increasing number of trials. Likewise, our data showed a similar bias and precision for a 2-AFC paradigm with 60 trials as for a 4-AFC paradigm with 30 trials. Trials in the 4-AFC paradigm took slightly longer as participants scanned more alternatives. However, the 4-AFC task still ended up faster for a given precision.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Bias and precision were similar in a 4-AFC task compared to a 2-AFC task with double the number of trials. However, a 4-AFC paradigm was more time efficient and is therefore recommended.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Possibly the most fundamental way of characterising a perceptual system is to measure the detection threshold: the minimum signal strength which can be detected. In principle, this can be measured by asking the subject to report whether or not a signal was present in a given stimulus, and defining a threshold as the point where the signal is detected on a specified fraction of trials. However, performance on such yes/no tasks is influenced not only by the detection threshold, but also by the subject’s decision criterion for reporting a signal. In forced-choice tasks a subject is instead asked to report which of several alternative stimuli contained the signal. This produces an estimate of detection threshold unbiased by a decision criterion [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Accordingly, forced-choice tasks are among the most widely-used psychophysical procedures.</p>
              <p>Despite being unbiased by a decision criterion, forced-choice tasks still suffer from other problems. For example, thresholds can be contaminated by response bias [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (temporal or position bias), although the effect of this bias on threshold estimation is negligible [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, a high number of trials is necessary to obtain reliable threshold estimates, resulting in long experiment durations (up to several hours if several thresholds are required) and requiring strong motivation and commitment from the subject. This makes it difficult to obtain reliable thresholds in young children. However, a reduction in the number of trials decreases the precision of the threshold estimate [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>An alternative way to increase precision is to increase the number of alternatives in forced-choice tasks. Although a forced-choice task with 2 alternatives (2-AFC) is probably the most commonly used in the vision research community [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], increasing the number of alternatives reduces the guessing rate and therefore makes every trial more informative. A smaller guessing rate also increases the slope of the psychometric function and improves efficiency of the threshold estimates [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These theoretical advantages increase monotonically with the number of alternatives <italic>m</italic>. However, in reality, there must be a point at which <italic>m</italic> becomes too large to be practical.</p>
              <p>A few studies have looked into directly comparing <italic>m</italic>-AFC tasks. Shelton and Scarrow compared two and three alternatives in an auditory detection task [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although similar threshold estimates were obtained, stability of the threshold estimates was better in the 3-AFC compared to the 2-AFC task. The 3-AFC task also minimized between-subject variability. Leek, Hanna, and Marshall compared two, three, and four interval forced-choice tasks in a simulation study [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The authors concluded four alternatives gave the most accurate results with the least variability. The procedure was also the most efficient. Jäkel and Wichmann also observed that for contrast sensitivity, a 4-AFC task was 3.5 times more efficient (time needed to get smaller confidence intervals) than 2-IFC task, and is the recommended task for naïve observers. Also, in food flavour discrimination, a 4-AFC task was found to be more powerful than a 2-AFC or 3-AFC task [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A quick contrast sensitivity function method also seems to benefit from increasing the number of alternatives: in simulations and in a behavioural experiment Hou et al. showed that a 10-AFC task has the highest efficiency compared to 2, 4, 8 and 16 alternatives [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the previous studies, the subjects were all adults and even the naive observers completed a large number of trials over the course of the experiment (20,000 in [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; 300 in [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Therefore conclusions cannot be generalized to a child population with whom fewer than 100 trials can be obtained. Furthermore, young children (under the age of 11 years or so) have a shorter attention span than adults, especially on tasks with a high cognitive load [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Trials with more alternatives are inherently more complex and may require more time to inspect the possible alternatives, resulting in longer experiment duration than the same number of 2-AFC trials. In children, with limited cognitive and attentional resources, the increased complexity of 4- or higher <italic>m</italic>-AFC trials could outweigh the other known advantages.</p>
              <p>To address this question, in the current study, we use simulations and data from psychophysical experiments with children. We examine whether previous conclusions in adults, that 4-AFC tasks yield more precise threshold estimates than 2-AFC, also hold in young children. In addition, we will investigate time-efficiency of both paradigms, by comparing the total duration of a 2-AFC experiment and a 4-AFC experiment that achieve the same levels of precision of threshold estimates.</p>

              <p>The task used in our experiments, and modelled in our simulations, was a disparity detection task suitable for assessing stereoacuity. Subjects are asked to find a “target” stimulus amongst either 1 or 3 “distractor” stimuli (2-AFC or 4-AFC), presented simultaneously in different spatial locations. The distractor stimuli have uniform binocular disparity, depicting a flat surface, whereas the target stimulus has a disparate square patch which appears to be sticking out in depth.</p>

The right plots show the probability correct as a function of disparity, with the dots being the simulated data and the line the fitted psychometric function to the simulated data. From this fitted psychometric function the threshold value was estimated. After 10000 repeats, the estimated thresholds can be presented in an histogram (C) to show the distribution of likely thresholds that can result from the 4-AFC staircase procedure with this model psychometric function (A). The average of this ditribution can be compared with the model threshold as an indication of bias and precision of the 4-AFC staircase procedure.</p>

                  <p>The standard deviation of threshold estimates for each subject, was determined by simulating the same experiment but using the psychometric function fitted to the subject’s data (of 15–80 trials) as the model function. An experiment was simulated in which probabilities for correct or incorrect answer were derived from that model function. Stimulus levels were chosen according to the staircase rules described above. A logistic function was then fitted to the simulated data to determine a simulated threshold estimate. This process was repeated 10000 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The observed threshold was compared to the distribution of the 10000 simulated thresholds to obtain a standard deviation of threshold estimate. Following Jäkel and Wichmann threshold uncertainty was calculated as the ratio between the simulated standard deviation and the observed threshold (SD/threshold) [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
                  <p>In simulation studies the bias is defined as the difference between the simulated threshold and the true model threshold. In our experimental data, the subject’s true threshold is unknown but our best approximation is the estimated threshold after the maximum number of trials. Therefore, bias and precision of empirical thresholds were estimated by comparing the estimated thresholds after a subset of trials with the estimated threshold after the maximum number of trials (80). Bias is defined as the difference between both and precision is defined as the absolute value of the bias.</p>
                  <p>Last, for each subset of trials the average trial duration and the total experiment duration was calculated.</p>
                  <p>Fitting of psychometric functions in simulations and real data was done in MATLAB R2014a (Mathworks) using the fminsearch function, and statistical analyses were performed in R [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>

Results are plotted for three example trial numbers. Similar results were obtained for the other trial numbers tested. On average, estimated thresholds were very similar to the model thresholds, indicating no bias (open circle symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This was true for all tested model thresholds, trial numbers, and tasks. Precision is reflected in the standard deviation of the bias distribution (filled triangle symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The standard deviation decreased with an increasing number of trials, indicating better precision (compare panels from left to right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Precision was lower with fewer trials (≤ 20 trials) in combination with low model thresholds (left lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This is a result of the staircase procedure. The staircase starts at a disparity of 3 log<sub>10</sub> arcsec and comes down in only small steps of 0.15 log<sub>10</sub> arcsec. This means only few trials around the low model threshold are included in staircases of 20 trials or less. This reduces the precision of the estimate thresholds in these simulations. For any combination of number of trials and model thresholds, precision was always higher in the 4-AFC task than in the 2-AFC task with equal number of trials (compare top left panel with bottom right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Similar levels of bias and precision between 2-AFC and 4-AFC tasks are obtained with double the number of trials in the 2-AFC task than in the 4-AFC task (e.g., compare middle top panel with middle bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g004">Fig 4</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

                <p>In summary, our simulations indicate that overall, bias is close to zero on both tasks independent of number of trials. However, the precision depends strongly both on the number of trials and the true threshold. Precision increases with increasing trial numbers. For all but the lowest thresholds (i.e. good stereoacuity), a 4-AFC task achieves a given precision with half the number of trials as a 2-AFC task. For low thresholds, a 4-AFC task has poorer precision with half the number of trials as a 2-AFC task.</p>

Both decrease with an increasing number of trials, similar to an improvement in precision with increasing number of trials in the Simulation study.</p>
                <p>Because for each subject we estimated thresholds for the first 15, 20, 25, etc. number of trials, the thresholds are not independent of each other and can therefore not be included in the same statistical analysis. We can however compare thresholds resulting from different number of trials collected with different tasks. In the statistical analyses, we focused on comparing 30 trials in the 4-AFC task with 60 trials in the 2-AFC task. Descriptive statistics for all trial numbers can be found in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201366.g008">8</xref>. Limiting ourselves to these trial numbers reduces the chances of a Type I error. The choice of 30 and 60 trials was informed by our simulation results that indicated that (1) trial numbers below 25 have reduced precision with low threshold estimates, (2) bias and precision are similar with double the number of trials in the 2-AFC than in the 4-AFC task, and (3) we needed to minimize the number of trials in working with children. Because test assumptions were met, no subjects were excluded for the subsequent analyses. We did not observe a significant difference between the estimated threshold after controlling for age (ANCOVA: F(2,89) = 0.6289, <italic>p</italic> = .54, mean 2-AFC = 1.69, mean 4-AFC = 1.67), nor its uncertainty (ANCOVA: F(2,89) = 0.0497, <italic>p</italic> = .95, mean 2-AFC = 0.085, mean 4-AFC = 0.086), bias (ANCOVA: F(2,89) = 0.5434, <italic>p</italic> = .58, mean 2-AFC = -0.009, mean 4-AFC = 0.022), or precision (ANCOVA: F(2,89) = 0.5345, <italic>p</italic> = .59, mean 2-AFC = 0.07, mean 4-AFC = 0.09). This suggests that a 4-AFC task with half the number of trials as a 2-AFC task results in similar thresholds, threshold uncertainty, bias, and precision.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the current study, we showed that for children aged around 10 years completing a small number of trials (&lt;100), estimated stereothresholds, uncertainty, bias, and precision are similar in a 4-AFC task compared to a 2-AFC task with double the number of trials. Individual trials on a 4-AFC task do take around 30% longer than trials on a 2-AFC task, but this increase is not enough to offset the advantage of halving the number of trials required. Accordingly, a 4-AFC task is more time efficient and is therefore recommended.</p>
              <p>We did not observe any significant difference in the 75% thresholds measured with the 2- vs 4-AFC tasks after 80 trials. This is perhaps surprising, given that standard signal detection theory would predict a difference [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A stronger signal–i.e. larger disparity—would be expected to be required for performance of 75% correct on a 4-AFC where chance is 25%, than on a 2-AFC task, where chance is already 50%. Since in our study the two tasks were performed by different subjects, inter-individual differences may have obscured a difference in thresholds. A d’ value of 0.954 corresponds to 75% correct in a 2-AFC task and 54% correct in a 4-AFC task, meaning that the 75%-threshold in a 2-AFC task should be the same as a 54%-threshold in a 4-AFC task if the model by Green and Swets is correct [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In fact, Jäkel and Wichmann [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] actually observed lower instead of higher 62.5% thresholds in a 4-AFC contrast detection task than 75% thresholds on a 2-AFC task, indicating that the theoretical predictions may not be correct. The lack of a difference in thresholds between the 2-AFC and 4-AFC tasks does not affect our conclusions, since our study was designed to make within-task, within-subject comparisons of thresholds, bias, uncertainty, and precision.</p>
              <p>Our study adds to the research on efficiency of alternative forced-choice paradigms in psychophysical research. Our results with children are in accordance with simulation studies comparing a 4-AFC task with a 2-AFC task. Leek, Hanna, and Marchal [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] found better accuracy, less variability and highest efficiency with 4-AFC task. Bi, Lee, and O’Mahony [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] showed 4-AFC is more powerful than 2-AFC. Like Jäkel and Wichmann [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] we found a 4-AFC task to be most efficient in naive observers. With respect to efficiency, both studies point in the same direction, in favour of a 4-AFC task.</p>
              <p>In the domain of stereoacuity, Schmidt, Maguire, Moore, and Cyert [<xref rid="pone.0201366.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed a higher testability in 3 to 3.6 year olds with the 2-AFC Stereo Smile Test than with the 4-AFC Preschool Randot. These children are far younger than those tested in the current study, raising the possibility that 2-AFC may have particular advantages in preschool children. Additionally, the nature of the both tasks is rather different: in the Stereo Smile Test, children detect a smiley face, while in the Preschool Randot children need to identify shapes. So, the higher testability of the Stereo Smile could easily be due to factors other than the lower number of alternatives.</p>
              <p>Our findings have implications for clinical practice too. They suggest that 4-AFC paradigms like used in Frisby (Frisby Stereotests, Fulwood, United Kingdom) or TNO (Lameris, Ede, Netherlands) stereotests are more efficient than a 2-AFC task like Frisby Screener (Frisby Stereotests, Fulwood, United Kingdom). We are currently adapting our experimental 4-AFC task to a new clinical stereotest in the form of a game that is presented on a parallax-barrier autostereoscopic tablet that monitors viewing distance. Our task has the additional advantage of using an efficient adaptive staircase to achieve an accurate threshold with the minimum number of trials.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this study, we compared a 2-AFC and a 4-AFC task for measuring stereoacuity in children with a limited number of trials. Simulations were run and experimental data were collected. We observed that a 4-AFC task with half the number of trials as a 2-AFC task results in the same estimated stereothresholds, uncertainty, precision, and bias, while takes less time to complete. We conclude that 4-AFC is recommended over 2-AFC when measuring stereoacuity in children.</p>
