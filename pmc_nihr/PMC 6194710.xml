                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">“Behaviour that Challenges” is common in people living with dementia, resident in care homes and historically has been treated with anti-psychotics. However, such usage is associated with 1800 potentially avoidable deaths annually in the UK. This study investigated the feasibility of a full clinical trial of a specialist dementia care pharmacist medication review combined with a health psychology intervention for care staff to limit the use of psychotropics.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">This paper focuses on feasibility; including recruitment and retention, implementation of medication change recommendations and the experiences and expectations of care staff.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">West Midlands care homes and individuals meeting the inclusion criteria (dementia diagnosis; medication for behaviour that challenges), or their personal consultee, were approached for consent.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">A specialist pharmacist reviewed medication. Care home staff received an educational behaviour change intervention in a three-hour session promoting person-centred care. Primary healthcare staff received a modified version of the training.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">The primary outcome measure was the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version at 3 months. Other outcomes included quality of life, cognition, health economics and prescribed medication. A qualitative evaluation explored expectations and experiences of care staff.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par6">Five care homes and 34 of 108 eligible residents (31.5%) were recruited, against an original target of 45 residents across 6 care homes. Medication reviews were conducted for 29 study participants (85.3%) and the pharmacist recommended stopping or reviewing medication in 21 cases (72.4%). Of the recommendations made, 57.1% (12 of 21) were implemented, and implementation (discontinuation) took a mean of 98.4 days. In total, 164 care staff received training and 21 were interviewed.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par8">The intervention contained two elements; staff training and medication review. It was feasible to implement the staff training, and the training appeared to increase the ability and confidence of care staff to manage behaviour that challenges without the need for medication. The medication review would require significant modification for full trial partly related to the relatively limited uptake of the recommendations made, and delay in implementation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">Dementia is an international healthcare priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One of the key challenges within dementia care is the management of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Behavioural symptoms include aggression, agitation, depression and hallucinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. BPSD is also referred to as behaviour that challenges, which is defined as ‘any behaviour considered antisocial within the care environment or deemed dangerous to the person with dementia, their fellow residents, and staff’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These two terms are used interchangeably in this paper.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Antipsychotics are frequently prescribed for people living with dementia for behaviour that challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The usage of antipsychotics for people with BPSD is implicated in the death of 1800 people every year and two-thirds of such usage may be inappropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The Banerjee Report found antipsychotics were often used as a first solution, yet behaviour that challenges can often be safely managed with the use of non-pharmacological approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Senior staff in care homes should be skilled in appropriate non-pharmacological techniques and be able to train other staff in these techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">A recent Cochrane review concluded that antipsychotics could be successfully discontinued in older people with dementia and BPSD, but the evidence was low quality and further research was required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, solely focussing on the prescription of antipsychotics may simply drive prescribing to equally problematic alternative psychotropics (such as anti-depressants and benzodiazepines) and research should test interventions to limit the use of all psychotropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Secondary care specialist dementia care pharmacists could have a vital role in ensuring the appropriate use of psychotropics for BPSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">This feasibility study was designed to provide key information on study processes and outcomes, so that the challenges in implementing and evaluating a pharmacy-health psychology dual intervention could be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Incorporating learning from a feasibility study can enhance the rigour and deliverability of any subsequent full clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A feasibility study was needed to assess implementation of the protocol and estimate key parameters, such as recruitment, consent and follow-up rates, and the time taken to conduct the study, to inform the design of the main trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It was also conducted to refine the battery of outcome measures, and understand any challenges associated with joint working between care homes, general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists.</p>

                  <p id="Par28">The sampling frame was care homes (both nursing and residential) in the West Midlands (within 6 miles of Birmingham) with at least 40 residents and providing care for people living with dementia. Care Homes meeting the inclusion criteria were identified from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and other web-sites e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carehomes.co.uk">Carehomes.co.uk</ext-link> including local authority sites. Eligible care homes supporting the Enabling Research in Care Homes (ENRICH; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://enrich.nihr.ac.uk">http://enrich.nihr.ac.uk</ext-link>/) initiative were also identified. ENRICH is an NIHR toolkit to support research in care homes. All identified care homes were invited to participate by letter with follow-up by single phone call or letter to care home manager.</p>

                  <p id="Par29">Consent for residents meeting the inclusion criteria was obtained from the resident, or their personal consultee, someone caring for them or interested in their welfare, but not acting in a professional capacity or for remuneration. Capacity was assessed using the Mental Capacity Act (2005) and local guidelines. All practical steps to maximise the individual’s capacity to provide informed consent, including taking sufficient time and the use of appropriate language, were taken. If the resident lacked capacity their personal consultee was approached regarding consent to the medication review (see protocol for full description of consent; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). The resident’s GP was then approached to consent to the medication review.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p id="Par32">The primary outcome measure was the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) at 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This is a caregiver administered questionnaire that assesses neuropsychiatric symptoms. Other outcomes included quality of life (EQ-5D/DEMQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], cognition (sMMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], health economics (modified version of Client Services Receipt Inventory [CSRI]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and prescribed medication (including implementation of the review; obtained from the care home medication record). Data were collected at 8 weeks, and 3 and 6 months (findings will be reported elsewhere).</p>
                <p id="Par33">An embedded process evaluation used individual semistructured qualitative interviews to explore the expectations and experiences of GPs and care home staff, including managers, both pre- and post-intervention. In addition, the chief investigator collected reflective comments from members of the team and participants (<italic>n</italic> = 9) to inform the potential design of the full trial. These accounts were collected during a short (up to 15 min) phone interview, which covered was the review helpful, and barriers and facilitators to participation in the study and implementation of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par34">All care home staff who received the behaviour change intervention were asked to complete two questionnaires. First, the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire, which was administered pre-intervention, immediately after the training, and 3 months post-intervention; second, the Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Survey which was administered pre- and 3 months post-intervention (findings will be reported elsewhere).</p>

                <title>Recruitment of care homes</title>
                <p id="Par35">Recruitment took far longer than expected. Recruiting six care homes was planned to take six months; it took 14 months to recruit five care homes. Despite two six-month extensions to the study period, it was not possible to recruit a planned sixth care home in the time available. Our original intention was to search the CQC web-site electronically, using the inclusion criteria, to identify eligible care homes. Due to the complexity of the database this did not prove possible, and it was necessary to look at each home individually on the website. Local authority and commercial websites (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.carehomes.co.uk">www.carehomes.co.uk</ext-link>) were searched using the same approach.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Our revised search strategy identified 82 eligible care homes. Three of these homes were recruited (conversion rate = 3.7%). Subsequently the support available from ENRICH was used; three ENRICH homes expressed an interest and one of these was recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. One care home was recruited by personal contacts – this home did not respond to the initial letter and follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par37">At individual care home level, the decision regarding participation was largely driven by the care home manager, and personal contact between the research team and care home managers in following up initial invitations to participate was effective in securing care home sign up. The care homes recruited to the study were diverse (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for further details).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Characteristics of participating care homes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>Type</th><th>Organisation</th><th>Specialty</th><th>Number of beds</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>001</td><td>Nursing home</td><td>Local charity with small number (&lt; 5) of care/nursing homes</td><td>Adults over 65</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>002</td><td>Residential home</td><td>Medium sized care home chain (50 to 100 care homes) across England</td><td>Adults over 65; Dementia</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>003</td><td>Nursing home</td><td>Small care home chain (&lt; 5)</td><td>Adults over 65; Dementia</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>004</td><td>Nursing home</td><td>Single ownership</td><td>Adults over 65; Dementia</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td>005</td><td>Nursing home</td><td>Single ownership</td><td>Adults over 65; Dementia</td><td>31 dementia (45 total)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

The mean number of days taken to recruit care homes was 236.6 (SD 127.2). This was partly because of the time taken to recruit the final two care homes: the care home recruited via ENRICH took 314 days to recruit, and the care home recruited via the personal contacts took 421 days. The first three care homes, which were recruited following an initial letter to the care home manager took a mean of 149 days (SD 31).</p>

                <p id="Par42">Consent from each participant’s GP was required for the medication review. Obtaining consent was straightforward in homes predominantly supported by a single general practice with strong links between the practice and the home (care homes 001, 003, 005). It was considerably more challenging in care homes supported by multiple practices (care home 002 supported by 4 practices and 004 by 2 practices).</p>
                <p id="Par43">In care home 002 it took over 3.5 months to obtain GP consent for every resident and required a strategic and time-consuming approach to primary care engagement. This approach included working closely with the Clinical Comissioning Group (CCG), Practice-based Pharmacists (PBP) and NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) primary care leads, a newsletter about the study specifically written for local GPs, an article in a local NIHR “Connect” Magazine, presentation at a GP Local CRN event on Dementia and attendance at a GP practice meeting. In care home 004, it was impossible to obtain GP consent for 2 recruited participants, for whom the personal consultees had assented, despite the earlier strategic approach.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par66">Increasing care home research is a key priority, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report in detail the feasibility of a dual-purpose care home study involving staff training and medication review. Overall, recruitment was challenging and time-consuming, securing GP engagement was difficult, drop-out rates were high and, where substantial recommendations in relation to medication were made, these took a long time to implement, if implemented at all.</p>
              <p id="Par67">Like other care home research, recruitment was challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The CQC database, as a search engine, had limited utility, confirming earlier findings (Personal Communication, Analisa Smythe, 18th October, 2017). It took 14 months rather than six months to recruit five care homes; and like other studies, the protocol was continually adapted as the team learnt from earlier experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This resulted in the need for five substantial ethical amendments during the study, which contributed to delays. Amendments included expanding the recruitment area, introducing the re-baseline procedure to account for the delay in implementation and in the final two care homes removing the six month follow-up (due to time limitations).</p>
              <p id="Par68">Our initial response rate of 3.7% is low compared to other studies that offered training to care homes; another study had a 10% response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This was possibly because care home managers, the key decision makers, welcomed the offer of cost-free training, but were less likely to welcome a medication review, which could potentially lead to discontinuation of medication for behaviour that challenges. Informal feedback, obtained as reflective comments, from the managers and evidence from another study confirms this viewpoint; one observational/interview study on current practice for the treatment of behaviours that challenge had a similar response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Like other studies we found that developing local relationships and using ENRICH were successful techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par69">It took a mean of 236.6 days to recruit homes. Like other researchers, recruiting GPs from multiple practices who provide care to participants living in a single care home was particularly challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our strategic approach to GP engagement was only partially successful and should be developed further for any larger trial.</p>
              <p id="Par70">At least 30% of residents were expected to meet the inclusion criteria with at least 18 potential participants per home and 7 to 8 recruited. The actual figures were 36.6% of residents with 21.6 potential participants per home and on average 6.8 recruited. On reflection, recruitment might have been improved by organising further meetings with relatives and greater involvement of care home staff in recruitment, although further training may be required for the care home staff.</p>
              <p id="Par71">Recent NICE guidance recommend that care providers should provide face-to-face training and mentoring to staff who deliver care and support to people living with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This training should include the management of behaviours that challenge including the appropriate use of medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. MEDREV successfully developed and evaluated an acceptable and feasible training package, which was well received. A large number of staff (<italic>n</italic> = 164) received training about delivering person-centred care, and the use of psychotropics and reasons for reducing them. Furthermore, by combining staff training with a specialist medication review, the use of psychotropics was reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par72">The qualitative research and the reflective comments, obtained from GPs were very supportive of both the training and medication review. Staff were positive about both elements. The Behavioural Change Intervention appeared to train the care staff in person-centred care so that they would understand why reducing psychotropics is beneficial and support implementation of the recommendations from the medication review. The pharmacists who trained the GPs also reported good interaction particularly in face-to-face training, which encouraged greater participant engagement and reached more GPs.</p>
              <p id="Par73">Nearly 43% of the recommendations (<italic>n</italic> = 9/21) were not implemented. Other similar studies have found similar rates; for example one study found that 58.1% of recommendations by a clinical pharmacist were implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The reasons for this, in our study, were not entirely clear although given the range in implementation rates between care homes, local context, and in particular the GP/care home/pharmacist relationship was likely an important factor. Informal feedback, obtained in the reflective comments, identified a perceived lack of integration with other secondary care medication reviews. The likelihood and speed of implementation may have increased with direct communication between the pharmacist and GP either by phone or face-to-face. Another possible avenue to explore is utilising the model of a practice-based pharmacist as a liaison between the specialist pharmacists conducting the medication reviews and the GP.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Other studies have found that GPs were broadly supportive of pharmacist medication reviews for BPSD and the implementation rate is similar to other studies involving clinicians implementing recommendations from a pharmacist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The relatively low uptake could be due to the additional time and effort needed to amend the prescription. Other studies suggest that GPs believe reducing anti-psychotic prescribing for BPSD could be achieved by increased availability of non-pharmacological approaches and staffing levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par75">Even when supported, the medication review recommendations took on average 98.4 days to implement. This may have clinical and medico-legal implications. It also creates methodological problems for future studies: because it was impossible to know when the recommendation was likely to be implemented, collecting outcome data was challenging. One possible reason for the delay was the use of pre-prepared medication administration packs, which are prepared every month, for care homes. Care home staff also attributed the delay in implementation of recommendations to a general low priority for healthcare for older people; this needs further exploration in future research.</p>
              <p id="Par76">Whilst problems relating to medication optimisation in care homes and in people living with dementia are widely acknowledged, there is very little research on interventions to optimise medication in care home residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One trial has investigated a PCT/CCG-led medication review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The homes in our study already received regular medication reviews from CCG pharmacists; suggesting that CCG pharmacists may lack expertise to review psychotropics. Furthermore, the GPs, in our study, appreciated the clinical and quality focus of the medication reviews.</p>
              <sec id="Sec24">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par77">This study was conducted in a single region in the UK and had a limited number of participants. However, we recruited and retained a range of care homes with differing characteristics (type of home, sociodemographic characteristics of local area). The original aim was to recruit a representative sample of staff from each home. However, only three members of staff were recruited from the final two homes, due to the difficulty and subsequent delay in recruiting these homes. Only three GPs were recruited despite efforts to recruit more. No pharmacists were interviewed; however the feasibility issues in relation to the medication review were captured in the interviews with care staff and GPs, and the reflective comments received.</p>

              <sec id="Sec25">
                <title>Policy implications</title>
                <p id="Par78">Healthcare policy must continue to focus on optimising medication usage in care homes, including the appropriate treatment of BPSD. MEDREV developed an acceptable and feasible training programme which included the appropriate use of medication, in line with NICE guidance, suggesting that this may be a promising policy approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since this study, NHS England has invested in pharmacy to support medication optimisation in care home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This research suggests, that to successfully optimise medication, these pharmacy staff need to develop robust ways of working across organisational boundaries linking primary, secondary and social care.</p>
                <p id="Par79">There are also implications for research policy makers. Recruiting the care homes and people with living dementia was time-consuming and difficult, confirming other studies. The NIHR and other funders have prioritised high quality research both in care homes, and on medication optimisation in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Yet despite this, there is limited research on medication optimisation in care homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] perhaps because care home research involving medication optimisation is uniquely challenging, as we found. This suggests that research into medication optimisation in care homes needs to be a specific priority.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec26">
                <title>Future research</title>
                <p id="Par80">One of the key challenges in this study was the delay in implementation of recommendations. Whilst our solution, of repeating the baseline measurements, might work for a single location feasibility study, when the chief investigator is able to work closely with the Clinical Study Officers, it is less likely to work for a larger multiple centre study. Expert recommendations on medication optimisation did not appear to be implemented in a significant minority of residents; this needs further investigation. From the care home point of view, it may be a question of who has the greater authority, the GP or the pharmacist and established relationships.</p>
                <p id="Par81">GP engagement could be improved by holding an initial event very early in the study. This event should carry Continuing Professional Development accreditation from the appropriate Royal College and include education from expert speakers, ideally with international reputations, in addition to information on the study.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Specialist pharmacists may not have had time to build a good relationship with the GP and without good communication and trust implementation of the recommendations may be challenging as we found. Since this study began, there has been significant investment in primary care clinical pharmacy including within care homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These practice-based pharmacists (PBP) are perhaps ideally placed to deliver the medication review; they have access to records and the autonomy to change the repeat template particularly if an independent prescriber. Involving such PBPs in the delivery of the medication review could address some of the feasibility issues identified and is a hypothesis for a future trial. Yet this area may be outside the scope of their practice and competency. Future research should explore the best way for pharmacy staff to deliver this specialist medication review and the training requirements.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par83">The feasibility study contained two linked elements; staff training and medication review. We found it feasible to develop, deliver and evaluate a well-received staff training programme both in the care home and the GP surgery. The dual intervention appeared to increase the ability of care staff to manage BPSD appropriately with less reliance on medication. Although we found a clear need for specialist medication review of psychotropics for care home residents with dementia, the medication review would require significant modification for full trial.</p>
