                <p>Suboptimal hearing aid use negatively impacts health and well-being. The aim of this study was to conduct a controlled trial of a behavior change intervention to promote hearing aid use. This study was a quasi-randomized controlled trial with two arms. A total of 160 first-time hearing aid users were recruited at their hearing aid fitting appointments. The control arm received standard care. In addition to standard care, the intervention arm received I-PLAN, which comprised (a) information about the consequences of hearing aid use/nonuse, (b) reminder prompt to use the hearing aids, and (c) an action plan. The primary outcome, measured at 6 weeks, was self-reported proportion of time the hearing aid was used in situations that caused hearing difficulty. Secondary outcomes were data-logged hearing aid use, self-reported hearing aid benefit, self-regulation, and habit formation. The results showed that the proportion of time the hearing aids were used in situations that caused hearing difficulty was similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any outcome measure including data-logged hearing aid use. The relatively high levels of hearing aid use across research participants may have limited the potential for the intervention to impact on hearing aid use. Although the intervention materials proved acceptable and deliverable, future intervention trials should target suboptimal hearing aid users.</p>

            <p>Hearing aids are the main treatment for hearing loss (<xref rid="bibr21-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Grenness etÂ al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr32-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Pryce etÂ al., 2016</xref>) and are effective in improving hearing-related quality of life (<xref rid="bibr12-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Chisolm etÂ al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bibr17-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson etÂ al., 2017</xref>). However, studies report that 5% to 24% of hearing aid owners do not use their hearing aids (<xref rid="bibr1-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Aazh etÂ al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr22-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Hartley etÂ al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Hougaard &amp; Ruf, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Solheim &amp; Hickson, 2017</xref>) and 40% of new adult patients use their hearing aids fewer than 4 hours per day (<xref rid="bibr1-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Aazh etÂ al., 2015</xref>). A recent study reported that adult patients were highly motivated to use their hearing aids but had difficulty translating motivation into action (i.e., âvolitional processesâ; <xref rid="bibr34-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Sawyer etÂ al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that interventions should target âvolitional processesâ (e.g., action planning) to increase hearing aid use among adult patients (<xref rid="bibr34-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Sawyer etÂ al., 2019</xref>). In addition, given that little is known about what behaviors audiologists perform that may facilitate hearing aid use, studies that involve audiologists delivering interventions face-to-face are needed to provide an evidence base for clinical practice (<xref rid="bibr25-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Ismail etÂ al., 2019</xref>).</p>
            <p>Although various interventions have attempted to promote hearing aid use, a Cochrane systematic review found that none of the 37 trials improved hearing aid use (<xref rid="bibr10-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker, Mackenzie, Elliott, etÂ al. 2016</xref>). One of the reasons is that none of the interventions were developed using behavior change theory and evidence (<xref rid="bibr6-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Armitage etÂ al., 2017</xref>), for example, the behavior change wheel (<xref rid="bibr28-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2014</xref>). The behavior change wheel is a systematic approach for designing behavior change intervention (<xref rid="bibr28-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2014</xref>). It was developed based on a systematic review and a synthesis of 19 multiple frameworks of behavior change (<xref rid="bibr28-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Using the behavior change wheel, <xref rid="bibr8-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker etÂ al. (2018)</xref> developed the âI-PLANâ intervention. The I-PLAN intervention aims to support audiologists during hearing aid fitting appointments to support adult patients in using their hearing aids. The I-PLAN comprises three components: (a) provision of information related to the benefits of using and disadvantages of not using a hearing aid, (b) provision of prompts as a reminder for hearing aid use, and (c) creation of an action plan for hearing aid use (<xref rid="bibr8-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker etÂ al., 2018</xref>; see <xref rid="table1-2331216520969472" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Given previous intervention studies were focused on providing information relating to communication techniques to reduce negative impact of hearing loss and/or information concerning the management and use of hearing aids (<xref rid="bibr10-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker, Mackenzie, Elliott, etÂ al., 2016</xref>), the I-PLAN intervention is a promising intervention to promote hearing aid use. The components of the I-PLAN target both motivation (via provision of information) and volitional processes (via provision of prompt and plan) of adult patients. To date, there remains a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of the I-PLAN intervention.</p>

            <p>In addition to testing the I-PLAN intervention, we wanted to understand the potential mechanisms of action thereby allowing the intervention to be optimized (<xref rid="bibr11-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Bauman etÂ al., 2002</xref>) and considered two potential avenues. First, given that the intervention is designed to enhance self-regulation (defined as âany efforts undertaken to alter oneâs behaviorâ; <xref rid="bibr37-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Sniehotta etÂ al., 2005</xref>; p. 245), we assessed the three action control constructs that play major roles in self-regulation: awareness of standards for action, self-monitoring, and self-regulatory effort as potential mediators of any effect (<xref rid="bibr36-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Sniehotta etÂ al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, self-regulation can be considered as a personal process that involves monitoring, evaluating, and readjusting oneâs behavior to achieve a behavior goal (e.g., using a hearing aid). Second, action plans specified in the âwhen-thenâ format (as in this study) have been shown to change behavior via habits (<xref rid="bibr3-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Armitage, 2016</xref>) and repeated successful performance of behaviors leads to habit formation (<xref rid="bibr19-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Gardner etÂ al., 2012</xref>). Habit is âa process by which a stimulus generates an impulse to act as a result of a learned stimulus-response associationâ (<xref rid="bibr18-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Gardner, 2015</xref>, p. 277). The components of the I-PLAN may facilitate habit formation by providing opportunity for patients to use their hearing aids in a similar context every day, so we additionally assessed habit as a potential mediator.</p>

              <title>Aim and Hypotheses</title>
              <p>We evaluated the effectiveness of I-PLAN (delivered face-to-face by audiologists during hearing aid fitting appointments) in promoting hearing aid use and benefit compared with standard care among first-time adult hearing aid users. We hypothesized that relative to participants who received standard care, participants who received I-PLAN would report higher hearing aid use in situations that caused hearing difficulty, greater hearing aid use measured via data-logging, greater hearing aid benefits measured by self-reported benefit on an outcome inventory, and higher self-regulation and habit formation measured by scores on self-regulation and habit formation measured by scores on self-regulation and behavioral automaticity questionnaires. We also hypothesized that self-regulation and habit formation would mediate the effect of the I-PLAN intervention on hearing aid use and benefit.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome, assessed 6 weeks post-intervention, was self-reported use of hearing aids in situations that caused hearing difficulty. The secondary outcomes were hearing aid use measured via data-logging, self-report of hearing aid benefit, self-regulation, and habit formation. The 6 weeks period between intervention and outcome assessments was chosen because it is a routine practice in U.K. National Health Service audiology clinics for patients to be followed up at 6 weeks after hearing aid being fitted.

<sup>2</sup>â=â0.0625) using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA; Î±â=â.05). However, to allow for attrition, we aimed to recruit 80 participants in each group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>â=â160 participants).</p>
                <p>Adult patients who were scheduled for initial hearing aid fitting appointments were invited to participate in this study. Adults were eligible if they (a) had no previous personal experience of using a hearing aid, (ii) were aged 18âyears old or above, (iii) attended initial hearing aid fitting appointment with study audiologists, (iv) were native English speakers or had good understanding of English, and (v) had sufficient mental capacity to provide informed consent based-on-audiologistâs opinion were eligible to take part in this study. The exclusion criteria were (a) inability to complete the questionnaires due to age-related problems (e.g., dementia) based-on-audiologistâs opinion and (b) presence of medical contraindications for hearing aids as described by the British Academy of Audiology (2007).</p>
                <p>For each patient, an invitation letter, participant information sheet, consent form, and baseline questionnaire were posted at least 2 days prior to their hearing aid fitting appointment. If patients decided to take part in the study, they were asked to sign the consent form, complete the questionnaire at home and return the completed documents to their audiologist at the hearing aid fitting appointment.</p>
                <p>Neither the study audiologists nor the authors had any role in allocation of participants to the two groups. Participants scheduling was carried out by clinical administrative staff. Allocation of participants to the study audiologists in both groups was designed to be as close as possible to the clinic procedures to minimize the demands on the participating audiological clinic. Participants were blinded to group allocation as they did not know which audiologists were delivering the I-PLAN or Standard Care when they attended their hearing aid fitting appointments. It was not possible to blind study audiologists to group allocation.</p>

                <p>Two hearing aid fitting consultations each were video recorded for all four study audiologists prior to the commencement of the study in order to (a) establish that usual clinical practice was different to the I-PLAN intervention and (b) provide a baseline description of clinical interactions of the study audiologists. Videos were independently reviewed by the first (Ismail) and one co-author (Dawes). Both of the authors recorded the audiologistsâ clinical practice in a checklist form (Supplemental Material 1) that was developed based on the description and examples of U.K. audiologistsâ practice observed in <xref rid="bibr9-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker, Mackenzie, and de Lusignan's (2016)</xref> study. The form was completed independently by the authors. Analysis of the video-recorded clinical consultations confirmed that the clinical practice of all study audiologists also was similar to that observed in Barker, Mackenzie, and de Lusignanâs description of the clinical practice of U.K. audiologists (see Supplemental Material 1). Clinical practice of the study audiologists did not differ between the audiologists who would later deliver the I-PLAN intervention versus those who would deliver standard care only. Comparability of I-PLAN and standard care audiologists prior to training was confirmed by showing no differences in the clinical and demographic characteristics and hearing aid use (data-logged hours of hearing aid use) of patients seen by each study audiologist in the 3 months before the study commenced (Supplemental Material 3).</p>

                <p>At the commencement of the study, two audiologists attended an I-PLAN training session with the first author (Ismail). The I-PLAN training session included an explanation of the development and components of the I-PLAN. Training also included a practical session using the I-PLAN where audiologists delivered the I-PLAN on each other via a role play exercise. The training lasted for about 1 hr. Following the training session, the two I-PLAN audiologists practiced delivering the I-PLAN to three first-time hearing aid patients each (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>â=â6, in total).</p>

In the I-PLAN group, four audiologistâpatient consultations selected at random (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>â=â4; 2 patients/audiologist) were video recorded to monitor fidelity of delivery of the I-PLAN intervention by the study audiologists.

In the Standard Care group, two audiologistâpatient consultations were also selected at random (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>â=â2; 1 patient/audiologist) and video recorded to monitor the consistency of the behavior of standard care audiologists during the research study. Videos of the clinical consultations of audiologists at 3 months after the I-PLAN audiologists received I-PLAN training showed that the I-PLAN audiologists delivered the I-PLAN components as prescribed in the I-PLAN written materials (Supplemental Material 2). The clinical interactions of the standard care audiologists 3 months after the commencement of the study were consistent with observations of clinical interactions before the commencement of the study.</p>

Specifically, standard care fitting appointments involved (a) programming of hearing aid(s); (b) performing real ear measurement ; (c) advising patients on realistic expectations (e.g., hearing aid does not restore normal hearing), communication tactics, and habituation to a hearing aid; (d) providing demonstration and instruction to operate a hearing aid; (e) explanation on services provided (access battery and repair service); (f) providing patients with batteries, hearing aid box, and written information about specific hearing aid fitting; (g) explanation about what to expect at the follow-up appointment; and (h) booking for hearing aid follow-up appointment in 6 weeksâ time.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study investigated face-to-face delivery of the I-PLAN to promote hearing aid use and benefit among adult first-time hearing aid users. There was no significant difference between the I-PLAN and Standard Care groups on hearing aid use measured by self-reported proportion of time hearing aids used in situations that caused hearing difficulty or data-logged hearing aid use, hearing aid benefit, IOI-HA, HHIE-S (aided), or potential mediatorsâ self-regulation and habit formation.</p>
              <p>While the I-PLAN did not increase hearing aid use or benefit, it may be premature to conclude that the I-PLAN is ineffective in promoting hearing aid use. Average hearing aid use as shown by data logging by the participants in this study at the 6-week follow-up appointment was high (Mean<sub>148</sub>â=â9.3âhours; <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>â=â5.2). There may therefore be limited potential to increase hearing aid use among the first-time hearing aid users in this study. As participants were required to give informed written consent to participate, the sample recruited to the study may have been biased in favor of those who were motivated to help with hearing research, and so may also be more likely to use their hearing aid(s) than those who declined to participate. It may be desirable to target those at high risk of not using or under using their hearing aids for interventions to promote hearing aid use, rather than delivering interventions to those who use hearing aids regularly.</p>
              <p>In addition, 16.9% (25 out of 148) of participants were nonregular hearing aid users (hearing aid use fewer than 4 hours per day; <xref rid="bibr1-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Aazh etÂ al., 2015</xref>); much lower than the 40% non-regular users reported by <xref rid="bibr1-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Aazh etÂ al. (2015)</xref> in a sample of new hearing aid users from another U.K. National Health Service audiology clinic. Hearing aid use may be different in different clinical samples. The clinic that hosted our study draws on a fairly affluent and well-educated population of patients, and hearing aid use rates may be above average in this study sample. There were no significant differences between non-regular and regular hearing aid users in other baseline characteristics in this study, but previous studies showed that adult patients who had a lower income (<xref rid="bibr27-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Lupsakko etÂ al., 2005</xref>) and who did not perceive a need for a hearing aid (<xref rid="bibr27-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Lupsakko etÂ al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Solheim etÂ al., 2018</xref>) were more likely not to use or under use their hearing aids. Other factors that might predict low hearing aid use, for example, personality traits and coping strategies (<xref rid="bibr14-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Cox etÂ al., 2005</xref>) or postmotivational variables (e.g., action planning; <xref rid="bibr34-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Sawyer etÂ al., 2019</xref>). Combinations of demographic and/or psychological variables could be used to identify those who are likely not to use hearing aids and may benefit from interventions to promote hearing aid use.</p>
              <p>It is possible that the behavior change techniques in the I-PLAN might interact with each other to reduce effectiveness (<xref rid="bibr30-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2018</xref>). The I-PLAN intervention involved a combination of several behavior change techniques and it was not possible to disentangle the independent contributions of individual behavior change techniques in the I-PLAN. Factorial study designs could isolate and investigate how individual behavior change techniques relate to hearing aid use. Alternatively, there were dozens of potential behavior change techniques that were not incorporated in I-PLAN that could be tested in the future. In addition, given that participants may have received information concerning the consequences of using and not using a hearing aid at the hearing aid fitting appointment as part of standard care (e.g., <xref rid="bibr9-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Barker Mackenzie, &amp; de Lusignan, 2016</xref>), it is also possible that some of the behavior change techniques specified in the I-PLAN, for example, the <italic toggle="yes">information about social and environmental consequences</italic> (BCT: 5.3; <xref rid="bibr29-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2013</xref>) were also delivered by study audiologists in the Standard Care group. However, based on our video observations of clinical interactions in the Standard Care group, none of the information about social and environmental consequences as stated in the I-PLAN materials was delivered by the study audiologists. The video observations of the study audiologists were also in line with a systematic review which concluded that audiologists typically focus on provision of information concerning technical aspects of hearing aids during hearing aid consultations (<xref rid="bibr25-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Ismail etÂ al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>The effectiveness of the I-PLAN may also depend how behavior change techniques are delivered (<xref rid="bibr30-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Michie etÂ al., 2018</xref>). Although the style of delivery of the behavior change techniques was beyond the scope of this study, it is possible that individual consultation styles of audiologists could add noise to the outcome data. For example, audiologists with better communication skills may promote better patient adherence to the audiologistâs recommendations (see <xref rid="bibr42-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Zolnierek &amp; DiMatteo, 2009</xref>). But as there was no difference in participant outcomes between study audiologists at the 6-week outcome assessment, it is unlikely that differences in interaction styles between audiologists had an appreciable impact on patient outcomes. Studies could investigate different modes of delivery of the I-PLAN components. For example, I-PLAN components could be provided in a written format without audiologistsâ involvement, which may be easily implemented in the clinical routine. The I-PLAN components also could be provided on-line in video format (e.g., <xref rid="bibr16-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson etÂ al., 2016</xref>). In addition, studies should ideally measure longer term outcomes than the 6-week follow-up in this study. Hearing aid use declines over longer durations (e.g., <xref rid="bibr24-2331216520969472" ref-type="bibr">Humes etÂ al., 2002</xref>) and useful interventions should support hearing aid use in the long term.</p>

                <title>Limitations of the Study</title>
                <p>First, there may have been contamination of the intervention across I-PLAN and standard care study audiologists given they were working in the same clinic. However, based on our video recordings, the clinical interactions of the standard care audiologists were consistent between observations prior to commencement of the study and 3 months after the commencement. A cluster randomized design using different clinical sites would eliminate the possibility of contamination in future studies. Second, participants were not randomized to group. In this study, randomization was not feasible. The procedures of this study were designed to be as close to routine clinic procedure in order to avoid additional burden on the clinic that was hosting the study. Third, the âstandard careâ at the host audiology clinic was comprehensive and included real ear verification and counseling. There may have been little scope to improve on this high standard of care and limiting the benefits of the I-PLAN.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This was a controlled trial of the I-PLAN intervention to promote hearing aid use and benefit among first-time adult hearing aid users. There were no statistically significant differences in any outcome measure. The I-PLAN intervention might be effective in promoting hearing aid use among patients with lower levels of hearing aid use than was the case for this study sample, where average hearing aid use was high. Interventions to promote hearing aid use should seek to identify and target those who are at risk of not using their hearing aid.</p>
