                  <p>COVID-19 vaccine rollout is lagging in Africa, where there has been a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination with the ChAdOx-nCoV19 (AZD1222) vaccine on antibody responses through to 180 days.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did an unmasked post-hoc immunogenicity analysis after the first and second doses of AZD1222 in a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 1b–2a study done in seven locations in South Africa. AZD1222 recipients who were HIV-uninfected, were stratified into baseline seropositive or seronegative groups using the serum anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) immunoglobulin G (IgG) electroluminescence immunoassay to establish SARS-CoV-2 infection before the first dose of AZD1222. Binding IgG to spike (anti-S) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) were measured before the first dose (day 0), second dose (day 28), day 42, and day 180. Neutralising antibody (NAb) against SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, beta, delta, gamma, and A.VOI.V2, and omicron BA1 and BA.4 variants, were measured by pseudovirus assay (day 28, day 42, and day 180).

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Of 185 individuals who were randomly assigned to AZD1222, we included 91 individuals who were baseline seropositive and 58 who were baseline seronegative, in the final analysis. In the seropositive group, there was little change of anti-S IgG (and anti-RBD IgG) or neutralising antibody (NAb) titres at day 42 compared with at day 28. Anti-S (and anti-RBD) IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were higher throughout in the seropositive compared with the seronegative group, including at day 180 (GMCs 517·8 [95% CI 411·3–651·9] <italic>vs</italic> 82·1 [55·2–122·3] BAU/mL). Also D614G NAb geometric mean titres (GMTs) were higher in the seropositive group than the seronegative group, as was the percentage with titres of at least 185 (80% putative risk reduction threshold [PRRT] against wild-type–alpha COVID-19), including at day 180 (92·0% [74·0–99·0] <italic>vs</italic> 18·2% [2·3–51·8). Similar findings were observed for beta, A.VOI.V2, and gamma. For delta, BA.1, and BA.4, NAb GMTs and the proportion with titres above the PRRT were substantially higher in the seropositive compared with seronegative group at day 28 and day 42, but no longer differed between the groups by day 180.</p>

                  <p>A single dose of AZD1222 in the general African population, where COVID-19 vaccine coverage is low and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is 90%, could enhance the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                  <p id="para40">Antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccines are correlated with prevention of infection as well as the attenuation of clinical severity of COVID-19 infection through virus neutralisation and Fc effector functions. The recombinant replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein vaccine (AZD1222) is being widely used across Africa, where vaccine coverage remains low but approximately 90% of the population has been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Previous findings show that a single AZD1222 dose in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals elicits similar antibody responses compared with two doses in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals. There is little data on the durability, breadth, and capacity to mediate Fc effector functions of antibodies that result from AZD1222 vaccination following SARS-CoV-2 infection (hybrid immunity), particularly in the era of dominance of COVID-19 due to infections by the omicron variant of concern (VOC).</p>
                  <p id="para50">We did a literature search on PubMed for reports from Nov 1, 2020 up to Aug 21, 2022 using the keywords (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“vaccine*” OR “vaccination*”) AND “Hybrid Immunity” AND “Omicron”, with no restrictions on language. We identified 51 studies reporting hybrid immunity after COVID-19 vaccination. We identified 16 observational studies reporting on hybrid immunity, which included analysis against the omicron VOC. COVID-19 vaccination, which used AZD1222, BBV152 (inactivated COVID-19 vaccine), BNT162.b2, and mRNA-1273 vaccines following infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in significantly higher anti-spike protein (anti-S), anti-receptor binding domain (anti-RBD), antibody concentration and neutralisation activity titres against wild-type virus compared with vaccine-only induced immunity. Also, hybrid immunity was associated with higher amounts of neutralising activity against omicron, albeit lower relative to wild-type virus, compared with those with vaccine-only induced immunity following two doses of AZD1222 or BBV152 and 2–3 doses of mRNA. The cross-sectional observational studies, however, varied in the number of vaccine doses (2–3), time period between last dose of vaccine, and sampling timepoint (21 to 224 days) and neutralising activity testing was restricted to wild-type virus, omicron BA.1 or BA.2, and delta.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">We expanded the observations of previous studies to include analysis of hybrid compared with AZD1222-only induced immunity on the longitudinal kinetics of anti-S, anti-RBD, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and neutralising antibody activity against wild-type (D614G), beta, delta, A.VOI.V2, gamma, BA.1, BA.4, and SARS-CoV from 28 days after the first dose of AZD1222 through to 180 days. Similar to earlier observations, our data show little increase of anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, neutralising antibody, or ADCC following a second dose of AZD1222 within 4 weeks of the first dose in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the first dose, compared with immune responses after the second AZD1222 dose in those without SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination. Hybrid compared with vaccine-only induced immunity showed increased ability to neutralise VOCs, including the highly immune-evasive omicron BA.1 and BA.4 sub-lineages, which have dominated global infections in the first half of 2022, as well as SARS-CoV. Furthermore, neutralising antibodies titres remained higher at 142 days after the second dose (D180) in individuals with hybrid compared with vaccine-only induced immunity against many VOCs, but not for delta, BA.1, or BA.4.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">The low increase in antibody responses in individuals after a second dose of AZD1222 in those infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the first dose of vaccine, calls into question the utility of a second dose as soon as 4 weeks after the first dose in populations with a high previous rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, hybrid immunity was associated with heightened neutralising activity against all VOCs including BA.1 and BA.4. Although there was waning of antibody neutralising activity against Delta, BA.1 and BA.4 by day 180 including in those with hybrid immunity, there is likely to be memory B cell responses against these variants in individuals with hybrid immunity. Our data indicate that even a single dose of AZD1222 at the general population level in Africa where there is high SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and COVID-19 vaccine rollout is lagging, might be a valuable, cost-effective intervention to significantly enhance the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para420">The findings of our study show that SARS-CoV-2 infections, before vaccination primed the immune system for a more robust humoral immune response to the AZD1222 primary series compared with individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 naive when vaccinated. Similar observations were reported by other studies on AZD1222 vaccine as an effective booster after initial priming with SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para430">Furthermore, a second dose of AZD1222 within 4 weeks of the first dose in individuals who were baseline seropositive, did not result in a further increase in anti-S IgG, anti-RBD IgG, Nab, or ADCC. In contrast there were substantial increases in antibody concentrations following the second dose of AZD1222 in individuals who were seronegative at baseline. Similar observations were reported by others after the primary series for AZD1222 for anti-S and NAb to wild type virus,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> as well as for mRNA and Ad26.CoV2.v2.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, we expand the observations to include the implications of hybrid-induced immunity compared with AZD1222-only induced immunity on kinetics of anti-S, anti-RBD, and ADCC through to day 180. Furthermore, we analysed the effect of hybrid immunity induced neutralising antibody activity to several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron BA.1 and BA.4, which dominate global infections in 2022.</p>
              <p id="para440">The baseline anti-N IgG seropositive compared with seronegative AZD1222 recipients maintained higher concentrations of anti-S and anti-RBD IgG through to day 180. Also, a greater percentage of vaccine recipients with hybrid immunity had NAb above the PRRT against symptomatic COVID-19 due to D614G, beta, A.VOI.V2, and gamma through to day 180. Although a higher percentage of the seropositive group compared with the seronegative group also had NAb titres above the PRRT against symptomatic COVID-19 due to delta (92·0% <italic>vs</italic> 9·1%), BA.1 (84% <italic>vs</italic> 0%) and BA.4 (88% <italic>vs</italic> 0%) at day 42, this was no longer evident by day 180. Nevertheless, there is likely to be memory B cell responses in individuals with hybrid immunity against delta, BA.1, and BA.4. The antibody-evasiveness of omicron BA.1 and BA.4 has been well described for convalescent sera and COVID-19 vaccines.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
              <p id="para450">The higher potential vaccine effectiveness even against variants showing relative resistance to NAb activity imputed from our analysis, is corroborated from real world vaccine effectiveness in which hybrid immunity with mRNA vaccines had higher vaccine effectiveness against BA.1 and BA.2 infection (52–57%) compared with only two doses of mRNA vaccine induced immunity.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The higher hybrid immunity induced vaccine effectiveness could be attributable to the greater magnitude of binding and NAb induced after only a single dose of vaccine compared with even the peak antibody responses at day 42 in the seronegative group. Also, the repertoire of immune responses following vaccination after past infection compared with in a SARS-CoV-2 naive individual might vary in terms of antibody targets and degree of affinity maturation and through a broader repertoire of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> immune responses.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Antibody mediated Fc effector function evaluated here, albeit in a small subset, showed that infection alone (at day 0), as well as vaccine-only induced immunity elicited cross-reactive ADCC against D614G and delta; with the ADCC IgG showing less waning through to day 180 compared with binding IgG and NAb concentrations. This is consistent with previous reports of antibodies retaining the ability to mediate Fc effector function against VOCs.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">We previously reported from the same study the lack of vaccine efficacy against mild–moderate symptomatic COVID-19 due to the beta variant (vaccine efficacy 10%; 95% CI −79 to 55%) in individuals who were anti-N IgG seronegative at enrolment. The lack of AZD1222 vaccine effectiveness against beta is consistent with our observation that none of the baseline seronegative group had NAb above the PRRT against beta variant symptomatic COVID-19 at day 42. In contrast, the percentage with NAb above the PRRT in the seropositive group was 71·7% at day 28 and remained high through to day 180 (51·9%). This illustrates the need for exercising caution in extrapolating from studies done early on in the pandemic when a lower percentage of the populations were infected by SARS-CoV-2 compared with the present when the population is broadly SARS-CoV-2 experienced.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para470">Notably, most individuals with hybrid immunity (92% at day 28 and day 42) had NAb against delta titres above the PRRT compared with only 9% of those with vaccine-only induced immunity. The final analysis of study recorded vaccine efficacy of 77·1% (95% CI 30·4–94·4) against the delta variant, with the cases having accrued 9–10 months after the second dose of AZD1222, independent of baseline anti-N IgG serostatus; and vaccine efficacy against wild-type virus was 91% (35–100).<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> We have not completed anti-N IgG at all the timepoints as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infections over and above the cases documented by nucleic acid amplification test positivity. Nevertheless, a serosurvey before the delta variant wave in several South African provinces showed SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rates of 32–63% by January, 2021.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> This could have contributed to a high degree of protection against delta, which dominated in South Africa between May, 2021, to early November, 2021, despite the low NAb activity induced by vaccine alone.</p>
              <p id="para480">We had unmasked the study and offered dosing of the placebo group and a third dose to the vaccinated group before the onset of the omicron dominant wave. Consequently, we cannot extrapolate whether the high percentage of individuals with hybrid immunity who had NAb above the PRRT against BA.1 at day 42 (84%) translated into vaccine effectiveness against mild–moderate COVID-19 due to omicron BA.1. Notably, 70% of COVID-19 unvaccinated adults in Gauteng Province (South Africa), where most sites involved in this study were based, were seropositive before the omicron dominant wave in South Africa.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">Limitations of our study include that we focused only on vaccine and infection induced binding and NAb responses, which are important contributors to protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild-moderate COVID.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> We did not evaluate CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte responses, which probably attenuate the clinical severity of COVID-19. Notably, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses induced by vaccines and past infection are preserved, even against the highly mutated omicron BA.1 variant harbouring more than 30 S-protein mutations.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Another limitation was use of the PSVN threshold associated with 80% risk reduction of wild-type–alpha symptomatic COVID-19, as a PRRT for other analysed variants, for which individual thresholds have not yet been established. Also, we did not measure anti-N IgG at day 28 and day 42, but rather used SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test confirmed cases identified from active surveillance and sampling at routine scheduled visits to exclude infections between day 0 and day 180. Consequently, we might have inadvertently missed some episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nevertheless, as the focus of the study was to establish the effect of antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection on immune responses to the AZD1222 vaccine, our study findings would be generalisable to a real world situation where undocumented exposures to SARS-CoV-2 occur. Our study was also limited by the number of samples that were available for NAb or ADCC testing, and there were some differences in median age and race between the groups, which we do not adjust for in the analysis. Also, the baseline seropositive group was infected with the wild-type virus and it's unclear whether primary infection with other variants would yield similar observations as we have shown.</p>
              <p id="para500">Overall, these data indicate that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 is likely to differ at an individual and population level depending on previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the low boost in antibody responses following a second dose of a vaccine in previously infected individuals suggests a low value at the population level (excluding immunocompromised individuals) of a second dose of vaccine 4 weeks later in settings where there has been a high rate of past SARS-CoV-2 infections. It is, however, possible that a longer interval between the first two doses could confer benefit in individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is pertinent in many low-income African countries where COVID-19 vaccine rollout is still lagging, but 79% of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by mid-November, 2021, before the circulation of the highly transmissible omicron variant.<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
