              <abstract>
                <p>Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is the rapid onset of reduced hearing due to loss of function of the inner ear or hearing nerve of unknown aetiology. Evidence supports improved hearing recovery with early steroid treatment, via oral, intravenous, intratympanic or a combination of routes. The STARFISH trial aims to identify the most clinically and cost-effective route of administration of steroids as first-line treatment for ISSNHL. STARFISH is a pragmatic, multicentre, assessor-blinded, three-arm intervention, superiority randomised controlled trial (1:1:1) with an internal pilot (ISRCTN10535105, IRAS 1004878). 525 participants with ISSNHL will be recruited from approximately 75 UK Ear, Nose and Throat units. STARFISH will recruit adults with sensorineural hearing loss averaging 30dBHL or greater across three contiguous frequencies (confirmed via pure tone audiogram), with onset over a ≤3-day period, within four weeks of randomisation. Participants will be randomised to 1) oral prednisolone 1mg/Kg/day up to 60mg/day for 7 days; 2) intratympanic dexamethasone: three intratympanic injections 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml spaced 7±2 days apart; or 3) combined oral and intratympanic steroids. The primary outcome will be absolute improvement in pure tone audiogram average at 12-weeks following randomisation (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0kHz). Secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks will include: Speech, Spatial and Qualities of hearing scale, high frequency pure tone average thresholds (4.0, 6.0 and 8.0kHz), Arthur Boothroyd speech test, Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefit Questionnaire, Tinnitus Functional Index, adverse events and optional weekly online speech and pure tone hearing tests. A health economic assessment will be performed, and presented in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Primary analyses will be by intention-to-treat. Oral prednisolone will be the reference. For the primary outcome, the difference between group means and 97.5% confidence intervals at each time-point will be estimated via a repeated measures mixed-effects linear regression model.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is the rapid onset of reduced hearing due to loss of function of the inner ear or hearing nerve. The cause is found in only 10–15% of participants [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and in most cases the aetiology is unknown or “idiopathic”. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is usually unilateral, has an incidence of 5–20 per 100,000 and can result in permanent and complete hearing loss, although spontaneous recovery is seen in 32–65% of cases [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ISSNHL can have a profound impact on participants and their quality of life.</p>
              <p>Evidence supports improved hearing recovery with early steroid treatment, via oral, intravenous or intratympanic routes [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with a combination of oral and intratympanic steroids possibly leading to superior hearing recovery [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Identification of the most clinically and cost-effective route of administration of steroids as first-line treatment for ISSNHL is a high priority research recommendation from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for assessment and management of hearing loss in adults [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>The best route of steroid delivery for hearing recovery in ISSNHL is unknown. Optimising treatment for ISSNHL is important for both participants and health resources as the condition is associated with reduced quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) work by the trial team also identified a need for better diagnosis and access to specialist care if the management and hearing outcomes of individuals with ISSNHL are to be improved.</p>
              <p>STARFISH is a three arm, superiority randomised, controlled trial that aims to identify the most clinically and cost-effective route of administration of steroids as first-line treatment for ISSNHL. Procedurally, the trial is designed to be in line with standard UK clinical practice as much as possible, to minimise burden on participants. The trial has been designed to establish the effectiveness of the most commonly used interventions for ISSNHL in the UK, using a broad range of outcomes that are important to patients, clinicians and policymakers, measuring functional hearing, associated symptoms, intervention adverse effects and patient quality of life.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Group 1) Oral steroid (prednisolone as tablets) 1mg/kg body weight/day up to 60mg/day for 7 days.</p>

                </list>
                <p>Immediately prior to the second and third intratympanic injections, a pure tone audiogram will be performed. If full recovery has been achieved (return to within 10dBHL of the unaffected ear at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0kHz, if contralateral ear has no participant-reported pre-existing loss), the participant and clinician may jointly decide to omit further intratympanic injections.</p>

                  <title>Technique for intratympanic injection</title>
                  <p>Dexamethasone 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml will be administered, depending on local policy. The procedure will be performed using a microscope or endoscope to visualise the tympanic membrane, with the participant recumbent at an angle of &lt;20 degrees. Any locally adopted method of local anaesthesia will be used. A 22–25 gauge spinal needle will be passed through the tympanic membrane anterior-inferiorly, and the dexamethasone slowly injected until the fluid level reaches the level of the needle. Following the injection, the study participant will maintain their head turned away from the injected ear, recumbent for 30 minutes to maximise uptake of steroid through the round window. Participants will be provided with information leaflets specific to the intervention(s) they received, detailing precautions following intervention, possible side effects, and where to seek further information if needed [<xref rid="pone.0290480.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0290480.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Files].</p>
                  <p>Written material and a training video will be issued to investigators to standardise the injection technique, and face-to-face training will be provided where requested by the site.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>The reporting of the outcomes will be based on published guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The objective of the trial is to test the superiority of three interventions, and in all analyses the oral steroid group will be considered as the reference category. All primary analyses (primary and secondary outcomes including safety outcomes) will be by intention-to-treat, i.e. all participants will be analysed in the intervention group to which they were randomised irrespective of adherence to randomised intervention or other protocol deviation. As a secondary (or sensitivity) analysis, a per-protocol analysis will also be carried out for the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>For the primary outcome and all other secondary outcomes measures, a Bonferroni correction [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] will be applied to account for the increase in the risk of type I error associated with making two key comparisons (i.e. “intratympanic steroid versus oral steroid” and “combination oral and intratympanic steroid versus oral steroid”). To maintain an overall 5% type I error rate, each comparison will be tested at a significance level of 2.5%. A comparison of intratympanic steroid versus combination oral and intratympanic steroid will also be performed as part of an exploratory analysis for all outcomes.</p>
                <p>For all outcome measures, appropriate summary statistics and differences between groups, e.g. mean differences, relative risks, absolute differences will be presented, with two-sided 97.5% confidence intervals. Outcomes will be adjusted for the minimisation variables and any baseline values (where applicable).</p>
                <p>For the primary outcome, the difference between group means and associated 97.5% confidence intervals at each time-point will be estimated through the use of a repeated measures mixed-effects linear regression model. All assessment times (baseline and the post-treatment time points) will be included. Parameters allowing for treatment group, time variable, the randomisation minimisation variables except for site and the baseline score will be included as fixed effects and participants nested within site as random effects. Time will be assumed to be a categorical (fixed) variable. To allow for a varying treatment effect over time, a time by treatment interaction parameter will be included in the model. A compound symmetry covariance structure will be assumed. Estimates of differences between groups at the 6 week and 12 week time-points will be taken from the model including this interaction parameter. Results will be presented as adjusted mean difference and 97.5% confidence interval. Subgroup analyses will be limited to the same variables used in the minimisation algorithm except for site and performed on the primary outcome only.</p>
                <p>The secondary outcomes consist of continuous, time to event, binary, ordered categorical with more than two categories and count data types. For all secondary outcomes that are continuous, they will be analysed using the same statistical method as described for primary outcome. All analysis will be adjusted for the minimisation variables as fixed effects (except site which will be included as a random effect).</p>
                <p>For those secondary outcomes that are binary, data will be summarised as number and percentage of participants in each intervention arm and an adjusted relative risk and 97.5% confidence interval will be estimated from a log-binomial regression model for each comparison. For secondary outcomes that are ordered categorical with more than two categories, data will be summarised as number and percentage of participants in each category by intervention arm. An adjusted odds ratio and 97.5% confidence interval will be estimated from an ordered logistic regression model for each comparison. Any secondary outcomes that are time to event data will be compared between intervention arms using survival analysis methods. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be constructed for visual presentation of time-to-event comparisons. A Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to obtain the adjusted hazard ratios and 97.5% confidence intervals. For secondary outcomes that are count data type, they will be analysed using a Poisson regression model (or negative binomial regression if there is evidence of overdispersion) with an offset for the length of time the participant was in the trial being included in the model, to obtain an adjusted incidence rate ratio and 97.5% confidence interval for each comparison. Statistical analysis will be undertaken in Stata version 18 (or higher) and/or SAS software, version 9.4 (or higher).</p>

                <p>Adherence to intratympanic treatment group will be defined as receiving 3 intratympanic injections of dexamethasone (either 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml) spaced 7+/-2 days apart, unless the course of injections was reduced to 1 or 2 injections on the basis of pure-tone audiogram-confirmed resolution of hearing loss or evidence of further sensorineural hearing loss, as well as not having received any oral steroid, with treatment initiated within 4 weeks of symptom onset. A reduction in course duration for intratympanic injection for any other reason will not be considered per-protocol.</p>
                <p>Adherence to the combined treatment group will require the criteria above to be met for both interventions. Additionally, if oral treatment is initiated within 4 weeks of symptom onset then intratympanic treatment must commence up to four days preceding or following this.</p>

                  <p>This does not include those participants who have specifically withdrawn consent for the use of their data in the first instance. However, these outcomes will be explored as per other missing responses. Most assessments will be conducted by an audiologist blinded to the treatment allocation and it is anticipated that the assessments will be completed within the scheduled time window. For participants who have internet access and agree to use the online digits-in-noise and pure tone tests, they will be asked to perform the tests on the trial website every week, for 12 weeks, from commencement of treatment. The completion dates of these tests will be checked to ensure they fall at the correct time-point.</p>

A preliminary cost consequence analysis will be carried out to establish whether any intervention shows dominance.

The outcomes for the economic evaluation (Health Utilities Index 3 and ICECAP-A) will be presented in terms of Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year, 12 weeks following randomisation.</p>
                  <p>Other outcomes of cost-per-case of any improvement in hearing and cost-per-case for the different increments of hearing improvement will also be reported.

                  <p>The incremental economic analysis will be conducted on both the HUI3 and ICECAP-A, with confidence intervals generated to estimate uncertainty. The results of these economic analyses will be presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to reflect sampling variation and uncertainties in the appropriate threshold cost-effectiveness value. Both deterministic and stochastic cost effectiveness analyses will be used to explore the robustness of these results to plausible variations in key assumptions and variations in the analytical methods used, and to consider the broader issue of the generalisability of the results.</p>

Elements of the design are pragmatic, to enhance recruitment and ensure relevance to current practice, for example with permitted variation in the timing and delivery of the interventions. Other variables had to be fixed to ensure the trial is able to detect superiority of a route of administration. The rationale behind these choices is outlined below.</p>

Two meta-analyses also suggest the final hearing threshold may be independent of the delay in steroid treatment, for both primary [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and secondary therapy [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="sec043">
                <title>Choice of interventions</title>
                <p>The three arms have been selected to reflect the variation in current practice, with all interventions already in widespread clinical use. Oral steroid (prednisolone) is included as an intervention as this is recommended in guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and used by most ENT clinicians across the UK [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As the current standard of care, this represents the control intervention.</p>
                <p>Intratympanic dexamethasone is included as a recent survey suggested 62% of UK ENT surgeons use intratympanic steroid injection in the treatment of ISSNHL [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with 80% of surgeons spacing injections 2–7 days apart [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Meta-analysis shows no evidence that one intratympanic steroid regime is superior [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and so the most commonly used agent (dexamethasone) and numbers of injections (three) in the UK have been adopted [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For surgeons not currently using intratympanic injection for ISSNHL, the technique is easy to learn, and training on the technique for the STARFISH trial will be provided via pre-recorded video materials or on-site if required.</p>
                <p>The third intervention is combined oral and intratympanic steroids, which has been included due to limited evidence that combination therapy may provide superior hearing recovery to monotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec044">
                <title>Choice of outcomes</title>
                <p>The choice of primary outcome, the improvement of PTA, has been recommended in an ISSNHL consensus statement [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and is used in most studies for ISSNHL. Meta-analysis suggests that the time of endpoint measurement has no effect on the change in PTA [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but as hearing recovery is rarely seen after 12 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the PTA at 12 weeks has been chosen as the primary endpoint.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes are a range of functional measures of hearing, including speech discrimination scores and patient-reported measures. Online home hearing tests have been developed to allow testing at short intervals that would not be practical otherwise, and the tests are strongly supported by our patient collaborators. Participants will be supplied with headphones and test results will be validated by comparison to in-hospital audiograms. These tests should provide greater detail on the rate of hearing recovery in each treatment arm at different time points.</p>

              <sec id="sec045">
                <title>Patient access to treatment</title>
                <p>Patient and public involvement work by the trial team identified delays in patient presentation to healthcare, and incorrect initial diagnosis that delayed patient access to specialist care in some cases. To enhance patient presentation, the STARFISH team, working with a patient group, has developed advertising for social media that alerts patients to the need for testing and urgent treatment if symptoms suggest ISSNHL. In addition, a poster has been created to be displayed in community medical and audiology practices.</p>
                <p>In the UK most individuals with ISSNHL initially present to their community General Practitioner (GP), where ISSNHL may not initially be identified. To aid the early diagnosis of ISSNHL, video and written educational materials aimed at GPs have been developed. The STARFISH team have also created a smartphone and website app to aid less experienced clinicians in performing and interpreting the Weber tuning fork test. This provides a screening test that can be used to distinguish between a conductive hearing loss and a sensorineural loss that may require urgent specialist assessment [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec046">
                <title>Team structure and recruitment strategy</title>
                <p>UK national guidance states that ISSNHL should be referred urgently to an on-call ENT team [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Referrals may occur outside working hours, and treatment is frequently initiated at the time of diagnosis by the on-call team. The STARFISH trial therefore cannot rely on a conventional research team structure and screening process. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that at each trial site the PI appoints an associate PI who is an ENT specialist trainee, who is better able to access patients and coordinate trainee colleagues and therefore improve recruitment. INTEGRATE, the UK ENT Trainee Research Network will use its established network to manage this trainee involvement. Associate PIs will receive training and formal recognition within the NIHR Associate PI scheme.</p>
                <p>Another barrier to recruitment is general practitioners recognising that the hearing loss is sensorineural rather than conductive and making an urgent referral to ENT. We have produced an app to help GPs make the correct diagnosis as well as an educational video and have partnered with GP research groups. We have established a Facebook group to directly target patients with SSNHL to give them information and encourage them to seek urgent medical input.</p>

              <sec id="sec047">
                <title>Limitations of the study</title>
                <p>There is a significant spontaneous hearing recovery rate in patients with ISSNHL who are untreated [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and quantifying this recovery would be of particular value if no route of steroid delivery was found to be superior. However, we have not incorporated a placebo arm as it would be unethical to withhold standard care with steroids [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and during patient and public consultation, potential trial participants said they would not accept randomisation to no treatment, making a trial including a placebo arm non-viable. It would be possible to give placebo tablets to the intratympanic steroid only group, and a placebo/sham injection to the tablet-only group, but in the case of injection this would increase participant risk without potential therapeutic benefit. Incorporating placebo treatments would also result in an increase in study cost and complexity, with potentially limited gain. It was concluded that the single blinding approach was adequate, given the relatively objective nature of the primary outcome in the form of a pure tone audiogram. It is accepted however that certain outcomes, such as those collected using patient reported outcome measures, could be impacted by participant awareness of their allocated intervention.</p>
                <p>Variables that may be associated with hearing recovery in ISSNHL are not well documented. STARFISH uses a minimisation algorithm at the point of randomisation to ensure that the number of participants with variables known to be related to the extent of hearing recovery are balanced between arms, but it is possible that other variables may impact recovery and not be controlled for. The variables incorporated in the minimisation algorithm are: hearing severity, as there is a correlation between the hearing threshold before treatment and recovery [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; time to treatment, as progressive spontaneous recovery may mean those treated later have already undergone some recovery; and presence of vertigo, as this is likely an indicator of poor prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0290480.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0290480.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Allocation to interventions is also matched for each centre, given potential differences between sites in delivery of the interventions and local patient population.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This is a proposal of a prospective, randomized, interventional, comparative non-inferiority study. The introduction, rationale and aims are valid. I have no concerns regading internal or external validity.</p>
              <p>The introduction is fine, and regarding methodology, I would urge the authors to consider the followinf suggestions:</p>
              <p>1. In the Randomisation algorithm, I would suggest adding a tinnitus category (present prior, new-onset, and reduction during treatment), as it is known that different treatment modalities affect tinnitus diferently.</p>
              <p>2. The schedule of intratympanic injections should be outlined with regard to oral dosing, to be able to discern drug dose/effect ratio.</p>
              <p>3. The PTA prior to IT administration is a fine addition meant to prevent discomfort to the patient, but introduces sampling and measurement bias. I would suggest that all patients receive three injections, to ensure comparability of data.</p>
              <p>4. Limiting improvement of PTA to 4 kHz limits the reach of analysis as a primary measure. Traditionally, speech-discriminating frequencies are seen as the most important, but high-frequency hearing loss often causes disturbing tinnitus, and I would suggest including 0.5 - 6 and 8 kHz, as a secondary outcome, to account for that, and then again separately, as proposed in point 4 of functional hearing outcomes section.</p>
              <p>The sample size, adherence and statistic testing are fine.</p>
              <p>Regarding placebo trials and comparison, as well as outcome testing, I would suggest citing the following study: Ajduk J, Peček M, Kelava I, Žaja R, Ries M, Košec A. Comparison of Intratympanic Steroid and Hyperbaric Oxygen Salvage Therapy Hearing Outcomes in Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss: A Retrospective Study. Ear Hear. 2023 Jul-Aug 01;44(4):894-899. doi: 10.1097/AUD.0000000000001338. Epub 2023 Jan 20. PMID: 36693145.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The study protocol of the multicentre RCT is well written and concise. However, some issues should be considered before publication:</p>
              <p>The manuscript structure and order of reported items should be in line with the “Reporting checklist for protocol of a clinical trial.”, based on the SPIRIT guidelines. It is not clear why the authors deviated from that guideline or checklist.</p>
              <p>It is not clear why the primary outcome is the PTA (0.5-4kHz), while the inclusion was an ISSHL measured at 3 contiguous frequencies. Why could the primary outcome not be aligned to that measure?</p>
              <p>The intervention is not clear. Please specify the actual drugs to be used. Dexamethasone-phosphate has completely different molecular properties to dexamethasone and has different pharmacokinetic properties entering and leaving perilymph (see Salt &amp; Plontke 2020 “Steroid Nomenclature in Inner Ear Therapy”. The same hold for the specification of prednisolone (Prenisolone 21-hemisuccinate, or Prednisolone-succinate?)</p>
              <p>Please clarify the use of 3.3 or 3.8 mg/ml. The dose are quite similar but not equal. Please refer to Chandrasekhar et al 2019. Maybe 10 or better 24 mg/ml would be more appropriated.</p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria: The 30-dB threshold is quite low and low effects of the interventions would be expected (see Fig. 3 in Chen, Halpin, Rauch 2003). It is not clear if the 30 dB are absolute thresholds or relative decrements. In this case please specify the reference. Is it an average over 3 (contig.) frequencies or at every single frequency? Table 1 says “0.5-8.0 kHz”…</p>
              <p>The measurement of the VRBQ, TFI, HUI3 and ICECAP-A are very good choices to make the study results worth.</p>
              <p>The „extent of hearing recovery“ has to be explained in more detail. Why was the 50% AB-phonems criterion used? At which sound pressure level?</p>
              <p>Adverse events (Figure 1) have to be reported over the entire trial period, starting with the first drug application.</p>
              <p>The study is not blinded and no placebo is used. This is a large risk for bias. Please discuss this issue also in the context of other similar trials, e.g., Plontke et al. 2022 ( <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-022-01184-8" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-022-01184-8</ext-link> ).</p>

              <p>Protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial of STeroid Administration Routes For Idiopathic Sudden sensorineural Hearing loss: the STARFISH trial</p>
              <p>We thank the academic editor and reviewers for their comments. We have addressed these individually below.</p>
              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>The study protocol is well written.</p>
              <p>Please justify the choice of drugs and the chosen concentration</p>
              <p>Dexamethasone is the most commonly used intratympanic steroid in the UK (Lechner M, Sutton L, Ferguson M, Abbas Y, Sandhu J, Shaida A. Intratympanic Steroid Use for Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss: Current Otolaryngology Practice. The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology. 2019;128(6):490-502), and is widely used both clinically and in existing studies (Plontke SK, Meisner C, Agrawal S, Cayé-Thomasen P, Galbraith K, Mikulec AA, Parnes L, Premakumar Y, Reiber J, Schilder AG, Liebau A. Intratympanic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2022 Jul 22;7(7):CD008080. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008080.pub2. PMID: 35867413; PMCID: PMC9307133.) as well as having good availability globally. Meta-analysis and simulation shows no evidence that one intratympanic steroid agent or dosing regime is superior over another (Liebau A, Pogorzelski O, Salt AN, Plontke SK. Hearing Changes After Intratympanically Applied Steroids for Primary Therapy of Sudden Hearing Loss: A Metaanalysis Using Mathematical Simulations of Drug Delivery Protocols. Otol Neurotol. 2017;38(1):19-30.).</p>
              <p>The team therefore chose dexamethasone at the dose of 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml as it is widely available and clinically used, with an established safety profile and basis for use in the literature. The results of the study will therefore be directly clinically applicable, and any recommendations or resulting policy rapidly translated into practice. </p>
              <p>Regarding the dose choice for dexamethasone, the decision to allow two concentrations of the same drug is a pragmatic one. In the UK most hospitals only stock 3.3mg/ml (the 3.3mg refers to the base rather than the salt). This formulation is labelled 4mg dexamethasone phosphate. Most manufacturers sell the 3.3mg/ml but there are a couple who produce the 3.8mg/ml base (5mg dexamethasone phosphate). </p>
              <p>The dose delivered is volume-based depending on the size of the middle ear cleft, and this may vary considerably between individuals. In addition, the ability to fill the middle ear will depend on location of tympanic membrane puncture and patient positioning, and some patients may clear the drug more quickly depending on Eustachian tube function once sitting up. There is a training video to standardise steroid injection, but there will inevitably be some variation. Given the small volume injected and multiple other variables, allowing the use of both 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml dexamethasone was thought to be reasonable to facilitate the running of the trial and was felt unlikely to be the biggest determinant of dose given. </p>
              <p>The rationale is summarised in Discussion/Choice of interventions. </p>
              <p>Provide explanation why tinnitus and vertigo were not assessed in this study</p>
              <p>Vertigo forms one of the minimisation criteria for matching trial arms.</p>
              <p>Tinnitus and dizziness are key secondary outcomes. They are assessed at baseline and all follow up points via the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefit Questionnaire (VRBQ). </p>
              <p>In addition a measure of tinnitus and dizziness severity will be recorded via visual analogue score (slider) on a weekly basis for those participants using the home hearing test software.</p>

To our knowledge, the presence of tinnitus is not identified as associated with poor or enhanced hearing recovery, beyond an association with severity of hearing loss, which does form one of the minimisation variables.</p>
              <p>2. The schedule of intratympanic injections should be outlined with regard to oral dosing, to be able to discern drug dose/effect ratio.</p>
              <p>As outlined in Methods/Interventions, the first intratympanic injection will be given within ±4 days of starting oral steroids. This flexibility has been built in following consultation with trial sites, as in some sites practical considerations relating to staff and facilities mean further defining the interval would lead to more protocol deviations. Based on feedback we do however expect most participants in the combined intervention arm to receive both oral and intratympanic injections on the same day. Figure 1 (SPIRIT schedule) also provides detail on intervention timing. </p>
              <p>Timing of dosing will be captured in the electronic data capture forms. We will report actual achieved dosing schedules in the primary trial publication. </p>
              <p>3. The PTA prior to IT administration is a fine addition meant to prevent discomfort to the patient, but introduces sampling and measurement bias. I would suggest that all patients receive three injections, to ensure comparability of data.</p>
              <p>This is a valid consideration that we have given thought to. We do not intend to analyse the pre-injection PTA data other than in terms of adherence. It is unclear why there may be measurement bias. We do accept that there may be some site-to-site variability. </p>
              <p>The current protocol reflects current clinical practice, and 3 injections will be delivered unless hearing has fully recovered. It is pragmatic, intentionally replicating standard care, for ease of delivery, acceptability to patients and clinicians and translatability to practice. We understand that in the event of full hearing recovery clinicians and patients would be hesitant to undertake the risk of further injection, and we seek therefore to include as many patients as possible with the current design. </p>
              <p>4. Limiting improvement of PTA to 4 kHz limits the reach of analysis as a primary measure. Traditionally, speech-discriminating frequencies are seen as the most important, but high-frequency hearing loss often causes disturbing tinnitus, and I would suggest including 0.5 - 6 and 8 kHz, as a secondary outcome, to account for that, and then again separately, as proposed in point 4 of functional hearing outcomes section.</p>
              <p>As stated by the reviewer, high frequency hearing thresholds measured by the absolute improvement in pure tone audiogram average across 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 kHz will be reported as a secondary outcome, given their importance in functional hearing. The frequency range for the primary outcome measure chosen reflects that used in other trials on sudden sensorineural hearing loss, enabling future meta-analysis. </p>
              <p>The sample size, adherence and statistic testing are fine.</p>
              <p>Regarding placebo trials and comparison, as well as outcome testing, I would suggest citing the following study: Ajduk J, Peček M, Kelava I, Žaja R, Ries M, Košec A. Comparison of Intratympanic Steroid and Hyperbaric Oxygen Salvage Therapy Hearing Outcomes in Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss: A Retrospective Study. Ear Hear. 2023 Jul-Aug 01;44(4):894-899. doi: 10.1097/AUD.0000000000001338. Epub 2023 Jan 20. PMID: 36693145.</p>
              <p>We were guided in our study design by the international consensus paper for studies on ISSNHL (Marx M, Younes E, Chandrasekhar SS, Ito J, Plontke S, O'Leary S, et al. International consensus (ICON) on treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis. 2018;135(1S):S23-S8). Thank you for highlighting the interesting study you cite, which identifies the main speech-discriminating frequencies as 500 Hz to 4000 Hz, as are covered by our primary outcome. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The study protocol of the multicentre RCT is well written and concise. However, some issues should be considered before publication:</p>
              <p>The manuscript structure and order of reported items should be in line with the “Reporting checklist for protocol of a clinical trial.”, based on the SPIRIT guidelines. It is not clear why the authors deviated from that guideline or checklist.</p>
              <p>The order is that recommended by PLOS one. The SPIRIT checklist is supplied completed with the initial submission. </p>
              <p>It is not clear why the primary outcome is the PTA (0.5-4kHz), while the inclusion was an ISSHL measured at 3 contiguous frequencies. Why could the primary outcome not be aligned to that measure?</p>
              <p>The inclusion criteria and outcome are already aligned, both relating to frequencies of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0kHz. The accepted international definition of sudden sensorineural hearing loss used in our study only requires 3 frequencies to be affected. The current choices align with other work and therefore permit meta-analysis. </p>
              <p>The intervention is not clear. Please specify the actual drugs to be used. Dexamethasone-phosphate has completely different molecular properties to dexamethasone and has different pharmacokinetic properties entering and leaving perilymph (see Salt &amp; Plontke 2020 “Steroid Nomenclature in Inner Ear Therapy”. The same hold for the specification of prednisolone (Prenisolone 21-hemisuccinate, or Prednisolone-succinate?)</p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment, we have amended the text to specify dexamethasone phosphate. In the UK this is the only form of dexamethasone available in the specified preparations. </p>
              <p>We consulted our trials pharmacy team regarding prednisolone. For standard tablets both we and they were unable to see any reference to the salt used in prescribing guidance, or in the British National Formulary. On review of stocked tablets and their packaging, no reference is made to the salt. We do note that the soluble tablets are prednisolone as prednisolone sodium phosphate, and as is oral solution. We therefore have not specified the salt. </p>
              <p>Please clarify the use of 3.3 or 3.8 mg/ml. The dose are quite similar but not equal. Please refer to Chandrasekhar et al 2019. Maybe 10 or better 24 mg/ml would be more appropriated.</p>
              <p>Meta-analysis and simulation shows no evidence that one intratympanic steroid agent or dosing regime is superior over another (Liebau A, Pogorzelski O, Salt AN, Plontke SK. Hearing Changes After Intratympanically Applied Steroids for Primary Therapy of Sudden Hearing Loss: A Metaanalysis Using Mathematical Simulations of Drug Delivery Protocols. Otol Neurotol. 2017;38(1):19-30.). The team therefore chose dexamethasone at the dose of 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml as it is widely available and clinically used in the UK, with an established safety profile and basis for use in the literature. </p>
              <p>A pragmatic approach reflecting clinical practice, allowing either 3.3mg/ml or 3.8mg/ml, aids study delivery, without significantly compromising analysis. The results of the study will therefore be directly clinically applicable, and any recommendations or resulting policy rapidly translated into practice. </p>
              <p>The rationale is summarised in Discussion/Choice of interventions. </p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria: The 30-dB threshold is quite low and low effects of the interventions would be expected (see Fig. 3 in Chen, Halpin, Rauch 2003). It is not clear if the 30 dB are absolute thresholds or relative decrements. In this case please specify the reference. Is it an average over 3 (contig.) frequencies or at every single frequency? Table 1 says “0.5-8.0 kHz”. </p>
              <p>The most frequently used audiometric criterion for SSNHL is a decrease in hearing of 30 decibels affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies. Because premorbid audiometry is generally unavailable, hearing loss is often defined in relation to the opposite ear’s thresholds (Chandrasekhar SS, Tsai Do BS, Schwartz SR, Bontempo LJ, Faucett EA, Finestone SA, et al. Clinical Practice Guideline: Sudden Hearing Loss (Update). Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2019;161(1_suppl):S1-S45.)</p>
              <p>For clarity, the inclusion criteria have been reworded: </p>
              <p>“Diagnosis of new-onset ISSNHL: a new increase in sensorineural thresholds of 30 decibels (dBHL) or greater with onset over a period of 3 days or less according to the patient's history, and affecting each of 3 contiguous pure-tone frequencies (out of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 kilohertz (kHz)) confirmed with a pure tone audiogram. Where audiometry is not available prior to the ISSNHL and there is a history is of equal hearing in both ears prior to the sudden loss, hearing loss will be defined in relation to the opposite ear’s thresholds. Where audiometry is not available prior to the ISSNHL and there is a history of different hearing in both ears prior to the sudden loss, then the candidate can only be included if the ISSNHL occurred in the better hearing ear and the measured thresholds are at least 30dB below the contralateral ear at 3 contiguous pure-tone frequencies (out of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 kilohertz (kHz)) confirmed with a pure tone audiogram.”</p>
              <p>Apologies but we have been unable to find Table 1 stating “0.5-8.0 kHz”. A secondary outcome will be high frequency hearing measured at 4, 6 and 8kHz. </p>
              <p>The measurement of the VRBQ, TFI, HUI3 and ICECAP-A are very good choices to make the study results worth.</p>
              <p>The „extent of hearing recovery“ has to be explained in more detail. Why was the 50% AB-phonems criterion used? At which sound pressure level?</p>
              <p>The outcome requires 50% at any intensity. The assessment will start at 30dB above the PTA average and intensity will be increased until the maximum score is reached. This is detailed in the associated supplementary material full protocol, but has now also been added to the text in Materials and Methods/Outcomes. </p>
              <p>50% was chosen as this is generally agreed to be a predictor of hearing aid benefit, and has been used as such in AAO-HNS guidance and some SSNHL studies. The literature regarding SSNHL is limited in this area, but 50% is more commonly cited as being the minimum score to achieve success with hearing aids in vestibular schwannoma populations.</p>
              <p>Adverse events (Figure 1) have to be reported over the entire trial period, starting with the first drug application.</p>
              <p>The study is not blinded and no placebo is used. This is a large risk for bias. Please discuss this issue also in the context of other similar trials, e.g., Plontke et al. 2022 ( <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-022-01184-8" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-022-01184-8</ext-link> ).</p>
              <p>The study is single blinded and primary outcome measurements will be made by blinded assessors. Participant blinding is not feasible without placebo. </p>
              <p>The lack of placebo is discussed in Discussion/Limitations of the study. As outlined here, ‘during patient and public consultation, potential trial participants said they would not accept randomisation to no treatment, making a trial including a placebo-only arm non-viable’. </p>
              <p>We have expanded this section to include: “It would be possible to give placebo tablets to the intratympanic steroid only group, and a placebo/sham injection to the tablet-only group, but in the case of injection this would increase participant risk without potential therapeutic benefit. Incorporating placebo treatments would also result in an increase in study cost and complexity, with potentially limited gain. It was concluded that the single blinding approach was adequate, given the relatively objective nature of the primary outcome in the form of a pure tone audiogram. It is accepted however that certain outcomes, such as those collected using patient reported outcome measures, could be impacted by participant awareness of their allocated intervention.” </p>
              <p>Thank you for highlighting the cited study. There are no doubt cultural and other differences that may permit this work in other countries, and participant acceptance is a fascinating aspect of study design. </p>

              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PONE-D-23-24534: Response to peer review</p>
              <p>Protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial of STeroid Administration Routes For Idiopathic Sudden sensorineural Hearing loss: the STARFISH trial</p>
              <p>We thank the academic editor and reviewers for their further review of our manuscript. We have addressed these individually below.</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for the revision, I have no further issues to discuss. The authors have made all of the required changes and I would be happy to support publication.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Dear authors. Thank you for considering the reviewer comments. I fully understand that substantial modifications of the study protocol are not possible anymore. My question about my role as reviewer in this context was unfortunatly not answered by the editors. If focussing on the manuscript I have no further comments and wish good success when conducting the study!</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: In this study protocol, a three-arm randomized control trial with an initial pilot study is being proposed. The primary outcome will be absolute improvement in pure tone audiogram at 12-weeks. Cost effectiveness will also be compared among the three arms.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- The standard statistical term for average is mean.</p>
              <p>While we agree, pure tone average is the commonplace term in both research and clinical practice when describing the outcome of audiometry and so has been used in this work. </p>
              <p>2- Indicate if adverse events will be collected according to a standardized format.</p>
              <p>SAEs will be collected according to a standardised format on our SAE form and that AEs relevant to the interventions will be recorded according to a standardized format on our CRFs. </p>
              <p>3- In the mixed-effect linear model indicate the type of underlying covariance structure that will be used or the method for selecting it.</p>
              <p>We will be using a compound symmetry covariance structure for the mixed-effect linear model. This has been added to the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>4- For the adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, state the variables that will be used for adjusting or the method that will be applied to determine which variable will be included.</p>
              <p>All analysis will be adjusted for the minimisation variables as fixed effects (except site which will be included as a random effect). This has been added to the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>5- Identify the software that will be used to capture the data as well as the software that will be used for the statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>Statistical analysis will be undertaken in Stata version 18 (or higher) and/or SAS software, version 9.4 (or higher). This has been added to the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>6- To assist in the review process, add line numbers to the document.</p>
              <p>Line numbers have been added</p>

              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>
