                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Alcohol-related hospital admissions have doubled in the last ten years to &gt; 1.2 m per year in England. High-need, high-cost (HNHC) alcohol-related frequent attenders (ARFA) are a relatively small subgroup of patients, having multiple admissions or attendances from alcohol during a short time period. This trial aims to test the effectiveness of an assertive outreach treatment (AOT) approach in improving clinical outcomes for ARFA, and reducing resource use in the acute setting.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">One hundred and sixty ARFA patients will be recruited and following baseline assessment, randomly assigned to AOT plus care as usual (CAU) or CAU alone in equal numbers. Baseline assessment includes alcohol consumption and related problems, physical and mental health comorbidity and health and social care service use in the previous 6 months using standard validated tools, plus a measure of resource use. Follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months after randomization includes the same tools as baseline plus standard measure of patient satisfaction. Outcomes for CAU + AOT and CAU at 6 and 12 months will be compared, controlling for pre-specified baseline measures. Primary outcome will be percentage of days abstinent at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include emergency department (ED) attendance, number and length of hospital admissions, alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, other health service use, mental and physical comorbidity 6 and 12 months post intervention. Health economic analysis will estimate the economic impact of AOT from health, social care and societal perspectives and explore cost-effectiveness in terms of quality adjusted life years and alcohol consumption at 12-month follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">AOT models piloted with alcohol dependent patients have demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol consumption and use of unplanned National Health Service (NHS) care, with increased engagement with alcohol treatment services, compared with patients receiving CAU. While AOT interventions are costlier per case than current standard care in the UK, the rationale for targeting HNHC ARFAs is because of their disproportionate contribution to overall alcohol burden on the NHS. No previous studies have evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of AOT for HNHC ARFAs: this randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting ARFAs across five South London NHS Trusts is the first.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par36">Worldwide, alcohol use was the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life year) in 2016, accounting for 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths. In 2016, alcohol use led to 2.8 million deaths worldwide and was the leading risk factor for premature death and disability among people aged 15–49 years. Alcohol use accounts for nearly 10% of global deaths among populations aged 15–49 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">In the UK, alcohol use disorders are a major public health challenge: it is the leading cause of preventable disability in working age men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the third greatest risk factor for years lived with disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Deaths from liver disease have increased by over 400% since the 1970s in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and predicted to overtake cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death by 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">The UK Department of Health estimates that alcohol costs the NHS in England £3.5bn per annum, 80% of which is incurred in inpatient and emergency care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the wider annual costs to society in England are estimated to be considerably greater at £21bn, £11bn of which is incurred by the criminal justice system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">Alcohol-related hospital admissions have doubled in the last 10 years to over 1.1 m per annum in England, a quarter (337,000) of which were for conditions wholly attributable to alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Reducing alcohol related admissions is a key public health target and is an indicator in the Public Health Outcomes Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. High-need, high-cost (HNHC) alcohol related frequent attenders (ARFAs) are a subgroup of all patients with alcohol-related hospital admissions and are characterised by having multiple hospital admissions or attendances caused by alcohol<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> during a relatively short time period. Whilst there is no single universal definition for an ARFA, for the purposes of this trial we defined an ARFA as someone who has had two or more admissions in any of the participating NHS trusts for at least one wholly attributable alcohol diagnoses within a 1 year period, OR; has had at least ten presentations to an emergency department in any of the participating NHS trusts within a 1 year period, OR; has at least four presentations to an emergency department in any of the participating NHS trusts within a month, OR; has been admitted at least once for a wholly attributable alcohol diagnosis and had at least four presentations to an emergency department in any of the participating NHS trusts within a 1 year period.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Previous studies show that the HNHC ARFA patient group typically have high levels of multimorbidity, including both physical and mental illness, social isolation, poor quality of life, unstable housing or homelessness, high criminal justice involvement, unemployment and living on benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Notably, they either have poor or no engagement with existing specialist alcohol treatment services. Their Accident and Emergency Department (A&amp;E) attendance is frequent, often due to not being registered with a General Practitioner (GP), and they have frequent emergency hospital admissions to both acute and mental health beds. Qualitative research has also identified that as a group ARFAs experience high levels of stigma and social exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">An intensive assertive outreach treatment (AOT) intervention has been developed to target the patients who have the highest alcohol related hospital attendance. AOT is based on a model of community service provision originally designed for people with severe mental illness (SMI) and was first pioneered by the work of Stein and Test (1980) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. AOT emphasises active engagement over an extended period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and has several features which distinguish it from usual care, including: (i) rapid access to services, (ii) a small caseload, (iii) a high ratio of community to office-based appointments, (iv) assertive engagement (e.g. with multiple attempts) and (v) a shared care approach, with care coordinators working within a multidisciplinary team that meets frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In adult mental health care, AOT (sometimes also referred to as Assertive Community Treatment) is an extensively researched and widely used model of care for treating difficult to engage patients with severe and enduring mental illness. AOT and its elements have also been used in the treatment of alcohol dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] which clinically, like severe and enduring mental illness, also often presents as a chronic relapsing disorder with high public health costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An AOT model implemented with alcohol dependent patients, demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol consumption and use of unplanned NHS care, as well as increased engagement with alcohol treatment services, compared with patients receiving care as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A national survey of AOT services for ARFAs in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] found 76 services across England offering AOT for ARFAs between December 2015 and June 2016. The majority included a multi-disciplinary team and offered extended support including advice on housing, mental and physical health in addition to alcohol treatment, however there was considerable variation amongst the models of care delivered and no previous RCTs have evaluated their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par42">While AOT interventions are more costly per case than current standard care in the UK, the rationale for targeting HNHC ARFAs is that they incur a disproportionately high amount of the overall alcohol burden on the NHS. Hence the potential savings to the NHS, as well as to wider social and criminal justice services, from a successful intervention outcome are greater than other less intensive interventions for less complex patients.</p>

                <p id="Par56">Patients in the intervention arm of the study will receive AOT in addition to usual care. AOT will incorporate the following elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]:

The AOT model has abstinence from alcohol as its ultimate clinical goal.

                <p id="Par66">AOT will be used to proactively engage with ARFA patients, to assess their physical and mental health and wider social needs, then to develop shared treatment goals, and to facilitate and coordinate engagement with the relevant care and support to address their multiple presenting needs. The AOT will mainly take place either in the patient’s home or local community settings.

CAU typically involves treatment of presenting physical or mental health problems and referral to specialist addiction services for ongoing help with alcohol related problems. Patients receiving CAU have access to medical detoxification, psychological interventions targeting drinking behaviour and aftercare, which are usually provided by specialist addiction services. But in contrast to AOT, the emphasis will be on the patient’s own motivation to engage with available services. Specialist input from addictions psychiatry, clinical psychology and social work may also be a part of CAU but the assertive and regular nature of contacts in AOT does not feature.</p>

                <p id="Par89">The AOT clinical team will work with informatics teams in the five NHS trusts (King’s College Hospital (KCH)-, Guy’s and St Thomas’ (GST)-, South London and Maudsley (SLaM)- and St George’s Healthcare (STG)- NHS Foundation Trusts; and Lewisham and Greenwich (LGT) NHS Trust) to identify HNHC ARFA based on primary or secondary clinical diagnoses of alcohol related admissions and number of admissions or emergency department attendances in the previous 12 months. This will also include the use of the clinical research information system (CRIS) within SLaM. The clinical team will also have access to electronic clinical records and discuss potentially eligible patients with clinicians in inpatient units in the five trusts, and the Alcohol Care Teams at KCH, STG and GST, to identify additional patients who meet the study criteria but are not captured by diagnostic criteria in electronic records.</p>
                <p id="Par90">Once potentially eligible patients have been identified, they will be contacted by the AOT clinical team and assessed for eligibility and informed about the potential to participate in the trial. They will be given the Patient Information Sheet and the trial will be explained verbally. Patients will be encouraged to ask questions or consult carers, relatives or their GP. If willing to proceed, eligible patients will be introduced to a member of the research team who will again explain the trial, confirm the patient’s eligibility, and obtain informed consent. The minimum period of time between informing the patients of the trial and obtaining consent will be 24 h. Patients unwilling to take part will be offered the standard CAU, including referral to local specialist addiction services.</p>
                <p id="Par91">Patients who provide informed consent will undergo a baseline research assessment conducted by the research team and will be randomised using an electronic trial management tool. In order to maintain blinding of researchers, the treatment allocation will be provided only to the AOT clinical team who will then initiate AOT treatment or referral to specialist addictions services as appropriate.</p>

                <p id="Par108">The primary outcome of the RCT is percent days abstinent using validated Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) interview method over a 90-day reference period at 12 months post-recruitment, which is the gold standard in alcohol treatment research. Similar studies have used effect sizes of 0.3–0.5 in their sample size calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We propose using an effect size of 0.4, alongside type 1 error rate, α = 0.05 and type 2 error rate, β = 0.8 and using a two-sided test. This indicates a sample size of 64 patients each in intervention and control group included in the analysis at the primary end-point. In order to address potential loss to follow-up we have incorporated a loss of 20%, larger than previous studies such as ACTAD that had a loss to follow-up of 7% at 12 months but smaller than UKATT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] that has a 28% loss at 12 months. This inflates the required sample size at recruitment to 80 in each group a total of 160 at baseline with the expectation that at least 64 in each group, a total of 128, will be followed up at 12 months.</p>

                <p id="Par110">The economic evaluation will estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of CAU + AOT compared with CAU alone over the 12-month follow-up. The primary economic evaluation will take a societal perspective including the use of all health and social care services, plus productivity losses (time off work due to illness) and criminal justice sector resources, known to be of particular importance in drug and alcohol populations. Whilst the NHS/personal social services perspective is generally preferred by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the inclusion of criminal justice sector resources is recognised by NICE as an appropriate extension for drug and alcohol treatment evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">Resource use data is being measured using a version of the AD-SUS which was developed for addiction and alcohol use disorder populations in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The AD-SUS is completed in interview with participants at baseline (covering the previous 6 months) and at 6 and 12-month follow-up (covering the period since previous interview). Appropriate unit costs will be applied to all resource elements reported by participants to calculate the total cost per participant. The AOT intervention will be costed directly, taking a micro-costing approach and nationally applicable unit costs will be applied to all other health and social care services used (for example, NHS Trust reference costs and the Personal Social Services Research Unit Costs of Health and Social Care compendium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Criminal activity will be costed using existing Home Office estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], uprated as appropriate, unless newer estimates become available. Productivity losses will be valued using the human capital approach, which involves multiplying time off work due to illness by an appropriate wage rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par112">Health utility is being measured with the EQ-5D-5 L (five dimensions, five levels) version of the EuroQol measure of health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D is a measure capable of generating quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for use in economic evaluations and will be used in the primary economic evaluation exploring cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per QALY. Responses will generate health states that utility weights can then be applied to and QALYs will be calculated using the total area under the curve approach. EQ-5D-5 L is a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D, measuring health-related quality of life and has been used extensively in previous alcohol studies in the UK (e.g. UKATT Research Team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]).</p>
                <p id="Par113">Two economic evaluations will be carried out: a cost-utility analysis using quality adjusted life years calculated from the EQ-5D-5 L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] using the area under the curve approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] (primary) and a cost-effectiveness analysis using the primary clinical measure of the RCT, percentage days abstinent in the past 90 days using the Time Line Follow Back interview (secondary). Cost-effectiveness will be assessed through the calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) – the additional costs of one intervention compared to another divided by the additional effects of one intervention compared to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Uncertainty will be represented by cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

In line with the clinical analyses, all economic analyses will be conducted by intention to treat principles with stratification variables, SADQ and site as covariates and multiple imputation by chained equations to account for missing data.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par115">AOT models piloted with alcohol dependent patients have demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol consumption and use of unplanned NHS care, with increased engagement with alcohol treatment services, compared with patients receiving CAU. While AOT interventions are more costly per case than current standard care in the UK, the rationale for targeting HNHC ARFA is because of their disproportionate contribution to the overall alcohol burden on the NHS. No previous studies have evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of AOT for HNHC ARFA: this RCT targeting ARFA across five South London NHS Trusts is the first to do so.</p>
              <p id="Par116">The inclusion criteria changed during recruitment to also include patients with alcohol related frequent emergency department attendances. In practice, this resulted in an increase in recruitment across the participating NHS trusts. Assessments completed by the AOT clinical team during the first 6 months of recruitment revealed that some participants had few inpatient hospital admissions in a year, but frequently attended an emergency department for alcohol related reasons, often choosing to leave before discharge. A high number of emergency department attendances with no resulting inpatient hospital admission incur costs of similar proportions to an inpatient hospital admission which are of importance to the economic analysis undertaken in the trial. A full amendment was approved to recruit from this patient population.</p>
              <p id="Par117">As far as we are aware, this is the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate AOT approaches for high cost high need alcohol related frequent attenders. The main strength of the study is that participants are randomized to receive the intervention or care as usual (control). By randomly allocating ARFA to control or intervention groups the impact of confounders (such as age, gender, ethnicity, levels of engagement with other services) as a source of bias are equally distributed between the intervention and control groups, and therefore minimised. The blinding of the researchers to treatment allocations reduces reporting bias. The economic analysis is carried out to include criminal justice sector resources which is recognised as an appropriate extension for drug and alcohol treatment evaluations.</p>
              <p id="Par118">Limitations include the potential of loss of subjects to follow-up. To reduce this risk, most data collection takes place in the subject’s home or community environment. In this hard to reach cohort of interest, if loss to follow-up does occur, using multiple imputation to account for missing data will help minimize this impact. Another potential challenge is maintaining the researcher’s blindness to treatment allocation, which is an acknowledged problem in psychosocial intervention trials. Researchers will advise participants not to discuss their ongoing treatment arrangements or the identity of their key worker or service and will conduct the TLFB measure before discussing service utilisation. The clinical complexity of the HNHC ARFA means that many experience mental health problems, homelessness and drug addiction and a limitation of our study is that by the nature of our exclusion criteria, we are not testing the efficacy of AOT on certain subgroups of the HNHC ARFA population. Consideration will need to be given as to whether the full extent of clinical and economic benefits have been completely realised within the 12 month follow up period; and how rates of death in both groups and signposting to health services impact on overall costs.</p>
