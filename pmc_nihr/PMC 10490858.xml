                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Implicit Learning in Stroke study was a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial, investigating the use of different motor learning strategies in acute stroke rehabilitation. Participating Stroke Units (n = 8) were from the South East/West regions of the UK, with the experimental intervention (implicit learning) being delivered by clinical teams. It required therapists to change how they gave instructions and feedback to patients during rehabilitation. This paper reports the processes underpinning implementation of the implicit learning intervention. The evaluation aimed to i) understand how therapists made sense of, engaged with and interpreted the effects of the intervention; ii) compare this to the experience reported by patients; iii) extrapolate learning of broader relevance to the design and conduct of research involving complex interventions in stroke rehabilitation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>How therapists made sense of and experienced the intervention impacted how it was implemented. The intervention was delivered by individual therapists, and was influenced by their individual values, beliefs and concerns. However, how teams worked together to build a shared (team) understanding, also played a key role. Teams with a more “flexible” interpretation, reported the view that the intervention could have benefits in a wide range of scenarios. Those with a more fixed, “rule based” interpretation, found it harder to implement, and perceived the benefits to be more limited. Therapists’ concerns that the intervention may impair therapeutic relationships and patient learning were not reflected in how patients experienced it.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Changing practice, whether in a research study or in the “real world”, is complex. Understanding the process of implementation is crucial to effective research delivery. Implementation frameworks facilitate understanding, and subsequently the systematic and iterative development of strategies for this to be addressed. How teams (rather than individuals) work together is central to how complex interventions are understood and implemented. It is possible that new complex interventions work best in contexts where there are ‘flexible’ cultures. Researchers should consider, and potentially measure this, before they can effectively implement and evaluate an intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Implicit Learning in Stroke Study (IMPS) was a mixed methods, pilot cluster-randomised controlled trial, investigating the impact of implicit learning principles on the recovery of lower limb motor function in sub-acute stroke rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Implicit learning targets the non-conscious attributes of the motor learning process, [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] leading to learning without awareness. This differs from “usual care” rehabilitation, which is known to be explicit in nature, i.e. therapists typically use frequent, detailed, body focussed instructions and feedback [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>The IMPS study involved eight acute stroke units (SU’s) in the UK, who were cluster randomised to either adopt principles of implicit learning during rehabilitation (n = 4), or continue with usual care (n = 4). Here we report findings from a nested qualitative study, which sought to understand therapist perceptions of implementing, and patient experiences of receiving, the implicit learning approach.</p>
              <p>The challenge of implementing research findings within stroke rehabilitation is well documented [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Reasons for this are multifaceted, and are influenced by the complex nature of most rehabilitation interventions–which typically involve various components, require expertise to deliver, and must be flexible enough to meet the specific needs of the individual [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Few stroke rehabilitation studies have used implementation science theories to comprehensively understand these factors during trial delivery, limiting the potential to support effective knowledge translation into practice. Improving understanding of the factors impacting implementation at this pilot stage will ensure the intervention is developed to be workable in practice, and enable robust design of a future definitive trial.</p>
              <p>Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), which identifies, characterises and explains key mechanisms that motivate and shape implementation, was used to underpin this research [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282612.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. NPT explains how people make sense of the work of implementing and integrating a complex intervention (coherence); how they engage with it (cognitive participation); enact it (collective action); and appraise its effects (reflexive monitoring) [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. NPT has been used widely to describe and explain the implementation of complex interventions that already have a research evidence base [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], including in stroke rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we use NPT to explore how a research intervention is experienced by those delivering it and undergoing it, to understand the impact of this on trial fidelity.</p>
              <p>The purposes of this qualitative evaluation were to: i) understand how therapists made sense of, engaged with and interpreted the effects of the IMPS intervention; ii) compare this to the experience reported by patients; iii) inform future research design and potential translation into practice; and iv) extrapolate learning of broader relevance to the design and conduct of research involving complex interventions in stroke rehabilitation.</p>

                <p>In the pilot cRCT [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], therapists delivering implicit learning received training (2.5 hours) and a handbook containing information on the theory and principles of implicit learning, and examples for how this could be applied in practice (including images and video). The principles of implicit learning, as applied in this research, involved: a) reducing the frequency of verbal instructions during therapy sessions; b) increasing the specificity of feedback, and c) adapting tasks <italic toggle="yes">and</italic> communication to promote an external focus of attention [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The intervention was not prescriptive; therapists were asked to adapt their practice for the individual patient(s) they worked with, whilst staying true to these principles. The full treatment guidance is available in <xref rid="pone.0282612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p>
                <p>This paper reports findings from the nested qualitative evaluation. Focus groups with trial therapists at intervention sites explored implementation of the IMPS intervention. Focus groups were chosen to enable the intervention teams to collectively discuss and debate, generating rich details of the complex experiences and reasoning behind actions, beliefs, perceptions and attitudes [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Semi-structured interviews explored patients’ experience of therapy in both the intervention and the control groups, enabling comparison between study arms, and with the perceptions of therapists. Data collected through both focus groups and interviews were considered collectively to meet study aims.</p>

                  <title>Setting and subjects</title>
                  <p>Focus groups (n = 4), one at each intervention site, were conducted with a convenience sample of participating physiotherapists, occupational therapists and therapy assistants. They took place at the end of the trial, when therapists had between 3 and 15 months experience of using the intervention. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the time period between the recruitment phase of the cluster trial, and focus group data collection, ranged between 1–12 months.</p>
                  <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of patient participants. Interviews took place within 7 days of completion of trial interventions; ensuring participants had recent experience of rehabilitation to draw on.</p>

                  <title>Focus groups</title>
                  <p>All intervention sites were invited, and agreed, to participate. Individual therapists and therapy assistants were provided with information about this aspect of the study. Those agreeing to participate provided written informed consent.</p>
                  <p>Face to face focus groups were facilitated by the lead researcher (LJ). Groups lasted approximately one hour, and followed a topic guide, broadly structured around the NPT framework (<xref rid="pone.0282612.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). Groups were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An observer recorded non-verbal aspects of the discussion.</p>
                  <p>Focus group transcripts were analysed by two researchers (LJ and JM)–allowing for sense checking of ideas, and the exploration of multiple assumptions and interpretations, rather than for consensus of meaning. Following data familiarisation, a hybrid approach [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] of both inductive and theory driven analysis was used. Both researchers independently coded the first transcript inductively, then met to discuss and agree an initial set of semantic codes; allowing identification of the explicit or surface meaning of the data, and describing the content as communicated by the respondents [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This was used to formulate a coding framework. The two researchers then independently applied the agreed codes to a second transcript and met again to discuss any new codes.</p>
                  <p>Data then underwent theory-driven analysis, guided by the four main constructs of NPT [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The semantic codes were categorised and tabulated according to the most relevant construct, as per Coupe et al. [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Transcripts were revisited multiple times, moving back and forth between deductive and inductive coding. Where hidden meanings or underlying assumptions were identified, latent codes were applied. This enabled analysis to move beyond a purely descriptive approach [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], through the identification of ideas or ideologies that could inform interpretation of the descriptive (or semantic) data [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This mixed data analysis generated a rich and detailed understanding of the underpinning meaning of the data. Once the final coding framework was agreed, the primary researcher (LJ) revisited all four transcripts to re-label data, and to extract and collate findings.</p>

                  <title>Interviews</title>
                  <p>Patient participants were approached by a local clinician, who provided written information about the purpose of the interviews. Those willing to participate discussed the study with the lead researcher (LJ). All research participants provided informed written consent to take part, including consent for the use of anonymised quotes in study publications.</p>
                  <p>Face to face interviews took place, in hospital (n = 17) or in the patient’s home (n = 2), no later than 7 days post-intervention. A topic guide was used to structure the discussion (<xref rid="pone.0282612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). Interviews were audio recorded, and reflective notes made and incorporated into the analysis [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
                  <p>Interview analysis was conducted by the lead researcher (LJ), using a thematic approach as outlined by Braun and Clark (2021) [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analysis took an experiential orientation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], prioritising how each style of therapy (implicit learning or usual care) was experienced by the participant. Initial coding was predominantly inductive; codes were transferred onto a spreadsheet, with a label identifying the participant and group (intervention or control). Codes were then considered collectively, to interpret meaning and meaningfulness across the dataset. At this stage, connections were also made to the focus group themes; with interview (patient) data being broadly mapped to the focus group (clinician) data. This process of reviewing and comparing the two datasets underwent several iterations, informed by discussion with the wider study team (SD and JM).</p>
                  <p>Here, we report aspects of the patient data that we could ‘cross-reference’ to focus group themes, enabling us to understand what therapists <italic toggle="yes">thought</italic> might be occurring for patients, and how patients actually experienced this. As part of the analytic process, interview and focus group data were discussed for reflective purposes with a third researcher (SD).</p>

                <p>These therapist-driven values were at odds with the experience of patients, who were consistently positive about their therapy, with no negative perceptions of communication style.

                  <p>Therapists understood the core components of implicit learning, but demonstrated differences in the degree to which they understood the underpinning motor learning theory. This resulted in variances in how they contextualised the approach, and their interpretation of its practical application. These differences appeared to be created within teams, rather than by individuals. Broadly speaking, teams understood the approach to be either a set of:</p>

                  <p>Teams (n = 2) that reported working together in an organised and collective way to understand the approach (communal specification) adopted the “flexible view”. It was within these teams that we noted greater and richer discussion. Therapists were more likely to discuss, critique, and reflect on the approach if they did so collectively. Through doing so, they built a greater theoretical understanding, and a more positive and solution focussed approach to application, which they were able to apply in a range of scenarios.</p>

                  <p>Conversely, in focus groups reporting a more “rules based” approach, we observed less dynamic conversation and debate, and the views of clinical leaders typically dominated the discussion. These “rules based” teams (n = 2), described implicit learning as less coherent with their views of ‘good’ therapy, particularly in relation to handling “handling” is as general term used in neurological rehabilitation to describe the provision of manual support from a therapist(s), during movement. This may be to ensure patient safety, to provide feedback (e.g. sensory), or to guide and facilitate movement., movement quality and functional task practice.</p>
                  <p>Handling is not inherently counter to an implicit approach, and there was nothing within the training or treatment guidance relating to this; however, most therapists saw the implicit approach as being “hands-off”. Handling was viewed by some as a separate therapeutic approach, and individuals reflected that they didn’t know how to incorporate handling alongside implicit principles. This was a contentious issue within the “rules based” groups, where clinicians placed high value on the importance of handling; and felt that this was compromised by implicit learning principles. These views were not challenged or debated more widely within those groups.</p>

                  <p>Movement “quality” was also raised as a specific challenge.

Interestingly, patients also commented on the quality of movement, and of needing to <italic toggle="yes">“get it right”</italic>, but they did not perceive movement quality to have the same importance as therapists.</p>

                  <p>Therapists also discussed the importance of making therapy functional, but held conflicting views on how ‘function’ sits within the explicit-implicit continuum. Some viewed a functional approach as closely aligned to implicit learning; others found it hard to apply the principles in a functional context. Two focus groups indicated that it was difficult to meet their therapeutic aim of making all tasks functional using an implicit approach, but could not illuminate how this would be easier with an explicit approach.</p>

                <p>All groups recognised that applying implicit learning required a new skill set, and that true implementation required expertise. Implicit principles became easier to apply and adapt with experience. Deeper understanding of the approach may come with greater exposure, but the opportunity for advanced training was suggested as a necessary enabler for sustainability. Interestingly, the more therapists tried to work with the approach, the more they realised that it required expertise to integrate into practice–something that hadn’t been anticipated at the outset.</p>

                <p>Teams who expressed more positive opinions of the implicit approach also reported a greater willingness to initiate a change in their practice; this seemed to arise from genuine intrigue and interest in trying to change their behaviour.

                <p>These differences appeared to partly relate to how far this approach deviated from individual therapist’s preferred therapeutic style.

                <p>Repeatedly, the terms “ease of applying” and “applicability” were used interchangeably. The approach was perceived as beneficial if it was easy (for the therapists) to apply, and the wrong approach if it was harder (for the therapists) to apply.

Instead, effectiveness was judged on how much time and effort the therapist needed to dedicate to planning treatment sessions.</p>

However, it was unclear how aware of this therapists were, and the potential role that understanding rules (through self-report from patients) could have on building or reinforcing collective action.</p>
                <p>Some therapists discussed how they might adapt the approach to further implementation, or what they might need to know in order to do this. This reconfiguration work only came from those teams who had been flexible in how they interpreted the approach; and were therefore more readily able to think about its fit within their practice. These teams discussed who the approach might work for, and differentiated the actual treatment session from other aspects of the physiotherapists role.</p>

                <p>Activities relating to coherence–the sense making work—occurred early in the process of implementation. At this stage, teams broadly fell into one of two groups, with more fixed (rule based) or more flexible (principle based) interpretations. This early formation of understanding impacted on how individuals and teams went on to enact the approach, and how they interpreted its value. The “rule-based” teams typically perceived the approach to conflict with their professional values, particularly with regards to their role as a therapist, and their relationship with patients. Teams that developed this view reported implicit learning to be more challenging to apply, and as a result perceived it to be beneficial in a narrow range of clinical contexts. This fed into the view that it conflicted with professional values, which became a barrier to implementation.</p>
                <p>The “flexible” therapists reported more activity that aligned with communal specification (working together to form a shared understanding) and also discussed a commitment to making the approach work (endeavour). The dynamic within these focus groups was more collaborative, with senior clinicians facilitating others to contribute their views, and a more open and questioning culture. These groups appeared to find it less challenging to apply the approach; and reported a belief that it could have benefits in a wide range of contexts. These teams also developed their thinking further in terms of reflexive monitoring, reporting more in-depth communal and individual specification. Subsequently, they also reported activities that would align to (hypothetical) reconfiguration–appraising the intervention in a way that would lead them to redefine or shape it to enable sustainability in future practice</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Using Normalisation Process Theory, we have described the process of implementing a complex rehabilitation intervention, within the context of a research trial. Understanding implementation in trials is an important aspect of feasibility and pilot work. An improved understanding of the implementation process will enhance the earlier stages of trial design, and will maximise future potential for translation of findings into clinical care.</p>
              <p>We identified behaviours that mapped to all four constructs of NPT, with coherence and cognitive participation as dominant themes. We found the initial phase of coherence to be the starting point for implementation. The “work” that happened during this phase appeared to predict how subsequent stages of implementation played out. This may be due, in part, to the linear nature of research; where activities typically occur sequentially, in line with a pre-defined protocol.</p>

                <title>Using implementation frameworks to maximise intervention fidelity</title>
                <p>Whilst there is recognition of the importance of measuring and reporting intervention fidelity within complex intervention trials [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], evidence to guide researchers on <italic toggle="yes">how</italic> to achieve fidelity is limited [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Proposed models typically focus on process, ensuring that: the intervention is comprehensively described; training is standardised; practitioner competence is assessed; and methods are in place for monitoring delivery [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although these factors were in place in our trial, we still identified differences in how teams interpreted, engaged with, and delivered the intervention. Our findings suggest that complex rehabilitation intervention research should consider the on-going process of implementation, not solely the end point of fidelity. Trial designs may need to actively facilitate implementation, particularly monitoring and supporting coherence and cognitive participation.</p>
                <p>The context for this study was a randomised controlled trial in stroke rehabilitation. Implementation frameworks are typically used in both research and real-world projects to understand the process of implementation of <bold>proven interventions</bold> [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282612.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They provide a structure for: describing and/or guiding the process of translating effective interventions and research evidence into practice (process frameworks); analysing what influences implementation outcomes (determinant frameworks); and evaluating implementation efforts (outcome frameworks) [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This study investigated implementation of, and fidelity to, an <bold>experimental intervention</bold>, within a research trial, demonstrating the key role of implementation frameworks in experimental research; assisting researchers to consider wider factors influencing implementation, and how these may be facilitated to optimise fidelity. For example, training delivery may need to be phased and adaptive, accounting for the fact that coherence is an on-going process, and is different between individuals and between teams. Recognising that healthcare professionals’ decision making is most often informed by their interaction with each other and with opinion leaders [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and that communal specification played an important role in how teams made sense of the intervention in our study, activities that encourage this should be built into the study design. Actively facilitating reflexive activities for teams, for example through case reviews or action learning sets, could also benefit implementation.</p>
                <p>The importance of understanding specifically how the intervention interacts within the context in which it is implemented, is now recognised as integral to complex intervention research [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these nuanced social factors of intervention delivery are rarely considered in stroke rehabilitation trials. To deliver a new intervention, a healthcare organisation (or service) needs to be <italic toggle="yes">willing</italic> (e.g., committed) and <italic toggle="yes">able</italic> (e.g., capable) to embrace the required change [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Whilst there are theories and tools to aid understanding of readiness for implementation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0282612.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], these are not specific to research contexts. Understanding the readiness of potential research sites to implement a new intervention could inform site selection and/or help to shape a more bespoke approach to implementation support. Developing a trial specific survey to understand a) previous attitudes towards innovation and b) readiness or intention to implement the new trial interventions, may be a useful starting point. Where potentially inflexible cultures are identified, a more tailored programme of support, informed by behaviour change theory, may be required.</p>

                <title>The influence of clinician values, beliefs and attitudes on implementation</title>
                <p>Complex interventions are often reliant on changing the behaviour of clinicians. In our study, clinicians were interested in the approach and committed to participating in the research, but implementation was impacted by professional values, and attitudes toward the intervention varied. Whether teams were flexible or rule-bound was key to the extent that the intervention was accepted and implemented, and could be reflective of the wider culture within the Units. Values played a dominant role in how the intervention was perceived, understood, and subsequently delivered. The role of an “opinion leader” was evident in how teams constructed their understanding of the approach, and subsequently how they engaged with it. Specifically, the values expressed by those in clinical leadership positions influenced the views expressed by others within the group.</p>
                <p>The issue of implementation fidelity being moderated by clinicians beliefs or concerns about interventions has been reported elsewhere in the stroke rehabilitation literature [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Success of implementation can be determined by the congruence or `fit’ of an intervention with the pre-existing beliefs of those delivering it [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some participants’ existing beliefs inhibited delivery of the intervention. Importantly, this was not universal; there were also examples of participants who understood and adopted the intervention in an insightful way, supported by teams who were flexible and creative. Whether implementation is taking place within a research trial or clinical, practice, factors relating to attitudes and beliefs must be identified and practically addressed.</p>

                <title>The contrasting views of therapists and patients</title>
                <p>Therapists discussed the significance and value of the “therapeutic relationship” they hold with patients, highlighting the importance of building rapport and creating trust in their clinical expertise. This has been reported elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and is likely to have a positive association with clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, therapists were asked to alter their communication style specifically during active therapy (i.e. when patients were exercising or practicing tasks; and in relation to those exercises/tasks), with the hypothesis that more concise, specific, and externally focussed communication can aid the process of motor learning. Some therapists expressed discomfort with making these changes to communication style, citing the impact they perceived it may have on therapeutic relationships, or on movement quality. Patients, however, did not express any concerns about the relationship or quality of therapy. This raises questions about whether therapists could do more to understand what type of communication works best for individual patients, how their learning preferences can be taken into account. Studies investigating intensive exercise [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and self-directed upper limb rehabilitation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] have also identified therapist concerns about new ways of working that are not reflected in patient experiences or outcomes. This suggests that an iterative process of implementation support may be necessary, feeding data (including patient views) back to therapists, allowing their concerns to be allayed.</p>

              <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
              <p>The use of a theoretical framework to understand the process of implementation within a research study enabled the systematic and comprehensive understanding of the processes underlying implementation, meaning results are more likely to be transferable to similar contexts. As Units participating in this study were from one geographically defined region (Southern UK), it is not known if or how the findings would differ in other settings, for example those with greater social or cultural diversity. One criticism of NPT is that it focuses primarily on the action of professionals, and does not take into account a range of perspectives, including the role that end users (e.g. patients) may play in implementation [<xref rid="pone.0282612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This study addresses this by including data from patient interviews, demonstrating that many of therapists’ concerns were not shared by patients. As our evaluation took part at the end of the trial, our analysis is limited to the activities reported by clinicians, at that point in time. Recognising that implementation is a dynamic and on-going process, evaluating this at different time points within the life cycle of a research project would provide deeper insights into the process, and how this can be maximised in future studies.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The early design phase is critical in trials investigating complex interventions. The complexity of the social processes underpinning intervention delivery is greater than typically considered in stroke rehabilitation research, which mostly focuses on the ‘what’ and not the ‘how and why’. Understanding the process of implementation is crucial, as erroneous conclusions may be drawn as to the efficacy of an intervention if insufficient thought has been given to maximising fidelity at the trial stage, and the human and organisational processes underpinning this. How teams (rather than individuals) work together is central to how complex interventions are understood and subsequently implemented. It is possible that new complex interventions work best in contexts where there are ‘flexible’ cultures, and that researchers should consider, and potentially measure this, before they can effectively implement and evaluate an intervention.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Johnson,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Dec 29 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Manuscript'.</p></list-item></list><!-- <div> -->If you would like to make changes to your financial disclosure, please include your updated statement in your cover letter. Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p>
              <p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-laboratory-protocols</ext-link>. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option for publishing peer-reviewed Lab Protocol articles, which describe protocols hosted on protocols.io. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Kind regards,</p>

              <p>Journal Requirements:</p>
              <p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.</p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming. The PLOS ONE style templates can be found at </p>
              <p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=wjVg/PLOSOne_formatting_sample_main_body.pdf</ext-link> and </p>

              </p>
              <p>2. In your Data Availability statement, you have not specified where the minimal data set underlying the results described in your manuscript can be found. PLOS defines a study's minimal data set as the underlying data used to reach the conclusions drawn in the manuscript and any additional data required to replicate the reported study findings in their entirety. All PLOS journals require that the minimal data set be made fully available. For more information about our data policy, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>"Upon re-submitting your revised manuscript, please upload your study’s minimal underlying data set as either Supporting Information files or to a stable, public repository and include the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers within your revised cover letter. For a list of acceptable repositories, please see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories</ext-link>. Any potentially identifying patient information must be fully anonymized.</p>
              <p>Important: If there are ethical or legal restrictions to sharing your data publicly, please explain these restrictions in detail. Please see our guidelines for more information on what we consider unacceptable restrictions to publicly sharing data: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-unacceptable-data-access-restrictions</ext-link>. Note that it is not acceptable for the authors to be the sole named individuals responsible for ensuring data access.</p>
              <p>We will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide in your cover letter.</p>
              <p>3. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please move it to the Methods section and delete it from any other section. Please ensure that your ethics statement is included in your manuscript, as the ethics statement entered into the online submission form will not be published alongside your manuscript. </p>
              <p>4. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. <!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Congratulations on a well-written paper, presenting an example in stroke rehabilitation research how to apply NPT for implementing (and evaluating) a new intervention into practice. Outcomes of this paper strengthen the main trial outcomes as they provide information on why and how implementing implicit learning has worked and where it can be improved.</p>
              <p>A few minor comments:</p>
              <p>p. 10: Provide one additional sentence after Table 3 that explains to the reader that you are now presenting the NPT constructs and how they are reflected in participant statements/experiences.</p>
              <p>p. 30, line 502: Did you assess context of the participating sites prior to implementing the intervention? If so, highlight it here.</p>
              <p>p. 31, line 535: Were you able to match if those patients who did not express concern about the relationship/communication style of the therapist were those patients who attended therapists who were more comfortable adapting to implicit learning and reduce their communication with the patient? I am just wondering if those therapists who found it difficult to limit their communication may not have used implicit learning so much and therefore, these patients did also not comment negatively on a particular communication style? I am not sure if you had any measures in place to check if therapists used implicit learning or not – apart from self-report.</p>
              <p>p. 32, line 553: the evaluation took part at the end of the trial recruitment phase. What does that mean? Was that before the intervention took place because it was when all sites/participants were recruited? Please clarify.</p>
              <p>p. 33 line 580: This is different to what is stated in the online submission form. The authors state that interview transcripts will be made available through the University of Southampton. I am aware this is PLOS One policy, however – would an entire focus group/interview transcript make it easier to identify a site/individual?</p>

              <p>PONE-D-22-24727: Understanding implementation of a complex intervention in a stroke rehabilitation research trial: a qualitative evaluation using Normalisation Process Theory.</p>
              <p>Overall comment: Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. Evaluation of the implementation of complex interventions is an essential element of understanding what factors impact on the effectiveness of novel interventions; publications detailing these factors can be valuable for a wide range of researchers. Normalisation process theory (NPT) is widely utilised to underpin evaluations of the implementation of complex interventions but publications articulating how NPT was used by researchers are less common so it was encouraging to see this manuscript. For me, there was much of value in the use of NPT in this study to evaluate the implementation of what seems to be a novel form of providing therapy in stroke rehabilitation units. My main concerns are firstly, the lack of detail in the description of the intervention being evaluated which made it difficult to assess the quality of the evaluation undertaken, and secondly, the limited way in which the stroke survivor data was utilised in the manuscript. I appreciate that the authors indicate a separate paper will report in more detail on the interview data. However, as the manuscript stands, for me, it does not fully address the aims identified in the abstract and background.</p>
              <p>Specific comments are listed based on the section of the manuscript. I have used a lower case m to indicate minor concerns and an upper case M to indicate more major concerns.</p>
              <p>Abstract:</p>
              <p>Title: The authors may wish to consider including the term process evaluation in the title, this to facilitate location of the publication by search engines. But, see later comments re the use of the term process evaluation in this study and manuscript. (m)</p>
              <p>Methods: The number of stroke units participating in the pilot cCRT should be included in the methods section together with a statement that these units were in the UK/England and whether the units were in a single county or region. Similarly, the number of stroke survivors interviewed should be stated. (M)</p>
              <p>Results: This section reports on therapists’ perceptions and actions with no indication of findings from data generated from interviews stroke survivors. The same can be said of the conclusions and contributions to the literature section. If the stroke survivor data contributed to the interpretation of the therapists’ data as part of the process evaluation, then some mention of what those data indicated should be made. (M)</p>
              <p>Conclusions: Please see the comments which follow relating to determining flexibility and rule based cultures.</p>
              <p>Contributions to the literature: May need some revision based on changes suggested as being necessary for the manuscript to be considered for publication.</p>
              <p>Main text:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>1) Lines 67-74. I appreciate the need for brevity but there needs to be some more detail provided in the description of the intervention being piloted. As a minimum, implicit learning as it was defined in the pilot cCRT needs to be explained, this in order to understand how far the data collection methods selected were likely to be effective in enabling understanding participants’ understanding of the intervention and of the implementation of the intervention. Table 3 (page 17) is very helpful but would be easier to interpret with a more detailed description of the nature of the implicit learning intervention.(M)</p>
              <p>2) Lines 91 and 92. The statement ‘here we use implementation science’ is somewhat sweeping. It seems that you are using the terms implementation science and NPT interchangeably. Greater clarity is needed in defining implementation science and your rationale for selecting NPT to underpin the evaluation of implementation in the pilot cCRT. Also, please see comment 5 below re process evaluation.(M)</p>
              <p>3) Line 102. Do you mean principles here? (m)</p>
              <p>4) Line 100 to 107. Can some indication of content of the 2.5 hour training and perhaps some extracts from the handbook be included as supplementary online material to help readers make sense of the intervention and its evaluation? (m)</p>
              <p>5) Line 108. This appears to be the only mention of the term process evaluation. As a minimum this methodology should be explained, ideally in the context of the recent MRC Framework for Developing and Implementing Complex Interventions (Skivington et al, 2021) and the MRC Guidance for Process Evaluation of Complex Interventions (Moore et al (2015). This would set up comment on the choice of qualitative rather than mixed methods in the process evaluation which should be explained here. Generating data as part of a process evaluation on stroke survivor views is most appropriate in my view but please see and consider the above comment relating to the absence of report on how these data contributed to the later interpretation of the therapists’ data.(M)</p>
              <p>6) Line 117 and 118. Please clarify the process used for selection of the therapists and therapy assistants. Lines 128-130 suggest a convenience sample. (m)</p>
              <p>7) Lines 135-150. The description of the process of analysis in focus group data is helpful overall but the term semantic codes probably needs explanation and a reference, some readers will not be familiar with the approach. Similarly, I suggest you define latent codes, line 146-147. Providing an example (in a table or text box) of the approach reportedly used to integrate the semantic codes and the NPT driven coding (Lines 142-144) would be very helpful.(M)</p>
              <p>8) Line 155 and 159. Interviews with in-patients in the hospital setting can be very different to those conducted in peoples own homes, what consideration was given to the impact of setting on data generated? Presumably the lead researcher also conducted the interviews. What adaptations, if any, were needed to allow the stroke survivor with language difficulties to participate in the interview?(M)</p>
              <p>9) Line 165 Typo, ‘and’.</p>
              <p>10) Lines 165-166. The process of reviewing the focus group data against the stroke survivor interview data needs more explanation, this is potentially a complex process but the information provided in the manuscript is insufficient to determine the quality of the analytical processes used; this in turn impacts the confidence which can be placed on the claims made later about integration of these data. It is not clear why data from control group stroke survivors were included as against only intervention group survivors, brief explanation would be beneficial.(M)</p>
              <p>11) Lines 277-291. The term’ handling’ used in the context of post-stroke physiotherapy will be familiar to those working in the field but probably needs definition (as a footnote perhaps) for those not familiar with physiotherapy/occupational therapy or stroke rehabilitation.(m)</p>
              <p>12) Line 438 and elsewhere in the reporting of the findings the differentiation of the teams using the concepts of fixed or rule-based and more flexible or principle based makes sense and is indirectly supported by some of the direct quotations and accompanying explanation. What is not clear is out of the four teams how many fell into each category?(M)</p>
              <p>13) Across the reporting of findings. It was encouraging to read the stroke survivor perceptions/quotations in relation to NPTs coherence and cognitive participation. It would be helpful to hear comment on why the stroke survivors’ comments did not also relate to collective action and reflexive monitoring.(m)</p>
              <p>14) Lines 477-483. Some interesting issues raised here. Firstly, in terms of process evaluation, fidelity to the trial protocol or an intervention manual is commonly evaluated both qualitatively and qualitatively. It seems in this study the two elements were regarded as separate forms of evaluation and the opportunity to consider and synthesise the findings was not taken; for example comparing fidelity measure outcomes for fixed teams versus flexible teams. Is that the case? Secondly, if ‘trial designs (or trials teams) ‘may need to actively facilitate implementation, particularly monitoring and supporting coherence and cognitive participation’, how do the authors envisage this could occur in a trial context? (M)</p>
              <p>15) Line 492. Typo ‘e’.</p>
              <p>16) Lines 549-553. The criticism (of NPT) is largely valid but is increasingly being addressed in the literature, not least by May et al. Whilst it is encouraging that stroke survivor interviews were included in the qualitative evaluation, the use of the findings from the interview is very limited in this manuscript which in my view limits the confidence that can be placed in some of the claims made. (M)</p>
              <p>17) Re limitations, given that there is no indication of the types of units/services and whether they were from one county or across the UK a limitation may relate to their similarity or difference. Some comment should be made regarding the context of rehabilitation service provision in the participating units. (M)</p>
              <p>18) Lines 567-569. Some comment on how flexible cultures might be determined and linked to that how change and service improvement might occur in inflexible cultures would be valuable if the findings of this study are to be of value to other researchers. (M)</p>
