                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Two million out of the UK’s 5 million routine diagnostic CT scans performed each year incorporate the thoracolumbar spine or pelvic region. Up to one-third reveal undiagnosed osteoporosis or vertebral fractures. We developed an intervention, Picking up Hidden Osteoporosis Effectively during Normal CT Imaging without additional X-rays (‘PHOENIX’), to facilitate early detection and management of osteoporosis in people attending hospitals for CT scans.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A multicentre, randomised, pragmatic feasibility study. From the general CT-attending population, women aged ≥65 years and men aged ≥75 years attending for CT scans are invited to participate, via a novel consent form incorporating Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) questions. Those at increased 10-year risk (within the amber or red zones of the UK FRAX graphical outputs for further action) are block randomised (1:1:1) to (1) PHOENIX intervention, (2) active control or (3) usual care. The PHOENIX intervention comprises (i) retrieving the CT scans using the NHS Image Exchange Portal, (ii) Mindways QCT Pro software analysis of CT hip and spine none density with CT vertebral fracture assessment, (iii) sending the participants’ general practitioner (GP) a clinical report including diagnosis, necessary investigations and recommended treatment. Baseline CT scans from groups 2 and 3 are assessed with the PHOENIX intervention only at study end. Assuming 25% attrition, the study is powered to find a predicted superior osteoporosis treatment rate with PHOENIX (20%) vs 16% among patients whose GPs were sent the FRAX questionnaire only (active control) and 5% in the usual care group. Five hospitals are participating to determine feasibility. The co-primary feasibility outcome measures are (a) ability to randomise 375 patients within 10 months and (b) retention of 75% of survivors, completing their 1-year bone health outcome questionnaire. Secondary 1-year outcomes include osteoporosis/vertebral fracture identification rates and osteoporosis treatment rates. Stakeholder acceptability and economic aspects are evaluated.</p>

              <p>Older patients attending hospital for CT scans may have undiagnosed spine fractures or low bone density and therefore stand to benefit from osteoporosis screening. Timely diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis benefits many patient outcome domains (pain, quality of life, morbidity and in the case of zoledronate treatment, mortality). An estimated 43% of patients &gt;60 years of age undergoing CT scans (for abdominal and pelvic problems unrelated to their bones) were found to have osteoporosis or vertebral fractures when scan images were examined using computer-analysis methods.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, radiologists reviewing CT scans reported only 16% of vertebral fractures in routine practice,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and bone mineral density (BMD) is rarely calculated from CT scans (CT BMD). This is despite CT BMD being approved internationally for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Also, femoral neck BMD from CT is interchangeable with standard dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) BMD when using the global individual fracture risk web calculator Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX). Indeed, several approved software packages now allow accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis in the hip and spine from routinely acquired CT images, while at the same time facilitating vertebral fractures identification and grading.</p>
              <p>Systematic reviews indicate that overlooking osteoporosis or vertebral fractures can lead to serious, preventable pain, disability and health costs (&gt;£2 billion per year from osteoporosis in the UK).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Osteoporosis is a common disease in older women and men: osteoporosis is associated with &gt;200 000 vertebral fractures and &gt;85 000 hip fractures annually in the UK.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Osteoporosis-related fractures have a high morbidity and, despite low cost-effective treatments, women and men are increasingly presenting at clinics with advanced multiple vertebral fractures, loss of body height, compressed abdominal contents, dysphagia, severe and chronic pain and reduced mobility. Despite an ageing UK population, osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The osteoporosis case-finding rate in primary care is low and there is no national mandate for screening. High-risk patients may be referred for DXA and are offered treatment if fracture risk is sufficiently high. Vertebral fractures are infrequently detected in usual care even though they (alongside hip fractures) cause the biggest burden to patients and the health service. We hypothesise that targeted screening will improve on usual care and improve diagnosis. The Picking up Hidden Osteoporosis Effectively during Normal CT Imaging without additional X-rays (PHOENIX) intervention is a simple and widely practicable intervention to facilitate osteoporosis identification, diagnosis and treatment in patients attending for routine clinical CT at any hospital. It has been developed to apply software to CT scan images and repurpose them for measuring bone density, fracture risk and to identify crushed vertebrae.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> It couples timely diagnosis with an individualised report (built from a guideline-derived clinical decision tree) sent to general practitioners (GPs) containing advice on recommended investigations, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-approved, cost-effective treatment/lifestyle advice to reduce osteoporotic fractures.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We expect benefits to accrue through early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, with additional justifications for investigating this population shown in <xref rid="B1" ref-type="boxed-text">box 1</xref>. Preventing fractures could lead to decreased societal and social burden, and reduced healthcare and social care costs.</p>

              <p>This feasibility study aims to test our PHOENIX intervention, which begins by offering adults attending hospitals for CT (for any reason) a comprehensive bone health screen, followed by ‘opportunistic’ reuse of their CT scans for bone densitometry. The intervention ends with their GPs receiving detailed written advice on managing the participants’ bone health. Patients are offered an invitation pack comprising a novel informed consent form/data capture tool that the patient can fill out with or without assistance, and a participant information sheet. Specifically, we want to determine whether it is feasible for our team to undertake a large trial of the PHOENIX intervention to prevent fractures in a larger population of CT attenders. Hence, our co-primary outcome measure is our ability to randomise 375 ‘high-risk’ participants within 10 months. For the larger fracture prevention trial to be feasible, the other co-primary outcome measure must be achieved, which is retention at 12 months; our ability to record bone active treatment data (yes/no) in 75% of surviving patients. Power calculations for any future trial will be informed by the secondary outcome measure; the percentage of participants in each arm who have (i) received a treatment recommendation (due to osteoporosis, vertebral fracture or high FRAX risk) and (ii) received and commenced treatment 12 months after their CT scan. <xref rid="B2" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 2</xref> contains a summary of the key features of the study protocol.</p>

              <p>The PHOENIX study is a parallel three-group, non-blinded randomised controlled study of volunteers aged ≥65–90 years (women) or ≥75–90 years (men) attending for CT for any clinical reason, where the spine and/or hips are visible in scan images. Specifically, CT-attending patient volunteers who have an elevated 10-year fracture risk (within the amber or red zones of the UK FRAX graphical outputs for further action) are randomised to one of three groups. The three arms allow comparison between (1) the PHOENIX intervention, (2) an alternative active control ‘middle’ group (to assess whether GPs will investigate or treat patients based solely on receipt of a populated FRAX questionnaire) and (3) a control (‘usual care’) group where no action is taken. Potential participants are identified ahead of attendance by the clinical or research team reviewing CT lists. Those eligible by age, sex and region of the body being scanned are handed the PHOENIX pack while attending the CT department. The specially designed informed consent form (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>) first guides the potential participant through eligibility screening questions (<italic toggle="yes">Do you take medication for your bones once a week that requires you to sit or stand upright? Do you have a yearly infusion (drip) or injection for your bones? Do you have a hip replacement? Have you ever had a hip operation?</italic>). If there is an affirmative answer to any of these questions, individuals are asked to return their forms and go no further. Those individuals who answer ‘no’ to all the questions are asked to supply key demographic data: date of birth, height, weight, country of origin and ethnicity (needed for accurate FRAX calculation) and National Health Service number (receptionists support the patient as needed with the latter). Individuals are also asked to document the reason for their scan, if they know it.</p>
              <p>On the last page of the consent form, the eight validated bone health-relevant questions from the FRAX questionnaire are completed, along with patient address, telephone number, GP name and GP address. Completed paperwork is scanned and sent by email attachment within the national, clinically secure NHS.net email account infrastructure to our add-tr.p*******@nhs.net address (except for local patients where the paperwork is collected directly from the CT reception). FRAX answers are processed by the research team at Cambridge who use the results to calculate the 10-year fracture risk score <italic toggle="yes">without</italic> femoral neck BMD online. Those at low risk of fracture (within the green zone of the UK FRAX graphical outputs) are not randomised, but for completeness, these low-risk participants do eventually have the bone parameters in their CT scans reviewed. CT scans from participants in this ‘green’ category are retrieved later and put through the PHOENIX intervention 13 months after they consented, allowing the study team to ascertain whether FRAX had been effective in picking up patients with osteoporosis/high fracture risk in this CT waiting room setting. Those in the remaining ‘red’ and ‘amber’ risk categories are randomised to one of three arms, described below: group (1) the PHOENIX intervention, (2) active control (FRAX questionnaire results only sent to GP) and (3) usual care.

                <p>The PHOENIX intervention. In brief, bone health for the red/amber risk participant is assessed using the CT images already captured, with computer-aided diagnosis of vertebral fractures performed by one of two trained NHS and accredited bone density technicians using Mindways QCT Pro (Mindways, Austin, Texas, USA) in Cambridge. The output is a consultant clinician-verified report (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>) sent to the GP with details of (i) femoral neck and/or spine bone density results, (ii) vertebral fracture diagnosis (yes/no/level affected), (iii) FRAX estimated 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture, (iv) any recommended follow-up investigations and a (v) simple treat/do not treat decision based on National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) intervention thresholds, with a suggestion of specific treatments recommended by NICE guidelines (the decision tree is shown in <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 2</xref>). These steps can take place at any time after the patient has gone home from having their CT. Any CT scanner to be used for CT densitometry must be calibrated by reference to a QCT phantom and recalibrated in the event of any X-ray tube change. The technical aspects of the PHOENIX intervention done at study entry in group 1 (and at study exit in the others two groups) are as follows: all analysis is conducted within the Mindways QCT Pro software tool using one of two standalone hospital-connected PCs as illustrated by screenshots (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). Technical steps involved in the full PHOENIX intervention are mentioned in <xref rid="B3" ref-type="boxed-text">box 3</xref>.</p>

For non-responders, a telephone interview is attempted aiming to collect the questionnaire data. Patient and clinician/healthcare worker/administrator perspectives of study involvement are explored through semi-structured interviews by telephone. All study data are held securely processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and not disclosed to third parties. Manual records will be held securely (eg, in locked filing cabinets). Electronic records will be held on a secure network requiring user ID and password access. Individuals are not identifiable from the REDCAP and JMP (V.15, SAS Institute) spreadsheet results of the trial. The Project Management Team members (KW, KESP, DC, JMB) are responsible for the day-to-day running of the study to discuss practical aspects and ensure it is progressing. The Trial Management Group (TMG) comprises the protocol authors and one patient and public involvement (PPI) member. They are responsible for the overall conduct of the study and ensuring the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) milestones are achieved. Prior to COVID-19, separate PPI meetings were held which enabled those attending to influence the study design.</p>

                <p>Our primary intention is to evaluate the technical procedures needed for a definitive trial with fracture incidence (rather than recruitment/retention) as the primary outcome. To help set the target recruitment numbers for the feasibility study, we therefore used the surrogate outcome of osteoporosis treatment rates at 12 months follow-up to permit sufficient power to assess and conduct cross-group comparisons across trial arms within the period of recruitment to the feasibility study. Scenarios for scaling up to a definitive trial are based on previous data.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 9</xref> Only those participants in the red/amber FRAX group (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>) will be randomised, so the number of invitations needed to reach any recruitment target will also depend on the prevalence of the red/amber FRAX group. In our local preliminary application of the PHOENIX intervention in 1518 patients, the prevalence of red/amber FRAX varied between 30% at age 40 years and 50% at age 95 years (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>), with overall prevalence 40.5% (95% CI 35.7% to 45.5%). There is no published UK data to compare with this but comparable prevalence was reported in a single study in the USA investigating combined bone density and fracture detection in routine CT investigations, where 42.3% (of 571 consecutive patients) were newly detected as having osteoporosis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A conservative assumption from our preliminary work is that the PHOENIX intervention will identify a further 9.6% of screened patients for treatment and that GPs will act to treat at least half of these, resulting in an expected 4.8% minimum detectable difference. If, in our study, the percentage treated at 12 months in group 2 (active control FRAX-GP arm) matches that observed in the MRC-funded osteoporosis screening Screening in the community to reduce fractures in older people (SCOOP) study<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> (15.5%), then we would consider that an improvement in percentage treated of 4.8% would be clinically significant. <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> shows the estimated total number of invitees needed to recruit the 375 red/amber risk participants, assuming different response rates and different prevalence estimates. In the scenario of 30% response (similar to SCOOP) combined with 40% prevalence of red/amber FRAX (red line in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4D</xref>), it would be necessary to invite a total of 3125 participants (or 625 invites per centre) to achieve the recruitment target of 375 randomised participants (75 per centre, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4D</xref>).</p>

                <p>Both the baseline and 1-year follow-up questionnaires being sent to all patients include space for participants to feedback their experience of the study. First explaining how this will help, this section includes example open questions such as <italic toggle="yes">“Do you have any comments on being offered a bone health check at the same time as your CT scan? Or on taking part in this research study?/how you were asked to join?/your decision to take part?’</italic>. Semi-structured interviews will be used with a smaller subsample of study participants (n=20) to allow for more in-depth exploration of issues that participants may raise in written feedback or during interview. Recordings will be transcribed by an academic transcription service following a confidentiality contract and anonymised by a member of the research team (JF) changing names of people and places and any identifiable details. Key research questions for the PHOENIX process evaluation are: (i) what are the implementation facilitators and barriers for the PHOENIX intervention? (ii) how acceptable to the intended patient group is the process of PHOENIX screening? (iii) how do implementation and acceptability issues affect uptake of the CT bone health screening and any subsequent GP investigation and recommended bone protective treatment? A combination of interviews and focus groups with those staff groups who will be key to the effective delivery of PHOENIX screening will also be undertaken, both in hospital and primary care, in order to understand their different perspectives. These staff groups are research nurses, receptionists and radiographers in CT departments and GPs. Analyses will be descriptive. The software programme NVivo V.12 (QSR) will be used to manage and index the qualitative data (anonymised transcripts of audio-recordings from interviews and focus groups) before charting, mapping and interpretation taking a framework approach.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Ritchie and Spencer thematic analysis is an approach suitable for qualitative research in which data collection is relatively focused on key questions,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> hence it is applicable to PHOENIX.</p>

                <p>At the ‘idea’ stage of the research, our small team presented our idea at the large workshop <italic toggle="yes">“Find your voice; Demystifying research and public involvement in research”</italic> at Cambridge Professional Development Centre Trumpington in May 2015. This was run by Dr Doreen Tembo Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) lead for the Eastern region NIHR Research Design Service in partnership with the Norfolk and Suffolk PPIRes team (PPI in research). This connected us with patients and public representatives, many of whom had relevant musculoskeletal disorders and/or past experience in an orthopaedic service. We collated the opinions and suggestions on our proposed project from every participant in the workshop in writing, individually and from small group discussions to help develop our research question and outcome measures, so that they were informed by patients’ priorities, experiences and preferences. Three individuals, Mr Jeremy Dearling, Mrs Tessa Plume and Dr Ann Frost volunteered to join our trial group as PPI representatives; they were specifically involved in patient documentation design (particularly the PHOENIX pack, informed consent form which facilitated consent without having a researcher present) and contributed to suggestions for increasing patient recruitment and follow-up. JF facilitated group sessions and individual structured interviews to assess the burden of the PHOENIX intervention on patients themselves, as well as a qualitative assessment of the process from a user perspective. The results of the research will be disseminated to surviving participants after generating patient-friendly materials in collaboration with our PPIE representatives.</p>

              <p>The PHOENIX study is dedicated to the memory of J. Keenan Brown, inventor of QCT Pro (9 February 1960 to 11 December 2021). Without Keenan, this study would not have been possible. The authors would like to acknowledge Karen Blesic for providing a valuable nursing perspective, for helping develop the idea and for her major contributions towards the NHS Research Innovation Fund pilot to PHOENIX (the clinical service called CORTEX). The authors acknowledge the contributions of Polly Barnes and Charlotte Tyson to CORTEX and also their contributions towards the practicalities of imaging data flow. The authors acknowledge Judith Brown’s contributions towards the practicalities of patient flow and analysis through the pathways and imaging services. The authors acknowledge Jeremy Dearling as our primary PPIE representative who gave valuable contributions to the design of the overall study, provided detailed feedback on the materials and protocol development. The authors also acknowledge the assistance of the Eastern region NIHR Research Design Service team, specifically Jonathan Scales, Andrew Sharpe, Analisa Casarin (improving and developing the research idea and application) and Doreen Tembo (PPI lead for the same). KESP acknowledges the Cambridge NIHR Biomedical Research Centre who support his work, and support DC. KESP also thanks the NIHR for funding his attendance at the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Course at Queen Mary University of London which helped him develop the idea. Finally, the authors acknowledge the major contribution of Dr Alan Lamont, chair of East of England (EE), Research Ethic Committee whose helpful suggestions and understanding of the relevant GCP issues and legislation rekindled our interest in adopting pragmatic patient consent without a researcher present.</p>

                <p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KESP: chief investigator for the study and is responsible for the concept and design of the overall study and manuscript final approval. KESP and EC provided clinical expertise in the area of bone health which forms the basis for the study. They developed the concept and idea for PHOENIX, gained funding and wrote the clinical decision tree with assistance from DC. Also methods design, writing and providing feedback of manuscript, manuscript final approval. KESP is responsible for the medical aspects of opportunistic diagnosis of osteoporosis, recommending investigations and treatments to participants. SK (with assistance from the relevant trials work of LS, and pilot work of KESP/DC) developed the statistical analysis plan including calculation of sample size and definition of primary and secondary outcomes and power calculations. APW designed the health economics work, and developed suitable outcomes for the trial. DC provided information on the background and rationale for using the various software. He has helped clarify pathways for scan analysis in the study and assisted in the development of the Clinical Decision Tree. KW wrote the protocol and drafted the manuscript, clarified pathways and study flow and liaised with the team to finalise the protocol. JF designed the process evaluation substudy, with all qualitative interview work, and developed suitable outcomes for the trial. TT provided information on the background and rationale for diagnosing vertebral fractures. He was responsible for the medical aspects of opportunistic diagnosis of vertebral fractures. All authors contributed to and approved the final version of the manuscript.</p>
