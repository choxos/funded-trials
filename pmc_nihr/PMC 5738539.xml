              <abstract>
                <p>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains a challenge to intensive care units, with secure diagnosis relying on microbiological cultures that take up to 72 hours to provide a result. We sought to derive and validate a novel, real-time 16S rRNA gene PCR for rapid exclusion of VAP. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was obtained from two independent cohorts of patients with suspected VAP. Patients were recruited in a 2-centre derivation cohort and a 12-centre confirmation cohort. Confirmed VAP was defined as growth of &gt;10<sup>4</sup> colony forming units/ml on semiquantitative culture and compared with a 16S PCR assay. Samples were tested from 67 patients in the derivation cohort, 10 (15%) of whom had confirmed VAP. Using cycles to cross threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) values as the result of the 16S PCR test, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.0, p&lt;0.0001). Samples from 92 patients were available from the confirmation cohort, 26 (28%) of whom had confirmed VAP. The AUROC for C<sub>t</sub> in this cohort was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.95, p&lt;0.0001). This study has derived and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a novel application for 16S PCR. This suggests that 16S PCR in BAL could be used as a rapid test in suspected VAP and may allow better stewardship of antibiotics.</p>

              <p>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains a significant problem in intensive care units (ICUs)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and despite reductions in reported VAP rates antibiotic use remains high.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The most common indication for antibiotic use remains suspected respiratory infections.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> VAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> especially when antibiotics are delayed or are inadequate.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, due to the various conditions that can mimic VAP, commonly only 30% of those suspected of having VAP subsequently have this diagnosis confirmed.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The delays in obtaining results from conventional microbiological cultures lead to empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics of which a significant proportion is later deemed unnecessary. The excessive use of antibiotics is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and mortality.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>The ubiquitous presence of a 16S ribosomal RNA gene in bacteria offers the possibility of detecting a wide range of bacteria in a single PCR.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Amplification of the 16S rRNA gene in a PCR assay results in amplification of all bacteria in a sample. Therefore, this offers potential as a screening test for suspected VAP. The aim of this study was to derive and validate a real-time 16S PCR assay for diagnosing confirmed VAP.</p>

<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cohorts of adult patients with clinically suspected VAP recruited from UK ICUs formed the derivation<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and confirmation<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> cohorts respectively. Briefly, patients were recruited if they met criteria for suspected VAP, namely new or worsening chest X-ray changes following at least 48 hours of ventilation, accompanied by two or more of: temperature &gt;38°C; white cell count &gt;11×10<sup>9</sup>/L; or mucopurulent sputum. In the derivation cohort patients were excluded if they had received new antibiotics within the 3 days prior to recruitment;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> no such exclusion was applied to the confirmation cohort.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Patients underwent protocolised bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and an aliquot of BAL fluid was processed using a semiquantitative culture method. This culture was used as our reference diagnostic standard, with growth at &gt;10<sup>4</sup> colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) of BAL fluid being defined as ‘VAP positive’ and growth &lt;10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL as ‘VAP negative’, these cut-offs being in line with established standards.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

              <p>Full details of sample processing are described in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary section</xref>. Briefly, the fraction of lavage not used for conventional culture was centrifuged to produce a cell-free supernatant, followed by nucleic acid extraction. The 16S PCR assays are described below; assay 1 and assay 2 were conducted in geographically separate laboratories.</p>

Real-time PCR was carried out on the ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). This assay was used for samples from the derivation cohort, to establish proof in principle of the diagnostic utility of this approach, and was also used for samples from the confirmation cohort.</p>

              <p>In the derivation cohort, samples from 67 patients were available, of whom 10 (15%) had ‘microbiologically confirmed VAP’. In the ‘confirmation’ cohort samples from 92 patients were available for analysis; 26 (28%) met the culture criteria for ‘microbiologically confirmed VAP’. The demographic details and organisms cultured are shown in the online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary section</xref> (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary tables S1 and S2</xref>).</p>
              <p>16S PCR assay 1 demonstrated that patients with confirmed VAP had a higher bacterial burden, as signified by a lower C<sub>t</sub> value, than those without VAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016209065F1">figure 1</xref>A). When evaluated for diagnostic ability by ROC curve, assay 1 demonstrated excellent diagnostic ability (see <xref rid="THORAXJNL2016209065TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and figure S1A) with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.00), sensitivity of 100% and specificity 72% at the most optimal cut-off.</p>

              <p>In the confirmation cohort, patients with confirmed VAP had significantly lower 16S C<sub>t</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016209065F1">figure 1</xref>B), and a similar diagnostic performance was demonstrated (<xref rid="THORAXJNL2016209065TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and figure S1B), with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 67% at the most optimal cut-off. The difference between the AUROC of the cohorts was not statistically significant (p=0.56).</p>
              <p>Samples from the confirmation cohort were also tested using 16S assay 2. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016209065F1">figure 1C</xref>, although the absolute C<sub>t</sub> values differed between the two assays, the same relationship between VAP and non-VAP samples was observed. ROC analysis (<xref rid="THORAXJNL2016209065TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> and figure S1C) demonstrated good diagnostic ability (area under the curve 0.84 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94) with sensitivity 89% and specificity 80% at the optimal cut-off. Although the point estimates of AUROC were higher for assay 1, the difference did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.4). However if the assays are compared at maximal sensitivity (100%), the specificity of assay 1 is significantly higher (<xref rid="THORAXJNL2016209065TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Using the Youden Index to define optimal C<sub>t</sub> value cut-offs on the ROC curve, a ‘positive’ result for 16S would be a value below this cut-off (indicating high bacterial load) and a ‘negative’ result would be a value above this cut-off (indicating low bacterial load).</p>
              <p>In the derivation cohort, 35 (52%) patients were receiving antibiotics on the day of recruitment. In the confirmation cohort, 69 (75%) were receiving antibiotics and 14 (15%) had undergone a change of antibiotics within the past 3 days. Receipt of antibiotics and recent change in antibiotics were not associated with changes in 16S C<sub>t</sub> values (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary results and table S3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of real-time 16S PCR for diagnosing VAP. Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used to explore the microbiome of ventilated patients, data on its diagnostic potential have been absent. In deriving and confirming a test, with a high agreement in test performance between the two cohorts, we demonstrate clear potential for the clinical utility of this test. Turnaround time is 4–6 hours; therefore, this test could impact on antibiotic use, which may otherwise only be rationalised following the results of conventional cultures at 48–72 hours.</p>
              <p>This study has a number of strengths. First, we were able to perform derivation and confirmation in two distinct cohorts, with confirmation in a cohort recruited from a diverse group of 12 ICUs. The results are therefore likely to be widely applicable; indeed, the microbiological spectrum found is similar to reports from other countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Second, by using consistent diagnostic procedures within each cohort, we avoided some of the problems which occur with the diagnosis of VAP.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Our rate of microbiologically confirmed VAP in both cohorts (23%) is at the lower end of the reported range<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but not out of keeping with other reports and we believe this may, in part, reflect the use of highly standardised BAL protocols.</p>
              <p>A disadvantage of this study is that samples were obtained bronchoscopically, requiring resource and exposing patients to a small but definite risk, and the applicability of this test to other sample types cannot be inferred. The assays we describe here are also limited to bacterial detection. The differences between the two assays tested, and the use of stored samples, highlight the need for external prospective validation before this measure could be implemented in routine clinical practice. Further refinements of assays may also improve diagnostic performance. The reference standard of growth of organisms on conventional culture, remains imperfect, and indeed may well be influenced by intercurrent antibiotics generally, and recent changes in antibiotics specifically.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However this remains the established standard<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is used routinely for clinical decision-making. As such, the 16S assay described here can predict the results of a clinically relevant test, but within 6 hours rather than the 48–72 hours taken for the conventional cultures.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we have derived and confirmed the diagnostic utility of a rapid laboratory test for VAP in a multicentre setting. We propose that this test has the potential to permit rapid decisions to direct antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected VAP thus improving stewardship of antibiotics in the ICU.</p>
