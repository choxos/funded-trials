                  <p id="Par1">Integrated care may improve outcomes for older people living with frailty. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a new, anticipatory, multidisciplinary care service in improving the wellbeing and quality of life (QoL) of older people living with severe frailty.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A community-based non-randomised controlled study. Participants (â¥65 years, electronic Frailty Index â¥0.36) received either the new integrated care service plus usual care, or usual care alone. <italic>Data collection was at three time points: baseline, 2-4 weeks, and 10-14 weeks</italic>. The primary outcome was patient wellbeing (symptoms and other concerns) at 2-4 weeks, measured using the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS); the secondary outcome was QoL, measured using EQ-5D-5L. To test duration of effect and safety, wellbeing and QoL were also measured at 10-14 weeks. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise and compare intervention and control groups (eligible but had not accessed the new service), with t-test, Chi-Square, or Mann-Whitney U tests (as appropriate) to test differences at each time point. Generalised linear modelling, with propensity score matching, was used for further group comparisons. Data were analysed using STATA v17.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">199 intervention and 54 control participants were recruited. At baseline, intervention and control groups were similar in age, gender, ethnicity, living status, and body mass index, but not functional status or area deprivation score. At 2-4 weeks, wellbeing had improved in the intervention group but worsened in the control (median IPOS -5 <italic>versus</italic> 2, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). QoL improved in the intervention group but was unchanged in the control (median EQ-5D-5L 0.12, <italic>versus</italic> 0.00, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and living status, the intervention group had an average total IPOS score reduction at 2-4 weeks of 6.34 (95% CI: -9.01: -4.26, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05); this improvement was sustained, with an average total IPOS score reduction at 10-14 weeks of 6.36 (95% CI: -8.91:-3.80, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). After propensity score matching based on functional status/area deprivation, modelling showed similar results, with a reduction in IPOS score at 2-4 weeks in the intervention group of 7.88 (95% CI: -12.80: -2.96, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Our findings suggest that the new, anticipatory, multidisciplinary care service may have improved the overall wellbeing and quality of life of older people living with frailty at 2-4 weeks and the improvement in wellbeing was sustained at three months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par7">In recent decades, healthcare for older people has been delivered by a range of providers and has sometimes been poorly coordinated between different services. Older people are increasingly living with multiple long-term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Integration of services is much needed and necessitates a paradigm shift in the care of older people from disease-oriented care (often focused on single conditions) towards goal-oriented proactive care (individualised and across multiple conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A proactive, integrated care approach that focuses on holistic health outcomes is preferable to one that focuses solely on improving individual disease outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The goal of an integrated care approach is to anticipate and delay the onset of poor health, as well as address existing consequences of multiple conditions, such as functional dependency and hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The UK's ageing population has resulted in an increase in the number of people living with multi-morbidity and frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite this, healthcare practitioners are intent on keeping them living independently in the community, and avoiding or delaying hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Integrated care interventions should be aligned closely to the target population of older people and personalised to meet the high and diverse needs of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">In the face of these challenges, services for frail older people should be redesigned. In 2018, the Jean Bishop Integrated Care Centre in Hull was established to provide integrated, anticipatory, multidisciplinary care for older people living with frailty. This study aimed to determine whether this new, proactive, multidisciplinary care service is effective in improving the overall wellbeing and quality of life of older people living with severe frailty.</p>

It can be reported as a total score (17 items: scoring 0-68; higher scores indicating worse wellbeing), or subscales: physical subscale (10 items: scoring 0-40); psychological (4 items: scoring 0-16); communication/practical subscale (3 items: scoring 0-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] . The clinical minimally important difference in IPOS total score is 4.8, with the mean (SD) for the baseline IPOS of 27.4 (9.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The secondary outcome was quality of life at 2-4 weeks, measured with the 5-level EuroQOL quality of life measure (EQ-5D-5L; higher scores indicating better quality of life) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported quality of life assessment that comprises one question for each of the five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, plus a visual analogue scale reporting overall health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The responses can be transformed into EQ-5D-5L index and utility scores, with 0 representing death and 1 representing perfect health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Wellbeing and quality of life were also measured (again using IPOS and EQ-5D-5L) at 10-14 weeks to test safety and duration of effect. Functional status, assessed by the clinical team, was measured using the Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS); a brief measure of functional status validated in cancer and non-cancer conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par24">After adjusting for age, gender, and living status, at 2-4 weeks the intervention group had statistically and clinically improved average total IPOS scores (-6.34; 95% CI: -9.01 to -4.26, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), and EQ-5D-5L index values (0.12; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.19, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par25">We evaluated the effectiveness of a new, anticipatory, multidisciplinary care service in improving the wellbeing and quality of life for older people living with severe frailty. This study showed that the new service improved wellbeing and quality of life for this study population at 2-4 weeks; the improvement in wellbeing was sustained at 3 months. We chose a short observation time because we expect the benefit from improved symptom control and additional support will have maximal effect at 2-4 weeks. The improvement in wellbeing and quality of life associated with the new integrated care service is greater than that previously reported as clinically meaningful by patients with advanced illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Choosing the right primary outcome measure is important; we found greater change in wellbeing (measured with IPOS) than in quality of life (measured with EQ-5D-5L). IPOS can detect clinically meaningful changes in symptoms and other concerns over time, and is more specific to the concerns of those with advanced illness. Quality of life, in contrast, is subject to a much wider range of influences. The domains included in IPOS are those prioritised as most important by patients with advanced illness themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this study population, the reported symptoms and other concerns may be linked to multiple long-term conditions, the progression of those conditions, to overall deterioration in health, or to management of health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IPOS can be used to capture wellbeing, to reflect the effectiveness of healthcare interventions, and to indicate care quality; it has good construct validity with three underlying factors: physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, and communication/practical issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">We used a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)-based intervention â a multi-modal screening and treatment approach that identifies the medical, psychological and functional needs of older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Multi-modal interventions are more likely than uni-modal interventions to improve health outcomes and to decrease frailty and depression in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our findings are consistent with another integrated care service (multi-disciplinary team meetings) evaluation which showed reduced rates of functional decline, emergency room visits and unnecessary hospitalisation among older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] . Use of CGA can improve physical and cognitive function, and reduce mortality and emergency hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], not only for older people in the hospital setting but also those in the community setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. CGA has also been shown to reduce the prevalence of frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] which may be one of the mechanisms explaining our sustained benefit over time. In a realist review which assessed the use of CGA in improving health-related quality of life, findings showed that the use of CGA improved patient outcomes such as physical and cognitive function, reduced mortality and emergency hospitalisations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], not only in older people in the hospital setting but also those in the community setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, a recent review has shown that there are significant variations in the results from earlier CGA intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and the evidence for effectiveness is low.</p>
              <sec id="Sec20">
                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
                <p id="Par28">This is one of the first studies evaluating the impact of a new, anticipatory, multidisciplinary care service for older people living with frailty on wellbeing as well as quality of life. A major strength is the use of a matched control group, with propensity matching to adjust for baseline differences. This demonstrates the course of the patientsâ outcomes and supports the relationship between outcomes and intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, some of the limitations need discussion. First, there were more patients recruited in the intervention group than in the control group. This reflected study limitations during data collection (during the COVID-19 lockdown) and was not planned. Our plan was to recruit an equal number of participants for both groups but unfortunately, because of COVID, this was not possible. Unequal samples in control and intervention groups are not â of themselves â problematic, unless leading to loss of power and/or unequal variance. In this instance, the imbalance was due to accessibility problems related to COVID. We therefore describe the two groups in more detail, especially in relation to functional status and area deprivation scores.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Second, the study groups had baseline differences in functional status and area deprivation scores. This may reflect sampling; those in the intervention group had â by definition â had to be mobile enough to attend the centre, while the control group included those who were house-bound (therefore with poorer functional status). GP practices (and hence areas) were included according to the roll-out of the integrated care service across the district; and selection of GP practices for control group recruitment were constrained by the roll-out (likely contributing to differences in area deprivation scores). However, propensity score matching using functional status and area deprivation scores still showed that the new service was associated with improved patients' wellbeing, and the size of this effect was clinically meaningful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For clinically important questions in observational research, propensity score analysis provides an alternate approach for evaluating causal treatment effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Any future study should aim to recruit participants with similar baseline characteristics to reduce sampling bias. Third, this study recruited only participants with severe frailty; the service is now extended to include those at risk of moderate frailty. Future studies should be designed to recruit participants from a wider frailty group. Fourth, this was an open trial because the service was an ongoing one, hence the intervention and outcome assessments were not blinded. This could have led to information bias. Any future study should aim to blind the study outcomes.</p>

                <title>Research and clinical implications</title>
                <p id="Par30">This study demonstrated that selection of relevant outcome measures as well as careful timing of measurement of primary and secondary outcomes is important in evaluations of interventions in advanced illness. There is a need for wider testing of this model of care in other populations and contexts. The clinical implications for the current findings include the need to consider wider use of this model of care among this population as well as defining the implementation strategies that can help to ensure wider adoption and sustainability of the new service.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par31">This study provides insight into the benefits of an integrated care service. Our findings suggest that the new anticipatory, multidisciplinary care service may have improved the overall wellbeing and quality of life of older people living with frailty at 2-4 weeks and the improvement in wellbeing was sustained at three months. However, change in the quality of life was not maintained at three months. The effectiveness of the new integrated care service on the outcomes of frailty, such as dependency, hospitalisation and mortality, should be considered in further studies but this initial evaluation shows real promise.</p>
