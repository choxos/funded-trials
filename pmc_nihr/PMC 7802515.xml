                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Radical surgery via total mesorectal excision might not be the optimal first-line treatment for early-stage rectal cancer. An organ-preserving strategy with selective total mesorectal excision could reduce the adverse effects of treatment without substantially compromising oncological outcomes. We investigated the feasibility of recruiting patients to a randomised trial comparing an organ-preserving strategy with total mesorectal excision.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>TREC was a randomised, open-label feasibility study done at 21 tertiary referral centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with rectal adenocarcinoma, staged T2 or lower, with a maximum diameter of 30 mm or less; patients with lymph node involvement or metastases were excluded. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by use of a computer-based randomisation service to undergo organ preservation with short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery after 8–10 weeks, or total mesorectal excision. Where the transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimen showed histopathological features associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, patients were considered for planned early conversion to total mesorectal excision. A non-randomised prospective registry captured patients for whom randomisation was considered inappropriate, because of a strong clinical indication for one treatment group. The primary endpoint was cumulative randomisation at 12, 18, and 24 months. Secondary outcomes evaluated safety, efficacy, and health-related quality of life assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 and CR29 in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN14422743.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 22, 2012, and Dec 19, 2014, 55 patients were randomly assigned at 15 sites; 27 to organ preservation and 28 to radical surgery. Cumulatively, 18 patients had been randomly assigned at 12 months, 31 at 18 months, and 39 at 24 months. No patients died within 30 days of initial treatment, but one patient randomly assigned to organ preservation died within 6 months following conversion to total mesorectal excision with anastomotic leakage. Eight (30%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation were converted to total mesorectal excision. Serious adverse events were reported in four (15%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation versus 11 (39%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0·04, χ<sup>2</sup> test). Serious adverse events associated with organ preservation were most commonly due to rectal bleeding or pain following transanal endoscopic microsurgery (reported in three cases). Radical total mesorectal excision was associated with medical and surgical complications including anastomotic leakage (two patients), kidney injury (two patients), cardiac arrest (one patient), and pneumonia (two patients). Histopathological features that would be considered to be associated with increased risk of tumour recurrence if observed after transanal endoscopic microsurgery alone were present in 16 (59%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation, versus 24 (86%) of 28 randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (p=0·03, χ<sup>2</sup> test). Eight (30%) of 27 patients assigned to organ preservation achieved a complete response to radiotherapy. Patients who were randomly assigned to organ preservation showed improvements in patient-reported bowel toxicities and quality of life and function scores in multiple items compared to those who were randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision, which were sustained over 36 months’ follow-up. The non-randomised registry comprised 61 patients who underwent organ preservation and seven who underwent radical surgery. Non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation were older than randomised patients and more likely to have life-limiting comorbidities. Serious adverse events occurred in ten (16%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation versus one (14%) of seven who underwent total mesorectal excision. 24 (39%) of 61 non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation had high-risk histopathological features, while 25 (41%) of 61 achieved a complete response. Overall, organ preservation was achieved in 19 (70%) of 27 randomised patients and 56 (92%) of 61 non-randomised patients.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Short-course radiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery achieves high levels of organ preservation, with relatively low morbidity and indications of improved quality of life. These data support the use of organ preservation for patients considered unsuitable for primary total mesorectal excision due to the short-term risks associated with this surgery, and support further evaluation of short-course radiotherapy to achieve organ preservation in patients considered fit for total mesorectal excision. Larger randomised studies, such as the ongoing STAR-TREC study, are needed to more precisely determine oncological outcomes following different organ preservation treatment schedules.</p>

                  <p id="para40">Radical surgery to remove the rectum, adhering to the principles of total mesorectal excision, without pre-operative radiotherapy, is the standard of care for early-stage rectal cancer. However, radical surgery has measurable mortality, substantial morbidity, and a considerable impact on patients’ quality of life (QOL). Patient groups and health-care professionals both recognise the potential benefits of an organ preservation approach for the treatment of early-stage rectal cancer to reduce the morbidity associated with radical surgery without compromising oncological outcomes, but there is currently a lack of high-quality, prospective, randomised evidence to justify adoption of this approach. Organ preservation strategies commonly use a combination of radiotherapy and local excision. The feasibility of primary organ preservation with chemoradiotherapy is not in doubt, but the cumulative toxicity arising from multiple treatments is problematic, particularly for patients who do not achieve organ preservation, and adversely affects patients’ health-related QOL (HRQOL). Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no randomised study has compared an organ preservation strategy with total mesorectal excision alone. The GRECCAR 2 trial enrolled patients with small T2 and T3 rectal cancer following a good clinical response to chemoradiotherapy, randomly assigning patients to undergo either radical surgery or transanal local excision (transanal endoscopic microsurgery). Conversion to radical surgery was advised for patients with ypT2 or more advanced stage cancer. A composite endpoint of death, cancer recurrence, and treatment-related morbidity at 2 years concluded that organ preservation was not superior to chemoradiotherapy plus radical surgery due to the cumulative toxicities of multiple treatments. Further exploratory analysis by treatment received suggested lower rates of faecal incontinence in patients who achieved organ preservation at 2 years. Notably, few studies have reported longer-term toxicity rates or patient-reported outcomes including HRQOL following organ preservation, particularly in a randomised setting against total mesorectal excision surgery alone. This limits our ability to extrapolate available data on HRQOL to guide patient choices.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">The TREC study demonstrates the feasibility of randomly assigning patients with early-stage rectal cancer to a multimodality organ preservation strategy (incorporating short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery) versus radical surgery without radiotherapy. The comparison of organ preservation with radical surgery showed some benefits of organ preservation with respect to fewer serious surgical complications, low acute patient-reported toxicity, and little impact on QOL and function at 3 months. Sustained benefits for up to 3 years in overall QOL, social function, body image, and decreased embarrassment about bowel function were also observed with organ preservation. The risk of unsalvageable local recurrence was low in TREC.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">The findings of the TREC study suggest that short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery is associated with lower acute and late patient-reported side-effects than total mesorectal excision (the standard of care), and consequently has a minimal impact on patients’ QOL. The high levels of compliance, low toxicity, significant downstaging, and high rates of organ preservation achieved in the TREC study support further evaluation of short-course radiotherapy to achieve primary organ preservation in patients with early-stage rectal cancer alongside other measures that could reduce the adverse effects of treatment, such as smaller risk-adapted radiotherapy fields, non-operative management of complete response, and a biomarker-driven approach to initiating surgical intervention. Such measures should be implemented in the context of well conducted clinical research, such as the ongoing STAR-TREC study, as larger randomised trials are required to establish the oncological safety of organ preservation.</p>

                <p id="para110">TREC was a randomised, open-label, feasibility study done in the UK, at 21 tertiary referral centres specialising in the treatment of early-stage rectal cancer. TREC assessed the feasibility of randomly assigning eligible patients with early-stage rectal cancer to either total mesorectal excision, without pre-operative radiotherapy in accordance with NICE guidance,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> or a novel organ preservation strategy. A non-randomised registry was included to capture treatment outcomes in patients for whom randomisation was considered inappropriate, due to a strong clinical indication for one of the treatment options (eg, individuals considered unsuitable for total mesorectal excision due to frailty, comorbidity, or older age).</p>
                <p id="para120">Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with rectal adenocarcinoma staged T2 or lower, no lymph node involvement (ie, N0), with a maximum diameter of 30 mm or less, and no metastasis. Patients with a previous history of pelvic radiotherapy were excluded. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para130">All patients were reviewed by a colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team at each centre, and eligible patients who were considered equally suitable for total mesorectal excision or organ preservation were invited to enrol in the study and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment allocation was done with a computer-based randomisation service accessed by telephone or web link. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. Where the multidisciplinary team strongly preferred one of the two treatment groups the patients were invited to participate in the study via a non-randomised registry. Entry to the registry was by online or telephone registration before any treatment was initiated. At the outset of the study, eligible patients who declined randomisation were excluded from the study and offered standard treatment, but a protocol amendment on May 8, 2013, allowed patients who were particularly reluctant to undergo radical surgery or formation of a stoma to choose organ preservation through the non-randomised registry.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para140">Baseline investigations included colonoscopy, tumour biopsy, high-resolution pelvic MRI, endorectal ultrasound (optional) and CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Organ preservation consisted of three-dimensional pelvic conformal short-course radiotherapy followed by local excision. 25 Gy in five fractions was given over a period of 5–7 days with photon energies of at least 6 MV and a three or four field technique. The clinical radiotherapy target volume included the tumour, mesorectum, and internal iliac, obturator and presacral nodes, up to the level of S2/3 junction. Radiotherapy quality assurance was coordinated by the UK National Cancer Research Institute Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance team.</p>
                <p id="para150">After an interval of 8–10 weeks following completion of short-course radiotherapy the area of the rectal wall affected by cancer was removed, with a 10 mm margin of normal mucosa, via transanal endoscopic microsurgery. The surgeon performed full thickness local disc excision of the tumour site, incorporating the muscularis propria with a small amount of mesorectal fat. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimens were pinned out, mucosal surface upwards, to identify the rim of surrounding normal tissue, before fixing intact. Standard radical surgery adhered to the principles of total mesorectal excision by low anterior resection or abdominoperineal excision where the primary tumour encroached upon the anal canal. Surgery comprised a minimally invasive, open, or hybrid approach. Specimens were classified according to TNM5, and pT1 cancers were substaged by the depth of the submucosal invasion. Central histopathological review was done for quality assurance and to score radiotherapy regression grade. Pathological complete response (ypT0) was designated by no visible tumour cells, despite embedding the entirety of the tumour and sectioning all blocks at three levels. Histopathological features considered high risk for local relapse following organ preservation were a maximum tumour diameter greater than 30 mm, cancer within 1 mm of the circumferential or deep resection margin, predominantly poor differentiation, presence of lymphatic or venous invasion (intramural or extramural), and tumour depth of invasion of submucosal tumour stage 3 (sm3) or greater.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Patients with one or more of these high-risk features were considered for planned early conversion from organ preservation to total mesorectal excision surgery within 8 weeks.</p>
                <p id="para160">Patients were followed up in the clinic at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months; with carcinoembryonic antigen testing at 12, 24, and 36 months; and CT scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis at 12 and 24 months. Additionally, patients undergoing organ preservation had white light endoscopy and MRI scans every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.</p>

                <p id="para170">The primary endpoint was cumulative recruitment of randomised patients, reported 12, 18, and 24 months from the date of first randomisation. Secondary endpoints comprised measures of safety, including 30-day and 6-month mortality, clinician-reported morbidity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4·0, reported 3 weeks after short-course radiotherapy and incidence of serious adverse events), patient-reported toxicity, and HRQOL assessed with validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C29 and C30 questionnaires measured at baseline, and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months in the intention-to-treat population.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Serious adverse events were defined as those that caused death, threat to life, prolonged hospital stay, readmission to hospital, or persistent disability. Secondary efficacy endpoints were tumour downstaging (including the incidence of histopathological features considered high risk for local recurrence following transanal excision alone), organ preservation rate, stoma rates, tumour recurrence, disease-free survival, overall survival, and HRQOL. Overall survival was calculated from the date of randomisation or registration to the date of death, and disease-free survival was calculated from the date of randomisation or registration to the date of death or disease recurrence, whichever occurred first. The site of recurrence at first relapse was grouped as isolated local (pelvic), local plus distant, or isolated distant, to determine recurrence-free survival.</p>

TREC assessed the feasibility of developing multidisciplinary organ preservation teams, opening sites, and recruiting patients to a randomised trial design.

              <p id="para220">Compliance with the organ preservation treatment strategy was high for both randomised (23 [85%] of 27 patients) and non-randomised groups (55 [90%] of 61; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Short-course radiotherapy was well tolerated, with four (15%) of 27 patients having one or more grade 3 adverse event, of which diarrhoea was the most common (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). Three patients who were randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision refused this treatment allocation and instead received the organ preservation treatment (protocol deviation); two of these three patients reverted back to total mesorectal excision following transanal endoscopic microsurgery due to the presence of histopathological features considered high risk for local recurrence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Patients randomly assigned to undergo primary total mesorectal excision were most frequently reconstructed by low anterior resection (23 [82%] of 28), with a temporary diverting stoma (20 [71%] of 28; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The rate of abdominoperineal excision with total mesorectal excision was 14% (four of 28 patients) in the intention-to-treat population.

Three patients (staged ypT1sm2N0, ypT1sm3N0, and ypT2N0) randomly assigned to organ preservation underwent total mesorectal excision by low anterior resection following short-course radiotherapy without undergoing transanal endoscopic microsurgery (protocol deviations); in one, the transanal endoscopic microsurgery equipment could not reach the tumour, while in the other two the tumour was considered too large for transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Early per-protocol conversion from organ preservation to total mesorectal excision followed histopathological evaluation of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimen in five (19%) of 27 patients (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>); there was no evidence of residual tumour in three patients, while two were staged ypT2N0.</p>
              <p id="para240">Histopathological evaluation of randomised transanal endoscopic microsurgery specimens revealed that seven (26%) of 27 patients achieved a pathological complete response, and one achieved a clinical complete response (without transanal endoscopic microsurgery); therefore, eight (30%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation achieved a complete response (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). The remaining patients were staged pT1 (six [22%] of 27), pT2 (eight [30%] of 27), and pT3 (five [19%] of 27). Of the 26 patients who underwent resection, resection margins were clear of cancer in 23 (88%) cases; three (12%) demonstrated adenocarcinoma up to 1 mm of the deep margin. Histopathological examination revealed that 14 (50%) of 28 patients randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (ie, who did not undergo radiotherapy) were pT1, 13 (46%) of 28 were pT2, and one (4%) of 28 was pT3 (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Microscopic lymph node metastasis was detected in four (14%) of 28 patients.

Patients randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision also demonstrated persistent moderate or large deteriorations in overall QOL, health anxiety, and role and social function, compared to baseline.

There was also a moderate increase from baseline diarrhoea scores at 36 months for patients randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision (increase of 13·4 points) in comparison with those assigned to organ preservation (decrease of 6·8 points; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>I). Notably, the scores in the total mesorectal excision and organ preservation groups for faecal incontinence and flatulence were relatively similar at 36 months, with both groups reporting relatively mild symptoms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>K). Urinary symptoms, including frequency and incontinence, remained stable during follow-up.

The benefit of organ preservation in patient-reported outcome scores was supported by an exploratory Bayesian model-based analysis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). Higher probabilities towards benefit for organ preservation were observed with organ preservation in many items at baseline, as noted previously. Inferences were adjusted for baseline values.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para290">The TREC study demonstrates that it is feasible to randomly assign patients with early-stage rectal cancer to two markedly different treatment options: multimodality organ preservation treatment or total mesorectal excision with no preoperative radiotherapy. 81% of eligible patients approached for TREC took part and 36% were randomly assigned, highlighting the acceptability of an organ preservation approach if it is offered. All sites that included more than three patients were able to randomly assign patients, suggesting that clinical teams effectively adapted conventional clinical consultations to randomly assign patients to a study comparing two substantially different treatment approaches. The high proportion of non-randomised patients allocated to organ preservation indicates that referral patterns to specialist organ preservation practices were well established for frail, elderly, comorbid, and stoma-averse individuals with early-stage rectal cancer but underdeveloped in the wider patient population considered suitable for total mesorectal excision. Importantly, TREC was designed as a feasibility study, to introduce and evaluate a protocolised, multimodality organ preservation approach. The primary aim was to determine whether patients and clinicians would support randomisation between radical surgery and organ preservation, with secondary aims relating to safety, efficacy, and acceptability—key elements to inform the design of a future phase 3 trial.</p>
              <p id="para300">Recent systematic reviews do not support adoption of an organ preservation approach for treatment of early-stage rectal cancer in fit patients because of insufficient high quality evidence.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In comparison with previous studies of chemoradiotherapy, the organ preservation approach followed in the TREC study has a number of strengths; we reported higher radiotherapy compliance (99% in randomised and non-randomised patients) than with chemoradiotherapy in previous studies (72–89%) and low acute toxicity (grade 3 adverse events: 15% <italic>vs</italic> 10–42%), alongside favourable organ preservation and complete response rates.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The low acute toxicity rate is not only reflected by clinician-reported monitoring of serious adverse events, but importantly also by prospective assessment of patient-reported outcomes. As a feasibility study, TREC was not powered to undertake formal comparisons of specific long-term cancer outcomes, but the sample size allowed exploratory evaluation of downstaging of histopathological features that would be considered high risk for local recurrence if present following transanal endoscopic microsurgery alone.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Introduction of short-course radiotherapy with an interval of 8–10 weeks to transanal endoscopic microsurgery was associated with significant tumour downstaging, corroborating an earlier report.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para310">To the best of our knowledge, we have, for the first time, shown consistent indications of benefit in multiple aspects of HRQOL and patient-reported toxicity with an organ preservation approach compared with total mesorectal excision alone, for up to 3 years. The risk of serious adverse events was lower with an organ preservation approach (15%) than with total mesorectal excision (39%), which is the current standard of care. The organ preservation rates observed with short-course radiotherapy are equivalent to those observed in other studies evaluating chemoradiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Results from non-randomised patients who underwent organ preservation, who were a decade older with increased comorbidities, were consistent with those obtained from the randomised patient population and also in accordance with our previous experience of using short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery to achieve organ preservation in elderly and frail patients.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Several studies of organ preservation have recorded severe treatment-related toxicities that might be poorly tolerated in an older, frail patient population and so it was reassuring that in our study the tolerability and toxicity of short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery did not seem to be any worse for this group.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The high rates of organ preservation for non-randomised patients might reflect a clear reticence for total mesorectal excision to be either offered or accepted. It is likely that the threshold for converting patients to total mesorectal excision in the non-randomised organ preservation group was higher than in the randomised group as non-randomised patients were generally older, with comorbidities. Notably, this discrepancy in conversion rates did not lead to a marked increase in local recurrence. Future studies need to address the best approach to manage the decision to convert patients to total mesorectal excision.</p>
              <p id="para320">Short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery, after an interval of 8–10 weeks, led to 30% of randomised patients and 41% of non-randomised patients achieving a complete response, which is similar to studies of chemoradiotherapy where 40–45% of patients achieved a complete response.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> A 10-week interval from short-course radiotherapy to transanal endoscopic microsurgery was chosen to balance the potential benefits of waiting longer for optimal tumour regression with the risk of disease progression through treatment delay in a small proportion of patients who might be resistant to radiotherapy. At the inception of the TREC study the benefits of a good histopathological tumour response were appreciated,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> and the available evidence suggested that short-course radiotherapy produced downstaging after an interval to surgery of 10 days or more;<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> however, the optimal timing for assessment of radiotherapy response was unknown. TREC used transanal endoscopic microsurgery routinely, as did other contemporary studies following reports of extremely poor correlation between clinical and histopathological staging in the context of a relatively short interval between radiotherapy and radical surgery.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Emerging data on the oncological safety of non-operative approaches to rectal cancer treatment,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> combined with the high complete response rates observed in this study and others,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> suggest that the adoption of a watch-and-wait strategy with selective use of transanal endoscopic microsurgery is feasible with the aim of further reducing treatment-related toxicity and improving HRQOL.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, the small sample size of TREC and the low number of events preclude meaningful analysis of oncological outcomes. We found no significant difference in either overall survival or disease-free survival between patients randomly assigned to organ preservation versus those randomly assigned to total mesorectal excision, in line with the GRECCAR 2 study,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> with very wide confidence intervals for the hazard ratios, reflecting the small sample size and relatively small number of events. A consistent proportion of patients relapse with distant metastasis regardless of primary therapy.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Isolated and technically salvageable local recurrence was detected in two (7%) of 27 patients randomly assigned to organ preservation, each associated with strong histological indicators for early conversion to total mesorectal excision (ypT3R0 and ypT2R1), but the patients had declined early conversion to total mesorectal excision and opted for close observation. Local recurrence might have been avoided with early conversion. These data emphasise the need for a phase 3 trial to more precisely define the risks and benefits associated with adopting an organ preservation approach.</p>
              <p id="para330">Despite the small patient numbers, the patient-reported outcomes data reveal that an organ preservation approach is associated with consistent improvements in multiple symptom and function items 3 months after treatment, with longer-term benefits for overall QOL, social function, body image, and less embarrassment about bowel function. We found no evidence of acute deterioration in HRQOL or patient-reported toxicity with organ preservation versus total mesorectal excision.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This exploratory analysis supports favourable longer-term patient-reported outcome scores seen at 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year follow-ups after organ preservation in various trials.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Our data provide an important contribution to the literature due to the absence of published randomised studies comparing patient-reported outcomes following total mesorectal excision and organ preservation. Although an unexpected finding, the lower baseline mean scores in a number of function items for the radical surgery group (completed after knowledge of randomisation status) might reflect our impression that the perceived risks of surgery in early-stage rectal cancer are higher than patients desire.</p>
              <p id="para340">As a feasibility study, TREC provides the justification to further evaluate short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery versus radical surgery in a randomised setting. Although randomisation was feasible, our recruitment rate across centres indicated that recruitment to a future phase 3 trial should be international. Around the same time as the TREC study, a single-arm phase 2 trial done in the Netherlands (CARTS) had evaluated chemoradiotherapy followed by transanal endoscopic microsurgery.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> These studies provided the basis for the design of an international phase 2/3 trial (STAR-TREC) designed to randomly assign patients to radical surgery, organ preservation with short-course radiotherapy, and organ preservation with chemoradiotherapy.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The external pilot (phase 2) demonstrated that it was possible to accelerate recruitment and the study progressed to phase 3 in 2020. The adoption of a more selective use of transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and a longer time interval to assess response in STAR-TREC were based on new data that became available after the completion of recruitment to TREC.</p>
              <p id="para350">Our findings have some limitations: in a feasibility study the overall numbers of randomised patients are low and individual centres contributed relatively few patients. However, recruitment of a randomised patient population has considerable strengths and reduces many sources of bias. This dataset will help inform the choices of patients who would normally receive standard total mesorectal excision and are considering the option to undergo organ preservation instead. The non-randomised registry primarily set out to describe the tolerability of treatment and early outcomes for older individuals considered to be at high risk for total mesorectal excision as this population is generally under-represented in rectal cancer trials. Although eligibility for inclusion was identical to the randomised group, the results should not be directly extrapolated to patients considered fit for total mesorectal excision. It is nonetheless reassuring that consistent trends were demonstrated across both randomised and non-randomised populations following novel organ preservation therapy with short-course radiotherapy and transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Although the use of routine transanal endoscopic microsurgery might now be considered over-treatment, at the time of the design of TREC, there were little data to support the long-term oncological safety of a watch-and-wait strategy, and there were concerns that short-course radiotherapy and treatment delay without transanal endoscopic microsurgery represented significant under-treatment.</p>
              <p id="para360">We conclude that TREC provides evidence to support further evaluation of organ preservation strategies that incorporate short-course radiotherapy as an alternative to radical surgery for early-stage rectal cancer. This is a feasible and acceptable approach for patients. Further evaluation of short-course radiotherapy is justified because of the excellent compliance, low toxicity, benefits in HRQOL, and high organ preservation rates observed in TREC. It is important that organ preservation continues to be evaluated in the context of well-conducted clinical research to establish the oncological safety of this approach.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
