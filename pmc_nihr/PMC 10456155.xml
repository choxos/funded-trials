                  <title>Background and aim</title>
                  <p>Attempts at personalisation of exercise programmes in head and neck cancer (HaNC) have been limited. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of introducing a remotely delivered, fully personalised, collaborative, and flexible approach to prescribing and delivering exercise programmes into the HaNC usual care pathway.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This is a single arm, feasibility study. Seventy patients diagnosed with HaNC will be recruited from two regional HaNC centres in the United Kingdom. Patients will undertake an 8-week exercise programme designed and delivered by cancer exercise specialists. The exercise programme will start any time between the time of diagnosis and up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, depending on patient preference. The content of the exercise programme will be primarily based on patient needs, preferences, and goals, but guided by current physical activity guidelines for people with cancer. The primary outcome measure is retention to the study. Secondary quantitative outcomes are uptake to the exercise programme, different measures of exercise adherence, pre- and post-intervention assessments of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory—Short Form), quality of life (SF-36), physical activity levels (International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Short Form), and various components of physical fitness. The outcomes of the nested qualitative study are acceptability and feasibility of the intervention evaluated via interviews with patients, health care professionals, and the cancer exercise specialists. Intervention and participant fidelity will be determined using checklists and scrutiny of each patient’s logbook and the cancer exercise specialists’ meeting notes. Analysis of quantitative data will be via standard summary statistics. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis.</p>

              <sec id="sec006">
                <title>Rationale and background</title>
                <p>Head and neck cancer (HaNC) represents malignancies arising from the larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, lips, and nasopharynx [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globally, HaNC is the seventh most common cancer with over 930,000 new cases and almost 500,000 deaths annually [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Symptom burden is typically considerable and mainly related to the location of the cancer and its treatment, the latter of which is often aggressive and multi-modal [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some symptoms are often still evident at 1-year post-treatment [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Notably, people with HaNC are typically frailer and more than twice as likely to report cancer-related disability than individuals with other cancers [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Identification of safe and effective interventions to help address these issues and improve the quality of life of people with HaNC is therefore an important endeavour.</p>
                <p>Substantial scientific evidence accumulated for more than 30 years indicates that exercise is a safe, cost-efficient, and effective intervention during all parts of the cancer continuum [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Regular exercise can reduce symptoms such as cancer-related fatigue and depression, attenuate cancer treatment-related toxicity, help prevent and manage co-morbidities, and reduce cancer-specific and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Exercise oncology research has mostly been conducted in breast, prostate, and colon cancer, however, and HaNC has been severely underrepresented [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Generalising findings from other cancers is problematic, since people with HaNC often differ considerably in ways that have important implications for exercise prescription and delivery [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A survey of 430 people with HaNC, for example, found that HaNC-related symptoms were perceived as major barriers to engaging in exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Specifically, dry mouth and throat, swallowing difficulties, shoulder weakness and pain, and drainage issues in the mouth or throat were ranked first, fifth, sixth, and seventh, respectively, of 37 perceived barriers to exercise. Other symptoms such as pain, depression, malnutrition, and weight loss are common to other cancers, but often more prevalent or more severe in people with HaNC [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This considerable symptom burden, combined with poor health literacy, high levels of social deprivation, and social isolation [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], likely explains the low levels of physical activity and poor cardiorespiratory fitness observed in HaNC cohorts [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, these factors make people with HaNC a hard-to-reach group for engagement in lifestyle interventions such as exercise programmes [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>A survey of people with HaNC in the United Kingdom reported that many are motivated to participate in an exercise programme if such an intervention was available [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Physical activity is not included in the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines for improving HaNC outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], however, and exercise programmes are not currently part of usual care for HaNC in the United Kingdom. Moreover, despite their many unique issues that have important implications for exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], no published physical activity guidelines currently exist on how to best prescribe exercise and promote its uptake and adherence in people with HaNC. Another notable issue is that centralisation of HaNC services in the United Kingdom has resulted in regional units serving large geographical areas. Thus, centralised service-based exercise programmes are unlikely to be an effective approach to support exercise uptake and adherence, since travel distance negatively impacts participation in an exercise programme in those with cancer [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>A major criticism of exercise oncology research is that the individual needs of people with cancer have largely been ignored, using a ‘one size fits all’ approach to the design and delivery of exercise programmes [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Consequently, a patient-centred approach that includes personalisation of exercise programmes for people with HaNC has been limited [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This is an important issue, as preferences for the frequency, intensity, duration, type, and location of exercise, and timing of the start of an exercise programme, vary considerably among people with HaNC [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies involving mainly people with breast cancer have shown significantly better outcomes for personalised exercise programmes versus a more standardised approach [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A collaborative approach in which people with HaNC have at least equal input into the design of the exercise programme is also desirable, as this provides a high level of autonomy, which is an important determinant of exercise adherence [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is consistent with the National Health Service’s long-term plan for a high level of personalisation in health and care in England, recognising that a one size fits all approach cannot meet the increasing complexity of peoples’ needs and expectations [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another issue is that fluctuations in symptoms across the HaNC continuum affect the willingness, tolerance, and ability to perform exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which might be somewhat dependent on the type of treatment the patient is receiving or has received. It therefore seems desirable to incorporate built-in flexibility into exercise programmes, to allow patients to autoregulate their exercise in quick response to changing symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Built-in flexibility also should improve exercise adherence by allowing a rapid response to any changes in patient circumstances and by improving self-efficacy for overcoming barriers to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Patients. Seventy patients will be recruited from the two HaNC regional centres. This should provide a minimum sample size of 42 patient participants on study completion, based on a conservative estimated retention rate of 60% [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The target sample size was determined pragmatically using guidelines for feasibility studies that recommend a sample size of between 24 and 50 [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, a sample size of 40 people with HaNC for a feasibility study involving an exercise intervention has been deemed sufficient to estimate an effect size for a full trial [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
                <p>Patient participants must meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) ≥ 16 years old; 2) able to provide informed consent; 3) diagnosed with HaNC and being treated with curative intent; 4) between the time of diagnosis and up to 8 weeks post-treatment; and 5) classified as low or medium risk according to a physical activity preparticipation risk stratification tool [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Patients classified as high risk according to the risk stratification tool, being treated with palliative intent, or engaging in any other intervention that may exert interference effects during their participation in this study, will be excluded from participation. The study will be as inclusive as possible, engaging adult patients with no restriction on age, socioeconomic background, ethnic diversity, or geographical location. The National Institute for Health and Care Research Equality, Diversity and Inclusion toolkit [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] will be used for increasing participation of underserved communities, such as ethnic minorities. Any patients with speech difficulties will be supported with alternative and augmentative communication methods.</p>
                <p>Health care professionals and cancer exercise specialists. Up to 20 healthcare professionals, involved in the usual care of people with HaNC, will be consented to take part in an interview to establish their views on the acceptability, processes, and integration of the intervention into the usual care pathway. Three cancer exercise specialists, employed to design and deliver the exercise programmes, also will be invited to be interviewed.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>A HaNC research nurse or the treating clinician will screen potentially eligible patient participants against the eligibility criteria using weekly head and neck multidisciplinary team meetings, clinical lists, and patient medical notes. Eligible patients, who represent those newly diagnosed with HaNC, will be introduced to the study, and given participant information sheets for both the main study and the nested qualitative study during their next routine clinic appointment, between the time of diagnosis and the start of treatment. Eligible patients will be subsequently followed-up to enquire about their willingness to enrol. Although it has been recommended that exercise programmes should be included in the cancer survivorship plan as early as possible [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], many people with HaNC do not feel able to start before treatment [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Patients that initially decline will therefore be asked for consent to be re-approached after starting their cancer treatment and, where relevant, again at their first post-treatment consultation. Patients also will be informed that they can enrol in the exercise programme at any time between diagnosis and up to 8-weeks post-treatment and will be given instructions on how to do this. Patients will not be permitted to re-enrol in the exercise programme if they withdraw, or postpone the exercise programme once started, since the effect of timing of the start of the exercise programme on exercise adherence will be evaluated. Allowing different starting time points also allows for identification of any issues that are specific to the starting time. Patients that decline the intervention, or who withdraw from or postpone the intervention, will still be offered the opportunity to consent to participate in the nested qualitative study.</p>
                <p>The rate and timing of enrolment onto the exercise intervention will be quantified. Reasons for refusal to enrol onto the exercise programme will be sought while respecting the right to refuse without giving a reason. Patients who provide written consent to participate will be referred to an oncology specialist physiotherapist for pre-intervention assessments and their general practitioner will be informed about their participation in the study. Patients are not expected to incur any personal expenses during any stage of the study and there will be no financial compensation for participation. The study is suitably insured against personal harm.</p>

This initially involves increasing the repetitions within the target repetition range. Once the patient can perform the maximum number of repetitions within the target repetition range for all sets for a given exercise, with good form, the resistance is increased. When using exercise bands, the patient should be instructed on the importance of standardising hand placement on the band.

Split routines should be avoided unless the participant has recent (within the last 4 weeks) resistance training experience, <underline>and</underline> it is inappropriate for the volume of resistance exercise to be fit into one training bout. Exercises that target specific muscles should be incorporated into the training programme where dysfunction from treatment is interfering with the ability to undertake activities of daily living. Multijoint exercises and large muscle groups should be exercised before single joint and smaller muscle groups in each exercise session.</td>

                <p>Balance exercises also will be encouraged for any patients that present with balance issues during their initial assessments [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Patients’ needs, preferences, and goals will take precedence, however, if these are not congruent with current physical activity guidelines. This approach is based on the premise that the best exercises are the ones the person will do. Personalisation of exercise programmes will include appropriate manipulation of the frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, progression, and location of the exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A menu of no-cost, convenient, locally available, or virtual exercise options, partly informed by previous research [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], will be used to help patients choose their preferred type of exercise and location. However, patients will be encouraged to suggest alternatives based on preferences and any past successes at adhering to exercise. The exercise location is therefore likely to differ based on patient preference. Whether patients exercise alone or with others also will largely depend on personal preference. Supervised group exercise sessions will not be offered due to increased expense and funding restrictions. Flexibility will be embedded into each patient’s exercise programme so that they can autoregulate the acute training variables in response to changes in symptoms and other perceived barriers to exercise [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Coloured elastic resistance bands (Theraband, Akron, OH) will be given to patients for performing resistance exercises. Each colour represents a different band resistance at 100% elongation (i.e., tan = 1.1 kg, yellow = 1.3 kg, red = 1.7 kg, green = 2.1 kg, purple = 2.6 kg, black = 3.3 kg, silver = 4.6 kg, and gold = 6.5 kg). Resistance bands have been shown to be a versatile and effective method for developing muscular strength and endurance compared to the use of conventional resistance training equipment such as free weights and resistance training machines [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
                <p>Exercise programmes will be progressed towards meeting the minimum recommended amount of physical activity for people with cancer [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] where appropriate. The focus, however, will be on avoiding inactivity and promoting exercise adherence rather than meeting the physical activity guidelines as a primary goal. Exercise programmes will be progressed by manipulating only one acute training variable at a time.</p>
                <p>Comprehensive instructions will be given to patients on how to interpret the 6–20 ratings of perceived exertion scale, according to those published by Borg [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. An ‘ACTIOHN exercise prescription principles’ document, written specifically for this study, will be used to guide the cancer exercise specialists when writing each patient’s exercise programme and for completing fidelity checks.</p>
                <p>Each patient will meet with a cancer exercise specialist before the exercise programme starts, to discuss the exercise programme and to obtain patient approval of its content, and for the cancer exercise specialist to provide instruction on exercise technique and provide information on safety. During the 8-wk exercise programme, a cancer exercise specialist will undertake a weekly 30-minute, individual video or telephone consultation with each patient. Consultations will provide patient education, discuss safety issues, address perceived exercise barriers, and encourage accurate and timely completion of the patient’s daily exercise log. Videos, delivered via a commercially available app (Physitrack®; Physitrack PLC, UK), will be used to help instruct patients on how to perform exercises safely and effectively. Paper copies showing photographs and written instructions for each exercise will be supplied to any patients where video access is not possible. Although all exercises will be performed by patients unsupervised, the cancer exercise specialists will check and advise on technique during weekly consultations. The cancer exercise specialists will send two texts each week to each patient to further encourage timely completion of daily exercise logs. The second text also will include a motivational message.</p>
                <p>Behaviour change techniques to improve the patients adherence to the exercise programme will draw on the CALO-RE taxonomy [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and will be implemented using motivational interviewing skills [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Behaviour change techniques and motivational interviewing will be informed by Self-Determination Theory [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The cancer exercise specialists have been given specialist training on behaviour change techniques relevant to physical activity and their implementation through the motivational interviewing approach. Further behaviour change support for patients will include being given written ‘top tips’ information and ‘exercise stories’ of how to best manage specific HaNC symptoms and overcome barriers to exercise. These peer-informed resources were developed by clinicians in collaboration with the Cancer of Head and Neck Group Experience (CHANGE) patient and public involvement (PPI) group. The CancerFit (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cancerfit.me/site/" ext-link-type="uri">www.cancerfit.me/site/</ext-link>) and Macmillan (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support" ext-link-type="uri">www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support</ext-link>) websites, and our Twitter feed will provide online resource support.</p>
                <p>After post-intervention assessments with the oncology specialist physiotherapist, the patient will meet with a cancer exercise specialist for a final time to develop and agree a personalised exit strategy from the 8-week exercise programme. This is to facilitate transition to independent long-term exercise and will involve discussing and formalising the patient’s goals over the next 12 months, how the current exercise programme can be progressed, and information to facilitate sustained behaviour change and how to deal with relapses. This use of an exit strategy is consistent with that recommended for exercise referral schemes in the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>

                <p>A certified cancer exercise specialist is an advanced fitness instructor with a level 4 vocational qualification, according to the Regulated Qualifications Framework in the UK, in designing and delivering oncology exercise programmes. The three cancer exercise specialists involved in the present study also hold other vocational health and fitness qualifications and one is enrolled on an MSc in Cancer Care degree programme. All the cancer exercise specialists performed a similar role as for the present study working on the SafeFit trial [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. They already have received training from a chartered psychologist (ARL) in motivational interviewing and other behaviour change techniques. The training involved two, 2-hour workshops and included a bespoke workbook that contains content from workshop presentation slides, practical activities, scenario-based learning activities, action and coping planning sheets, and self-reflective diary sheets. The cancer exercise specialists also met with the chartered psychologist for 1 hour at another two time points during working with their first patient to obtain further support in applying the motivational interviewing and other behaviour change techniques. Exercise programme design and delivery by the cancer exercise specialists will be undertaken with the guidance and supervision (including fidelity checks) of a certified exercise physiologist (AWM) via fortnightly meetings throughout the study period.</p>

Completion of this checklist will be facilitated by scrutinising exercise programmes and logs completed by the cancer exercise specialists.

                <title>Interviews</title>
                <p>Acceptability of the intervention will be explored by qualitative semi-structured interviews with approximately 20 of the participants with HaNC, purposively sampled to ensure maximum variation based on gender, age, socio-demographic characteristics, location, type of cancer treatment, and where possible, those that declined to participate. Patients who decline, withdraw from, postpone, or complete the intervention will be invited to participate in an interview. Purposive sampling will aim to capture patients at different time points (i.e., both during and after completion of the programme) and patients with different levels of adherence to the intervention. Feasibility of integrating the intervention into the usual care pathway will be explored by qualitative semi-structured interviews with up to 20 healthcare professionals involved in the care of the people with HaNC at the two study sites, and the cancer exercise specialists. The focus will be on assessments and programme delivery, usability of the study materials and intervention tools, and acceptability of the content and timing of the intervention. All interviews will be conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher with skills in interviewing vulnerable populations around sensitive topics. Informed consent will be sought prior to interview. Interviews will be audio-recorded. A topic guide will be used in the interviews, but interviewees will be encouraged to speak freely about any other issues relating to the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. The topic guide has been developed from discussions within the wider research team, the CHANGE PPI group, and from literature around exercise participation. The guide will be revised as new issues emerge in each interview. Each interview is expected to last between 40 and 60 minutes.</p>

              <title>Data analyses</title>
              <p>Quantitative methods. The primary outcome is to report the retention rate of patients enrolled into the study. The retention rate will be estimated to a degree of precision equal to 11.5% if the minimum sample size is achieved. As this is a feasibility study, no formal hypothesis tests will be undertaken. Both primary and secondary outcomes will be reported for baseline and follow-up using standard summary statistics such as means, medians, and percentages, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Demographic information also will be reported using standard summary statistics. Estimates of variability in the primary outcome measure will be used to determine the sample size for a definitive randomised controlled trial. All analyses will be undertaken using the STATA software package (Version 17, StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA).</p>
              <p>Qualitative methods. Thematic analysis will be undertaken using a framework approach [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Data will be analysed by the Research Associate and team members (AL, AWM, VB, MGC, JP), and conducted iteratively throughout the project. The developing analysis will be regularly discussed at project meetings and where appropriate, inform changes to study processes. The patient and staff transcripts will initially be analysed separately. The enquiry will focus on the feasibility and acceptability of introducing exercise using a personalised, collaborative, and flexible approach, at a range of time points, including the exit strategy and exercise maintenance. The analysis team will discuss and agree emerging codes and themes. The analysis framework will then be constructed, informed by Normalization Process Theory [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], covering four key areas: 1) how people make sense of a new practice (coherence); 2) the willingness of people to sign-up and commit to the new practice (cognitive participation); 3) their ability to take on the work required of the practice (collective action); and 4) activity undertaken to monitor and review the practice (reflexive monitoring). The analysis will remain open to relevant issues that may not be captured within the framework and novel issues arising in transcripts incorporated into a revised framework. Standard approaches to the rigorous analysis of qualitative data (including constant comparison, deviant case analysis, and member checking for accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0289911.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]) will be used.</p>
              <p>Triangulation. Quantitative and qualitative data on patients’ and healthcare professionals’ engagement with the intervention, will be regularly discussed and triangulated at project management group meetings to identify ways to refine the intervention and study processes while the study is ongoing. The impact of these refinements will then be examined both qualitatively and quantitatively. Procedurally, the “following a thread” framework for triangulation and integrative analysis of qualitative and quantitative data will be adopted. There is no assumption over the primacy of either data type and will look for both convergences and divergences between them and aim to produce categories and themes that accommodate both types of data. Attention to exploring any divergences between the quantitative and qualitative data will be given, as these can often provide important insights. This will generate insights about ways of personalising the intervention to the needs and preferences of different patient groups, understanding variation in engagement and outcomes of the intervention, and provide insights on the mechanisms by which the intervention has an impact.</p>

                <p>Patients’ study data will be collected by the principal investigator for each study site, or their delegated representative, and recorded in the case report forms. The case report form data will be pseudo-anonymised through a unique study identifier number. A record linking the patient’s name to the unique study identifier number will be held in a locked room at the study sites and will be the responsibility of the principal investigators. The Chief Investigator or delegated representative will monitor completeness and quality of data recording in case report forms and will regularly correspond with site principal investigators (or delegated team members) with the aim of capturing any missing data and ensuring continuous high quality of data. Data will be entered at study sites onto a secure online system, with the paper originals remaining at site. Written consent forms will be stored securely according to the Research Ethics Committee’s requirement.</p>
                <p>Interview audio recordings will be encrypted, and password protected and sent to the University of Liverpool for transcribing. Interview recordings will be transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription agency with a secure upload facility. Once received, transcripts will be checked for accuracy and edited to remove any identifying information to ensure anonymity of respondents. Each patient will be assigned a code that will give assurance that they cannot be identified. This will be stored with electronic consent records in case a participant wishes to withdraw from the study. Transcripts will be held securely on the password-protected encrypted server at the University of Liverpool. Recordings will be deleted once it is established that the research team will not need to revisit them.</p>
                <p>The Chief Investigator will have overall responsibility for the quality and retention of study data. Data will be handled, computerised, and stored in accordance with the latest directive on Good Clinical Practice (2005/28/EC) and local policy. Clinical information will not be released without the written permission of the patient, except as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, its designee, regulatory authorities, or the Research Ethics Committee. Prior written agreement from the Sponsor or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any confidential information to other parties.</p>

They also were asked for their opinions on completing specific fatigue and physical activity questionnaires. The group were further asked to develop resources that will be given to patient participants to advise them on how to best manage specific HaNC symptoms and overcome exercise barriers. This was overseen by clinicians. VB chaired three PPI meetings as part of the input into developing this study and corresponded with the group by email to obtain feedback outside of scheduled meetings. She attended the research team meetings and will continue to do so throughout the data collection, analyses, and dissemination phases. VB will chair another five PPI meetings during this period.

Some of the PPI group expressed uncertainties as to whether they could exercise, and some thought they needed to rest to recover. There were many exercise barriers described (e.g., confidence, motivation, leaving the house, feeding tube management, dry mouth, shoulder and neck stiffness, and finding achievable forms of exercise). Those that sought information about exercise in the past struggled to find anything appropriate for HaNC issues. They said a good assessment and encouragement from someone qualified, with suggestions for overcoming barriers to exercise (particularly relating to treatment side-effects), and an exercise programme flexible enough to accommodate their abilities, would be helpful. They were uncertain as to what the best time point might be to introduce an exercise programme. The PPI group piloted the patient-reported outcome measures and found them acceptable. Most of the PPI group preferred the short form version of the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory over the Piper Fatigue Scale because it was easier to understand and quicker to complete. Most also preferred the short form version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire over the long-form version because of the lower participant burden and thought this was particularly important when completing it when feeling fatigued. They also suggested the delivery of the intervention is acceptable and potentially achievable. The PPI group developed bespoke ‘top tips’ information and ‘exercise stories’ in collaboration with clinicians. These resources will be given to patient participants during their initial assessment visit to help them manage specific HaNC symptoms and overcome barriers to exercise.</td>
