              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patients with germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <italic>CYLD</italic> (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omim.org/605018">605018</ext-link>) develop multiple, disfiguring, hair follicle tumors on the head and neck. This condition, named CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS) (also known as Brooke-Spiegler syndrome [605041]), is rare; however, the effect on individual patients can be devastating, with up to 1 in 4 mutation carriers requiring complete surgical removal of the scalp.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> These patients also have numerous tumors on the trunk that are symptomatic with pain and prone to ulceration and bleeding. Tumors have a predilection to develop on the external ear and in the ear canal, resulting in conductive deafness. An additional predisposed site is pubic skin, associated with sexual dysfunction. These patients require repeated surgery to control tumor burden and lifelong monitoring of tumors, for which malignant transformation is infrequently reported. Radiotherapy is of limited benefit and carries the attendant risk of further tumor induction within the treatment field, as well as malignant transformation of treated tumors.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> To date, there are no effective medical alternatives to treat this rare orphan disease.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) was discovered as a candidate drug target after a search for targetable kinases in inherited CCS tumors using an unbiased genetic approach.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In the absence of any personalized, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for CCS, transcriptomics of human CCS tumors was used to aid the discovery of oncogenic kinases that were overexpressed and targetable.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Alterations in DNA and differences in RNA expression of fresh, snap-frozen tumors compared with adjacent, unaffected skin were characterized and led to 2 key findings.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> First, the genetic changes in these tumors were limited, with loss of heterozygosity at the <italic>CYLD</italic> locus being the only recurrent genetic change seen. This homogeneity implied that a targetable kinase discovered on this genetic background might have an effect on most tumors. Second, overexpression of TRKs selectively in tumor cells was identified, with overexpression of TRKB and TRKC in almost all tumors examined. Although the mechanism by which loss of CYLD function results in perturbation of TRK homeostasis is not fully understood, TRK signaling has been shown to confer a survival advantage to tumor cells by increasing resistance to apoptosis and cell proliferation.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="doi180025r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="doi180025r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This is pertinent because new-generation oral TRK inhibitors are now available, targeting cancers that overexpress TRK after gene rearrangement.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Pegcantratinib (previously CT327) is a potent TRKA inhibitor with activity against TRKB and TRKC. It is a topical investigational medicinal product developed by Creabilis SA (now Sienna Biopharmaceuticals, Inc) for the treatment of inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis and concomitant pruritus. Significant and clinically meaningful reduction in psoriatic pruritus was reported previously, which occurs via a TRKA-dependent mechanism, in patients treated with topical pegcantratinib, 0.5% (wt/wt).<sup><xref rid="doi180025r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> To our knowledge, the present trial is the first to investigate pegcantratinib use in patients with CCS; however, the drug has been given to 36 healthy volunteers and 336 patients in the clinical trials to date<sup><xref rid="doi180025r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="doi180025r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and was well tolerated at concentrations up to 0.5% wt/wt. These safety data supported the application of 0.5% wt/wt concentration in our patients.</p>
              <p>We designed an early-phase exploratory trial to investigate if delivering pegcantratinib to CCS tumors might represent a safe and feasible noninvasive treatment. This study is of translational relevance because <italic>Cyld</italic> transgenic mice fail to recapitulate the human CCS tumor phenotype,<sup><xref rid="doi180025r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> making the study of in vivo effects of TRK inhibition in humans with a topical intervention a necessary approach that overcomes this limitation. Furthermore, we leveraged the multiplicity of skin tumors in these patients to develop a statistically powered study, which is challenging in rare disease. The trial also offered the opportunity to gain novel insights into CCS, including its natural history, the rate of growth of early tumors, the frequency of pain in small tumors, and the effect of disease on patients’ quality of life.</p>

Regulatory approvals were sought and obtained from a human participants ethics review board (National Research Ethics Service Committee North East-Tyne and Wear [14/NE/1080;06/1059]) and the Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (EudraCT:2014-001342-21), and the trial was registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN75715723">ISRCTN75715723</ext-link>) and the trial protocol can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>. All recruited patients provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>Phase 1b was an open-label study to determine the short-term safety and tolerability of applying pegcantratinib, 0.5% (wt/wt) to a preselected single skin tumor (&lt;30 mm in diameter) in a <italic>CYLD</italic> mutation carrier that was scheduled for routine excision. The treated site was clinically assessed using a modified version of the Draize score test for signs of local site reaction,<sup><xref rid="doi180025r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a measure of skin inflammation, after 4 weeks. The lack of reactions (modified Draize score of ≤3) in at least 5 of 8 treated tumors allowed the trial to progress to phase 2a.</p>
                <p>Phase 2a was a within-patient (and by tumor) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f1">Figure 1</xref>A). The setting was a single-center trial based at a tertiary dermatogenetics referral center for CCS (Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, United Kingdom). We aimed to recruit 15 to 20 patients, each with 10 eligible small tumors (&lt;10 mm in diameter, with 5 matched lesions on each body side), with a target of 150 tumors treated and assessed for 12 weeks. Volume measurements and tumor pain assessments were taken at baseline, week 4, and week 12 by a masked assessor (M.D. and N.R.). At the 12-week (final) visit, one randomly selected recruited tumor was biopsied (punch biopsy specimen 4-6 mm in diameter) from each body side and snap frozen for molecular analyses.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>Between March 1, 2015, and July 1, 2016, a total of 23 patients who had germline mutations in <italic>CYLD</italic> or who satisfied clinical diagnostic criteria for CCS were recruited. In phase 1b, 8 female patients with a median age of 60 years (age range, 41-80 years) were recruited and completed the study. Each patient had a single large tumor selected for inclusion, and these tumors had a mean base diameter of 10.6 mm (range, 5-18 mm). None of the 8 patients developed any treatment site reactions, and all had a modified Draize score of 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f2">Figure 2</xref>A). Compliance with the treatment application was excellent, with 98.7% of intended applications administered. All patients reported that they would use the ointment if it was available as a treatment. Notably, 3 patients reported that their tumors had become less painful. Adverse event reporting identified 1 patient who developed shingles away from the treated site, and this was reported as mild and deemed unrelated to treatment. These safety and acceptability data allowed for progression to phase 2a.</p>

              <p>In phase 2a, 15 patients with CCS were recruited, of whom 7 had participated in phase 1b. In phase 2a, allocation of tumors was to either receive active treatment on the right side and placebo on the left side (arm A) or active treatment on the left side and placebo on the right side (arm B). Thirteen patients were female, and the median age of participants was 51 years (age range, 37-74 years). Patients had a range of comorbidities and medications (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Each patient had at least 10 eligible tumors that allowed for matching for size, with 5 selected on the left side of the patient and 5 selected on the right side (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). These small tumors (mean, 4.23 mm in diameter) selected against predefined criteria that were distinct from phase 1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f2">Figure 2</xref>B) because we wanted to study tumors before they reached a size when they were typically excised. Tumor characteristics indicated adequate matching in both arms of the trial (eTable 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Fourteen patients with 140 tumors completed the trial, with 1 patient withdrawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f1">Figure 1</xref>B and C) because of shift-working patterns preventing compliance with the treatment application. Baseline data for this patient are included in accord with the statistical analysis plan, which has an intent-to-treat analysis specification. Skin adverse events were minor. Itch, which was transient, was reported in 2 actively treated tumors. One additional tumor underwent ulceration, which may have been related to active treatment. Patient compliance with treatment was excellent, with 98.8% of protocol treatment delivered. Treatment acceptability was positive, with 10 of 14 patients reporting that they would use the ointment as a treatment if it was effective.</p>
              <p>In phase 2a, response to treatment was classified according to the World Health Organization–Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (WHO-RECIST) criteria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://recist.eortc.org/">http://recist.eortc.org/</ext-link>) as either a complete response or a partial response. Two tumors treated with pegcantratinib and 6 tumors treated with placebo were classified as responders. The prespecified critical number of tumors (n = 12) required to obtain a response in the actively treated tumors according to the statistical design was not met (<xref rid="doi180025t1" ref-type="table">Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f3">Figure 3</xref>). Tumor growth and shrinkage were seen in both actively treated tumors and placebo-treated tumors, and there was no significant difference in the mean volume at 12 weeks (difference of means, 3%; 95% CI, −6% to 7%). A priori specified analysis of tumors at terminal hair-bearing skin sites, such as scalp and vellus hair–bearing sites (nonhairy), did not reveal any trends in reduction in these subsets. Smaller tumors did not appear to respond differently than larger tumors.</p>

              <p>Pain was detected in 14 of 140 tumors in phase 2a. Similar pain patterns were noted in actively treated tumors and placebo-treated tumors, suggesting that it was unlikely to be the active treatment causing pain. Eight painful tumors received active treatment. In 4 of these tumors, pain increased or remained the same, and pain decreased in the other 4 tumors. Six painful tumors received placebo treatment. In 5 of these tumors, pain increased or remained the same, and pain decreased in 1 tumor.</p>
              <p>This trial opportunistically captured data on quality of life in CCS, and this was carried out using 2 validated tools at baseline only. The EQ-5D revealed a low effect of this disease on patients’ quality of life (eTable 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Notably, in the pain/discomfort dimension, 6 patients reported moderate pain, and 2 patients reported severe pain. The DLQI, an effect measure designed for skin conditions, disclosed a small to moderate effect on quality of life, with a median DLQI of 4 (interquartile range, 2-8) (eTable 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Access to skin biopsy specimens of tumor tissue treated in the trial allowed for in-depth molecular analyses. Histopathological analysis of 28 of 140 biopsied phase 2a tumors indicated that 25 (89.2%) were cylindroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f2">Figure 2</xref>C) and spiradenoma, with the remaining 3 (10.8%) being trichoepithelioma. Nerve stains of phase 1b tumor tissue demonstrated innervation of cylindroma and spiradenoma tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f2">Figure 2</xref>D), a feature not previously demonstrated within these tumors.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The drug penetration assay of 28 tumors was performed at 3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f4">Figure 4</xref>A). Pegcantratinib was demonstrated within multiple levels of tumor tissue in 12 of 14 pegcantratinib-treated tumors sampled. In certain tumors, drug was detected at all 3 levels, but in most tumors drug levels were only quantifiable in sections obtained from the top and middle levels. Corresponding placebo-treated tumors did not demonstrate the drug in these cases. The range of drug concentrations detected was from 13.61 to 1052 nM. Notably, 3-dimensional (3-D) culture of primary tumor cells demonstrated that 50% of cells are viable in concentrations of 19.2 μM (eFigure 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The drug assay was also used at the end of the trial once unmasking was performed to check for compliance. In 1 of 14 individuals, we detected the drug on the side opposite to the allocated side. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine if excluding this individual would alter the outcome of the study, and that was found not to be the case. Overall, this supports that the trial design and delivery were robust, with a low rate of application error.</p>

                  <p>A, Skin biopsy specimens were snap frozen and serially sectioned, such that tissue was available at 3 levels in the tumor biopsy core, labeled top layer, middle layer, and bottom layer. Adjacent sections for histology were taken at the same time to confirm position within the core biopsy–included tumor cells. A liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) assay was used to measure levels of pegcantratinib at 3 levels within the tumors. B, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on RNA extracted from tissue sections taken adjacent to sections used for the top level of the drug assay. Increased expression of targets of pegcantratinib, TRKB and TRKC, in tumors compared with control skin samples is shown. The error bars indicate SEM. C, Unsupervised clustering analysis of transcriptomes generated from RNA extracted from tissue sections taken adjacent to sections used for the top level of the drug assay demonstrated frequent clustering by patient rather than by allocation to active or placebo treatments.

              <p>We assessed phase 2a tumors for expression of TRKs by carrying out RNA sequencing. Increased expression of <italic>TRKB</italic> and <italic>TRKC</italic> transcripts was seen in tumor tissue compared with normal skin, a finding that was validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f4">Figure 4</xref>B). Mutation analysis of RNaseq data did not show mutations in <italic>TRKB</italic> and <italic>TRKC</italic> kinase domains to account for inactivity or acquired resistance. Clustering analysis of transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="doi180025f4">Figure 4</xref>C) demonstrated that most tumors clustered by patient rather than by allocation to active or placebo treatment. Downstream effects on proteins regulated by TRK signaling were assessed, namely, phosphorylated extracellular signal–regulated kinase (pERK) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2). pERK expression did not consistently reduce in the presence of active treatment (eFigure 2A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). BCL2 expression levels were reduced only in some pegcantratinib-treated tumors compared with levels in placebo-treated tumors and were unchanged or raised in others. No trend was evident from the data (eFigure 2B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-DOI180025-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>), suggesting limited abrogation of TRK signaling in CCS tumors with the concentration of pegcantratinib used in this trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We report the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial to date in a large CCS cohort using tumor transcriptomic–led drug targeting. The inclusion of placebo-treated tumors in phase 2a revealed that some early CCS tumors may reduce in size, underscoring the importance of our trial design. As an intervention, we used pegcantratinib, 0.5% (wt/wt), an existing kinase inhibitor with activity against TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC designed for topical use, with an excellent safety profile in humans. We used a novel method of interventional trial in inherited human skin tumors that allowed us to overcome the failure of <italic>Cyld</italic> transgenic mice to develop cylindromas<sup><xref rid="doi180025r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and provided tumor biopsy tissue to study the molecular effects of the intervention. We demonstrated that the drug penetrated tumor tissue. Most important, CYLD defective tumor primary cell culture models on 3-D tissue culture scaffolds showed sensitivity to low micromolar levels of pegcantratinib, supporting our rationale of in vivo targeting in patients with CCS. Drug measurement in treated tumor tissue demonstrated that high nanomolar concentrations were achieved in tumor cells with the applied concentration of pegcantratinib, which may account for the lack of clinical response seen. The absence of consistent changes in pERK and BCL2 in the actively treated tumors is consistent with this. Our data provide a rationale for dose-escalation studies of pegcantratinib or emerging systemic TRK inhibitors that have increasing safety data in humans.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="doi180025r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A clinically relevant observation was that pain reduction was reported in some tumors. Spiradenomas are recognized as 1 of 8 painful skin tumors in dermatology,<sup><xref rid="doi180025r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and 50% of patients with CCS have reported a painful tumor.<sup><xref rid="doi180025r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In the larger tumors seen in phase 1b, the reduction in pain seen in 3 painful tumors prompted us to study the smaller lesions for pain in phase 2a. Phase 2a tumors were less frequently symptomatic, and pain was only reported in 14 lesions, limiting the interpretation of our findings. Given the recognized activity of pegcantratinib in reducing itch,<sup><xref rid="doi180025r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> it is plausible that TRK inhibition, specifically of TRKA, within nociceptive pain fibers may account for this finding. We demonstrate multiple nerve fibers in these tumors, and these nerve cells may represent a second target in addition to cylindroma keratinocytes, where TRK is expressed.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study highlights a novel approach using targeted therapeutics based on transcriptomic profiling in the rare inherited skin disease CCS. We investigated if pegcantratinib ointment, developed for inflammatory dermatoses (eg, psoriasis), could inhibit and possibly shrink skin tumors in CCS and consequently minimize the need for surgery in this rare condition. The excellent safety profile observed during this period of intervention supports the rationale for future research using dose-escalation studies of higher concentrations of pegcantratinib. Furthermore, some patients reported pain reduction in selected tumors, and additional research is needed to understand this observation. Finally, the careful study of these rare tumors has provided new data on the rate of tumor growth and their effect on quality of life, knowledge that will support the design of future trials in CCS.</p>
