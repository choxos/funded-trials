                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Faecal incontinence (FI) is a substantial health problem with a prevalence of approximately 8% in community-dwelling populations. Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is considered the first-line surgical treatment option in adults with FI in whom conservative therapies have failed. The clinical efficacy of SNM has never been rigorously determined in a trial setting and the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The design encompasses a multicentre, randomised, double-blind crossover trial and cohort follow-up study. Ninety participants will be randomised to one of two groups (SNM/SHAM or SHAM/SNM) in an allocation ratio of 1:1. The main inclusion criteria will be adults aged 18â€“75 years meeting Rome III and ICI definitions of FI, who have failed non-surgical treatments to the UK standard, who have a minimum of eight FI episodes in a 4-week screening period, and who are clinically suitable for SNM. The primary objective is to estimate the clinical efficacy of sub-sensory SNM vs. SHAM at 32Â weeks based on the primary outcome of frequency of FI episodes using a 4-week paper diary, using mixed Poisson regression analysis on the intention-to-treat principle. The study is powered (0.9) to detect a 30% reduction in frequency of FI episodes between sub-sensory SNM and SHAM stimulation over a 32-week crossover period.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Secondary objectives include: measurement of established and new clinical outcomes after 1Â year of therapy using new (2017 published) optimised therapy (with standardised SNM-lead placement); validation of new electronic outcome measures (events) and a device to record them, and identification of potential biological effects of SNM on underlying anorectal afferent neuronal pathophysiology (hypothesis: SNM leads to increased frequency of perceived transient anal sphincter relaxations; improved conscious sensation of defaecatory urge and cortical/subcortical changes in afferent responses to anorectal electrical stimulation (main techniques: high-resolution anorectal manometry and magnetoencephalography).</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This trial will determine clinical effect size for sub-sensory chronic electrical stimulation of the sacral innervation. It will provide experimental evidence of modifiable afferent neurophysiology that may aid future patient selection as well as a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of FI.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par30">Faecal incontinence (FI) is defined as the recurrent involuntary loss of faecal material leading to a social or hygienic problem (International Consultation on Incontinence: ICI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and not related to an acute diarrhoeal illness (Rome III). While variations exist regarding prevalence due to differences in survey methods, screening questions, reference timeframe, definition and population studied, few could argue that FI is not a substantial health problem. Population studies suggest a prevalence ranging from 3 to 15% in community-dwelling women, 15% in community-dwelling older people, 18â€“33% in hospitals, 38% in home health, and up to 50â€“70% in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A clear relationship with advancing age suggests that it will remain a problem within the developing Western population demographic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">FI leads to substantive effects on quality of life in terms of physical and emotional health; to stigmatisation and social isolation; and in older people, admission to residential care. Societal costs incurred by lost work productivity and absenteeism can be added to significant direct and indirect medical costs attributable to drug and pad usage, to specialist care, and particularly to nursing costs in older patients. Such estimates probably under-reflect the full impact of FI due to under-reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that treatment of urinary and FI account for at least 2% of the total UK healthcare budget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Initial treatments of FI include pharmacological and behavioural therapies, the latter generally incorporating some form of biofeedback. While anecdotally these treatments appear to improve continence in a significant number of patients there is little high-quality evidence to support this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Traditionally, surgical treatments focussing on anal sphincter function are offered when conservative measures fail. These can be classified into reconstructive (sphincteroplasty), augmentation (bulking agents) and neosphincter procedures (artificial sphincters, graciloplasty). These procedures are invasive, irreversible, and balance variable success rates against some risk of significant morbidity. A stoma is the final option.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Neuromodulation is one of the fastest growing areas of medicine: technologies now address diverse disease areas including epilepsy, Parkinsonâ€™s disease and tremor, chronic pain and deafness. The application of neuromodulation to the problem of FI has significantly changed the treatment paradigm for many patients over the past 20Â years. Chronic stimulation of the sacral nerve roots using an implanted electrode and generator â€“ sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is now considered the first-line surgical treatment option for the majority of adults with FI in whom non-operative therapies have failed to alleviate symptoms (NICE 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) especially as it is the least invasive procedure. However, despite having regulatory approval from the NICE and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), SNM remains an expensive intervention with some limitations in terms of a high-quality evidence base for either mechanism of action or efficacy.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Evidence of SNM efficacy</title>
                <p id="Par34">Numerous observational studies show that SNM leads to substantial health gain for adults with FI with low levels of operative morbidity compared to alternative surgical strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Reduced FI episodes correlate with objective QoL improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and SNM has been shown to be cost-effective with an ICER of Â£25,070 per quality-adjusted lif e year (QALY) lying within the threshold recommended by NICE as an effective use of NHS resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This systematic review, however, also highlighted the generally poor methodological quality of included studies which were almost universally single-centre retrospective or prospective clinical case series with unblinded observers and failure to report outcomes on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The latter point is especially important since significant attrition bias undermines nearly all studies even including the higher-quality pivotal trial for FDA approval (a prospective multicentre US case series of 120 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Two independent publications from Europe that have reported large patient series using the ITT principle have shown less encouraging results (circa 45% long-term success) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">Available randomised trial data for SNM in FI have recently been systematically reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A total of six included studies comprised four randomised crossover designs and two parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). One crossover included only two patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; a further study published only in abstract form reported mainly mechanistic outcomes in only seven patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The remaining two crossover studies included the widely cited study by Leroi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], which enrolled 34 patients pre-selected on the basis of a successful prior SNM implantation. Only 27 participated in the crossover and only 24 completed the study (10 excluded patients included four explantations due to AEs and others due to lack of efficacy or protocol violations). Although the majority (18 / 24) of analysed patients preferred â€˜ONâ€™ vs. â€˜OFFâ€™ at the end of study, the study failed to show a clinically meaningful reduction of symptoms between ON and OFF periods; e.g. difference in median FI episodes per week of only one episode. This was suggested to result in part from a short washout period (1Â week) and a carry-over effect. A second published crossover study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] employed an identical trial design but with smaller numbers of patients, randomising only 16 of 31 preselected implanted patients and thence only for two 3-week crossover periods. In contrast to the earlier study, significant decreases in FI episodes and summative symptom scores were observed in the ON vs. OFF periods despite having no washout. In an unblinded RCT by Tjandra et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] 53 participants with severe faecal incontinence in the SNM group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group which received optimal medical therapy (mean âˆ’â€‰5.20, 95% CI âˆ’â€‰9.15 to âˆ’â€‰1.25 at 3Â months; mean âˆ’â€‰6.30, 95% CI âˆ’â€‰10.34 to âˆ’â€‰2.26 at 12Â months). Finally, an observer-blinded RCT of SNM vs. a less invasive form of neuromodulation: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] demonstrated a within-group effect size that was greater for SNM than PTNS. While pilot in design and with small numbers (<italic>n</italic>Â =â€‰40 total), this effect was modest compared to most observational case series.</p>

                <title>Evidence of SNM mechanism</title>
                <p id="Par36">Traditional understanding of the pathophysiology and surgical management of FI held that the sphincter â€˜barrierâ€™ had primacy. It is now clear that while sphincter disruption is still relevant to the development of FI in many patients; e.g. obstetric injuries, it is only one factor in complex defaecatory dysfunction that involves alteration in unconscious anorectal and pelvic reflexes and conscious modulation by the central nervous system (CNS). SNM was developed for FI with the view that it would augment defective sphincteric function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is now well appreciated that patients with FI resulting from pathophysiology other than primary sphincter dysfunction also benefit from treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The importance of sensory dysfunction on both urinary and bowel control is being increasingly appreciated and there is strong evolving evidence (including our own pilot data in humans and experimental animals) that the mechanism of action of SNM results primarily from modulation of afferent nerve activity.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Pulling the above evidence together it is clear that the clinical efficacy of SNM has never been rigorously determined in a trial setting. There is, therefore, a need for a well-designed study of SNM that seeks to determine definitive proof of clinical effect size and which notably improves on the small number of existing randomised studies and observational data. Such a study has the opportunity to embed a hypothesis-led mechanistic study.</p>

Time points will have an interval tolerance of Â±â€‰1Â week for logistical expedience.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2689_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study scheme diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2689_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

The inclusion of sex as a stratification factor is justified by the potential differences in pathophysiology in the small number of male patients with significant FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Patients will be randomised prior to surgery so they enter the study even if it is not possible to implant the stimulator.

                  <title>Blinding procedures</title>
                  <p id="Par93">Research investigators and participants will be blinded to intervention status (SNM or SHAM). Patients will be informed of the allocation ratio of 1:1 and that blinding prevents them from knowing in which group they are participating (and, therefore, their order of intervention sequence). Patients will be issued with a patient programmer (InterStim iCon Patient Programmer Model 3037) with tamper-proof tape cut so as to obscure the stimulator setting but not obscure the on-off icon (which is in the top left-hand corner of the screen). This enables the patient to switch off the stimulator in an emergency; e.g. unwanted neurological AEs (the only emergency that would require this) and to permit driving (manufacturerâ€™s guidance recommends that the stimulator should be turned off for driving). When the patient has completed their car journey they will simply reactivate the device which will return to the pre-set level (SNM or SHAM). This is a pragmatic consideration that is both necessary to complete the study (recruitment would be impossible if patients could not drive for the whole 32-week crossover period) and part of â€˜real-lifeâ€™. There is published evidence that switching the device off for part of the day (even for long periods) has no effect on efficacy over a chronic stimulation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The settings on the device (to turn stimulation settings up or down) will not be accessible to the participants, having been disabled at the time of programming, in addition to the external buttons being covered with tamper-proof tape. The patient programmer power switch, neurostimulator synchronisation switch and neurostimulator on/off switch will be accessible to the patient.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">The Model 8840 Clinician programmer is able to access log data of stimulation usage so there is potential to check all data on ON-OFF cycling during the study intervention periods if this is required to validate fidelity of the intervention (a bit like used blister-packs to count unused drugs in a drug trial). During the SHAM period the neurostimulator will be active but not be providing stimulation (current set to 0 V). Therefore, analysis of neurostimulator activity in the SNM and SHAM phases should be equivocal in percentage of neurostimulator â€˜useâ€™ and un-blinding one participant would not compromise blinding for the remainder. The digital programming unit (Nâ€™Vision Clinician Programmer Model 8840) will not be supplied to the patient but can be used post hoc to determine if the patient has changed settings or switched stimulation on or off during the study (the programmed settings will also have been recorded on a case report form (CRF) by the unblinded clinical team member). The patient will not be removed from the study if the tamper-proof tape has been broken. This will be recorded for statistical analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par95">A nominated member of the research team or normal care clinician will have access to the programmer at the relevant fixed time points for stimulator adjustment (crossover and 6-week reprogramming). This person who will not be blind to intervention status will not otherwise be involved in the research protocol; e.g. outcomes assessments, collection of CRFs, data management.</p>

                  <p id="Par96">The intervention is chronic low-voltage stimulation of the third sacral root using surgical implantation of a commercially available CE-marked active implantable (class III) medical device (Medtronic InterstimÂ®) used in accord with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Patients meeting the mandated response using the monopolar temporary wire or quadripolar tined lead (lead choice and duration of testing based on local surgical practice) will undergo implantation of the permanent InterStim system under general or local anaesthesia (with sedation) by trained expert colorectal surgeons following the procedural steps developed by Siegel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and now published as full guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] (in brief: fluoroscopic-aided percutaneous insertion of 3889 lead using curved stylet and accepting position only when three out of four electrodes provide low-voltage (&lt;â€‰3Â V) contraction of the anal sphincter and pelvic floor Â±â€‰big toe). The implantable pulse generator (3058; Medtronic) will be placed as pre-marked in the ipsilateral buttock only if electrode responses meet the Siegel criteria.</p>
                  <p id="Par98">The device will be activated as per local policy. This can be in the post-operative period the same day as surgery or after a surgical stabilisation period of up to 2Â weeks (this is routine clinical practice in some centres).</p>
                  <p id="Par99">General programming parameters will accord with a written algorithm based on best clinical practice. Prior to programming, an impedance check will be performed and recorded to ensure integrity of the electrical system. The clinical team will set the electrode configuration to achieve sensory threshold defined as the stimulation amplitude where the patient feels the first sensation of stimulation in the anus or perineum (or vagina) at a 14-Hz frequency, pulse width 210Â Î¼sec (a perception of anal sphincter stimulation is considered by most to be optimal). To determine the amplitude necessary to elicit an anal sensation, the amplitude will be increased by 0.1Â V from zero until the sensory threshold is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The dominant electrode will be defined by initial mono-polar testing of each electrode noting the site of sensation and sensory threshold with each electrode used. The optimal electrode configuration will then be determined based on the programming algorithm. The amplitude required to elicit the sensory threshold with the optimal electrode configuration will be recorded.</p>
                  <p id="Par100">The patient will continue with stimulation at sensory threshold for 5Â min, and the process then repeated to identify the habituated sensory threshold. Sub-sensory chronic stimulation will then be performed at the level of the habituated sensory threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] setting the device at this level. The maximum stimulation setting will be set at the habituated sensory threshold to ensure that an individual patient is unable to increase the amplitude of stimulation to above the sensory threshold and, therefore, determine whether they are receiving active stimulation or not.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">At the 6-week time point after device activation, the patient will be re-assessed by the un-blinded research delegate or clinician. Changes in electrode configuration will be permitted if a patient is having sub-optimal efficacy or significant unwanted effects of stimulation. Any change in electrode configuration or site of sensation will be documented. The habituated sensory threshold will be re-calculated and stimulation thence returned to this level.</p>

However, the device is then returned to 0 V and (device remains on but will provide no stimulation). At the 6-week time point after device implantation, the patient is re-assessed for sub-optimal efficacy (anticipated in the majority if the fundamental hypothesis is correct) by the un-blinded research delegate or clinician. To maintain blinding, an identical procedure is followed as above; i.e. re-evaluation of sensory threshold and electrode configurations but this is followed by returning the stimulator to 0 V.</p>

                  <p id="Par172">Frequency of FI episodes per unit time will be patient-recorded using 4-week paper bowel diaries. While the limitations of this method are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], this remains the â€˜gold standardâ€™ in FI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (we will, however, be recording for 4Â weeks rather than only 2 as in many previous studies). The measure of treatment effect is the average number of FI events per 4-week period for patients undergoing SNM as compared with the average number of events for patients undergoing SHAM simulation. The study is powered to detect a ratio of 0.7. This is not to be confused with the reduction in the actual number of events post intervention for a given patient, where a 50% reduction has frequently been employed, albeit subjectively, to define â€˜successâ€™ for that patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Rather, we use number of events as a quantitative outcome, achieving greater power than a dichotomous outcome of successful/unsuccessful, and we power to detect a 30% reduction, on average, in this outcome on ITT principles.</p>

Whole cortical data will be obtained using standard methods on an Elekta Triux 306 channel system utilising noise cancellation methods to eliminate implant and stimulator artefacts. A beam-former analysis methodology will be employed to evaluate both evoked and induced changes in brain activity associated with SNM and anal stimulation. Brain sources will be constructed using individual co-registered T1-weighted MRI brain volumes. The outcome of this process will be a measure of the changes in brain oscillatory power and/or frequency changes computed from brain structures where maximum changes associated with anal stimulation are observed.

                <sec id="Sec55">
                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par188">The sample size is based on the primary outcome; i.e. faecal incontinence episodes per unit time as recorded using the 4-week bowel diary at the end of each 16-week crossover phase.</p>
                  <p id="Par189">We assume that when the device is inactive, the average number of events in 4Â weeks for a typical participant is 28. The number of events per month for that individual will have an over-dispersed Poisson distribution, with 95% range 7 to 112. But individuals will also vary, so the average number of events in a month could vary from 14 in an individual at one extreme to 56 in an individual at the other. This means that the correlation between log(number of events) for the same individual in two different months will be 0.2, and the standard deviation of log(number of events) for each month will be 0.775 (this is consistent with results from two previous NIHR trials in similar populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and with our clinical experience). Thus, to detect a 30% reduction in FI event rate with 90% power at the 5% significance level with a crossover design requires 80 participants. Allowing for 10% loss to follow-up a total of 90 participants will be randomised. This sample size would also achieve more than 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in FI event rate using the data from the first period of the crossover alone. This sample is also sufficient to detect changes in mechanistic outcomes (90% power) based on pilot data; i.e. using a one-sample test comparing logarithm of anal electrical sensitivity post-SNM, the proposed mechanistic sample size <italic>n</italic>Â =â€‰25 will be sufficient to detect a 30% reduction in sensory threshold with 95% power at the 5% significance level, assuming the standard deviation of the change in log-sensitivity is 0.47 (consistent with a coefficient of variation of 0.5 for sensitivity, as observed in pilot data, and a correlation of 0.5 between pre- and post-SNM assessments). The anocortical studies are mainly exploratory and sample size will be based on success of recruitment. It is, however, envisaged that approximately 15 patients will complete all three visits for MRI/MEG. Previous MEG studies have drawn important conclusions with sample sizes of this order.</p>

                    <p id="Par191">The analysis of the primary outcome will compare SHAM and active therapy in both arms of the crossover trial, at T12â€“T16 and T28â€“32, using mixed Poisson regression analysis to adjust for a fixed effect of period and a random effect of individual. To allow observed numbers of events before and after activation in the same individual to have an over-dispersed Poisson distribution we will also include a random effect of time within individual. We will analyse all non-missing data, adjusting for the stratification variables (random effect of centre and fixed effect of sex). This approach is unbiased if missingness is related to observed outcome data or stratification factors from the same participant (a â€˜missing at randomâ€™ assumption): further sensitivity analyses will explore this assumption if needed.</p>
                    <p id="Par192">Secondary outcomes will be analysed in the same way â€“ using Poisson regression for outcomes that are counts, and linear regression for other quantitative outcomes.</p>

Group analysis of this data will allow determination of cortical reorganisational changes associated with chronic SNM. This will be achieved by the spatial normalisation of individual MRI volumes into a grid based on the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) standard template. Statistical analysis will employ a non-parametric cluster-based permutation test<sup>57</sup>. Firstly, an uncorrected dependent-samples <italic>t</italic> test will be performed on pre- and post-stimulus brain activity across the entire brain volume.

                  <p id="Par223">The study poses no major risk to participants above the standard risk of SNM therapy. SNM is an established therapy whose main attraction is non-invasiveness and safety compared to other surgical procedures. The short period (3Â months) without active therapy imposed by the crossover design is not deemed â€˜harmfulâ€™ for a chronic and stable condition by the time that surgical intervention is considered. The main procedural risks are unwanted stimulation effects: muscle spasms, vaginal pain, scrotal pain, leg pain and paraesthesia (common to some degree but manageable usually by reprogramming), infection (cited at 2%) and leading to device erosion or removal. Other listed AEs (based on FDA: PMA P080025) include: unwanted changes in bladder function (urgency, retention); pain at neurostimulator and/or lead site including skin irritation; and allergic or immune system response to the implanted materials that could result in device rejections. Malfunction of the components of the InterStim Therapy System including neurostimulator programming error, lead migration/dislodgement, lead fracture, erosion of the lead into the colon with perforation, neurostimulator battery depletion, extension fracture, neurostimulator migration can also occur.</p>
                  <p id="Par224">Taking the average natural background radiation in the UK to be 2.3Â mSv per annum, then an effective dose of 1.6Â mSv for this study is approximately equal to 8 months of natural background radiation exposure. X-ray examination involves exposure to ionising radiation and carries a risk of induction of excess cancers which may not be expressed for many years after exposure. Using the adult population lifetime risk coefficient of 5% per Sievert gives a lifetime risk of cancer of approximately 1 in 12,500. The Public Health England Radiation Protection Division describes risks of this magnitude as very low.</p>

                  <p id="Par227">For the anorectal tests, the main difference from routine clinical evaluation of anorectal function is the addition of prolonged high-resolution anorectal manometry. This test is not performed routinely and has a longer duration than standard studies (about 110Â min); the patient must attend twice. These tests are non-invasive and only confer mild discomfort due to insertion of anal catheter. No ionising radiation is employed by any tests.</p>

                <title>Double-blind efficacy study</title>
                <p id="Par230">A double-blind, randomised crossover design is appropriate to experimentally assess clinical effect size and to study mechanism. The crossover will compare sub-sensory chronic sacral-root stimulation against SHAM stimulation with the well acknowledged advantage of statistical efficiency. It is, however, also acknowledged that such a study <italic>must</italic> improve on the previous four attempts at crossover studies to provide useful efficacy data. The proposed design will address the main criticisms of previous studies:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par231">Adequate intervention periods to adequately assess response. We will have two 16-week periods (SNM and SHAM) in comparison with previous studies (maximum 1Â month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>])</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par232">Adequate washout period and reduced risk of carryover effects. While the duration of carry over effects of SNM is unknown, the current study design allows for almost 3Â monthsâ€™ washout before outcomes are assessed, compared to a maximum in previous studies of 1Â week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Clinical experience suggests that this duration is adequate but we will, nevertheless, continuously monitor the kinetics of therapy and washout throughout the study using the newly developed e-recording tools</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par233">Adequate statistical power, we propose a completed crossover of 80 patients compared to previous maximum of 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par234">Reduced selection bias. Although the crossover design does not permit full adherence to an ITT principle; i.e. from start of trial therapy with test stimulation, we will randomise all newly implanted patients rather than patients who have already been selected on the basis of successful chronic therapy. Selected patients will thus be naÃ¯ve to chronic stimulation and <italic>all</italic> consenting implanted patients will be randomised</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par235">Reduced attrition bias. We will continue assessments on all participants provided that the patient has not withdrawn consent. Patients who become unblinded to intervention would not, however, contribute data to analysis</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par236">Improved patient blinding. We will use the experience gained from the Durham-based NIHR RfPB TiLTS-CC study to maintain blinding</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par237">Improved assessment methods (e.g. diaries are collected for a longer period. As well as a paper diary an electronic simple touch-screen device will also be trialled)</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par238">We do, however, accept that the choice of design has some limitations:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par239">Although it is acknowledged that a small proportion of patients prefer supra-sensory stimulation (about 10% in our clinical practice), especially in the short term, for double-blinding it is clearly necessary to mandate sub-sensory stimulation and we acknowledge that this is in effect an experimental variant of the therapy used in â€˜real lifeâ€™. We will, however, comply with routine clinical practice by having a reprogramming session at 6Â weeks in each arm regardless of intervention status; i.e. in the SHAM arm this will be a â€˜pseudo-reprogrammingâ€™ event. For the FI indication, a recent randomised observer-blinded comparison showed no difference in effects of supra- and sub-sensory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] building on a small study that showed that therapeutic response threshold was significantly lower than sensitivity threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, we acknowledge that some differences in physiological results have been recorded for sub- and supra-sensory stimulation in the patients with slow-transit constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and this is acknowledged in the study title</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par240">We acknowledge that it is difficult (and labour intensive) to blind patients to SNM in crossover designs, particularly for patients who receive the intervention first and then have it switched to OFF. This proved a problem in a recent study of irritable bowel syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] in which 75% patients correctly identified that the stimulator was ON or OFF across all crossover phases. This noted, previous crossover studies of FI (accepting limitations in published documentation) have successfully blinded participants. This remains a risk for any placebo-controlled intervention where the number needed to treat is relatively small; i.e. the majority of patients can identify their stimulation status by the effect it has on their symptoms. This noted, the effect size of SNM vs. SHAM remains uncertain (a reason for performing the study)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par241">The study does not address the long-term clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of SNM</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Cohort follow-up study</title>
                <p id="Par242">The primary study (double-blind crossover) will provide a robust estimate of experimental efficacy. The cohort of thus recruited patients, however, also provide an opportunity to study the outcome at a later time point with patient-decisive stimulation (sub- or supra-sensory) as would be normal for routine clinical practice. On this basis, patients will be followed up for a further 6Â months to a total, therefore, of just over 1 year post implant (2â€‰Ã—â€‰16â€‰+â€‰26â€‰=â€‰58) and outcomes recorded between 54 and 58Â weeks (Â±â€‰1Â week). Such data will provide the first estimate of the outcome of optimised (internationally standardised) lead placement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] in adults with FI and also do so with the scientific rigor mandated by a prospective randomised study managed by a CTU (even if the intervention by this stage is â€˜open labelâ€™). It is acknowledged that patients will only have actually had 36Â weeks of stimulation (continuous or discontinuous depending on crossover sequence). However, published data indicate that outcomes at 6Â months are almost identical to those at later time-points (accepting data censorship in some cohort studies).</p>
