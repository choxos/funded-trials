                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Novel therapies such as small protein molecule inhibitors and immunotherapies are tested in early phase trials before moving to later phase trials and ultimately standard practice. A key aim of these clinical trials is to define a toxicity profile, however, the emphasis is often on safety with measurements of organ toxicity. Other subjective side effects can be under-reported because they are not measured formally within the trial protocols. The concern from clinical practice is that cognitive toxicity is poorly studied and may be under-reported in this context. This could lead to toxicity profiles of new treatments not being fully described and patients with unmet need in terms of acknowledgement and support of symptoms. This protocol outlines a framework of an exploratory study with feasibility aspects to investigate the impact and experience of cognitive changes for patients on phase I trials.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a mixed-methods study, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. The sample is 30 patients with advanced cancer who are participating in phase I trials of novel therapies in the early clinical trials unit of a specialist cancer centre. A test battery of validated cognitive assessments will be taken alongside patient reported outcome measures at three time points from baseline, day eight and day 28 post start of treatment. At day 28, a semi-structured interview will be conducted and the narrative thematically analysed. Results will be integrated to offer a comprehensive description of cognitive function in this patient group.</p>

The study has the potential to highlight previously unreported side effects and more importantly unmet need in terms of care for patients who are participating in the trials.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In cancer drug development advances in the understanding of genetics and the biochemical pathways involved in cancer have helped researchers to rationally design ‘molecularly targeted drugs’. These novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies are first tested clinically in patients within phase I trials in cancer centres. Due to the experimental nature of phase I trials and the fact that little is known about the toxicities, patients need to have exhausted all standard treatment options to participate. To contextualise, these patients will generally have advanced cancer and pretreated disease. It is a heterogeneous patient population in terms of tumour types. However, what the patients do have in common is a shared experience of the continuous cycle of treatment and disease progression to the point where there is no further treatment available. Patients on phase I trials often have significant tumour burden with metastatic disease and a life limiting prognosis. These patients remain motivated to participate in phase I trials of experimental therapies and despite having advanced progressive disease the criteria for participating in phase I means the patients do have to have a certain level of fitness to meet eligibility requirements of specific protocols.</p>
              <p>At this stage of drug development, the main aims are to find the optimal dose, investigate the pharmacology and to define the toxicity profiles.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> When considering toxicity profiles of these potential new treatments the emphasis is on safety and this is reflected in many of the standard assessments in the protocols such as cardiology monitoring, renal and liver function tests.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Clinicians and nurses involved in the conduct of phase I trials do perform medical history taking and nursing assessments to gain a full perspective of other side effects reported but they are interpreted and recorded in a subjective manner usually using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) which is a National Institute of Health-National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Programme initiative. It is a multidimensional tool designed specifically for use in clinical trials. The tool enables the clinician to categorise symptoms that are graded 0–5, translating respectively to none, mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening and death. The use of the CTCAE is commonplace in all phase I trials.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>This exploratory study investigates the impact of targeted therapies within the context of an experimental trial on the cognitive function of patients with advanced cancer. It is suspected that some of the targeted therapies tested within phase I trials may have a negative impact on the patient’s cognitive function. Evidence from clinical practice suggests that patients are experiencing symptoms relating to cognitive function, however this does not seem to translate to reports of cognitive toxicity within clinical trial data. As cognitive function is not formally assessed the extent, nature or domain of cognitive impairment (CI) is not well described. There is also suggestion in literature that the difficulty in ascertaining the relationship between CI and targeted therapies may be due to the under-reporting of cognitive symptoms in clinical trials.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>Impairment of cognitive function in the field of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy has been investigated and it is known that such a symptom impairs quality of life.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, if cognitive function was investigated and described in the context of patients on phase I trials, it could provide a basis of knowledge on which to develop interventions and coping strategies with the aim of preventing or ameliorating the effects of this possible decline in cognitive function.</p>
                <p>Cognitive function is described as the internal processes involved in making sense of the world and the capacity to make decisions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Such processes include attention, perception, learning, memory, language, problem solving, reasoning and thinking.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These functions are defined in terms of domains that can broadly be divided into sensory and motor skills, memory, attention and concentration, executive function (which includes reasoning and problem solving) and language and verbal skills.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While the domains overlap in terms of function each can be assessed using validated cognitive assessment tools. Impaired cognitive function in patients with cancer can present as loss of memory, difficulty with word finding, loss of concentration and difficulty in task switching.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Even though cognitive function is not assessed as part of the phase I trials, anecdotal reports from some patients suggest that they experience some deterioration while on the trial, which is often temporal to dosing of drug.</p>
                <p>For patients this has implications in that they may have a symptom they feel unable to discuss. This in turn can mean that they do not receive any help or support regarding the problem which can be isolating and frightening for the patient.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Not having the symptom acknowledged or having no information to warn about the possibility of it happening has been reported as being distressing and difficult for patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref></p>
                <p>Implications on a broader scale will mean that better defined toxicity profiles will improve understanding of consequences of treatments. This will assist in developing interventions that help patients make informed choices about having certain treatments and be better equipped to cope with the consequences of them. This may be as simple as recognition of the potential problem with information and preparation for the patient or the implementation of strategies to help with symptoms such as compensatory memory techniques, rehabilitation and relaxation.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref></p>
                <p>In terms of relevance the numbers of patients initially receiving such treatments in phase I trials may be relatively small, usually tens to hundreds. Nevertheless, for these patients with a limited prognosis issues regarding side effects are important. Once a drug has gone through the phases of testing and is licensed for practice the numbers of patients receiving these treatments could then become thousands.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The number of patients with cancer participating in clinical trials is increasing.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, it is important to find out accurately what is happening to patients on clinical trials so they can be supported with the management of side effects such as diminished cognitive function. In order to begin to address this and improve the care and understanding of patients on phase I trials this proposed study will be the first exploration using formal assessment of cognitive function in this context.</p>

              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Evidence gap</title>
                <p>Early work in chemotherapy related CI highlighted a disparity in trial designs and some limitations in research in this field, such as the use of cross-sectional trial design offering no baseline from which to measure change. Lack of consistency in the type of cognitive assessment methods used in the trials also lead to broad differences in reporting of the prevalence of CI. This led to a team of expert cognitive researchers founding a multidisciplinary group known as the International Cancer and Cognition Task Force (ICCTF). The ICCTF was founded in 2004 and one of the aims was to produce guidelines to harmonise study design. The recommendations were to include pretreatment assessment, longitudinal follow-up, the use of a control group and a core set of cognitive assessment tests when investigating cognitive function in patients with cancer.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> All recommendations will be adopted for this protocol except the use of a control group. It would be difficult to match a control for this patient group as the main reason that patients do not enter a phase I trial is due to a deterioration in clinical condition. Therefore, patients in a comparable situation would likely be receiving palliative care only and it may not be appropriate to ask them to participate as a control.</p>
                <p>The subsequent studies that followed these guidelines continued to show associations between systemic chemotherapy treatment and CI as well as discovering that patients with cancer often have a degree of CI at baseline when compared with matched healthy controls.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> The studies also describe the manifestation of CI as a decline in concentration, memory, verbal fluency and executive functioning, which includes higher order cognitive abilities of planning and abstract thinking. Due to the longitudinal design some have been able to demonstrate compelling evidence of dose dependent relationships between treatment and severity of diminished cognitive function.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–25</xref></p>
                <p>Some of the studies also highlighted the value of collecting the patient’s own perception of cognitive function as they showed that this can vary from the validated cognitive assessment measures,.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> What is not addressed in many of these studies is the meaning to the patient in terms of how it may affect their lives. Just a small number of qualitative studies have been conducted exploring the impact of cognitive function on the quality of life of patients. They show that there is a negative effect on work, being unable to return to previous occupations and detrimental effects on emotional, social and psychological aspects of daily life.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
                <p>A scoping literature review was conducted with the aim of understanding the status of assessment and reports of cognitive function within phase I trials. The scoping review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist as a framework.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Papers were included if they reported cognitive symptoms or symptoms categorised as cognitive within the toxicity reports of the trial. The purpose of this was to identify any issues relating to cognitive function, including how it was assessed and reported. Also included were any studies investigating cognitive function in a phase I population. Other observational studies that explored symptom presentation and reporting in phase I trials were included. The purpose of this was to understand any factors that are specific to this patient population and context that may influence identification of cognitive symptoms. Excluded were studies that did not include cognitive issues in the reports. Studies of patients with central nervous system tumours and paediatric patients were excluded as due to the nature of the disease and treatment there are cognitive issues specific to each of these patient’s groups. Search limits included papers in English and dates of publication 2010–2021.</p>
                <p>Just one study in the review specifically investigated cognitive function in a population of phase I patients. The aim was to identify the relationship between cognitive function and intact decisional capacity in relation to informed consent. The cross-sectional design assessed the cognitive function of patients at baseline prior to starting the trial so there was no longitudinal assessment or feasibility assessment throughout the course of the clinical trial. The sample was representative of a phase I population, outcome measures were valid, and associations of confounding variable were adjusted for in the analyses. The research team found that a proportion of patients had CI at baseline and those with worse cognitive function were less likely to understand and remember some of the key principles of the trial. The study was limited due to the cross-sectional design and the researchers do propose that further longitudinal work assessing cognitive function in patients on phase I trials would be of value.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
                <p>Evidence of cognitive toxicity reports in the phase I trials was limited. A small number did report cognitive toxicity. The symptoms were not well characterised and sometimes aggregated or reported as a cognitive category rather than the symptom, making it difficult to understand exactly what the adverse events were.</p>
                <p>A phase 1 trial investigating safety and efficacy of BLU-285, a highly selective targeting inhibitor of mutant KIT and PDGFR in a population of 116 patients with Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumour reported CI as a toxicity. The symptoms are aggregated in the report as cognitive effects. The paper reports that 46% (n=115) have all grade cognitive effects and group together memory impairment, confusional state, cognitive disorder and encephalopathy within this category.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This perhaps represents a lack of clarity in working definitions of CIs.</p>
                <p>Other reports of cognitive toxicity within phase I include a combination study investigating the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor inhibitor and Pi3K inhibitor, for patients did not include cognitive assessments but did include specific mental health diagnostic tools in the trial design. Despite the lack of cognitive assessments 10% (n=30) of patients on the trial reported cognitive disturbance. This is another example of the symptom being reported as a category rather than the actual symptom, hence the presentation of the cognitive disturbance is impossible to elucidate. This vague description leads to a poor understanding of the symptom which is attributed as a severe side effect of treatments. Indeed the cognitive disturbance was graded severe enough to be classified as a dose limiting toxicity. A dose limiting toxicity is a drug related adverse event predefined in the protocol and is significant as it may prevent further dose escalation. This means that the recommended doses could be affected.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
                <p>Despite not including any cognitive assessments within the trial protocol, a phase I trial of a Pi3K and mTor inhibitor in combination also reported ‘cognitive disorders’ in some patients on the trial this is further categorised as memory loss, confusional state, attention deficit and agitation. Causality was attributed to the investigational medicinal product.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Because no formal cognitive assessments were incorporated into the study design, the severity and duration of this is unclear.</p>
                <p>None of the papers filtered in the review used formal cognitive assessments within the trial protocol, so the review confirms that there are no formal or consistent cognitive assessments as part of current standard practice within early clinical trials.</p>
                <p>More recently studies are emerging that look at patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in phase I trials, in particular the PROMs version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) which is a multidimensional PROMs specifically designed by the NCI to capture symptomatic adverse events in clinical trials.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> While its use is commonplace in phase 2 and 3 trials it’s used less in early phase trials where definition of toxicity is a key endpoint.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> One study recruited 265 patients on phase I trials and administered the PROMs at three time points. In the case of cognitive events there are two items on the scale of memory impairment and impaired concentration. The study team describe a difference between PROMs and clinician reports as 25.9% of patient reports of memory as compared with 0.5% of clinicians and in the case of impaired concentration 0.7%–28.1%, respectively. A similar study using the MD Anderson symptom inventory which is also a patient reported questionnaire focusing on 13 core common cancer symptoms.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It has one item relating to cognitive function labelled as ‘difficulty remembering’. This study showed that up to 41% of patients identified as having difficulty remembering.</p>
                <p>The number of experiences of CI in the PROMs studies are incongruous with the many papers filtered in this review where there are simply no or very limited reports of CI. This highlights potential unmet need in this patient group.</p>
                <p>In summary, there is a lack of evidence to show the effects on cognitive function for patients on phase I clinical trials. This has a twofold consequence. First, that the side effects of the drugs may not be well characterised and only become apparent in latter stages of drug development or even when a drug becomes standard practice. Second patients who are participating in phase I trials may have unmet need in terms of identification and support of symptoms of CI. This research protocol outlines an exploratory framework for a study using mixed methods to both identify the existence of cognitive decline in these patients but also describe the impact this has on their everyday lives.</p>

The study has an added feasibility aspect to gain an understanding of how acceptable and appropriate nurse led cognitive assessments are in this patient group bearing in mind the existing potential burden of the phase I trial assessments. The overarching research question for the study is:</p>
                <p>‘What is the impact of the targeted therapies given within the context of a phase I trial on the cognitive function of patients with advanced cancer?’</p>

The patients will be recruited from the clinical trials unit within a specialist cancer hospital, where they attend on a weekly basis. The patient group is heterogeneous in terms of tumour type, age and gender. However, the similarities within the sample population will be the stage of disease, the types of previous treatment and context. Although a convenience sample will be used there will be some stratification in terms of gender. Due to sample size any stratification of other possible confounding factors such as age, educational status will not be possible. Age and educational status (as a key component of cognitive reserve) have been shown to have an influence of altered cognitive function. The sample split between male and female will aim to be equal, as it is known that there are cognitive differences relating to gender.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> As this is an exploratory study with feasibility aspects, the sample size will be 30 patients.</p>

The interview will be digitally audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The purpose of the interview is to drill down into issues identified by the quantitative assessments, but also to further elicit information regarding possible impact on the patient’s life. The interviews are semistructured but can be flexible so that they can be guided by any issues highlighted by the quantitative data collection.

The participant will be told that they can have a break or stop the interview at any time. Interviewing patients on potentially sensitive issues can lead to an emotional response, either cathartic or distressing.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> At the end of the interview there will be two questions regarding the experience of the cognitive assessments, this will provide information regarding the tolerability of performing such structured assessments in this patient group.</p>

To answer the first research question and provide a description of the function of the three cognitive domains from baseline across the time points. The following analysis plan will be conducted:</p>
                  <p>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) A and B will be converted to age adjusted T scores using the professional manuals.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–42</xref> The Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) will be converted to Z scores.</p>

The proportions of patients showing CI as described here will be reported as percentages.

                  <p>To describe the change over time and comparison of means an analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated measures test will be conducted. While caution should be taken to interpret these results due to sample size the ANOVA may help to explore possible trends in cognitive function and provide effect sizes for the changes in the dependant variables (cognitive scores). The results from the ANOVA analyses will also be used to answer research question 3, more detail will be given about the independent variables to be included in the model.</p>
