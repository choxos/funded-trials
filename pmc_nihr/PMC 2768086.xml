                  <p>First BEAT evaluated the safety of bevacizumab with first-line chemotherapy in 1914 patients. Prospectively collected data from 225 patients who underwent curative-intent surgery were analysed, including an exploratory comparison of resection rate in patients treated with different regimens.

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In First BEAT, 225 out of 1914 patients (11.8%) underwent curative-intent surgery at median 64 days (range 42–100) after the last dose of bevacizumab. R0 resection was achieved in 173 out of 225 patients (76.9%). There were no surgery-related deaths and serious post-operative complications were uncommon, with grade 3/4 bleeding and wound-healing events reported in 0.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Resection rates were highest in patients receiving oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy (<italic>P</italic>=0.002), possibly confounded by patient selection. In NO16966, 44 out of 699 patients treated with bevacizumab (6.3%) and 34 out of 701 patients treated with placebo (4.9%) underwent R0 metastasectomy (<italic>P</italic>=0.24).</p>

                  <p>The rate of serious post-operative complications in First BEAT was comparable to historical controls without bevacizumab.

            <p>The addition of oxaliplatin and irinotecan to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has improved patient survival and the chance of downsizing initially unresectable metastatic disease, to allow curative-intent surgery. Although the optimal management of liver metastases which are resectable at presentation has not been definitively established, the prospective, randomised controlled European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), Belgium/Intergroup trial 40983 of peri-operative 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) <italic>vs</italic> surgery alone demonstrated a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) in the subgroups of eligible and resected patients, although not the intention to treat (ITT) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nordlinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), supporting some role for peri-operative chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the trial did not meet the primary endpoint and neither distinguished between synchronous <italic>vs</italic> metachronous presentations, nor stratified for the length of disease-free interval in the latter group. However, peri-operative chemotherapy is a widely accepted strategy, in particular for synchronous presentations, or metachronous presentations occurring soon after treatment of the primary tumour. An alternative strategy for patients with resectable liver metastases is the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, supported by a recently published combined analysis of the Federation Francophone de Cancerologie Digestive (FFCD) Trial 9002 and the EORTC/National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCICCTG), Canada/Gruppo Italiano di Valutazione Interventi in Oncologia phase-III trials. The analysis included 278 patients and showed a moderate, but non-statistically significant benefit for adjuvant bolus 5-FU plus leucovorin over surgery alone for PFS (27.9 <italic>vs</italic> 18.8 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.76; <italic>P</italic>=0.058) and overall survival (OS) (62.2 <italic>vs</italic> 47.3 months, HR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.95–1.82; <italic>P</italic>=0.095) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitry <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
            <p>A newer treatment paradigm has been proposed for highly selected patients with unresectable liver-only metastases in such patients, primary chemotherapy may allow a proportion, in whom adequate downsizing is achieved, to undergo subsequent resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leichman, 2007</xref>). These patients, by the estimates of some investigators, may comprise up to a quarter of patients presenting with mCRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2004</xref>). In one study, patients who underwent hepatic resection after conversion chemotherapy had a reduced OS compared with those with primary resectable disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>); however, with a median follow up of 48.7 months, 18% remained free of disease, and so are potentially cured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Watkins <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The median OS from mCRC treated with 5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan has reached over 20 months, whether given concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falcone <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) or sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tournigand <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), but despite this, &lt;5% of unresectable patients will live up to 5-years with chemotherapy alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chua and Cunningham, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the reported 5-year survival of the highly selected group of patients with initially unresectable liver-only disease treated with conversion chemotherapy then surgery ranges from 33–50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giacchetti <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2004</xref>). Inevitably, some patients will not benefit from metastasectomy after conversion chemotherapy and identifying these patients is vital for preventing futile surgery.</p>
            <p>Prospective evaluation of conversion chemotherapy for patients with liver-only, primarily unresectable disease has been undertaken in the phase-II setting, with response rates (RR) of 48–71% and R0 resection rate of 26–41% in these selected populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pozzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De La Cámara <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ychou <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), however, high rates of recurrence of up to 73% were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberts <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Giacchetti <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Resection rate has also been prospectively evaluated within phase-II and -III trials in patients with any-site mCRC, with RR of 33–66% and R0 resection rates of up to 15% reported, despite the unselected population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tournigand <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delaunoit <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falcone <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
            <p>The addition of bevacizumab, to first and second line chemotherapy for mCRC has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kabbinavar <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giantonio <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Saltz <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), and statistically significant improvement in OS in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giantonio <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, there are currently no data evaluating the role of bevacizumab added to chemotherapy in the peri-operative setting. We present here our evaluation of this topic in two large prospective trials.</p>
            <sec>
              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>Two large international multicentre studies were included in this analysis. First bevacizumab expanded access trial (BEAT) added bevacizumab to investigator's choice fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of mCRC. This international trial recruited 1965 patients from 41 countries between June 2004 and February 2006. Eligible patients were aged at least 18-years old, had histologically confirmed mCRC, had not received chemotherapy for mCRC previously, were of ECOG performance status 0–1, with adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, without significant proteinuria and were scheduled to receive first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Patients who had undergone major surgery within 28 days, had a serious non-healing wound or ulcer, a bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy or were on therapeutic anticoagulation, had uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant cardiovascular disease were excluded from the study.</p>
              <p>Safety was the primary endpoint of the trial. This included the incidence of all reported adverse or serious adverse events, serious adverse events related to bevacizumab and the targeted adverse events of gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing complications, hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding and thromboembolism. Time to disease progression; defined as the time period from the start of first-line therapy to investigator assessed disease progression, and OS; defined as the time period from the start of first-line therapy to death, were secondary endpoints.</p>
              <p>Data for secondary resections (metastasectomy) were prospectively collected in the overall (ITT) population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, bevacizumab. The safety of bevacizumab in all patients undergoing secondary resection was also prospectively examined.</p>
              <p>The NO16966 study was designed to show non-inferiority of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) to FOLFOX4 after the presentation of the pivotal trial by Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>, showing a survival benefit from adding bevacizumab to first-line combination chemotherapy with irinotecan and bolus 5-FU/leucovorin (IFL) for mCRC, the trial was amended to a two-by-two design to assess the addition of bevacizumab to each combination. Between February 2004 and February 2005, 1401 patients were randomised to the four arms of the trial, which met the primary endpoints of non-inferiority of XELOX to FOLFOX for PFS and superiority of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab to chemotherapy plus placebo for PFS. The ITT population (<italic>n</italic>=1400) was defined as all patients who signed the trial consent form and were randomised. Eligibility criteria for this trial have been published previously.</p>
              <p>Secondary resection rate was not a predefined endpoint of the NO16966 trial and as such, the trial was not powered to detect a difference in patients treated with or without bevacizumab, but these data have been retrospectively collected and analysed for the ITT population. Bevacizumab-related adverse events were prospectively collected in the study, but the rate of peri-operative complications was not.</p>
              <p>For both studies, the protocol was reviewed by an independent review body and all patients were required to give written, informed consent.</p>

                  <p>Resection rates were calculated for the ITT population, for curative-intent surgery (the site of surgery was the only site of disease), R0 resection (complete resection with no residual disease), all hepatic surgery performed, curative-intent hepatic surgery and R0 resection rate.</p>
                  <p>Resection rates were also calculated for the exploratory subgroups of patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens and irinotecan-based regimens. Fisher's exact test was used to compare resection rates. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated for OS in the subgroups of patients undergoing curative-intent hepatic resection, those undergoing R0 hepatic resection and the remainder of the ITT population. In addition, survival curves were generated for the exploratory subgroup of patients with liver-only metastatic disease who underwent R0 resection <italic>vs</italic> those who did not.</p>
                  <p>The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS in those undergoing any surgery, all curative-intent surgery, R0 resections, hepatic metastasectomy, curative-intent hepatic metastasectomy and R0 hepatic metastasectomy compared with those that did not, in the ITT population and the subgroup of patients with liver-only disease.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>First BEAT prospectively collected safety data from patients undergoing surgery and is the largest data set using a targeted agent in this setting. Data from the randomised phase-III NO16966 trial were collected retrospectively, therefore, must be interpreted with more caution.</p>
              <p>First BEAT reported a 6% R0 hepatic resection rate in the unselected population and 12.1%, when selecting patients with liver-only disease. In the NO16966 study, there was no significant difference in R0 resection rate in patients treated with bevacizumab compared with placebo (6.3 <italic>vs</italic> 4.9%, <italic>P</italic>=0.24). A major limitation of the analysis of resection rate in both studies is that resectability was not prospectively defined. It is conceivable that some patients may have had resectable disease from the outset, especially if reviewed by an experienced hepatobiliary surgeon at a tertiary referral centre.</p>
              <p>The optimal regimen for patients with potentially resectable disease is yet to be defined, but a strong correlation between response to chemotherapy and subsequent resection rate has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Folprecht <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). An exploratory subgroup analysis of the First BEAT data demonstrated that a higher proportion of patients treated with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy than bevacizumab plus an irinotecan-based regimen underwent curative-intent surgery (16.1% <italic>vs</italic> 9.7%). However, the resection rate within the oxaliplatin-treated subgroup in First BEAT is substantially higher than seen in N016966, which could suggest that First BEAT investigators chose to use oxaliplatin-based regimens in patients with potentially resectable disease. There are also differences in the baseline characteristics of the patient populations of each study, which may have contributed to the difference in resection rates. For example, more patients in First BEAT had a single site of metastatic disease (61% compared with 41 and 42% in the bevacizumab and placebo arms, respectively).</p>
              <p>In First BEAT, overall survival was longer in patients who underwent hepatic metastasectomy compared with those who did not. A limitation of this comparison is that at the start of treatment, all patients received chemotherapy, and therefore there were no patients in the surgery group. Hence, the estimates and comparisons are biased, as patients who eventually underwent surgery have an initial guaranteed survival time.</p>
              <p>Although bevacizumab improved the response rate when added to IFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hurwitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), which has since been superseded by the FOLFIRI regimen, it did not improve the response at all when added to XELOX or FOLFOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Saltz <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Thus, although the choice of chemotherapy regimen may be key to maximising resection rate with bevacizumab combinations, the choice to be made is unclear. A superior response rate has been reported with the FOLFOXIRI regimen (66% <italic>vs</italic> 41% with FOLFIRI) in the first-line setting, with a corresponding increase in R0 resection rate, reported as 36% in a subgroup of patients with liver-only metastatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falcone <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, a second phase-III trial of the regimen reported a more modest response rate of 43% from the combination (33.6% with FOLFIRI), possibly due to the lower doses of all three agents used.</p>
              <p>An apparent increase in steatohepatitis and a subsequently increased 90-day mortality after liver resection has been reported with irinotecan given before liver surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vauthey <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Oxaliplatin is also known to affect the liver, causing sinusoidal dilatation in 19% of cases in the same series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vauthey <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). It is interesting to note that in a retrospective series of 105 patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, the investigators reported a lower incidence and severity of sinusoidal dilatation in patients receiving bevacizumab (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ribero <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The authors suggested that this may be because of VEGF blockade-mediated down-regulation of matrix-metalloproteinase-9, which is known to be involved in sinusoidal dilatation. A recently published non-randomised phase-II study of bevacizumab with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in 56 patients with potentially resectable liver metastases reported one case of abnormal liver function/regeneration due to steatohepatitis, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gruenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) which is consistent with the observation that major perturbations in liver function or liver regeneration with chemotherapy of moderate duration are rare.</p>
              <p>The optimal timing of surgery after chemotherapy alone is again unresolved. In the EORTC Intergroup Trial 40983, surgery was planned for 2–5 weeks after the last administration of chemotherapy and took place a median of 4.1 weeks after chemotherapy (range 2–16.4 weeks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nordlinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Reversible peri-operative complications were more frequent in the chemotherapy arm (25% <italic>vs</italic> 16%, <italic>P</italic>=0.04) with notable increases in biliary fistulae, hepatic failure and intra-abdominal infections, but no difference in bleeding, venous thromboembolism or post-operative death rates. Whether the increase in complications related to the timing of surgery relative to chemotherapy, or simply the exposure to chemotherapy itself, cannot be determined from these data, although data from a retrospective series of 750 patients undergoing hepatic resection, suggest that the rate of complications is highest in patients undergoing surgery within 4 weeks of chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Welsh <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
              <p>More caution is generally applied when bevacizumab is used before or after surgery because of potential effects on bleeding, wound-healing and liver regeneration. In an analysis of pooled data from two randomised studies, the reported wound-healing complication rate after an unplanned major surgery during treatment was 13% for patients treated with 5-FU and bevacizumab compared with 3.4% in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Scappaticci <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, in patients that had undergone major surgery 28–60 days before commencing bevacizumab, a significant difference in wound-healing complications was not observed in the bevacizumab and control arms (1.3% <italic>vs</italic> 0.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Scappaticci <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), suggesting that the risk of this complication can be reduced by careful management of the timing of surgery in relation to bevacizumab. In First BEAT, surgery took place at a median of 64 days after the last dose of bevacizumab, which could be considered as a conservative approach, but was associated with a relatively low rate of serious complications. Results from a small, non-randomised study suggests that a shorter time period between bevacizumab and surgery may be reasonable; this phase-II trial using a 5-week delay reported a 21% total complications rate after liver surgery (less than reported in the EORTC 40983 trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nordlinger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>)), with blood transfusions required in 6% of the patients and no peri-operative mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gruenberger <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
              <p>There are fewer safety concerns with the addition of the EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Data from a pre-planned analysis in the phase-III CRYSTAL trial demonstrated potential efficacy of adding cetuximab to downsize initially unresectable disease, with R0 resections achieved in 4.3% of patients treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, compared with 1.5% in those treated with FOLFIRI alone (<italic>P</italic>=0.0034) and 9.8% <italic>vs</italic> 4.5% R0 resections respectively, in an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with liver-only disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Van Cutsem <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). These resection rates are lower, although comparable, to those reported here, however, the resection rates in the chemotherapy arm alone are notably lower than in the placebo arm of NO16966 (4.9% of the ITT population, 11.6% of patients with liver-only disease), possibly due to the different cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. It should be noted that cetuximab has recently been recommended by the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in patients with K-ras wild-type and unresectable, liver-only mCRC.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The rate of serious post-operative complications in First BEAT was acceptable, with resection rates consistent with those reported in the recent literature. The contribution of bevacizumab is difficult to evaluate outside a randomised controlled trial. In NO16966, there was no statistically significant difference in resection rate or the OS in patients treated with bevacizumab <italic>vs</italic> placebo, however, the numbers of patients undergoing resection in this trial was small; thus the ability of this trial to detect a difference in resection rates would be quite limited.</p>
