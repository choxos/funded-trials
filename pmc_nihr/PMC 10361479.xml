                  <title>Background and objective</title>
                  <p>Point-of-care lateral flow device antigen testing has been used extensively to identify individuals with active SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2 in routine community care.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Adults and children with symptoms consistent with suspected current COVID-19 infection were prospectively recruited from 19 UK general practices and two COVID-19 testing centres between October 2020 and October 2021. Participants were tested by trained healthcare workers using at least one of two index POCTs (Roche-branded SD Biosensor Standard™ Q SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and/or BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2). The reference standard was laboratory triplex reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) using a combined nasal/oropharyngeal swab. Diagnostic accuracy parameters were estimated, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), overall, in relation to RT-PCR cycle threshold and in pre-specified subgroups.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 663 participants included in the primary analysis, 39.2% (260/663, 95% CI 35.5% to 43.0%) had a positive RT-PCR result. The SD Biosensor POCT had sensitivity 84.0% (178/212, 78.3% to 88.6%) and specificity 98.5% (328/333, 96.5% to 99.5%), and the BD Veritor POCT had sensitivity 76.5% (127/166, 69.3% to 82.7%) and specificity 98.8% (249/252, 96.6% to 99.8%) compared with RT-PCR. Sensitivity of both devices dropped substantially at cycle thresholds ≥30 and in participants more than 7 days after onset of symptoms.</p>

                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Both POCTs assessed exceed the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency target product profile’s minimum acceptable specificity of 95%. Confidence intervals for both tests include the minimum acceptable sensitivity of 80%. In symptomatic patients, negative results on these two POCTs do not preclude the possibility of infection. Tests should not be expected to reliably detect disease more than a week after symptom onset, when viral load may be reduced.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>As point-of-care tests (POCTs), lateral flow device antigen (LFD-Ag) tests provide rapid results that avoid the delays and costs associated with laboratory testing [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and may be used for community testing for SARS-CoV-2. They provide decentralised, near-real-time information to guide individual decisions about self-isolation and treatment, enabling enhanced surveillance of health and social care staff with potential to reduce community transmission through early detection. For use in primary care, the ideal test would be simple to use with minimal training required, give rapid but accurate results, and present a low biosafety risk. As many countries are reducing or withdrawing community testing at dedicated testing centres, testing for SARS-CoV-2 is falling to community-based healthcare workers, such as those working in General Practice, and to patients.</p>
              <p>There are concerns about the diagnostic accuracy of LFD-Ag devices and in particular LFD-Ag test performance when used by front-line community-based healthcare workers in usual care settings. False negatives are more damaging in the community as ambulatory patients can potentially propel community transmission, whilst false positives in otherwise healthy individuals could hamper efforts to maintain employment and education and result in inappropriate management [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Whilst the evidence base for LFD-Ag SARS-CoV-2 testing has steadily increased since early 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], community settings, where most tests take place, are less well studied. Extrapolating results from one clinical setting or population to another risks spectrum bias and is not recommended [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In-context evaluations reflect the dynamics of disease transmission, the capabilities of those performing the test and the circumstances under which they are operating. Community populations have a relatively low prevalence and severity of disease, there is overlap in symptomatic presentation with other common clinical syndromes, and the population includes many elderly and frail patients who may mount weaker immune responses to circulating respiratory virus. Studies of selective patient samples tested within laboratories by highly trained staff, or hospital populations who are likely to be more severely unwell, have differing viral loads, and may undergo invasive procedures to increase yield of respiratory tract sampling. Community staff performing POCTs often have little-or-no laboratory experience and no ready access to technical support. Therefore, data on performance of diagnostics in the community is important to inform clinical decisions in the main area of use for these tests.</p>
              <p>We aimed to conduct a community based prospective diagnostic accuracy study of POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients performed by front-line healthcare workers.</p>

                <p>RAPTOR-C19 (RApid community Point-of-care Testing fOR COVID-19) is the community testbed for diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 within the UK’s COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR) [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was designed as a prospective platform diagnostic accuracy study, conducted in the community, for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care tests (POCTs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RAPTOR-C19 allows for POCTs that test for either active or past infection; the present paper relates to the first two POCTs assessed via this study, both of which test for active infection. Further diagnostic tests are undergoing assessment within the platform. The published protocol gives full details of the study design [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and a summary is provided here.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and participant eligibility</title>
                <p>The main setting for this study was UK primary care. Nineteen general practices were recruited after email invitation for expressions of interest, following the sharing of Research Information Sheets for GP surgeries to practices identified through the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN). To increase recruitment, two COVID-19 community testing centres for symptomatic individuals were added as additional recruitment sites in the spring of 2021. Participants were adults and children presenting with symptoms of active infection consistent with suspected current COVID-19 (see [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for a list of specific symptoms). Within these criteria, practices may have differed in their approaches to recruitment (for example, some may not have had capacity to recruit participants on certain days of the week), and so included participants can not necessarily be considered as a consecutive series among those eligible and willing to participate.</p>

                <title>Baseline and follow-up assessments</title>
                <p>In addition to undergoing testing for the index test(s) and reference standard described below, further participant information was collected at the time of recruitment using an electronic case report form (eCRF). Variables included age, sex, ethnicity, presence and duration of specified symptoms within the preceding 14 days, vaccine status, household contacts diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, and the timing and results of previous tests for SARS-CoV-2. Adult participants (age ≥ 16 years) recruited from general practices were asked to provide a venous blood sample for antibody testing, collected by appropriately trained staff. These participants were also invited to attend a second visit, or be visited at home by a research nurse, after 28 days to provide a second sample for repeat antibody testing. Adult participants were asked to complete an online daily symptom diary for 28 days after recruitment, but as completion rates were low, no diary data are reported here. Linked electronic health records provided collateral information about subsequent hospitalisation, SARS-CoV-2 test results (in addition to those performed for this study) and mortality within 28 days. Serious adverse events related to test usage were reported by study sites to the RAPTOR-C19 coordination centre via adverse events reporting forms, which were evaluated by clinical staff.</p>

                <title>Index tests</title>
                <p>This paper presents results from two POCTs. The SD Biosensor Standard™ Q SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (REF 9901-NCOV-01G, branded and distributed by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used from the start of the study. This test incorporates an internal quality control and is read and interpreted manually by the user following the prescribed assay incubation period [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].The BD Veritor™ System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with the BD Veritor™ Plus Analyzer (REF 256089, Becton Dickinson and Company, Maryland, USA) was used from January 2021 onwards. This assay also incorporates an internal quality control but differs from the SD Biosensor test, as results are read by the associated analyser following either a manually timed incubation process (Analyze Now mode) or in an automated manner (Walk Away mode) which times incubation and reads automatically [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both assays consist of individually packaged LFD cassettes with associated swabbing and sample extraction materials. The RAPTOR-C19 and CONDOR teams deemed both tests could feasibly be used by community healthcare workers, including those without clinical qualifications, with minimal training. Both tests had a buffer with SARS-CoV-2 inactivation capacity and a process with no associated aerosol generating procedure for use away from the laboratory. Recruitment sites used either one or both POCTs, depending on availability. Some participants were tested using both POCTs, and as each candidate POCT used a different sampling site (nasopharyngeal for SD Biosensor, nasal for BD Veritor), order of sampling was judged unlikely to disadvantage either POCT. Index test results were neither shared with the patient nor used as a basis for clinical decision-making. Clinical site staff, including general practitioners, nurses and healthcare assistants, took the samples. They received training via a webinar before recruiting to the study, and were asked to adhere to the manufacturers’ instructions for use. Only manufacturer-issued swabs and materials were used to collect and process samples. Index test results were recorded in the eCRF by site staff as ‘Positive’, ‘Negative’, or ‘Unknown/No result’. Further details of testing procedures are provided as Supplemental Material.</p>

                <title>Reference standard</title>
                <p>The reference test for active infection was an in-house validated reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of ORF1ab and E gene regions of SARS-CoV-2. The assay incorporated ORF1ab primers and probes as published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and E gene primers and probe published by Corman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288612.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The assay used the ThermoFisher TaqPath 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) carried out on the ABI QuantStudio 7 flex real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Corporation, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States). Testing was performed at the same Public Health England (latterly UK Health Security Agency) laboratory, using a combined nasal/oropharyngeal swab taken during the same visit as when the index test(s) were performed. Results were reported as positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, with RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values provided for each assay target [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The reference test was conducted blind to the results of the index tests. Reference results were not available for at least 24 hours after recruitment. The reference sample was also tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), seasonal coronavirus, and influenza. We linked baseline and POCT data to date-matched reference standard data using a unique patient identifier. During the earlier phase of the study, delivery delays and recording and administrative errors meant that for some participants no reference swab was analysed. For some others the swab used for RT-PCR could not be reliably date-matched with the recruitment date of the participant. These participants were excluded from the primary analysis but included in a sensitivity analysis.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample size was based on a target of 150 reference standard positive individuals, for each index test. If the true sensitivity of an index test were 90% or higher, a similar number of positive samples (144) would yield a standard error of the estimate of the sensitivity of ≤2.5%, and a 95% confidence interval width of ±5%. This would have ≥90% power to detect a difference from a level of 80% sensitivity (the level specified as “desired” by the MHRA Target Product Profile [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), at a 5% significance level. Based on an assumed prevalence of 10%, the original target total sample size was 1500 (see Statistical Analysis Plan in Supplemental Materials and published protocol for full details). In the event, the observed prevalence was higher than expected and the study was terminated when the 150 positive sample target was met. For the SD Biosensor POCT, an interim analysis for futility (i.e. to test if sensitivity and specificity estimates fell below pre-specified thresholds) was performed at the end of July 2021 using data from the first 331 participants recruited. As this did not lead to discontinuation for futility, recruitment continued until the full target sample size was exceeded. Details are available as Supplemental Materials.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>A Statistical Analysis Plan was written before the analysis was performed and is available in Supplemental Material. We calculated the prevalence of positive RT-PCR results, and the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for each index test alongside exact 95% confidence intervals. Index test results were presented graphically in relation to the RT-PCR cycle threshold. Prespecified subgroup analyses split results by participant characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity, spectrum of disease, recruitment method and recruiting practice. We also performed a post-hoc analysis of diagnostic performance against time since symptom onset. We summarised recruitment rates, variation in disease prevalence over time, and baseline characteristics and symptom progression using appropriate summary statistics and graphs, with the number of participants with missing data reported separately.</p>
                <p>We used two methods to allow for imperfect reference standard bias. Firstly, for individuals with discordant results between either index test and the reference standard, we created an enhanced composite reference standard using a combination of antibody testing results, additional RT-PCR test results, and linked hospitalisation and mortality records [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondly, we performed a statistical adjustment to sensitivity and specificity estimates using a Bayesian adjustment approach [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288612.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], assuming Beta prior distributions for the sensitivity (prior mean 97%) and specificity (prior mean 99%) of the reference standard derived from performance characteristics of the RT-PCR test in operation during the study period.</p>
                <p>To allow for discrepancies between recorded recruitment date and recorded swab dates from some participants, two sensitivity analyses were performed: firstly, a stricter scenario excluding all individuals for whom these dates did not match exactly, and secondly, a less strict scenario in which date discrepancies of up to a week were allowed (as discrepancies may have reflected date recording errors).</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis was performed using RStudio 2022.02.3 including the epiR package [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], RStan [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and WinBUGS14.</p>

Disease prevalence in the primary analysis cohort was higher in males (47%, 128/272) than in females (34%, 132/391) and much higher in those who reported at least two key symptoms (59%, 151/257).</p>
                <p>Among sites that recruited at least 10 participants, sensitivity and specificity estimates were largely similar, although the prevalence of disease varied substantially between sites (S1 Fig 1 in <xref rid="pone.0288612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
                <p>There were two main circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 during the study period in the UK, VOC Alpha GRY (B.1.1.7+Q.) then VOC Delta GK (B.1.617.2+AY.) (S1 Fig 2 in <xref rid="pone.0288612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). We tracked the performance of both POCTs over time showing that the diagnostic performance of neither test shifted during the transition from one dominant variant to the other (S1 Figs 3 and 4 in <xref rid="pone.0288612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). <xref rid="pone.0288612.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarises the diagnostic performance in relation to RT-PCR cycle threshold. Both POCTs show a clear reduction in performance with increasing cycle threshold (reflecting reduced viral load). In an exploratory analysis, the sex differences in diagnostic sensitivity remained when broken down by cycle threshold (S1 Table 2 in <xref rid="pone.0288612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). S1 Fig 5 in <xref rid="pone.0288612.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> shows the trend in mean cycle threshold across the duration of the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The results of this prospective diagnostic accuracy evaluation of two POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients in primary care fall within the wide range of previous studies in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288612.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A living systematic review found widely varying estimates of the sensitivity for the BD Veritor system (between 41.2% and 96.2% in different studies), and similarly varying estimates for the SD Biosensor system (between 28.6% and 98.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the primary analysis, we estimate the sensitivities of BD Veritor and SD Biosensor to be 76.5% (95% CI 69.3% to 82.7%) and 84.0% (95% CI 78.3% to 88.6%) respectively. Both devices were found to have specificities close to 99%, which is consistent with most previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>The minimum target for acceptable performance in the target product profile of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95% [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The World Health Organisation target product profile stipulates sensitivity ≥80% and specificity ≥97% [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results indicate that performance is likely to exceed the specificity threshold, but there remains doubt over performance in relation to sensitivity. Allied to high positive predictive values, this suggests that the most appropriate use of these POCTs may be as rule-in tests, while negative test results do not preclude infection.</p>
              <p>Diagnostic performance was strongly associated with RT-PCR cycle threshold. Performance declined at higher cycle thresholds, which are associated with the presence of lower intact sample viral RNA, a proxy for viral load. Test sensitivity declined among individuals whose symptoms began more than one week before recruitment. Correlation has been proposed between higher viral load distributions, LFD positive results and infectiousness of individuals [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but others have suggested that important numbers of infections may be missed by LFDs due to their limited sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Without an agreed reference standard for infectiousness, we were unable to assess the value of these tests for identifying infectious individuals [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>Venekamp et al’s community-based study in the Netherlands of tests including SD Biosensor and BD Veritor recruited until June 2021, before the Delta variant became dominant [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our recruitment continued for one year from October 2020, covering the period of the two dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK circulating during this time (Alpha and Delta). We demonstrated a sustained diagnostic performance for both variants, with sensitivities slightly higher than those reported by Venekamp et al.</p>
              <p>Other studies have shown substantial decreases in test sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals, including those recruited as close contacts of cases [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288612.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288612.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our study demonstrates reduced sensitivity in individuals with fewer core symptoms but does not provide evidence about the performance of the two assays in the asymptomatic population. Based on these findings, patients with a single main symptom (fever, cough or anosmia), could be advised to repeat a negative test if their symptoms persist, or if more symptoms develop.</p>
              <p>This study prospectively recruited a large cohort of symptomatic participants attending primary healthcare and two COVID-19 testing centres, and therefore reflects real-world diagnostic accuracy. Understanding performance in primary healthcare is likely to be increasingly important as we cope with waves of endemic infection, and this is one of the few studies to report performance for any POCT in this setting and to our knowledge the only one based in UK primary care.</p>
              <p>Recruitment met recommended sample sizes. Further, this study benefitted from contemporaneous swabbing for all tests, and blinding of index test results from those who were performing the reference test (and vice versa), as recommended in diagnostic accuracy studies [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A single site performed all reference standard testing to ensure consistency. Our results were adjusted, using two methods, for possible reference standard misclassification and were robust to this adjustment. Paired sampling and use of two index diagnostic tests gave greater scope for direct comparison than previous evaluations.</p>
              <p>This study also has some limitations. Because of low recruitment from some sites, a testing centre was added as a recruitment site and so the population tested overall may be less unwell than those who would contact the GP surgery. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied substantially by practice, suggesting there may have been differences in the way in which practices identified participants for recruitment. However, throughout the study recruited patients were required to be symptomatic and diagnostic performance did not change when restricted to participants recruited via the testing centre. This study does not assess diagnostic performance in asymptomatic patients, in whom viral load may be lower and there may be a consequent effect on diagnostic performance. It assesses performance when testing was carried out by clinical staff, rather than via self-swabbing, and performance might decline if not always done according to manufacturers’ instructions and performed by a trained operator. Consistent with other studies, we have used RT-PCR cycle threshold as a proxy for viral load and did not apply a calibration and conversion to provide absolute estimates. Fully quantitative assays require a calibrated standard curve, which was not incorporated as an element of this study, as the results were intended to be binary in recognition of how diagnostic decisions are made in the real world.</p>
              <p>This study represents 12 months of recruitment, during which time the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 fluctuated, and results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to future variants should they emerge. For example, some studies have suggested that some assays may have impaired detection for Omicron variants [<xref rid="pone.0288612.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>The number of missing test results was higher than anticipated, and RT-PCR results were unobtainable for 40 samples, most of which were from participants who received the SD Biosensor POCT during the early period of recruitment. The effect of this was explored in sensitivity analyses, which did not show substantial changes in the major results. The principal reason for missing RT-PCR data was because of postal delays during the pandemic period in the early set-up of the study. As such we consider these data to be missing completely at random and do not expect this to bias the results.</p>
              <p>In a population with symptoms of COVID-19 presenting to community settings, SD Biosensor and BD Veritor POCTs performed by healthcare professionals are highly specific and so could be used to rule in COVID-19. However the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR test results who received false negative POCT results was 16.0% for SD Biosensor and 23.5% for BD Veritor, which could result in onward transmission and inappropriate management unless population prevalence of disease is very low. Performance was improved in patients with more symptoms and those with low RT-PCR Ct values. Tests should be interpreted with more caution outside of this clinical phenotype. Though this strategy was not tested, it may be sensible to repeat the POCT in 12 or 24 hours in patients with a clinical phenotype for COVID-19 who test negative since viral counts may rise over time. This strategy should be studied since identifying true negatives as well as positives is important as waves of this virus continue.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Nicholson,<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --> <!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->Your manuscript has been reviewed by three experts in the field of POCT use for the detection of SARS CoV-2  and</p>
              <p>two of them suggest that the manuscript should be revised  in order to be acceptable for publication. One of the reviewer is suggesting to reject the manuscript because of poor novelty in a landscape filled with many similar report: I do  not agree with this evaluation, since I believe that the quality of your study is above the level of  many other similar published papers and consequently  I suggest that you undertake a revision procedure  considering the points raised  by the reviewers.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->One of the most relevant issue is the lack of OMICRON related variants among the viruses incleded: if you feel that this step would not be possible please open a wide discussion on that. I also believe that fact that only symptomatic patients have been included should be widely  and deeply discussed.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by May 04 2023 11:59PM.  If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at <email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors analyse the performance of two POCT tests in a clinical setting on symptomatic individuals with high viral load compare to RT-PCR. The study is planned and carried out thoroughly. The study has a high quality compared to the multitude of studies on this topic but is limited by the restricted sample size, the missing viral load calculation, the lack of Omicron VOC samples as well as asymptomatic individuals.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. Figure 1: Is there a cause why only in participants tested with SD Biosensor (including participants testes with both tests), PCR results are missing? Please discuss in the limitations.</p>
              <p>2. The information contained in the figures in the supplement seems much more interesting to the reader compared to the figures in the manuscript (especially figure 2). Consider creating interesting figures from the supplement data and move the figures from the manuscript to the supplement.</p>
              <p>3. Ct value is just a gross measure of viral load. I suggest calculating viral loads from the PCR data as they are comparable to other high quality studies.</p>
              <p>4. The study only includes symptomatic persons. This fact should be strengthened during the whole manuscript.</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>1. Abstract (only in the Submission form): “(260/663, 95% CI 35.5% to43.0%)” – a space is missing</p>
              <p>2. p3, Abstract, Results, why is 95% CI included two times. Consides removing the second or add 95% for all confidence intervals</p>
              <p>3. p9, 168-171: Please describe the reference test more in detail. Was it a commercial assay, different assays, …?</p>
              <p>4. p10, 190: If you do a sample size calculation, please do it exact. 1500 is quite crude. In my calculation using your assumptions I get the result of 1347</p>
              <p>5. p 23, 366-370: The data presented is only performed on symptomatic individuals with high viral loads. Other studies show big differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Consider removing the statements on asymptomatic individuals or discuss them together with relevant literature (e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.12.017" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.12.017</ext-link>

              <p>6. Limitations: A limited sensitivity has been reported for the Omicron variants (e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2022.08.006" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2022.08.006</ext-link>

              <p>Reviewer #2: THE POOR NOVELTY OF THE PAPER SUGGESTS ITS REJECTION</p>
              <p>THERE ARE MANY PAPER ALREADY PUBLISHED ON POCT TESTING FOR COVID-19</p>
              <p>THE STUDY DESIGN IS FINE AND THIS IS A WELL-WRITTEN PAPER BUT, IN MY OPINION, IT DOES NOD ADD VALUABLE INFORMATION TO CURRENT KNOWLEDGE</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: General comments:</p>
              <p>The manuscript thoroughly describes the performance of two different antigen tests (one with visual reading of results and one with machine reading of results) in an outpatient setting. Although the paper could be considered post festum (the current SARS-CoV-2 variants were not present during the testing period), the manuscript highlights, documents and adequately discuss the inferior diagnostic accuracy of antigen testing compared to Gold Standard qPCR testing. The manuscript is well written with huge amounts of clinical data and adequate statistics.</p>
              <p>Specific comments:</p>
              <p>Line 68: I do not think LFD-Ag are commonplace for community testing at the present time?</p>
              <p>Methods: A description of the two assays is warranted – e.g. the difference between manual and machine reading of results.</p>

              <p>05th June 2023</p>
              <p>Dear Professor Sambri,</p>
              <p>We hope that this letter finds you well. We were very grateful to you for your editorial comments and guidance and to the three reviewers for their considered and constructive reviews of our manuscript.</p>
              <p>We are delighted to respond to your comments and those of the reviewers in the following document and through submission of a revised manuscript and associated material. We trust that our revisions will be acceptable to you and the reviewers.</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

              <p>Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of two point-of-care tests for COVID-19 when used in 2 community settings in the UK primary care COVID diagnostic accuracy platform trial (RAPTOR-C19)</p>
              <p>One of the most relevant issue is the lack of OMICRON related variants among the viruses incleded: if you feel that this step would not be possible please open a wide discussion on that. I also believe that fact that only symptomatic patients have been included should be widely and deeply discussed.</p>
              <p>Response: We are grateful to Professor Sambri for these observations and have amended the manuscript title to make clear from the outset that the evaluation focused on symptomatic participants. The symptomatic focus of the study is also referenced in the abstract and discussion. This is further discussed in response to Reviewer #1 point 4 below.</p>
              <p>We have made specific reference to a publication in the Discussion which describes variable detection of Omicron by rapid antigen tests (Osterman A, Badell I, Dächert C, Schneider N, Kaufmann A-Y, Öztan GN, et al. Variable detection of Omicron-BA.1 and -BA.2 by SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests. Medical Microbiology and Immunology. 2023;212(1):13-23. doi: 10.1007/s00430-022-00752-7.), at the point where we describe the possibility that it may not be possible to extrapolate our results to Omicron or future variants of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: The authors analyse the performance of two POCT tests in a clinical setting on symptomatic individuals with high viral load compare to RT-PCR. The study is planned and carried out thoroughly. The study has a high quality compared to the multitude of studies on this topic but is limited by the restricted sample size, the missing viral load calculation, the lack of Omicron VOC samples as well as asymptomatic individuals.</p>
              <p>Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. Figure 1: Is there a cause why only in participants tested with SD Biosensor (including participants testes with both tests), PCR results are missing? Please discuss in the limitations.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this comment. The main reason that more RT-PCR results were missing among participants tested with the SD Biosensor POCT than the BD Veritor POCT was because of postal issues in the delivery of samples for RT-PCR testing during the pandemic period in the early part of recruitment (SD Biosensor was the first POCT to come on board the study). Some samples were inadvertently delivered to the wrong location by the postal service and others were lost in transit. As this is the main reason for this missing data we do not expect this to be related to the RT-PCR result and so would consider these missing results not to bias estimates of diagnostic accuracy. We have explained this in the relevant paragraph in the limitations part of the Discussion.</p>
              <p>2. The information contained in the figures in the supplement seems much more interesting to the reader compared to the figures in the manuscript (especially figure 2). Consider creating interesting figures from the supplement data and move the figures from the manuscript to the supplement.</p>
              <p>Response: We feel it is somewhat subjective as to which figures readers would find more interesting, but we agree that the previous S1 Fig 6 (diagnostic accuracy in relation to time since first reported symptom) would have been better in the main manuscript (now Fig 3).</p>
              <p>3. Ct value is just a gross measure of viral load. I suggest calculating viral loads from the PCR data as they are comparable to other high quality studies.</p>
              <p>Response: We thank the reviewer for making this point. We prefer that our data remain in the format of Ct values, which are the common lexicon for these kinds of studies. Fully quantitative assays require a calibrated standard curve, which was not included in this study, as the results were intended to be binary. The comparator of positive/negative is indicative of how diagnostic decisions are made in the real world, where absolute viral load and even Ct values are not used by clinicians. Our study is consistent with many published reports. Most other studies that have evaluated POCTs in other settings, and/or systematic reviews, report by Ct value and not directly by viral load measures (such as the living systematic review, Brümmer et al., 2021. Accuracy of novel antigen rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: PLoS Med, 18(8), p.e1003735). We have added a note in the limitation paragraph of the Discussion to highlight these points. </p>
              <p>4. The study only includes symptomatic persons. This fact should be strengthened during the whole manuscript.</p>
              <p>Response: Participants with symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 were the target patient group for this study. We had previously noted this in several places of the manuscript (including the Abstract Methods section, final sentence of Introduction, Recruitment and participant eligibility section of Methods, several places in Discussion including a comparison of our results with other studies performed in asymptomatic individuals, and in the limitations paragraph of the Discussion). However, we agree that it is important to emphasise further so have now made this additionally clear in the title of the manuscript, the Conclusions section of the Abstract and the first sentence of the Discussion.</p>
              <p>Minor comments:</p>
              <p>1. Abstract (only in the Submission form): “(260/663, 95% CI 35.5% to43.0%)” – a space is missing</p>
              <p>Response: We have corrected this in the Submission form.</p>
              <p>2. p3, Abstract, Results, why is 95% CI included two times. Consides removing the second or add 95% for all confidence intervals</p>
              <p>Response: We have corrected this.</p>
              <p>3. p9, 168-171: Please describe the reference test more in detail. Was it a commercial assay, different assays, …?</p>
              <p>Response: We have expanded the ‘Reference standard’ sub-section of the ‘Methods’ to provide more detail on the RT-PCR assay used for reference testing in the study.</p>
              <p>4. p10, 190: If you do a sample size calculation, please do it exact. 1500 is quite crude. In my calculation using your assumptions I get the result of 1347</p>
              <p>Response: The primary target sample size was 150 positive cases (in line with the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Target Product Profile) and the 1500 figure was only ever intended as an approximate total target sample size based on an assumed prevalence of 10%. For the reasons outlined, this total in any case needed to be adjusted as a result of the fluctuating and unpredictable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the period of the study. Full details of the sample size calculation are available in the (cited) published protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan that was provided as a supplementary file.</p>
              <p>5. p 23, 366-370: The data presented is only performed on symptomatic individuals with high viral loads. Other studies show big differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Consider removing the statements on asymptomatic individuals or discuss them together with relevant literature (e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.12.017" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.12.017</ext-link>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00991-21" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00991-21</ext-link> ).</p>
              <p>Response: We agree that this study does not demonstrate performance in asymptomatic individuals, in whom performance may differ from symptomatic individuals, and had already stated in the limitations section of the Discussion: “This study does not assess diagnostic performance in asymptomatic patients, in whom viral load may be lower and there may be a consequent effect on diagnostic performance.”</p>
              <p>Also in the Discussion we state “Other studies have shown substantial decreases in test sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals, including those recruited as close contacts of cases” and cite three papers to support this. To make this additionally clear we now also state “Our study demonstrates reduced sensitivity in individuals with fewer core symptoms but does not provide evidence about the performance of the two assays in the asymptomatic population.”</p>
              <p>However we do not feel the two papers indicated by the reviewer are directly relevant as they report results of other assays which were not evaluated in our study.</p>
              <p>6. Limitations: A limited sensitivity has been reported for the Omicron variants (e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2022.08.006" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2022.08.006</ext-link>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-022-00730-z" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-022-00730-z</ext-link>
<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-022-00752-7" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00430-022-00752-7</ext-link> ). Consider adding this fact to the limitations ot another place in the discussion.</p>
              <p>Response: We are grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion and have added this statement and references about possible impaired performance for Omicron variants to the limitations part of the Discussion that mentions future SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: THE POOR NOVELTY OF THE PAPER SUGGESTS ITS REJECTION</p>
              <p>THERE ARE MANY PAPER ALREADY PUBLISHED ON POCT TESTING FOR COVID-19</p>
              <p>THE STUDY DESIGN IS FINE AND THIS IS A WELL-WRITTEN PAPER BUT, IN MY OPINION, IT DOES NOD ADD VALUABLE INFORMATION TO CURRENT KNOWLEDGE</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your review. We respectfully disagree as there are no other published studies of this size, and with the methodological strengths of this study, conducted in community settings.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: General comments:</p>
              <p>The manuscript thoroughly describes the performance of two different antigen tests (one with visual reading of results and one with machine reading of results) in an outpatient setting. Although the paper could be considered post festum (the current SARS-CoV-2 variants were not present during the testing period), the manuscript highlights, documents and adequately discuss the inferior diagnostic accuracy of antigen testing compared to Gold Standard qPCR testing. The manuscript is well written with huge amounts of clinical data and adequate statistics.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your considered review of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Specific comments:</p>
              <p>Line 68: I do not think LFD-Ag are commonplace for community testing at the present time?</p>
              <p>Response: We have rewritten the opening sentences of the manuscript to reflect changes in community testing practices and have removed original reference [1] accordingly.</p>
              <p>Methods: A description of the two assays is warranted – e.g. the difference between manual and machine reading of results.</p>
              <p>Response: We have added additional descriptive detail with respect to the two index tests under the ‘Index tests’ heading, highlighting the key differences in test result interpretation i.e. manual/user vs machine.</p>
