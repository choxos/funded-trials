                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Early antiviral treatment is effective for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) but currently available agents are expensive. Favipiravir is routinely used in many countries, but efficacy is unproven. Antiviral combinations have not been systematically studied. We aimed to evaluate the effect of favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir or the combination of both agents on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load trajectory when administered early.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We conducted a Phase 2, proof of principle, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial, double-blind trial of ambulatory outpatients with early COVID-19 (within 7 days of symptom onset) at 2 sites in the United Kingdom. Participants were randomised using a centralised online process to receive: favipiravir (1,800 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 400 mg 4 times daily on Days 2 to 7) plus lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily on Days 2 to 7), favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir plus favipiravir placebo, or both placebos. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 viral load at Day 5, accounting for baseline viral load. Between 6 October 2020 and 4 November 2021, we recruited 240 participants. For the favipiravir+lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir+placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo, and placebo-only arms, we recruited 61, 59, 60, and 60 participants and analysed 55, 56, 55, and 58 participants, respectively, who provided viral load measures at Day 1 and Day 5. In the primary analysis, the mean viral load in the favipiravir+placebo arm had changed by −0.57 log<sub>10</sub> (95% CI −1.21 to 0.07, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.08) and in the lopinavir-ritonavir+placebo arm by −0.18 log<sub>10</sub> (95% CI −0.82 to 0.46, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.58) compared to the placebo arm at Day 5. There was no significant interaction between favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir (interaction coefficient term: 0.59 log<sub>10</sub>, 95% CI −0.32 to 1.50, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.20). More participants had undetectable virus at Day 5 in the favipiravir+placebo arm compared to placebo only (46.3% versus 26.9%, odds ratio (OR): 2.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.65; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.03). Adverse events were observed more frequently with lopinavir-ritonavir, mainly gastrointestinal disturbance. Favipiravir drug levels were lower in the combination arm than the favipiravir monotherapy arm, possibly due to poor absorption. The major limitation was that the study population was relatively young and healthy compared to those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>At the current doses, no treatment significantly reduced viral load in the primary analysis. Favipiravir requires further evaluation with consideration of dose escalation. Lopinavir-ritonavir administration was associated with lower plasma favipiravir concentrations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to represent a major threat to global health. Interrupting viral replication in early infection reduces the risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease progression and hospitalisation [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Efficacy has been demonstrated for neutralising monoclonal antibody treatments, but these are vulnerable to loss of potency with new viral variants as observed with the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the cost of available oral antiviral and monoclonal treatments is prohibitive for many countries.</p>
              <p>A general principle of antiviral chemotherapy is that multiple agents with different modes of action are often required, which can be particularly pertinent in the case of repurposed drugs where antiviral potency using monotherapy may be limited. Combination therapy using a polymerase inhibitor combined with a protease inhibitor, thereby targeting sequential steps in the viral replication pathway, is a potential strategy [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When SARS-CoV-1 was treated with the polymerase inhibitor ribavirin in combination with the protease inhibitor lopinavir-ritonavir, and when this combination was initiated immediately upon diagnosis, a significantly lower mortality was seen compared with historical controls [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another study of this combination showed reduced mortality and need for intubation when therapy was given early, while late rescue treatment had no effect [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Early post-exposure prophylaxis against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in healthcare workers also showed that ribavirin plus lopinavir-ritonavir reduced the incidence of infection from 28% to 0% [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>In early 2020, it was shown that while ribavirin had little effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in vitro, the orally available polymerase inhibitor favipiravir did have an in vitro potency within clinically achievable range [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). While subsequent in vitro results have been less promising, high-dose favipiravir achieving concentrations commensurate with human exposures reduced viral load and lung pathology in hamsters [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Early observational clinical studies reported benefits of favipiravir in COVID-19 patients [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Favipiravir generic formulations are now in widespread use for COVID-19 in some countries, but high-quality evidence on its effect in early treatment is lacking. A recent pre-print suggested that favipiravir (as monotherapy and taken with a twice daily dosing regimen) did not impact time to viral clearance [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>While the HIV protease inhibitors tipranavir and nelfinavir showed higher in vitro potency against SARS-CoV-2 than lopinavir-ritonavir [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], safety concerns and limited clinical experience with these agents meant that we chose to study lopinavir-ritonavir. Both lopinavir and ritonavir, which is used as a pharmacokinetic booster to lopinavir, have modest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that was predicted to yield around up to 30% inhibition of viral replication at the licensed dose (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In line with this, lopinavir-ritonavir monotherapy did not improve clinical outcomes in trials on hospitalised patients [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, viral dynamic modelling suggests that drugs with lower potency may nevertheless inhibit viral replication if started earlier [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and high-quality early treatment trials with lopinavir-ritonavir are lacking.</p>
              <p>The FLARE trial therefore aimed to deliver robust Phase 2, proof of principle, data on viral load changes using early antiviral treatment. The combination of favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir was studied in a 2 × 2 factorial design to evaluate the combination while simultaneously testing each agent in monotherapy versus placebo to understand their respective contributions. Doses used in current clinical practice and previous trials for other indications were used due to available safety data, and modelling which suggested that we would achieve EC90 for favipiravir based on the available pharmacokinetic data at the time (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). For favipiravir, this is similar to the dose now being employed worldwide for COVID-19.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>FLARE was an early intervention trial testing the effect of oral antiviral therapy on viral load [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in ambulatory outpatients. Participants received favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir placebo, favipiravir placebo plus lopinavir-ritonavir, or placebos of both drugs. Favipiravir or matched placebo was administered at a dose of 1,800 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 400 mg 4 times daily from Day 2 to Day 7. Lopinavir-ritonavir or matched placebo were given at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily from Day 2 to Day 7. Participants were advised to take both Day 1 doses on the first day regardless of time of enrolment, due to the perceived importance of achieving high antiviral levels as early as possible. Those recruited in the afternoon took the first dose immediately and the second dose at least 6 hours later.</p>
                <p>Participants aged between 18 and 70 years who had recently (within the last 5 days) developed symptoms of COVID-19, or who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were within 7 days of symptom onset, or who were asymptomatic but had tested positive by PCR within the previous 48 hours, were eligible for the trial. Participants were ineligible if they had known hypersensitivity to either drug or their ingredients/excipients, had chronic liver or kidney disease, were taking concomitant medicines known to interact with the trial treatments, were being treated as a hospital inpatient for any condition, were pregnant or breastfeeding, or were participating in another interventional clinical trial (treatment or vaccination). Before 8 June 2021, participants vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 were excluded but this was reversed by the Trial Steering Committee due to the large number of vaccinated individuals presenting with infection at that time, and the importance of establishing whether early antiviral treatment is effective in a vaccinated population. Female participants of childbearing potential were required to provide a negative pregnancy test before commencement of trial medication and on Day 14, and to use highly effective contraceptive measures during the trial; male participants with a female partner of childbearing potential were also required to use highly effective contraception.</p>
                <p>Participants were informed about the trial via occupational health departments at participating hospital sites and participant identification centres, via poster advertisements, social media or, from 23 June 2021, directly by National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace following the identification of a positive test. The trial team also directly contacted ambulatory patients who had tested positive at hospital sites and those in the local area from a list provided by NHS Digital.</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited at 2 sites: Royal Free Hospital and University College London Hospital, both in London, UK.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the Wales Research Ethics Committee 3 (Ref: 20/WA/0210) and all participants provided written, informed consent. The trial registration number (<ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) was NCT04499677.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>A prescreening visit (usually by telephone) briefly assessed eligibility and collected the following information: study site, age (≤55 versus &gt;55 years), sex, height and weight (to calculate body mass index (BMI)), symptomatic or asymptomatic, current smoking status (current smoker, non-smoker, ex-smoker), ethnicity, previous COVID-19 specific vaccination (yes/no), and presence/absence of the following comorbidities: diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic or other heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease. These variables were used as part of the minimisation strategy to randomise participants into the 4 arms 1:1:1:1 using a centralised concealed online process to assign participants to a medication kit number.</p>
                <p>Trial medication kits, prepared by RenaClinical, were coded to maintain double blinding (investigators and participants). Kits contained favipiravir or colour and size matched placebo 200-mg tablets supplied by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. and lopinavir-ritonavir 200-mg/50-mg tablets (AbbVie) or colour and size matched placebos (RenaClinical).</p>

                <title>Study procedures</title>
                <p>People willing to participate at prescreening were visited in their home or seen in a designated COVID-19 treatment area at recruitment sites. Following confirmation of eligibility and written informed consent, a nasopharyngeal swab (for participants who were symptomatic but had not tested positive) and baseline blood test was performed along with collection of clinical and demographic information. A pack containing trial medication, kits and instructions for collecting daily saliva samples (Saliva RNA Collection and Preservation devices, Norgen Biotek, Canada), a thermometer, and participant diary was provided. The first saliva sample was taken followed by witnessed intake of the first dose of trial medication; participants were advised to take daily saliva samples each morning from Days 2 to 7 before eating, drinking, or brushing teeth.</p>
                <p>A telephone follow-up was performed on Day 5 and a second visit performed on Day 7 where saliva samples were collected and blood was drawn for safety and favipiravir pharmacokinetics. Stool samples were collected if provided. Follow-up telephone calls or visits were made on Day 14; a pregnancy test was performed for women of childbearing potential and blood tests taken if abnormalities had been detected at Day 7. A final telephone call was made on Day 28.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was viral load measured by quantitative PCR performed on saliva samples at Day 5, accounting for the pretreatment Day 1 viral load. Secondary outcomes were proportion of participants with undetectable viral loads at Day 5, rate of decrease in viral load during the 7-day treatment course, duration of fever, proportion of participants with medication-related toxicity at Days 7 and 14, and proportion of participants admitted to hospital, intensive care, or dead due to a COVID-19-related illness.</p>
                <p>We planned to assess viral clearance in stool but received insufficient samples for analysis. Further outcomes of whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 and more extensive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling will be reported separately.</p>

                <title>Laboratory analyses</title>
                <p>Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and serum urate were measured in the diagnostic laboratory at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London. Saliva viral load was also measured by the GOSH diagnostic laboratory. Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value between 40 to 45 were repeated, and for the purposes of the primary analysis, a viral load was calculated from the calibration curve if the repeat value was also &lt;45. However, due to uncertainties in the interpretation of these Ct values and in line with clinical practice, for the secondary analysis of undetectable viral load, Ct values &gt;40 were considered undetectable.</p>
                <p>Serum antibody status at Day 1 and Day 7 was measured at the University of Birmingham via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described previously [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
                <p>Favipiravir drug levels pre and post the second or third dose on Day 7 were measured in plasma by the LSI Medience Corporation in Japan on behalf of Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. Favipiravir was confirmed to be stable for 24 hours at room temperature and for 6 months once frozen at −20°C. The assay lower limit of quantification was 0.1 mg/L.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>It was assumed that a clinically significant difference in viral load between antiviral and placebo-treated participants would be 0.5 to 1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL by Day 5. Simulations showed a total of 216 participants would provide 90% power with 2-sided alpha of 2.5% to detect a 0.9 log<sub>10</sub> decrease in viral load of each active treatment on its own compared to placebo. The factorial design allowed an interaction term to be estimated with 80% power, at a nominal 2-sided alpha of 5%, to detect a synergistic or antagonistic effect of 1.0 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL. The standard deviation of change in viral load in each group was assumed to be 1.3 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL. To allow for 10% attrition rate, a total sample size of 240 (60 participants per arm) was determined.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were done according to a predefined statistical analysis plan (see <xref rid="pmed.1004120.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Statistical Analysis</xref>). Analysis of the primary, secondary, and safety outcomes was conducted on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT population is composed of all randomised participants. For the primary outcome, the ITT analysis was composed of all ITT participants for whom a measure of viral load was available at Day 1 and Day 5. Additionally, the primary outcome was analysed in a modified ITT (mITT) population, which excluded participants who had undetectable viral load both at Day 1 and Day 5.</p>
                <p>An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to estimate the difference in viral load at 5 days post treatment between the treatment arms. The model included a term for each treatment (favipiravir active/placebo and lopinavir-ritonavir active/placebo), an interaction term between the 2 treatments, and baseline viral load. Supportive analyses on the primary outcome included a model adjusting for (i) minimisation factors; (ii) minimisation factors, symptom duration and antibody status (post hoc adjustment strategy); (iii) potential effect of the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, by adding a categorical variable reflecting the period of recruitment: no delta variant (before 24 April 2021), some delta variant (between 24 April 2021 and 12 June 2021) and predominantly delta variant period (post 12 June 2021). A linear mixed model was used to model the viral load trajectories from Day 1 to Day 7 between the 4 treatment arms. Two adjustment strategies were followed: (i) Day 2 to Day 7 viral loads were modelled as response variable, adjusted for Day 1 viral load; (ii) also adding minimisation factors, symptom duration, and antibody status (post hoc analysis). Logistic regression models were fitted to test for differences in proportions of events between the groups. We used STATA/MP 17.0 for all analyses.</p>
                <p>No interim analyses were planned and safety monitoring was undertaken by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).</p>

                <p>Between 6 October 2020 and 4 November 2021, we screened 1,215 and recruited 240 participants (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Participant details are provided in <xref rid="pmed.1004120.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and minimisation factors in <xref rid="pmed.1004120.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Most participants (90%) were below the age of 55 years; 82% were Caucasian and 85% did not have any comorbidities. Approximately 51% of those randomised were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, and the proportion of vaccinated participants was balanced across the 4 arms; 63% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody at baseline. Approximately 66% of the participants started treatment within 5 days of symptom onset. The time between symptom onset and start of treatment was similar between the arms. Three patients did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR prior to recruitment; of these, 2 had a positive baseline sample but 1 had a negative baseline sample. One patient was asymptomatic at recruitment but their baseline viral load was above the mean. Symptoms across the entire cohort are summarised in <xref rid="pmed.1004120.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The major finding of the FLARE trial is that, at the doses used, there is no clear evidence that either favipiravir monotherapy, lopinavir-ritonavir monotherapy, or favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir produce clinically worthwhile reductions in viral load in early treatment. FLARE provides insufficient evidence to take these therapies into Phase 3. However, further study of favipiravir may be warranted: In particular, dose escalation studies might identify more efficacious doses against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
              <p>We found a numerically greater but nonsignificant reduction in viral load associated with favipiravir monotherapy in the primary analysis, while a post hoc fully adjusted mixed model, similar to that used to report the effect of other antivirals [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was statistically significant (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1004120.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). We also observed an increase in the proportion of patients with undetectable viral load compared to placebo, lopinavir-ritonavir, or combination therapy (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1004120.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The effect was seen especially in those with higher baseline viral load, likely due to viral replication having slowed substantially in those with low viral load, limiting utility of antivirals [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this may point towards efficacy in a group with the most potential to benefit.</p>
              <p>When the FLARE trial was designed in March 2020, we identified the imperative to generate high-quality Phase 2 proof of principle trial evidence on repurposed antivirals for early treatment of COVID-19, and this question remains important. The trial opened for recruitment in September 2020 but proceeded at only 2 sites as we did not receive research prioritisation in the UK via Urgent Public Health (UPH) status.</p>
              <p>Based on in vitro data and early clinical reports, favipiravir was chosen as the most promising orally available agent. Due to uncertainty whether favipiravir monotherapy would be effective, the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir was proposed as an inexpensive, readily available protease inhibitor with evidence of some clinical effect against previous coronaviruses, and modest in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.</p>
              <p>Favipiravir is a ribosomal-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor with a similar mode of action to molnupiravir. The magnitude of difference in viral load at Day 5 with favipiravir versus placebo in our trial (0.57 to 0.65 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL, depending on analysis used) was similar to that seen with molnupiravir (0.55 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) at the highest dose tested in trials (800 mg twice daily) [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]: This agent has been reported to be clinically effective for early COVID-19. However, it remains to be seen whether molnupiravir monotherapy will retain clinical benefits in routine clinical practice. Favipiravir as monotherapy was well tolerated with relatively few adverse effects; in particular, we did not observe significant hepatotoxicity. A loading dose of 6,000 mg (2,400 mg given twice 8 hours apart followed by 1,200 mg) on Day 1, followed by 1,200 mg twice daily thereafter was well tolerated when used in Ebola [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and thus higher doses may be feasible. High levels of uric acid were seen, which is a well-recognised side effect of favipiravir, but without obvious clinical consequence.</p>
              <p>We chose the favipiravir dose used in influenza trials of 3,600 mg on Day 1 followed by 1,600 mg daily thereafter because simulations using pharmacokinetic data provided by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co. suggested we should expect to achieve 90% viral replication inhibition (along with a slight advantage in higher pre-dose trough levels if the maintenance dose was split 4 times per day rather than twice per day (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>)). However, upon measuring favipiravir pharmacokinetics on Day 7, we found levels around one third of our pretrial predictions and, perhaps more unexpectedly, significantly lower levels of favipiravir in the combination arm despite measurement being limited to those still taking IMP at this time point (<xref rid="pmed.1004120.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our dosing simulations assumed linear pharmacokinetics and although there was a prior report of time-dependent reductions in levels seen in Ebola [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we did not anticipate this with our dose regimen. However, data published after the start of FLARE indicate that favipiravir is likely to display time-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics at the doses used here [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], albeit intracellular concentrations with this dose regimen have been proposed to reach antiviral levels [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nevertheless, time-dependent nonlinearity does not account for the lower levels seen in the combination compared with monotherapy arm. While a cytochrome P450 mediated drug–drug interaction is not expected between favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir, possible explanations include lower favipiravir absorption associated with the gastrointestinal effects of lopinavir-ritonavir, or more unreported missed doses in the combination arm.</p>
              <p>It remains possible that a concentration-dependent antiviral effect may nevertheless occur with the lower concentrations seen in FLARE, especially via mutagenesis. Viral sequencing work is ongoing to explore this possibility and a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model is planned to investigate whether there is a concentration-response relationship with either viral load or mutagenesis. This model should identify the rationale for and doses to use in a future trial.</p>
              <p>Favipiravir is in routine usage for COVID-19 in many countries, but existing trial data are mixed. Some small, open-label studies have indicated benefits in terms of clinical outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or viral shedding [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, other studies have indicated no clinically important benefit [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], including when given in early disease [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These studies were open label with heterogenous populations often including hospitalised patients, where antiviral treatment is expected to be less effective. Holubar and colleagues performed a double-blind randomised trial of favipiravir in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic adults within 72 hours of a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (median 5 days of symptoms) [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among 116 patients, there was no difference in time to viral shedding cessation or symptom resolution. However, baseline Ct value (inversely related to viral load) tended to be lower while the change in Ct value between Days 1 to 7 tended to be greater in the favipiravir-treated arm.</p>
              <p>By including a placebo-controlled lopinavir-ritonavir monotherapy arm, FLARE has demonstrated that this agent has no potential to reduce viral load, even with early treatment, and is poorly tolerated. As such, FLARE provides a strong rationale not to take lopinavir-ritonavir into Phase 3. We were able to reach this conclusion by exposing only 60 outpatients to lopinavir-ritonavir monotherapy. A similar design could have quickly ruled out other repurposed agents such as hydroxychloroquine.</p>
              <p>An expected but problematic issue encountered with lopinavir-ritonavir was the frequency of side effects, especially gastrointestinal, leading to frequent discontinuation of treatment. We also encountered numerous potential drug–drug interactions, including with commonly prescribed medications such as budesonide and simvastatin, requiring exclusion of potential participants or modification/suspension of concomitant medications. These are important issues to consider with other ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (e.g., nirmatrelvir). Fortunately, data from trials so far have not indicated a high rate of discontinuation with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Possible explanations include fewer side effects with nirmatrelvir compared to lopinavir, improved adherence among a high-risk group with more potential for clinical benefit and better adherence to a twice daily regime. However, this will need to be monitored in “real world” settings.</p>
              <p>As the recruitment period for FLARE coincided with the successful UK vaccine roll-out, the Trial Steering Committee decided to include participants who had received a vaccine. Regardless of treatment arm, rate of viral load decay tended to be higher in participants who were vaccinated or antibody-positive at baseline.</p>
              <p>Our study has some limitations. The recruited cohort was relatively young and healthy with lower rates of comorbidities and obesity than often seen in the hospitalised population with COVID-19. Approximately 18% of participants were of non-white ethnicity that is similar to the UK population but may be less reflective of those with poor outcome. However, the trial was designed predominantly to look at viral load rather than clinical outcomes and therefore these factors were less important. Our participants had lower baseline viral loads than many reported elsewhere in the literature. This may have related in part to the use of saliva, but saliva kits were convenient for participants and allowed us to standardise the volume collected. In other reports, viral load has been reported to be either higher [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or lower [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in saliva compared to nasopharyngeal swab but generally concordance is very good [<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004120.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We were unable to perform viral culture or infectivity assays that may have provided useful additional information. For logistical reasons, we were unable to obtain samples for pharmacokinetics on every participant in the study. Due to the lack of UK UPH status, recruitment took longer than anticipated, and the results of FLARE are available only after the identification of other oral antiviral agents for COVID-19. However, they retain importance for low- and middle-income countries where favipiravir is already in routine use and where molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir may be prohibitively expensive.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our results do not support routine usage or Phase 3 trials of favipiravir or lopinavir-ritonavir at the doses investigated. There may be some effect of favipiravir when used for early treatment of COVID-19, especially in those with high baseline viral load, but further investigation is needed regarding dosage or additive antiviral medication. Another relatively small study would be sufficient to establish this. We have conclusively demonstrated the ineffectiveness of lopinavir-ritonavir even in early disease and have identified a new drug interaction between favipiravir and lopinavir-ritonavir with the latter apparently lowering plasma levels of the former. These results have important implications for the global efforts against COVID-19.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Statistical Review</p>
              <p>Lowe and colleagues present the results of a 2x2 factorial designed study of early antiviral treatment in COVID-19. This review considers the use of statistics in the paper.</p>
              <p>Overall, these are very good, but I do have a few minor comments.</p>
              <p>The modelling approach is reasonable, and the authors apply a number of sensitivity analyses, but I would like to have seen the results of models fitted without interaction terms; this could be done in a supplementary table.</p>
              <p>In the text, the primary analysis results are reported as reductions in the treated arms relative to placebo/placebo, though the confidence intervals quoted are for the differences (i.e. the opposite sign to the point estimates), which is slightly confusing.</p>
              <p>The main conclusion that there is no clear evidence that either treatment produces clinically relevant reductions in viral load, seems a little negative. A clinically important reduction is quoted as being in the range 0.5 to 1.0 log10 copies per ml, and the main effect of favipiravir is 0.57 in the primary analysis, or more in the supporting analyses, and much more in the subgroup with higher baseline viral load. Saying that, the authors do discuss these points.</p>
              <p>There is mention of a pre-specified statistical analysis plan, but it is not referenced, and not included in the supplementary materials.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Lowe et al report the results of a blinded randomised clinical trial for COVID patients of favipiravir, LPV/r, the combination, and placebo. The primary outcome was salivary viral load at day 5 (adjusted for baseline level). This was a phase 2a trial. There was no statistically significant change in viral load compared to placebo for any of the treatment arms in the primary analysis.</p>
              <p>Overall, this is a well written manuscript that reports on the trial as planned in the trial protocol and as registered on clinicaltrials.gov. The use of placebo is a particular strength. It provides an example of a well conducted phase 2 trial that can inform the design of future trials. As the authors state in the discussion more trials such as this may have helped to guide which agents should be included in larger phase 3 trials during a pandemic. Unfortunately, the time taken to complete this study also provides an example that such earlier phase trials need to be conducted and reported quickly to make such an impact. The reality is that the results from FLARE are unlikely to have great impact on the therapeutic landscape or subsequent trials given the alternative options in mid 2022 - at least in high income countries. One suggestion is that in the discussion the authors could consider the issue of whether favipiravir should still be used or trialled in lower middle income countries that may not have access to monoclonals or paxlovid and molnupiravir.</p>
              <p>I would like to see details on whether all randomised participants had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 - the first inclusion criteria appears to only require consistent symptoms. The protocol suggests that they all were swabbed for a diagnosis, but I think they could be randomised prior to the results. Can probably infer this from the figures, but should report at start of results.</p>
              <p>In terms of the reporting of the primary outcome, I would have liked to have seen more detail in the main manuscript. Specifically in table 3, reporting the coefficient was not intuitively understood. To me it would be clearer to see the baseline and day 5 viral loads (I know this is in figure 2, but the summary mean numbers could be reported in the text or table) in each of the 4 groups, the change in viral load in the 4 groups, and then the coefficient which represents the difference in change between the 3 active groups and the placebo group (if I have understood the analysis). Figure 2 and 3 and suppl figure 2 are certainly helpful as well. Table 4 is also helpful in seeing the raw numbers in terms of numerator and denominator. At line 234-235, I'm not sure it is appropriate to say the pre-defined threshold for significance. I haven't seen the Statistical analysis plan, but I would have thought the pre-defined threshold related to the primary analysis, and not to the various additional analyses that were performed. I think better to just state the numbers. Same point when this is discussed in the discussion at line 313-314. At line 240-245, was this 'post-hoc supportive analysis' in pre-defined sub-groups? Would be good to be clear about that. E.g, 'In the post-hoc supportive analysis (i.e., this was not a pre-defined sub-group analysis)…'</p>
              <p>For clarity and ease of use of data for meta-analyses etc, I suggest all the secondary outcomes be reported in a table (excluding the PK-PD modelling aspects). I can get this data from the manuscript text, but I would encourage clear reporting of all the secondary outcomes.</p>
              <p>Line 324 - the clinical trial results for molnupiravir have now been reported.</p>
              <p>Line 354-358 - rather than using 'this' in some of the sentences, it would be clearer to directly refer to 'LPV-ritonavir'.</p>
              <p>Line 369-378 - the paragraph could come earlier in the discussion. I suggest grouping all the favipiravir paragraphs together.</p>
              <p>Limitations wise - a discussion of timeliness of results and therefore ability to impact on subsequent trials or practice could be considered in this section.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors report on the FLARE study which was a Phase 2, proof of principle, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial, double-blind trial of outpatients with early COVID-19 (within 7 days of symptom onset) at two sites in the United Kingdom. The study consisted of 4 arms; </p>
              <p>1) favipiravir + lopinavir-ritonavir.</p>
              <p>2) favipiravir plus lopinavir-ritonavir placebo.</p>
              <p>3) lopinavir-ritonavir plus favipiravir placebo.</p>
              <p>4) both placebos. </p>
              <p>The primary outcome was viral load relative to baseline on day 5.</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>The favipiravir alone arm demonstrated the greatest reductions in viral load but the confidence intervals were large ( 1.21 to 0.07 log10 reductions, p=0.08) leading to a non significant result. </p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>The patient population are patients diagnosed with coronavirus within 7 days of symptom onset who were managed in the outpatient setting. The authors state ambulatory patients in the methods and then in exclusion mention participants were being treated as a hospital inpatient for any condition. They should just make this clear in the abstract and methods that the trial participants were treated in the outpatient/community setting (hence their population is classed as a non severe patient group).</p>
              <p>The viral Laos was measured in daily saliva samples. Is there sufficient data to show how it correlates in terms of viral load with nasopharyngeal samples. </p>
              <p>Statistical analyses</p>
              <p>The study is inadequately powered but at the time of setting up the study in the early phase of the pandemic there was insufficient information and the authors have made reasonable attempts at estimating effect size. </p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Dominant population that has been recruited was under the age of 55 years with average age of 40 years. Hence, in this healthy population the placebo groups may have also more effectively cleared the virus and hence reducing the difference between the treatment and placebo group. Furthermore, almost 50% of patients recruited had received 2 doses of the vaccine. This may have further reduced the effective difference in viral clearance between the treat,ent and placebo groups. Have the authors factored age and vaccination into their linear mixed model. It is very likely that a lot of the adjustments are post hoc and the authors need to be explicit in which factors were planned a priori and which factors were post hoc eg effect of delta variant, effect of vaccination if considered.</p>
              <p>Do the authors have an explanation why only 50% of patients had drug levels measured?</p>
              <p>Viral pcr: did favipiravir have any effect on the viral sequence on day 5 compared to the other therapies. As favipiravir is a ribosomal-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor we would anticipate multiple mutations in the virus. The authors mention they are performing viral sequencing and that data would significantly strengthen this study.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: Overall summary: This phase 2 proof of principle, placebo controlled RCTwith 2x2 factorial double blind trial of OP with early COVID-19 from 2 sites in England using favipiravir, favipiravir and LPV-ritonavir, favipiravir plus LPV-ritonavir placebo, and both placebo using SARS-CoV2 VL at day 5 obtained through saliva as an outcome was safe, but with frequent side effects, most notably GI. There was no clinically significantly reduced VL in the primary analysis of the study drug. </p>
              <p>Main strengths: The analysis was done during the pandemic when there were substantial challenges in patient recruitment, research staffing and changes in standards of care. It was also very difficult to bring outpatients in for research studies in a safe way due to limitations on transportation and health care facility rules. The authors should be commended for conducting an outpatient trial during this time period due to these substantial barriers. </p>
              <p>Potential points to further explore: </p>
              <p>It is unclear why patients who were asymptomatic were included in the trial, as they would be less likely to show an effect (ie they likely had lower viral loads to begin with) do the results change by excluding those? </p>
              <p>In the demographics table, the authors indicated the number of doses received of the vaccine. It might be better to classify whether the participants who were vaccinated, were fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated (ie were they more than 14 days out from their most recent/final vaccination)? How did some patient receive 3 vaccines?</p>
              <p>In the minimization table participants are labelled as vaccinated or not. Would redo this analysis with fully/partially/not vaccinated. </p>
              <p>The authors note that there was no significant reduction in VL in the primary analysis. The difficulty with the analysis is that the samples obtained were in the saliva, which is more convenient, but less likely to show an effect than a nasal swab. This is noted in the limitations, but significantly impacts the results of the study. </p>
              <p>A notable issue is the significant number of withdrawals/discontinuations of the groups taking LPV-r due to GI side effects, and the substantial drug-drug interactions. Appropriately the authors discuss the issues with using ritonavir for boosting; however this is being done fairly successfully with nirmatrelvir in 2022. Do the authors have any speculation for the differences between drop out rates for paxlovid real world data and for the LPV-r arms in this trial?</p>
              <p>As noted in the limitations, this study population was young and very healthy. Would specifically note that there were few minorities, low rates of comorbidities and obesity, and over half were vaccinated, which could have affected the study effect. And make it less representative of those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, would note this in the limitations. The authors do not report any data on resolution of symptoms other than duration of fever. It would be helpful to identify what symptoms patients had at the start of the trial and at the end to identify how sick they were. Presumably none of the patients were hospitalized, but that should be explicitly noted.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Lowe,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Favipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir or combination therapy (FLARE): a randomised, double blind, 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled trial of early antiviral therapy in COVID-19" (PMEDICINE-D-22-01160R2) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by xxx reviewers. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>GENERAL</p>
              <p>The Data Availability Statement (DAS) requires revision. For each data source used in your study: </p>
              <p>a) If the data are freely or publicly available, note this and state the location of the data: within the paper, in Supporting Information files, or in a public repository (include the DOI or accession number). </p>
              <p>b) If the data are owned by a third party but freely available upon request, please note this and state the owner of the data set and contact information for data requests (web or email address). Note that a study author cannot be the contact person for the data. </p>
              <p>c) If the data are not freely available, please describe briefly the ethical, legal, or contractual restriction that prevents you from sharing it. Please also include an appropriate contact (web or email address) for inquiries (again, this cannot be a study author).</p>
              <p>In the first 1/3-1/2 of the manuscript you use square brackets to sign post tables and/or figures etc, in the latter part circular brackets. Suggest the use of circular brackets throughout reserving square brackets for in-text reference call-outs and for however duplication of brackets are necessary)</p>
              <p>AUTHOR SUMMARY</p>
              <p>Thank you for including an author summary I have made some suggestions for modifications as below, as we understand things (please note the requirement for bullet points):</p>
              <p>Why was this study done? </p>
              <p> * The FLARE trial aimed to discover whether existing oral antiviral drugs could reduce the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 virus if given soon after symptoms started.</p>
              <p> * If effective this strategy could reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. </p>
              <p>What did the researchers do and find? </p>
              <p> * The researchers performed a clinical trial of two medications - favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir, testing them on their own and in combination. </p>
              <p> * Combination therapies were less effective than favipiravir monotherapy, but many people taking lopinavir/ritonavir had gastrointestinal side effects and favipiravir drug levels were lower in the combination arm, possibly due to poor absorption.</p>
              <p> * SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were not significantly lower with any of the drug treatments after 5 days compared to placebo, although more people taking favipiravir had undetectable levels of the virus. </p>
              <p>What do these findings mean? </p>
              <p> * None of these therapies should be used routinely at the current doses investigated.</p>
              <p> * Further studies investigating the effect of Favipiravir when administered at higher doses should be undertaken.</p>
              <p>METHODS and RESULTS</p>
              <p>Please indicate explicitly in the main manuscript text that consent was written.</p>
              <p>TABLES</p>
              <p>Table 3: please also provide unadjusted analyses</p>
              <p>FIGURES</p>
              <p>Suppl figure 5: the graphs are very small thus rather inaccessible to the reader, please revise</p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Alex McConnachie, Statistical Review</p>
              <p>I thank the authors for their responses to my original comments. I am generally happy with these.</p>
              <p>Seeing the SAP is good, but the paper does not signpost it when it is referred to in the methods section. I had hoped that the SAP would provide more information about the sample size calculation/simulation, but the text in the SAP is very much the same as the paper. Sufficient detail needs to be given to allow someone to replicate what was done (e.g. assumed treatment effects, and SD of the primary outcome).</p>
              <p>My guess is that the sample size calculation for the main effects relates to a model without interaction, essentially treating the study as two separate trials, where the analysis in relation to one randomisation treats the other randomisation as a stratification factor; this is why I prefer that the non-interaction analysis is reported somewhere in the paper. Saying that, it is true that in this case, the interaction model is more informative, given the magnitude of the interaction term. Plus, it is possible to work out the results without the interaction, given the information presented, so seeing these results is more for convenience, than a requirement.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I am satisfied that the authors have addressed the comments made on previous review. Well done on a valuable trial.</p>
