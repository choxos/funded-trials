                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation (LF-EMS) may have the potential to reduce breathlessness and increase exercise capacity in the chronic heart failure population who struggle to adhere to conventional exercise. The study’s aim was to establish if a randomised controlled trial of LF-EMS was feasible.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III–IV) having left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% documented by echocardiography were eligible.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomised (remotely by computer) to 8 weeks (5×60 mins per week) of either LF-EMS intervention (4 Hz, continuous, n=30) or sham placebo (skin level stimulation only, n=30) of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles. Participants used the LF-EMS straps at home and were supervised weekly</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Recruitment, adherence and tolerability to the intervention were measured during the trial as well as physiological outcomes (primary outcome: 6 min walk, secondary outcomes: quadriceps strength, quality of life and physical activity).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Sixty of 171 eligible participants (35.08%) were recruited to the trial. 12 (20%) of the 60 patients (4 LF-EMS and 8 sham) withdrew. Forty-one patients (68.3%), adhered to the protocol for at least 70% of the sessions. The physiological measures indicated no significant differences between groups in 6 min walk distance(p=0.13) and quality of life (p=0.55) although both outcomes improved more with LF-EMS.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Patients with severe heart failure can be recruited to and tolerate LF-EMS studies. A larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) in the advanced heart failure population is technically feasible, although adherence to follow-up would be challenging. The preliminary improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life were minimal and this should be considered if planning a larger trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects approximately 26 million people worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and is associated with a poor prognosis; 30%–40% of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within a year.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV are unable to perform the simplest daily activities, become depressed and have a poor quality of life.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Regular aerobic exercise reduces breathlessness and muscle dysfunction for individuals with CHF while improving exercise capacity.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> According to the ExTraMATCH meta-analysis,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> exercise training leads to a 35% relative reduction in mortality, similar to the effects of beta-blockers<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> However, those with advanced CHF are often so limited that they are unable to gain the holistic benefits of exercise.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) may provide an alternative rehabilitative therapy for this group. In patients with mild to moderate CHF, EMS can improve muscle strength of the legs, exercise capacity and quality of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> Low-frequency (4–5 Hz) EMS (LF-EMS) produces shivering-like subtetanic muscle contractions that can stimulate an aerobic response equivalent to 51% of maximal oxygen uptake.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Therapeutic levels of aerobic exercise can thus be achieved passively by LF-EMS,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and it has been shown to be comfortable and well tolerated in healthy individuals and those with mild to moderate CHF.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> However, the impact of LF-EMS in patients with advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV) is currently unknown. As patients with advanced heart failure have shown poor uptake and adherence to intervention studies,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> a preliminary study was needed to determine the feasibility of LF-EMS in this patient cohort prior to the development of a large-scale definitive trial.</p>
              <p>Based on recommendations for good practice in the design of pilot and feasibility studies,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> this study was undertaken with the following aims: to (1) test the robustness of the study protocol for a potential future trial; (2) estimate rates of recruitment, consent and retention; (3) determine the tolerability of the LF-EMS intervention and the effectiveness of the sham placebo in the NYHA III/IV CHF population and (4) gain initial estimates of the efficacy of LF-EMS for all potential primary outcomes. This can be used for sample size calculations in future substantive trials.</p>

Outcomes were assessed at baseline (prerandomisation), 8 week and 20 week follow-up.</p>

                <p>Male and female adults, &gt;18 years old, with stable CHF, documented by echocardiography of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;40%) were eligible for the study. All participants had NYHA functional class III–IV symptoms as judged by an experienced heart failure cardiologist. Participants were required to be medically stable, defined as the absence of hospital admission or alterations in medical therapy within the preceding 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria for safety and practical reasons were: (1) presence of implantable cardiac devices, (2) serious cardiac arrhythmias,(3) neurological disorders or previous stroke significant enough to limit exercise, (4) orthopaedic problems that prevented walking, (5) neuromuscular disease, (6) dementia or (7) a mid-thigh circumference of &gt;50 cm (due to the size of the LF-EMS straps).</p>

                <p>The LF-EMS equipment (Biomedical Research Limited, Galway, Ireland) consisted of a pair of neoprene straps containing built-in adhesive gel electrodes. The equipment is Conformite Europeene(CE)marked under the European Medical Device Directive. The stimulator current waveform was designed to produce rhythmical contractions in the leg muscle groups occurring at a pulse frequency of 4–5 Hz (pulse width: 620 µs). The maximum peak output pulse current used was 140 mA.</p>

                <p>Participants used the LF-EMS or sham placebo for 1 hour, five times a week, for eight consecutive weeks. Of the five hourly sessions per week, four were completed unsupervised in the participant’s own home. The remaining session was conducted in a cardiac rehabilitation outpatient setting under the supervision of an exercise physiologist. The LF-EMS technology was retrospectively interrogated (ie, at the weekly supervised sessions) to report date, frequency, duration and stimulation intensity.</p>

                <p>In the sham arm of the study, participants were provided with identical straps and electrodes. In contrast to the LF-EMS group, the controller was programmed to deliver a very low level of stimulation (frequency: 99 Hz, pulse width: 150 µs, maximum current amplitude: 7.3 mA). This provided sensory input to the skin surface but little or no muscle activation. Participants in the sham group had the same induction, supervision and follow-up as the intervention arm.</p>

                  <p>Twelve of the 60 participants (4 LF-EMS, eight sham) (20%) withdrew and did not finish the intervention period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Of these, only three found the intervention intolerable (one LF-EMS, two sham). Other reasons for dropout were: deterioration in health (n=6), family problems (n=2) and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (n=1). Only 22 (45%) of those completing the intervention period returned for follow-up testing at 20 weeks. Reasons for non-follow-up were: deterioration in health (n=9), excluded due to implantation of cardiac resynchronisation therapy device (n=2), declined to take part without further explanation (n=13) and could not be contacted after repeated attempts (n=3).</p>

Interrogation of the LF-EMS controllers revealed that participants in the LF-EMS group became more tolerant to the intervention; mean stimulation intensity increased from 57.79 mA (95% CI 51.16 to 64.42) during week 1 of the study to 84.86 mA (95% CI 75.44 to 94.28) by week 8, an improvement of 46.5%.</p>

                  <p>The sham placebo for the study appeared to be convincing as only 61% of participants guessed their treatment group correctly. The 95% CI for the proportion of participants guessing correctly was (46% to 74%)%) and thus not significantly different from 50% which would be expected by chance. Furthermore, participants demonstrated an inclination to guess that they were randomised to LF-EMS regardless of group allocation.</p>

              <p>The predetermined criteria for proceeding to a larger trial were achieved for dropout (20%), adherence (68.3%) and sham placebo efficacy (61.53% participants guessed correctly). However, only 35.06% of eligible patients were recruited, below the target of 40%. Initial outcome measures revealed no significant difference between intervention and placebo groups, although there was a non-significant improvement in 6MWD and quality of life after LF-EMS.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment</title>
                  <p>Percentage uptake (35.06%) of eligible patients in the study was below the predetermined criteria of 40%. This is similar to the poor uptake of conventional cardiac rehabilitation (CR) nationally in the UK: &lt;40% of eligible patients with heart failure accessed CR in the most recent National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

                  <title>Retention/adherence/tolerance</title>
                  <p>One strength of this study is the good level of adherence (68.3%) and retention (80%) compared with other clinical studies; In the Heart  Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes in Exercise training (HF-ACTION) trial,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> only 40% of patients in the exercise group (n=1159) reported adherence to recommended training volumes after 3 months. This may have been because of the ease of independent use at home of LF-EMS, in combination with the weekly supervised sessions with an exercise physiologist. The patients recruited in the present trial were more debilitated yet they engaged more with LF-EMS than those in the HF-ACTION trial,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> suggesting that LF-EMS maybe more acceptable to this population than conventional exercise.</p>
                  <p>The dropout at 3 months follow-up was lower than expected due to ill health, device implantation and apathy, and would be challenging to overcome in a larger trial. Strategies to combat dropout could include combining assessment with clinical patient appointments to ensure compliance or arranging home visits for some assessments.</p>
                  <p>Feedback from the acceptability questionnaires may also be useful in curtailing dropout in a larger trial: the LF-EMS group generally thought that wearing the straps for an hour was ‘medium’ to ‘quite hard/unpleasant’. Continued use of a LF-EMS was deemed challenging also so it is possible that a reduced frequency of LF-EMS while still maintaining a sufficient dose, for example, 3×1 hour a week may enhance long-term adherence.</p>
                  <p>Tolerance to the LF-EMS intervention improved during the study. Mean current intensity increased by 46% from week 1 to 8. This tolerance effect is in keeping with an earlier study by Crognale <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> that showed a 20% increase in healthy active adults. The active adults tolerated higher absolute stimulation levels than in this study, both before and after habituation, suggesting that patients with advanced CHF are subjectively less tolerant to LF-EMS than a healthy population. In addition, the user feedback collected seems to support this view. Vivodtzev and colleagues<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> examined factors determining tolerance of EMS in patients with pulmonary disease. The study reported that lower tolerance to EMS was associated with greater severity of condition, fat free mass and inflammatory response. It is possible that the same is true in the CHF population but more research is needed to confirm this.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p>Baseline 6MWD was higher in our study sample than in other advanced heart failure studies.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This may have been due to high variability because of a few outliers in each group. This reflects the subjective nature of the NYHA classification system. However, signs and symptoms of advanced heart failure were primarily the eligibility criteria for this study and not 6MWD. In addition, the ≤300 m distance cut-off (below which our baseline mean falls) is often cited, as prognostically important and reflective of advanced disease in many investigations.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref> The non-significant improvements in exercise capacity as measured by 6 min walk were smaller than those in a meta-analysis of EMS in patients with heart failure by Smart et al.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These authors reported a combined improvement in 6MWD of 46.9 m versus usual care or placebo, compared with the effect size of 13.2 m in this study. However, patients in this study were more symptomatic than those included in the meta-analysis,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and thus had a lower baseline exercise capacity (286 m vs 342 m). Nevertheless, the mean relative increase (5%) in walk distance of participants in the LF-EMS group is within the measurement error associated with this test<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and probably should not be considered clinically significant.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The extrapolation from these results that patients with severe CHF are beyond help from EMS maybe premature; a longer training period maybe required to show meaningful changes in exercise capacity, particularly as some participants took longer to tolerate meaningful EMS intensities than others.</p>
                <p>Quality of life (MLHFQ) improved in both groups after the intervention. This may, in part, relate to the psychosocial benefits of engaging with researchers regularly in the cardiac rehabilitation facility.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The placebo effect of both interventions and its influence on patients’ perception of well-being should not be underestimated.</p>
                <p>Based on previous research by Banerjee <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> and numerous high-frequency EMS studies,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 35 36</xref> improvement in leg strength after use of LF-EMS was expected. The current trial however showed no significant change in muscle strength. Muscle wasting, prevalent in many patients with advanced heart failure,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> could explain this observation. The chronic impairment of muscle tissue caused by heart failure affects the muscle and skin nerve receptors and hence contractility of the weakened muscle.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Participants with more functional leg muscles therefore may have received greater stimulus to muscle tissue that others did for the same level of current intensity. This suggests that LF-EMS may not be effective for all patients with advanced CHF.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The sample for this study was small as is recommended for feasibility studies<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and this limits the external validity of our findings. Participants were deemed eligible for the study based on the judgement of experienced heart failure clinicians using available knowledge. This may have led to greater variability in disease severity/limitation than was intended. The current amplitude (mA) stimulus intensity that participants chose to use was a limitation to the study design. Participants were instructed to adhere to the ‘maximum tolerable intensity’ during LF-EMS sessions. Due to considerable individual differences in the subjective perception of discomfort associated with EMS, it is therefore likely that there was variability in the intensity that individuals received.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>As some of the predetermined feasibility criteria were met in this trial, a larger study into the effects of LF-EMS on patients with advanced heart failure could be undertaken. However, this ‘difficult to engage with’ patient group would be very challenging to recruit and follow-up in sufficient numbers to provide definitive data on its efficacy. The improvements seen in this study in 6MWD, and quality of life measures, were not statistically significant. Leg strength and physical activity levels showed no significant change. An intervention period &gt;8 weeks could be considered to give participants more time to adjust to the intervention. More investigation is required to determine which patients with CHF are unresponsive to LF-EMS due to severe muscle dysfunction.</p>
              <p>A larger trial may be feasible with this difficult population: however, it is unlikely that the non-significant improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life found in this pilot study justifies a larger pragmatic trial.</p>
