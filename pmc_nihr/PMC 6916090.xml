                  <p id="Par1">We tested the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a complex therapy intervention which aimed to promote activity and independence for people with early dementia (PrAISED). Feasibility questions were on: recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery, adherence and withdrawals, level of supervision required, adverse events, data collection and sample size assumptions.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We conducted a three-arm, multi-site, single-blind, randomised controlled feasibility trial. Eligibility criteria were aged 65 years or older, diagnosed mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment, able to walk without human help, and communicate in English, no co-morbidities that prevented participation in cognitive assessment and capacity to give consent. Participants were recruited from Memory Assessment Service clinics and the ‘Join Dementia Research’ register.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Patient participants were randomised 1:1:1 to a high intensity supervision PrAISED intervention, moderate intensity supervision PrAISED intervention or brief falls prevention assessment and advice (control). The PrAISED intervention aimed for participants to complete three hours of PrAISED exercises a week for 12 months. It included individualised activity and exercise plans and supervised exercises with regular re-assessment and progression, and was delivered by occupational therapists, physiotherapists and rehabilitation support workers. Primary efficacy outcome was the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), measured after 12 months. Secondary outcomes included physical activity, quality of life, mood, cognition, strength, balance, rate of falls, frailty and carer strain. Falls and activity were ascertained by monthly diary.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Between September 2016 and March 2017 we recruited 60 patient participants and 54 carer participants from two sites. Forty-nine patient participants completed a follow-up interview. Feasibility outcomes were mostly satisfactory, including recruitment and retention, intervention delivery and data completeness for most scales used. We could not maintain blinding of researchers at follow-up and experienced difficulties collecting data using some questionnaires and devices. Participants only completed a mean 77 (moderate supervision) and 71 (high supervision) minutes per week of PrAISED exercises over 12 months. We recorded 19 adverse events, none serious and related to the intervention.</p>

                  <p id="Par5">We conclude that with some adjustments to the trial protocol, it is feasible to deliver the PrAISED intervention and conduct a trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par34">Dementia comprises a group of progressive neurological diseases that affect memory and other cognitive functions, and which are severe enough to restrict daily function. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a potential precursor state, with measurable cognitive deficits, but preserved functional ability, which progresses to dementia in over half of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Neuropsychological deficits and falls risks are similar in people living with both diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Remaining independent is a priority for people living with dementia and their carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) deteriorates as the disease progresses. This is partly due to worsening cognitive impairment, including memory, apraxia, agnosia and executive function, but other aspects also contribute, including deconditioning, co-morbidities or injuries, failure to compensate or adapt to cognitive loss, and over-protectiveness or restriction of opportunity by carers, often in the name of safety. People living with dementia are especially prone to falls, physical illness, delirium, other crises and deterioration whilst in hospital.</p>
              <p id="Par35">A multi-disciplinary rehabilitation approach can address some of the problems. Physiotherapy aims to support activity through increases in strength and balance, improving gait, fitness, and confidence and reducing the risk of falls. Occupational therapy can support independence through cognitive rehabilitation and risk enablement approaches. Health psychology can support the individual to make changes to their daily life to become more active by linking these desired changes to basic psychological needs, and addressing barriers.</p>
              <p id="Par36">A Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] reported evidence that exercise programs for people with dementia improved ADL, but the quality of evidence was rated as poor. High intensity home-based exercise reduced rate of loss of ADLs and falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and functionally-directed home-based therapy can also increase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although this has not been replicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many other trials of simple interventions in dementia have failed to improve outcomes; for example, a moderate intensity group exercise programme failed to improve cognition or ADL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The optimum ‘dose’ of exercise required to improve ADLs in people with dementia is not clear; most studies aimed for one hour of exercise three times a week for 24 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which is similar to the amount of exercise required to reduce risk of falls. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend that people aged 65 years and older with poor mobility should do balance challenging exercise on 3 or more days a week and muscle strengthening activities on two more days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Inconsistency in trial results may be due to variable or low intervention adherence, ranging from 16 to 100% in a review [unpublished observation from Di Lorito, C. Bosco, A. Booth, V. Goldberg, S.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par40">Patient participants were identified by clinicians working in Memory Assessment Services and referred to the research team if interested, or by researchers through the Join Dementia Research Register. We included patient participants who were age 65 years or over and had diagnosed mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 15–25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 18–26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination III (ACEIII) 60–94 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], depending on what assessments clinics used). Patient participants had to be able to walk without human assistance and communicate in English, have no co-morbidities that prevented participation in cognitive assessment and capacity to give informed consent (formally assessed by a researcher). A family member or informal carer of the patient participant who could communicate in English was recruited, if willing. Written consent was taken from both patient and carer participants. We chose to study people with mild impairments as our intervention was designed to prevent or slow decline amongst those still well enough to engage and learn new lifestyle activities.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Researchers and NIHR Clinical Research Network clinical support officers (CSO) recruiting patient participants and collecting data had two days training in study procedures. Two researchers or CSOs visited the patient and carer participants in their own home to complete a screening questionnaire, discuss the study and take written informed consent. The commitment needed to complete the study (if randomised to one of the active arms) was emphasised to avoid later withdrawals. Baseline data were collected from the patient and carer participant. Some patient participant data were collected from the carer participant to reduce burden. Visits with two researchers or CSOs allowed the patient and carer participants to be interviewed concurrently in different rooms, reducing the overall time of the interview and allowing the participants to respond freely.</p>
                <p id="Par42">To describe the patient participants, we collected demographic data, past medical history, medications, and falls risk factors from the carer participant and measured cognition by completing a standardised mini mental state examination (sMMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with the patient participant.</p>

                <title>The intervention</title>
                <p id="Par43">We tested two versions of the PrAISED intervention, which differed in the amount of professional supervision offered. Both versions aimed for the patient participant to complete three hours of PrAISED exercises each week for the 12 month intervention period. Both versions included assessment, creation of an individualised tailored exercise and activity plan, supervised exercises and activity, and regular reassessments and progression. Patient participants in the high intensity supervision group received up to 50 visits from a therapist or rehabilitation support worker (RSW) over a period of one year. Patient participants in the moderate intensity supervision group received 9 visits from a therapist (or two therapists for initial assessment visits) and three phone calls over a three month period, and encouragement to continue the programme after professional supervision ceased.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The PrAISED physical exercises included balance challenging, strength building, dual-task training and gait re-education. Some exercises could be gained through functional strategies which aimed to maintain or improve independence. Patient participants in the high intensity supervision group received visits that were tapered over the year, starting at twice weekly for three months, then weekly for three months, bi-monthly for three months and monthly for the last three months. Patient participants in the moderate intensity supervision group received tapered visits in the first three months of the twelve month intervention period. The supervision regimens were based on precedents from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both interventions included motivational strategies to encourage adherence to, and persistence with, the planned exercises and activities. Participants were encouraged to continue their exercise and activities beyond the supervised period and were provided information on appropriate community exercise groups in their area. Therapists and RSWs delivering the intervention received three days training prior to the start of the study and 2 days training during the intervention delivery period. The control group had a single falls prevention assessment and advice with one to two follow-up visits by a therapist if indicated. Standard care controls are common practice in activity and exercise interventions for people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par78">We tested the feasibility of evaluating a programme of therapeutic exercise and activity for people with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment delivered over one year, with moderate and high levels of professional supervision. All criteria for progression to the fully powered main trial were met. We recruited appropriate participants at a sufficient rate, delivery of and adherence to the intervention, and retention in the study were satisfactory. Randomisation and data management systems worked well. There were no unexpected or adverse consequences of the intervention. Completion rates for baseline and outcome data were satisfactory for most but not all measures used, but required a carer as a reliable informant and blinding of researchers proved unfeasible. Asking the carer participant to complete some patient participant scales reduced burden on the patient participant. The intervention was feasible and safe to deliver. We found our sample size estimates for the main trial to be reasonable.</p>

However, mean activity per week was only 72 min of PrAISED exercises a week, falling considerably short of the required ‘dose’ of 180 min and WHO recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therapist training has been changed for the main trial with a greater focus on motivation and adherence. Our attrition rate of 18% was acceptable compared to similar studies (23% for FiNALEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; 9% for Wesson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]).</p>

                <title>Supervision intensity required to enable engagement</title>
                <p id="Par81">The standardised effect size estimates for the primary and some intermediate outcome measures (whilst difficult to interpret due to small sample size) suggest the intervention, delivered with a high level of supervision, could feasibly show a positive effect at 12 month outcomes in a fully powered comparison (in other words, the intervention is not shown to be futile). The PrAISED intervention required patient participants to complete 3 h of PrAISED exercises a week for 12 months, but differed according to the amount of professional contact they received. Of the two intervention groups, the greater effect size was seen with the high intensity supervision group. Measured adherence was not different between these groups, but these data are difficult to collect, not least because the difference between an ‘exercise’ and an ‘activity’ can be difficult to determine, and therapists reported that some participants chose to do ‘activities’ over ‘exercises’ as time went by. Care may be enhanced in the therapy arms through the interactions between participant and therapist (such as if the therapist referred the patient participant to services for a problem not related to the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). We cannot be sure whether it was the ‘social’ contact or the therapy programme that changed outcomes, however, in complex intervention trials all elements are typically considered together. It was not feasibly to have a sham control and it is common practice to have a ‘usual care’ control arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] for activity and exercise interventions for this patient group. Our research suggests participants are less likely to do the exercise without human contact (through supervision or support from carers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>

Issues of bias in outcome data collection need to be addressed through specific anti research bias training, which we have put in place for the main trial.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Many people with dementia live alone in the community and some do not have any family carers. We wanted to be inclusive in our recruitment, but found we could not complete primary outcome data with this policy and will restrict our inclusion criteria for the main trial to those with a carer willing to take part.</p>
                <p id="Par84">The DAD as a primary outcome measure has been used before in similar trials; is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and was well completed when a carer was available. However, the DAD did show a ceiling effect at baseline and outcome; potentially reducing the chances of demonstrating effectiveness. Better ADL outcome measures for people with early dementia are needed. Measurement of physical activity using accelerometers was inaccurate due to technical difficulties, which were resolved during the feasibility trial and which has informed researcher training. We selected the best performing accelerometer for the main trial (Misfit Shine 2). Carer participants found the IPAQ difficult to complete and we have changed it to the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam physical activity questionnaire for the main trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An independent CTU managed the data and undertook statistical analysis blind to intervention group. Some scales had high levels of missing data resulting in some being dropped or changed and instructions on completion being clarified for the planned main trial.</p>

In a trial where one group has considerably more contact than the other, there is the problem of differential reporting of adverse events, and comparing rates of adverse events in different groups is impossible to interpret. We have embedded safety parameter variables (mortality, hospitalisation, falls, injury) in the outcome dataset, which is collected independently of contact with therapists delivering the clinical intervention.
