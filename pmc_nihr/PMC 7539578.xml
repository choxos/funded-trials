                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is a cause of significant respiratory morbidity in childhood and beyond. Coupled with lung immaturity, infections (especially by <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp) are implicated in the pathogenesis of CLD through promotion of pulmonary inflammation. Azithromycin, which is a highly effective against <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp also has potent anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, azithromycin therapy may improve respiratory outcomes by targeting infective and inflammatory pathways. Previous trials using macrolides have not been sufficiently powered to definitively assess CLD rates. To address this, the azithromycin therapy for chronic lung disease of prematurity (AZTEC) trial aims to determine if a 10-day early course of intravenous azithromycin improves rates of survival without CLD when compared with placebo with an appropriately powered study.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>796 infants born at less than 30 weeks’ gestational age who require at least 2 hours of continuous respiratory support within the first 72 hours following birth are being enrolled by neonatal units in the UK. They are being randomised to receive a double-blind, once daily dose of intravenous azithromycin (20 mg/kg for 3 days, followed by 10 mg/kg for a further 7 days), or placebo. CLD is being assessed at 36 weeks’ PMA. Whether colonisation with <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp prior to randomisation modifies the treatment effect of azithromycin compared with placebo will also be investigated. Secondary outcomes include necrotising enterocolitis, intraventricular/cerebral haemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity and nosocomial infections, development of antibiotic resistance and adverse reactions will be monitored.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD), also known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is a major cause of neonatal death in infants born prematurely. It is clear that survivors of CLD have adverse respiratory outcomes in childhood and beyond.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref></p>
              <p>Despite the advances in neonatal care, rates of CLD have not markedly changed. This is largely because of the survival of the most immature infants born at the limits viability (22 to 23 weeks’ gestation), which means that the proportion of preterm infants born at 28 weeks or less of gestation has increased over the last 30 years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consequently, the etiological definition of CLD was modified to represent the structural immaturity of the lungs which are in the canalicular/saccular stages of development.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The pathophysiology is complex and results from continual lung injury caused by inflammatory processes coupled with repair/remodelling and resultant fibrosis.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In contrast, the historical picture of CLD was largely characterised by parenchymal tissue damage caused by volutrauma, barotrauma and by high levels of oxygen required to sustain life.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Infections, both antenatal (eg, chorioamnionitis) and nosocomial, contribute to a cytokine-mediated inflammatory cascade which peaks between 7 to 10 days of life.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
<italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp (class Mollicutes) are the smallest free living organisms and have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of CLD.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These commensal bacteria form part of the normal vaginal bacteria microbiota, and thus are readily transmitted to the uterus via the cervix or acquired during vaginal delivery. Lacking a cell wall, they are readily transferred to the lung where they colonise the respiratory mucosa and directly or, in conjunction with aforementioned iatrogenic factors, indirectly promote inflammation largely through recruitment of neutrophils to the lung. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp colonisation was strongly associated with diagnosis of CLD at 36 weeks’ post-menstrual age (PMA; OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.42 to 3.47) which was largely independent of gestational age when investigated with meta-regression.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Current treatments for the prevention of CLD are largely supportive and include optimising use of early non-invasive respiratory support and preventing infections. Use of systemic corticosteroids is considered in cases where the infant is unable to be weaned from invasive ventilation. However, although early low-dose regimens may be beneficial in a high-risk subpopulation, it is well-established that higher doses of corticosteroids are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cerebral palsy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Due to the potential risks associated with use of corticosteroids, other treatments, or ideally preventive strategies, with improved safety profiles are urgently required for CLD. An interest in macrolide antibiotics, and the potential for improving lung outcomes via eradication of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic>, was established in the 1990s. However, early trials of erythromycin were underpowered and did not reduce the incidence or severity of CLD.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A study trialling clarithromycin treatment for 10 days reported a reduction in CLD (2.9% vs 36%) when compared with placebo but importantly only initiated delayed randomised therapy if the infant was culture-positive for <italic>Ureaplasma</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> More contemporary data exists with azithromycin, which is an important adjunct therapy for numerous respiratory conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Consistent with other macrolides, azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through blinding to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Moreover, azithromycin is attractive as it also uniquely exhibits well-characterised immunomodulatory effects through suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB, decreasing neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation by limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, since azithromycin is concentrated in leukocytes, it may be actively transported and released at the site of infection.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>Several proof of concept and dose-finding studies have already been completed. The meta-analysis by Nair and colleagues showed that azithromycin treatment is associated with a 14% reduction in the combined outcome of CLD/death when compared with placebo.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Dose-finding work in respect of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp eradication has been undertaken in a series of studies by Viscardi and colleagues.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> Importantly, all previous studies did not note any serious adverse reactions to azithromycin and add to the existing safety information.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Antimicrobial resistance among <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> remains low.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>Given the Nair meta-analyses and lack of adequately powered studies, and given the reported association of presence of pulmonary inflammation and <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> with development of CLD, there is a compelling case for a definitive, adequately powered study to investigate the effectiveness of azithromycin on reducing rates of CLD in preterm infants. The azithromycin therapy for chronic lung disease of prematurity (AZTEC) trial is determining if a 10-day course of intravenous azithromycin improves rates of survival without CLD at 36 weeks’ PMA when compared with placebo.</p>

                  <p>Site selection is based on receipt of an expression of interest via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) networks and personal contact directly with UK Level III neonatal units. A registration questionnaire captures key information about the site, trial team and any concerns around delivery of the protocol in the context of routine practice. Where feasible, a preliminary visit is made by the Trial Manager to present the study background and protocol. The Trial Management Group approved the centres selected to participate.</p>
                  <p>Formal initiation visits are held at each site to train the local trial team in trial-specific procedures. This is supplemented with comprehensive guidance documents for discrete elements of the study. Specific training in preparation and administration of the IMP is cascaded down by delegated members of the local study team to cot-side nurses; this includes a video produced by JL with support from neonatal nurses and the medical illustration department at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youtu.be/Xto6n5qFuYQ">https://youtu.be/Xto6n5qFuYQ</ext-link>). The local clinical trials pharmacy team are also provided with trial-specific training in IMP storage, accountability and reconciliation procedures during the initiation process. All local study teams have undertaken Good Clinical Practice training commensurate with their roles and responsibilities.</p>

                  <p>Randomisation to the intervention is performed following confirmation of eligibility and completion of the informed consent process. The randomisation list prepared by an independent CTR statistician uses a 1:1 allocation ratio with fixed block length. Allocation to azithromycin or placebo is blinded such that the allocation will not be known to clinicians, the baby’s family or the trial outcome assessors. The list is uploaded to a validated, user-tested, web-based system (Sortition, Oxford University Innovation Ltd). Randomisation is performed by a member of the local study team using a unique username and password. The system performs treatment allocation by issuing a random four-digit IMP pack ID (matching the IMP supplied to each site), and also a participant ID in a standardised format. A member of the site study team retrieves the appropriate pack of IMP from the storage location and ensures this is appropriately prescribed on the infant’s prescription chart. Unblinding, if required, may also be performed by the site PI (or designee) using the web-based system.</p>

These procedures are timed to mirror standard care to minimise disturbing trial infants, where possible. Endotracheal aspirates are obtained if the infant is intubated, and nasopharyngeal aspirates are collected if they are not.

                  <p>Relevant interventional studies to prevent development of CLD as an outcome (including studies using macrolides) in preterm infants were reviewed. In general, national and international studies consistently show rates of survival without CLD of 50% to 60% (those with lower rates are due to highly selected groups of sicker participants) for studies with similar inclusion criteria to AZTEC. Thus, adopting a conservative approach using 50% survival without developing CLD is reasonable. Similarly, the absolute differences in effect size ranges from 10% to 20% in most studies. The study is powered to an improvement of 12% (50% to 62%) in survival without CLD with a power of 0.90 and significance level of 5% requiring recruitment of 796 subjects which is highly feasible as shown by several similar UK studies in this population. Since the primary outcome will involve formal assessment with an oxygen challenge test in both tertiary units and in step-down units, a dropout rate of 10% has been estimated.</p>

                  <p>We are conducting an internal pilot involving the first five sites to be activated, and for a period of 12 months (9 months of recruitment and 3 months of follow-up). A pilot report will be produced detailing information on recruitment rate, consent rates, treatment compliance and primary outcome completeness. The report will be presented to the funder and the AZTEC independent committees to help inform any adaptations necessary to facilitate moving forward with the main trial. No formal interim analysis is planned.</p>
                  <p>The trial will be analysed and reported using the ‘Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials’ (CONSORT)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 guidelines.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> A separate and full statistical analysis plan has been developed prior to database lock. The analysis plan will be reviewed by the AZTEC independent committees.</p>
                  <p>The principle of intention-to-treat will be applied as far as practically possible, including all participants in the primary analysis in the group to which they were randomly allocated. All analyses will use a 5% level of statistical significance and 95% CI will be presented throughout. The primary outcome will be analysed using multilevel logistic regression, within a multiple imputation framework. The analysis will adjust for covariates balanced at randomisation and account for clustering of both multiple births and participants within centres. The imputation model will use the treatment arm and gestational age variables, as well as whether or not the participant was transferred from their recruiting site prior to the primary outcome assessment. Furthermore, a series of sensitivity analyses, within the multiple imputation framework, will be used to assess the robustness of conclusions.</p>
                  <p>The presence of multiple births within the same pregnancy will be explored by including this as an additional level in the model, and this will be used as the primary analytical approach should the model converge. Dichotomous secondary outcomes will be analysed using the same approach. Number of days of respiratory support will be analysed as a time to event outcome allowing for competing risk of death. These models will also attempt to account for any clustering effects of multiple births within the same mother. Statistical tests will not be used on safety and tolerability outcomes. These outcomes will use descriptive statistics only.</p>
                  <p>To explore the extent to which there may be a differential treatment effect by presence of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp, the model fitted for the primary analysis will be extended by including a main and treatment group interaction term for <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp colonisation at baseline. Since patterns of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> colonisation may vary,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 32</xref> the approach to this analysis may be modified in respect of emerging trends identified the placebo group samples. The final analytical approach will be agreed prior to database lock. Estimates from the statistical models (main effects and interaction terms) will be presented alongside 95% CI and p values.</p>
                  <p>There are no formal stopping rules but the safety data will be regularly reviewed by the Trial Management Group, and at least annually by the independent Data Monitoring Committee.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>As the survival of preterm infants increases, decreasing morbidity associated with prematurity, including CLD, is becoming increasingly important. AZTEC is an example of evaluating drug development<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in infants as a large, pragmatic and adequately powered trial of a macrolide antibiotic to prevent development of CLD with widespread support by the neonatal community.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> The importance of improving outcomes for preterm infants at risk of developing CLD is highlighted by the potential impacts on later pulmonary function, especially the prospect of early decline in lung function and early-onset COPD.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Moreover, the evidence base to treat graduates of the neonatal unit when they present with symptoms in childhood is poor,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> largely because the mechanisms of prematurity-associated respiratory morbidity remain poorly understood.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p>
              <p>Whether modification of pulmonary inflammation and treatment of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> infection would reduce rates of CLD has been debated for three decades. Use of postnatal corticosteroids is associated with long-term adverse effects; however, the safety profile of azithromycin is superior and is unlikely to affect neurological outcomes. Plans to follow-up neurodevelopment and respiratory outcomes at 1 and 2 years of age are in place. This study includes ascertainment of whether each infant is colonised with <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp and randomisation of treatment to azithromycin or placebo. Given the time lag between randomisation and the results of tests for <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> spp, the randomisation will not be balanced for <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> status. Nevertheless, this study design will allow an assessment of the causative role of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> in the development of CLD.</p>
              <p>If effectiveness of azithromycin therapy is demonstrated, integration into standard care would be relatively straightforward since the majority of candidates for treatment would have intravenous access for 7 to 10 days. Establishing whether azithromycin alters antibiotic resistance patterns will provide important information to the clinician who may have concerns around adding an adjunct treatment to a wide array of antimicrobials already given to this vulnerable group of patients. Although AZTEC will not specifically address mechanistic actions of azithromycin, including its effect on the lung and gut microbiota, samples will be banked to permit such work in the near future using established<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and novel methodologies such as metagenomics.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p>
              <p>In summary, the AZTEC trial is addressing an important therapeutic need in an area where treatment based on high-quality evidence is severely lacking. Should antimicrobial resistance not be affected, azithromycin therapy should be appealing to clinicians due to the anti-inflammatory properties and proven ability to eradicate <italic>Ureaplasma</italic>. Treatment may yield fewer intensive care days and fewer discharges on home oxygen, resulting in considerable reduction in costs to the National Health Service (NHS), as well as decreasing the significant burden on parents. On the other hand, should the treatment not be clinically effective, the neonatal research community can turn their attention to alternative options for combating CLD. Identification of an effective treatment to prevent CLD would be of exceptional value to the NHS, infants and their families.</p>
