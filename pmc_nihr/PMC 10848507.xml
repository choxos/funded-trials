                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Urgent dental care may be the only place where many people, especially vulnerable groups, access care. This presents an opportunity for delivery of a behavioural intervention promoting planned dental visiting, which may help address one of the factors contributing to a socio-economic gradient in oral health. Although we know that cueing events such as having a cancer diagnosis may create a ‘teachable moment’ stimulating positive changes in health behaviour, we do not know whether delivering an opportunistic intervention in urgent dental care is feasible and acceptable to patients.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The feasibility study aimed to recruit 60 patients in a Dental Hospital and dental practices delivering urgent care within and outside working hours. Follow-up was by telephone, e mail and post over 4 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Although the recruitment window was shortened because of COVID-19, of 47 patients assessed for eligibility, 28 were enrolled (70.1% of screened patients provided consent). A relatively high proportion were from disadvantaged backgrounds (46.4%, 13/28 receiving State benefits). Retention was 82.1% (23/28), which was also the rate of completion of the Oral Health Impact Profile co-primary outcome. The other primary outcome involved linking participant details at recruitment, with centrally-held data on services provided, with 84.6% (22/26) records partly or fully successfully matched. All intervention participants received at least some of the intervention, although we identified aspects of dental nurse training which would improve intervention fidelity.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Despite recruitment being impacted by the pandemic, when the majority of clinical trials experienced reduced rates of recruitment, we found a high recruitment and consenting rate, even though patients were approached opportunistically to be enrolled in the trial and potentially receive an intervention. Retention rates were also high even though a relatively high proportion had a low socio-economic background. Therefore, even though patients may be in pain, and had not anticipated involvement before their urgent care visit, the study indicated that this was a feasible and acceptable setting in which to position an opportunistic intervention. This has the potential to harness the potential of the ‘teachable moment’ in people’s lives, and provide support to help address health inequalities.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Socio-economic inequalities are an important policy concern because of the principle of distributive justice which is concerned about treating equals equally and giving all people their due [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, we find a pattern that is repeated globally: as socio-economic advantage decreases, so does people’s use of dental services, as does their oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While the relative contribution of lifestyle and service-related factors to inequalities in oral health can be debated, there is evidence that low social position is tied more strongly to measures of disease management (missing and untreated teeth) than to indicators of oral disease per se, leading to the conclusion that the use and nature of dental services received is key to how low social position translates into inequalities in oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">There are multi-faceted reasons for the social patterning of dental attendance which involve macro, meso and individual level factors operating together to create a dynamic ‘spider-less web of multiple intersections’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Examples of macro-level factors are governmental pricing policies for dental care including whether there is free or subsidised care for low-income groups, as well as general employment and welfare policies; whereas meso-level factors include factors such as the extent of close neighbourhood social ties, how many dental services there are in the local area, and what the transport system is like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These interact with individual level factors such as self-efficacy (how able some-one feels that they can use dental services), dental anxiety, and a range of other psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, this presents us with a bewildering range of possible intervention points. The resultant complexity of the area may explain why reports of interventions addressing inequalities in the use of planned dental care are so few, and at odds with the global nature of the problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Krieger’s advice, however, is to start by tackling factors most amenable to ‘practical intervention’ and nearest to outcomes of the pathways involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For dental visiting, this means that a promising place to start would be positioning an intervention where people have turned to urgent dental care because of problems, and addressing some of the socio-psychological factors which shape individuals’ motivation and intentions to do with taking up planned care. This means that the intervention involved did not address provider or service-related reasons why individuals do not attend for planned care, which were out with its scope, while still important issues in themselves.</p>
              <p id="Par8">‘Teachable moments’ are “cueing events”: i.e. naturally occurring health events or circumstances that lead individuals to make health behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The experience of dental problems forcing the individual to visit a dental service may act in the same way as cueing events such as a cancer diagnosis on smoking cessation behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], although we do not know whether both the setting or people’s experience of pain or other problems at the time of intervention delivery means that this is not the right moment for other reasons. A behavioural intervention to be delivered in urgent dental care settings was developed in conjunction with extensive public and patient involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and so this feasibility study was undertaken to address key areas of uncertainty before a full randomised controlled trial was undertaken.</p>
              <p id="Par9">The feasibility trial had several primary objectives. Firstly, to investigate the likely rate of completeness of co-primary outcome data: attendance at an NHS dental practice as measured by routine data collected by NHS Business Services Authority (objective 1); and completeness of participant self-reports of oral health quality of life (objective 2). Also, to identify if recruitment of patients to the study and opportunistic delivery of the intervention when attending for urgent dental care would yield a reasonable recruitment rate (objective 3); and to explore the fidelity of the intervention as delivered by trained dental nurses in the urgent dental care setting (objective 4).</p>

Allocation to intervention (the RETURN behavioural intervention aimed at supporting planned dental visiting) and control (usual care per site) was 1:1. This was an open study since investigators involved in intervention delivery and participants were not blind to allocations. Participants were followed up for 4 months after randomisation.</p>

                <p id="Par33">Patients attending for urgent care who did not have their own dentist were classified as potentially eligible. They were approached on arrival by trained dental team (DT) members (dental nurses or other staff employed at the site) to screen for inclusion in the trial and prior to seeking consent, using questions routinely asked during usual care such as whether the patient had their own dentist and how long it had been since they had visited a dentist for a non-urgent appointment. Consent was then sought by trained staff (DT or research nurses) using a patient information sheet outlining risks and benefits of being involved in the study, and then a final study eligibility check was undertaken. Reasons for non-eligibility and non-consent were gathered using a paper-based screening log.</p>

Participants were shown a pack of resources which included 6 booklets outlining different barriers or reasons people often gave for not taking up planned dental care (‘I don’t have time’; ‘I don’t think to go when I’m not in pain; ‘I don’t have trust in dentists’; cost; embarrassment; anxiety). These 6 identified barriers were the result of a prior literature review and synthesis of theory as well as qualitative and public and patient engagement work testing how barriers to planned dental care were experienced within the context in which the intervention was to be applied (adults living in the city of Liverpool, England and the surrounding areas who attended urgent services for their dental care), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In a non-judgemental and listening conversation with trained dental nurses, participants identified which of these main reasons were why they did not make planned dental visits and watched an accompanying video clip of a few minutes where someone spoke about their experience about that barrier. Dental nurses then supported participants in setting a planned dental visiting goal and accompanying action plan. While participants might have felt more than one of the barriers were relevant to them, because of time, the discussion was focused on one main barrier identified, although participants were able to access material on other barriers with the whole pack given to them to take home after that visit. Participants also received a text a few days later which reminded them of the action plan they had set.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par35">A feasibility study asks whether the study can be done, whether it should proceed, and if so, whether there needs to be any changes before a bigger study measuring intervention effect is undertaken. Clear progression, or stop/go criteria are usually set a priori at the feasibility protocol stage which inform the decision as to whether a definitive study should follow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Progression criteria often take the form of traffic light ratings, where green (go) indicates that the criteria have been met and the trial should proceed, amber (amend) indicates that amendments should be made to the design before embarking on a larger trial, and red (stop) indicates that there needs to be careful consideration as to whether a main trial is advisable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Outcomes with pre-specified stop/go criteria used to judge whether to proceed with a definitive trial are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>
                <sec id="Sec9">
                  <title>Proposed primary outcome measures for the full trial (objectives 1 and 2)</title>
                  <p id="Par36">For the main trial co-primary outcomes had been identified: the first (attendance at a dental practice for a planned care appointment within 12 months) involved data routinely collected by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) which is an organisation responsible for collecting data on the activity undertaken by dentists with contracts to deliver dental care in NHS dental practice. Since data entered onto the NHSBSA system is linked to dentists’ payment, then a relatively complete dataset was expected, although this would be subject to a successful data linkage between participant details collected at recruitment with appropriate identifiers in NHSBSA data. Although follow-up in the main trial was planned for up to 18 months after recruitment, since the feasibility trial had a follow up period of 4 months, the feasibility study investigated the proportion of participants recruited who had been matched with records of the urgent care (baseline) visit. Since NHSBSA only holds records for NHS dental practice, participants recruited in LUHFT were excluded from those with expected matches. NHSBSA data also does not collect data where primary dental care is provided privately.</p>
                  <p id="Par37">The second co-primary outcome involved self-reported oral health quality of life as measured by the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (completeness taken as 12 or more questions answered), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and allowed outcome data to be collected from participants attending private dental services and secondary care, although this would be subject to non-response bias if follow-up attrition rates were high. Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) data was collected for all participants as part of baseline assessments, and in follow-up data collection which was undertaken firstly by telephone, and where a phone number was not supplied, via email. If an e mail address was not provided, or where there was no response by other means, a last resort of postal contact was used.</p>

In the case of the RETURN intervention trial, the anticipated an economic evaluation was to be limited to the patient rather than a societal perspective and be based on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire. The economic analysis would also require completion of an assessment of costs gathered by a health economics patient questionnaire, with data fields ranging from the number of healthcare contacts within the last eight weeks for teeth / mouth problems (at a variety of services), medications (prescription and non-prescription), travel expenses associated with teeth/mouth problems, days lost from work, earnings lost, payments and other expenses related to teeth/mouth problems. The feasibility study included collection of health economics data to assess whether participant burden was acceptable, although this did not feature as a primary outcome of the feasibility trial with progression criteria. Patient burden was assessed by noting the completeness of data at baseline and also by asking participants about burden during follow-up telephone calls.</p>

Seven patients did not consent because they did not want to take part in research; 2 said they were unable to concentrate at that time because of their pain, and 3 said they did not have enough time that day. If ineligible patients are excluded, consenting rate was 70.1% (29/41).</p>

                  <p id="Par57">Since 2 participants were recruited at LUHFT, with no matching records in the BSA system expected the number of participants included in this analysis was 26. Based on participant name, gender and date of birth, 22 matching participant records were retrieved. One further record did not have a treatment completion date matching the date of the baseline appointment, although a matched record was found which fell before randomisation and still during the study period. A matching rate of 84.6% (22/26) for fully or partially matched records, or 80.8% (21/26) fully matched was found. The following 4 records were excluded as successful matches: one which was linked to multiple records based on the participants’ identifier; and 3 records matching BSA identifiers but which were coded against non-urgent visits.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Progression criteria for the main trial were set as &gt; 90% successful linking of participant identifiers collected at randomisation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to centrally held data about visits to NHS dentists. This was based on national testing of the accuracy of the NHSBSA unique patient identifier system which reported an inaccuracy of unique patient identifiers to be &lt; 1% of a practice list (for example, because of misspelling the patient’s name) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Discussion with NHSBSA identified that the accuracy of matching would be improved in the main trial by using an additional identifier of postcode, and by checking the spelling of names and checking of dates of birth at each follow-up point.</p>

Ten (91%) selected and went through at least one barrier booklet with a nurse, selected and watched a barrier video and set a goal and made an action plan. One participant received a lot of urgent treatment just prior to intervention delivery and was in pain, so was only given the pack to take away on the day of recruitment. Only 5 (45%) participants observed however, had a listening, non-judgemental conversation with the nurse exploring how the patient felt about their identified barrier, which meant that further training was needed related to this aspect of intervention delivery before the main trial.</p>

The biggest factor influencing intervention delivery time was the extent the nurses engaged the participants in conversations around patients’ barriers, with the OH recruiting nurse generally using fewer probing questions. Observations also found nurse confidence was a further factor influencing exposure, with the IH recruiting nurse generally less confident in delivery, and not always guiding the participant towards the intervention material most in line with patients’ concerns. Taken together, intervention exposure was probably equivalent between sites, although this identified that some aspects of nurse training requiring strengthening before a main trial.</p>

Participant burden was explored in participants who completed follow-up by telephone. All participants contacted reported that they were happy with what was asked of them during their participation in the trial. When asked about the length of time the trial took at their urgent care appointment, just one intervention patient stated that it felt long, but acknowledged that this is not time they would have spent by themselves and so it was useful. One control patient mentioned that it felt long because they were in pain, but that they were still happy to take part. No patients reported the follow-up too burdensome, and all said they were happy to have taken part. When asked specifically about the questionnaires, all patients reported they were happy with the questions that had been asked of them, and that there were no questions that had felt inappropriate or that they did not want to answer.</p>

Unfortunately, their use is on the rise, especially among certain population groups such as 18-44-year olds and those with low income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

              <p id="Par73">Although an opportunistic intervention for patients seeking urgent care for dental problems had not been previously explored, we found that a relatively high proportion (70% of eligible patients), consented to participate in the trial. This was despite a high proportion being from a low income (46% on state benefits) and low educational (53% left school at 16 years) background, and other literature showing that participation in clinical trials tends to be disproportionately low in such groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Minority ethnic groups are also often found to be less likely to participate in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although 78.6% of trial participants had a White British ethnicity, this proportion was actually <italic>lower</italic> than the national census statistics for the proportion of White British people living in the Liverpool area (84%), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is despite feasibility inclusion criteria limiting participation to sufficient English language ability in order to understand materials and take part, which was introduced for cost and pragmatic reasons.</p>
              <p id="Par74">The feasibility study took place as pandemic storm clouds were gathering, which led to an early closure of the recruitment window, meaning that the full recruitment target was not reached. Recruitment rate was potentially impacted by COVID-19 related staff sickness and isolation, and diversion of staff resources and focus on the study at sites. Staff reported that numbers of people attending for urgent dental care had started to decline in late February/early March 2020 because of population efforts to limit anything other than essential travel and use of services. This appears to have been an impact of the pandemic seen elsewhere, with attendances at emergency dental services in Beijing, China reduced by 38% at the beginning of the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Moreover, there was pandemic disruption to non-COVID-related clinical trials generally. For example, less than 20% of Oncology trials in the United States and Europe continued to enrol patients at the same rate; partly because of the necessity to divert clinical staff to patient care, and the focus on COVID-related trials, and partly because of operational challenges related to limiting in-person visits to minimize potential viral exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. That we managed to achieve such a high accrual rate in such circumstances is indicative of the ability to achieve high recruitment rates in a full RCT under more usual circumstances.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Phase II studies are primarily designed to test the feasibility and acceptability of various methods before a larger definitive phase III RCT is undertaken. One aspect we explored was the feasibility of using routinely held NHSBSA data for a primary outcome, and the reliability of linking personal identifiers collected in the urgent dental care setting. Relatively few trials have made use of these data in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and although we experienced a relatively high matching rate, we identified that by adding postcode as an additional identifier, this could be further improved.</p>
              <p id="Par76">Dental nurses are key members of dental practice teams, and potentially positioned to be the most appropriate, effective and cost-efficient member of staff to deliver behaviour change conversations to patients. Previous trials involving DNs being trained to deliver theoretically informed behaviour change conversations have mostly involved young children as the participants concerned, with findings promising in terms of outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, other studies report that dental teams find behaviour change conversations difficult to initiate and are uncertain about acquiring sufficient skill through brief training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. While clinical guidelines identify that dental professionals have a role supporting patients to build their motivation to optimise oral health behaviours, and a range of training resources are available to facilitate this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], findings from our study indicate that in order for DNs to achieve the required level of competence and confidence to deliver behaviour change conversations effectively, the training required, including some personalised support and shadowing in dental practice, may be considerable – at least for some nurses. Thus, a research question arises, as to the cost-effectiveness and clinical effectiveness of changing dental professionals’ skills in supporting behaviour change as part of clinical practice and, in turn, patient health behaviours and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The type and intensity of the training required is be a key factor to consider in trials of this type.</p>
              <p id="Par77">Updated UK Medical Research Council guidance confirms the importance of feasibility studies as one of the four main phases in the design and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Guidance to standardise reporting of feasibility studies is also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which includes a reporting of progression criteria to determine how the results of a feasibility study should be interpreted. Setting these clearly in advance helps the process of identifying potential limitations in a future trial, and what sort of mitigation measures might helpfully strengthen it, although many previous feasibility studies have failed to include progression criteria in their protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Where there are several feasibility outcomes with associated progression criteria which form a matrix such as in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the overall decision as to whether or not to proceed is usually based on the relevant importance of each outcome to overall success (for example, adequate recruitment will be one of the most crucial factors, to ensure resources are not wasted by undertaking an inadequately powered main trial); and whether mitigating measures can be put in place to strengthen any identified weaknesses.</p>
              <p id="Par78">As the MRC complex intervention guidance points out, each phase in the evaluation of complex intervention is heavily context dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Questions should be asked at every point concerning how the intervention is interacting with its context, and what key uncertainties remain. Thus, when interpreting feasibility outcomes against progression criteria, there needs to be some discussion regarding context when concluding as to whether progression to a larger trial is advisable. Given that this feasibility study took place in a pandemic context, this is especially important. Attendance rates in urgent dental care, lockdown and staff sickness during the pandemic are all likely to have influenced recruitment rates. On the other hand, while the numbers recruited to the feasibility study (<italic>n</italic> = 28) fell into the red progression criteria category for outcome 3 (n = &lt; 40), this was within half of the recruitment window. This left us, after the feasibility study, with some uncertainty as to the rate of recruitment in a non-pandemic context, which presented an area of potential risk to a successful larger trial.</p>
              <p id="Par79">Internal pilot studies are a mechanism whereby main trials with an element of risk (e.g. where recruitment to time and target is uncertain), can proceed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The main trial goes ahead following a main trial protocol, but progress is assessed early on against pre-specified targets, and there is an agreement as to in what circumstances the study should be stopped, if further information indicates that the main trial is unlikely to reach its recruitment, retention or site set-up targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Unlike an external pilot, data collected during the internal pilot contribute towards the final trial. So, while this feasibility study suggested that progression of the RETURN intervention to a main trial was advisable, the use of an internal pilot to assess recruitment rates in a non-pandemic context reduces risk. The main trial protocol for the intervention is now published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and has progressed with the inclusion of an internal pilot milestone relating to recruitment rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Exclusion criteria to the main trial includes exclusion of people who had previously participated in the feasibility study reported here.</p>

                <p id="Par81">The RETURN Feasibility Study was approved by London-Bromley Research Ethics Committee (19/LO/1510). We confirm that there is no connection between the affiliated institutes involved in the conduct of this study and the ethics committee who granted ethical approvals. The ethics committee was not in the local area because applications for ethical approvals are allocated to committees considering applications for NHS approval right across the country in order to minimise the length of time between application and receipt of approval and this was the earliest opportunity. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in the trial, as well as the dental team members delivering the trial. We confirm that all participants involved in this study had an adequate understanding of written English to enable informed consent to be obtained. Inclusion criteria also limited the age of participants to adults, and therefore no minors were included in the study.</p>
