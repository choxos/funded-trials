                  <p>Doxycycline is often used for treating COVID-19 respiratory symptoms in the community despite an absence of evidence from clinical trials to support its use. We aimed to assess the efficacy of doxycycline to treat suspected COVID-19 in the community among people at high risk of adverse outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a national, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in older people (PRINCIPLE) across primary care centres in the UK. We included people aged 65 years or older, or 50 years or older with comorbidities (weakened immune system, heart disease, hypertension, asthma or lung disease, diabetes, mild hepatic impairment, stroke or neurological problem, and self-reported obesity or body-mass index of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater), who had been unwell (for ≤14 days) with suspected COVID-19 or a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Participants were randomly assigned using response adaptive randomisation to usual care only, usual care plus oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg once daily for the following 6 days), or usual care plus other interventions. The interventions reported in this manuscript are usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only; evaluations of other interventions in this platform trial are ongoing. The coprimary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19, both measured over 28 days from randomisation and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ISRCTN, 86534580.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>The trial opened on April 2, 2020. Randomisation to doxycycline began on July 24, 2020, and was stopped on Dec 14, 2020, because the prespecified futility criterion was met; 2689 participants were enrolled and randomised between these dates. Of these, 2508 (93·3%) participants contributed follow-up data and were included in the primary analysis: 780 (31·1%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group, 948 in the usual care only group (37·8%), and 780 (31·1%) in the usual care plus other interventions group. Among the 1792 participants randomly assigned to the usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only groups, the mean age was 61·1 years (SD 7·9); 999 (55·7%) participants were female and 790 (44·1%) were male. In the primary analysis model, there was little evidence of difference in median time to first self-reported recovery between the usual care plus doxycycline group and the usual care only group (9·6 [95% Bayesian Credible Interval [BCI] 8·3 to 11·0] days <italic>vs</italic> 10·1 [8·7 to 11·7] days, hazard ratio 1·04 [95% BCI 0·93 to 1·17]). The estimated benefit in median time to first self-reported recovery was 0·5 days [95% BCI −0·99 to 2·04] and the probability of a clinically meaningful benefit (defined as ≥1·5 days) was 0·10. Hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19 occurred in 41 (crude percentage 5·3%) participants in the usual care plus doxycycline group and 43 (4·5%) in the usual care only group (estimated absolute percentage difference −0·5% [95% BCI −2·6 to 1·4]); there were five deaths (0·6%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group and two (0·2%) in the usual care only group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community in the UK, who were at high risk of adverse outcomes, treatment with doxycycline was not associated with clinically meaningful reductions in time to recovery or hospital admissions or deaths related to COVID-19, and should not be used as a routine treatment for COVID-19.</p>

A platform trial allows multiple treatments for the same disease to be trialled simultaneously. A master protocol defines prospective decision criteria for stopping interventions because of futility, declaring interventions superior, or adding new interventions.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> This design allows the rapid assessment of multiple interventions, with the aim of rapidly stopping interventions with little evidence of meaningful benefit, and thereby directing resources towards evaluation of new interventions, with the overarching aim in this case of identifying community-based treatments for COVID-19. Interventions evaluated in PRINCIPLE have included hydroxychloroquine (discontinued), azithromycin (discontinued), doxycycline, and inhaled budesonide (discontinued). Here, we report outcomes for doxycycline.</p>

                    <p id="para90">We searched PubMed on Feb 24, 2021, using the search terms (“randomised” OR “trial”) AND (“doxycycline” OR “tetracycline”) AND (“COVID*” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “SARS-CoV”), with no language or date restrictions, and identified 21 papers, one of which reported findings from a randomised controlled trial that provided some data for the effectiveness of doxycycline as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with controls or usual care. In this double-blind trial from Bangladesh, the investigators compared oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg every 12 h for the next 4 days) plus oral ivermectin (12 mg once daily for 5 days), oral ivermectin alone, and a placebo control, in 72 adults (mean age 42 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 (n=24 per group). There was no evidence of difference in the primary outcome of mean time to viral clearance between the doxycycline plus ivermectin group (11·5 days [95% CI 9·8–13·2]) and the placebo group (12·7 days [11·3–14·2]; p=0·27), although time to viral clearance was shorter in the ivermectin alone group (9·7 days [7·8–11·8]) than in the placebo group. We searched <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs20">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> on Feb 24, 2021, with the same search strategy and identified 13 additional ongoing or completed randomised controlled trials assessing doxycycline as a treatment for COVID-19, none of which had yet reported results.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p id="para110">To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to report the efficacy of doxycycline as a standalone treatment for patients with COVID-19 in the community. We did not find evidence that doxycycline meaningfully improved recovery time or reduced hospitalisations or deaths when used in this setting.</p>

                      <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                    </p>
                    <p id="para130">Our findings, from this study among older adults and those with comorbidities, do not support the routine use of doxycycline for suspected COVID-19 in the community in the absence of other indications such as bacterial pneumonia. Emerging evidence suggests that bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 is uncommon, therefore antibiotic treatment is unlikely to benefit most individuals with COVID-19 in the community in well resourced countries, and wider use without clear benefit could lead to public health harm through increased antibiotic resistance. Further research to identify strategies for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 in the community is needed.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="para140">We enrolled people in the community who were aged 65 years or older, or 50 years or older with comorbidities, who had ongoing symptoms (for ≤14 days) from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or suspected COVID-19 (in accordance with the UK National Health Service [NHS] definition of high temperature, new continuous cough, or change in sense of smell or taste).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Comorbidities required for eligibility in people aged 50–64 years were: weakened immune system, heart disease, hypertension, asthma or lung disease, diabetes, mild hepatic impairment, stroke or neurological problem, and self-reported obesity or body-mass index of 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater. People were ineligible if: they were currently an inpatient in hospital, they had almost recovered (general condition much improved and COVID-19 symptoms now mild or almost absent), in the judgement of the recruiting clinician was deemed ineligible, or if they had previously been assigned to a group in the PRINCIPLE trial. People were ineligible to be assigned to doxycycline if they were already taking antibiotics for an acute condition or if doxycycline was contraindicated (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 55</xref>). Initially, eligible people were recruited, screened, and enrolled through participating general medical practices, but from May 17, 2020, people across the UK could enrol online or by telephone. After each patient completed a baseline and screening questionnaire, a clinician or trained research nurse confirmed their eligibility using the patient's primary care medical record, accessed remotely where necessary, before randomisation.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para150">Participants were randomly assigned using a secure, web-based, in-house, randomisation system (Sortition version 2.3). When the doxycycline group opened, the azithromycin and usual care only groups were also active, and participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of the three groups, stratified by age and comorbidity. Subsequent randomisation probabilities were determined using response adaptive randomisation via regular interim analyses, which allowed allocation of more participants to interventions with better observed outcomes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 68–167</xref>).

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para160">The interventions reported in this manuscript are usual care plus oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily for the following 6 days) and usual care only. Usual care in the NHS for suspected uncomplicated COVID-19 in the community is largely supportive. Antibiotics are only recommended for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia if bacterial infection is suspected or if the patient is at high risk of adverse outcomes, in which case the guidelines recommend doxycycline.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In this trial, doxycycline was either prescribed or issued directly by the participant's general medical practitioner, or issued centrally by the study team and delivered by urgent courier to the participant.</p>
                <p id="para170">Participants were followed up through an online, daily symptom diary for 28 days after randomisation, supplemented with telephone calls on days 2, 14, and 28. Participants were encouraged to nominate a trial partner to help provide follow-up data. We obtained consent to ascertain health-care use outcome data from general practice and hospital records. We aimed to provide a SARS-CoV-2 self-swab for PCR testing promptly after randomisation, but capacity issues early in the COVID-19 pandemic meant swab testing was unavailable for some participants.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para180">The trial commenced with the primary outcome of hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19 within 28 days of randomisation. However, the proportion of patients requiring admission to hospital in the UK<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> was lower than initially expected.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Therefore, the trial management group and steering committee recommended amending the primary outcome to include a measure of illness duration.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Duration of illness is an important outcome for patients and has important economic and social impacts. Furthermore, treatments that do not shorten illness duration are also unlikely to provide a benefit in COVID-19-related hospitalisations or deaths. This change received ethical approval on Sept 16, 2020, and was implemented before any interim analyses were done. Thus, the trial had two coprimary endpoints measured over 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery (defined as the first instance that a participant reported feeling recovered), and hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19.</p>
                <p id="para190">Secondary outcomes were a rating of how well participants feel (participants were asked “How well are you feeling today? Please rate how you are feeling now using a scale of 1–10, where 1 is the worst you can imagine, and 10 is feeling the best you can imagine”), time to sustained recovery (date the participant first reported feeling recovered and subsequently remained well until 28 days after randomisation), time to initial alleviation of symptoms (date participant first reported all symptoms as minor or none), time to sustained alleviation of symptoms, time to initial reduction of severity of symptoms, duration of hospital admission, contacts with health services, adherence to study treatment, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and treatment effects among SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para200">Sample size calculations are detailed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 79)</xref>, where we justify sample sizes by simulating the operating characteristics of the adaptive design in multiple scenarios, which explicitly account for response adaptive randomisation, early stopping for futility or success, and multiple interventions. In brief, for the primary outcome analyses, assuming a median time to recovery of 9 days in the usual care only group, approximately 400 participants per group would provide 90% power to detect a 2-day difference in median recovery time. Assuming 5% hospitalisation in the usual care only group, approximately 1500 participants per group would provide 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation or death.</p>
                <p id="para210">Statistical analyses are detailed in the master statistical analysis plan (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 168–207</xref>). The first primary outcome, time to first self-reported recovery, was analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential model regressed on treatment and stratification covariates, and included parameters for temporal drift. The second primary outcome, hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19, was analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model regressed on treatment and stratification covariates. The primary outcomes were evaluated using a gate-keeping strategy to preserve the overall type I error of the primary endpoints without additional adjustments for multiple hypotheses. The hypothesis for the time to first self-reported recovery endpoint was evaluated first, and if the null hypothesis was rejected, the hypothesis for the second coprimary endpoint of hospitalisation or death was evaluated. In the context of multiple interim analyses, the master protocol specifies that each null hypothesis is rejected if the Bayesian posterior probability of superiority exceeded 0·99 for the time to recovery endpoint and 0·975 (via gate-keeping) for the hospitalisation or death endpoint. Based on trials of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> a minimum of 1·5 days difference in median time to first report of recovery, and 2% difference in hospitalisation or mortality rate were prespecified as clinically meaningful. If there was insufficient evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit in time to recovery, futility was declared and randomisation to that intervention was stopped, meaning other interventions could be evaluated more rapidly in the trial.</p>
                <p id="para220">Bayesian methods were specified for the primary analysis for multiple reasons, including: the ability to incorporate response adaptive randomisation based on a Bayesian posterior distribution of each intervention being the best intervention; the ability to update Bayesian posterior distributions via interim analyses and base decisions on probabilistic summaries; and the ability to account for temporal drift using Bayesian smoothing methodologies. Bayesian prior distributions were prespecified and were chosen to allow the data to dominate model estimation.</p>
                <p id="para230">The prespecified primary analysis population included all eligible participants who were assigned to usual care plus doxycycline, usual care only, or usual care plus other interventions, from the start of the platform trial until randomisation to doxycycline was stopped, with data extracted after a further 28 days of follow-up. Because this population included participants who were assigned to usual care only before the usual care plus doxycycline group opened, the primary analysis models include parameters to adjust for temporal drift in the study population, which might have occurred due to changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2, usual care, or the pandemic situation, as well as changes in the inclusion or exclusion criteria over time. These parameters provide an estimated trajectory for the primary endpoint in the usual care only group over time via Bayesian hierarchical modelling; methodological details are provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 68–167</xref>). We did a sensitivity analysis that compared each intervention versus the concurrently randomised controls (participants who were randomly assigned to usual care only during the time period when the usual care plus doxycycline group was open to randomisation), which should be consistent with the primary analysis results. Although analyses for non-concurrent randomised controls are not typically implemented in traditional trials, they are becoming standard practice in many high-profile adaptive platform trials.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In addition, we did a secondary analysis restricted to SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive participants in the primary analysis population.</p>
                <p id="para240">Analyses of the secondary outcomes, and prespecified subgroup analyses on age, comorbidity, swab results, duration of symptoms before randomisation, and severity of symptoms scores at baseline (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 200</xref>), were done on the concurrent randomisation analysis population, defined as all participants who were randomly assigned to usual care plus doxycycline or usual care only during the time period when the usual care plus doxycycline group was open to randomisation. Secondary time-to-event outcomes were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, and binary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression, adjusting for comorbidity status, age, duration of illness, and eligibility for doxycycline at baseline.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para360">This adaptive platform randomised trial, in people in the community in the UK with suspected or PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who were at high risk of adverse outcomes, showed that doxycycline did not meaningfully shorten time to recovery or reduce hospitalisations or deaths related to COVID-19 compared with usual care only. Findings were unchanged in the secondary analysis restricted to participants with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in subgroup analyses by age and presence of comorbidities.</p>
              <p id="para370">We identified no published randomised controlled trials of doxycycline as a standalone treatment for COVID-19. A small randomised controlled trial in 72 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in Bangladesh compared doxycycline for 5 days plus single-dose ivermectin, ivermectin alone for 5 days, and placebo.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The primary outcome of mean time to negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR was 12·7 days (95% CI 11·3–14·2) in the placebo group and a similar 11·5 days (9·8–13·2; p=0·27) in the doxycycline plus ivermectin group, and was shorter in the ivermectin alone group (9·7 days [7·8–11·8]; p=0·02) than in the placebo group. There were no differences in hospitalisation duration. A prospective observational study of 315 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 148 (47%) received doxycycline, found no evidence that doxycycline was associated with decreased 30-day mortality (adjusted HR 0·92 [95% CI 0·49–1·69]; p=0·79).<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para380">The strengths of our study include the evaluation of doxycycline as a standalone, early treatment, the focus on patients in the community at increased risk of complications, and the use of 28 days of patient-reported outcomes which, in the case of hospitalisations and deaths, were confirmed by medical record review. Only three-quarters of patients reported feeling fully recovered during follow-up, and the median time to sustained recovery was 22 days, reflecting the now well known potential for COVID-19 to cause recurrent and protracted symptoms, but we did not assess outcomes beyond 28 days.</p>
              <p id="para390">A potential limitation of our study is the inclusion of patients without PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the inclusion of these patients reflects the management of suspected COVID-19 early in the UK pandemic, and in many other community and low-resource hospital settings, where limited availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing might necessitate early empirical treatment. Given the variation in PCR testing sensitivity, particularly if self-administered by unwell older people in the community, some participants are likely to have had false-negative tests.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity within PRINCIPLE has increased as the pandemic has progressed, and our findings were unchanged when restricted to the 51·2% participants with PCR-confirmed infection. We did an open-label study as rapidly generating a placebo for multiple trial interventions was not feasible, and our study is a pragmatic trial which aims to determine whether the addition of doxycycline to usual care was effective, rather than to compare doxycycline with placebo. Although this could introduce potential bias, any possible placebo effect on time to self-reported recovery would most likely have biased results towards benefit from doxycycline. As we did not observe any clinically meaningful benefit, this is unlikely to have influenced our results.</p>
              <p id="para400">There was a relatively higher proportion of individuals who reported recovery on day 1 among those without a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). This finding might be an artifact of the recruitment and screening strategy that was implemented early on in the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, when there were difficulties obtaining data to confirm eligibility from some general practices. Difficulties in obtaining this information resulted in delays between trial screening and randomisation for some participants, who are likely to have then reported recovery sooner after randomisation. Subsequent improved screening processes enabled assessment of eligibility for participation far more rapidly. The proportions of participants who had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result and those who did not differed over the duration of the study, due to the non-availability of testing in the early months of the trial, before screening processes were improved. These differences are taken account of in the primary analysis model, which adjusted for temporal trends in time to recovery.</p>
              <p id="para410">We found a marginally higher HR for time to first self-reported recovery favouring doxycycline among those with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the concurrent randomisation population, when compared with the primary analysis population which included people diagnosed on the basis of symptoms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). However, the estimated benefit in terms of time to recovery was around half a day for all study populations.</p>
              <p id="para420">In the primary analysis, there were slightly more hospital admissions or deaths related to COVID-19 in the usual care plus doxycycline group than in the usual care only group; whereas in the SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive population, there were 1·2% fewer hospitalisations or deaths in the usual care plus doxycycline group, with a low probability that doxycycline was superior on this outcome. However, the hospitalisation analysis did not account for temporal drift (in line with low event counts and the statistical analysis plan effective at time of the analysis), and the estimated difference of 1·2% might be overestimated, given increasing hospitalisation over the duration of the study. In the concurrent randomisation analysis, there was a 0·2% estimated difference in hospitalisations or deaths.</p>
              <p id="para430">The challenge of designing trials with relatively little information early in a novel pandemic has meant that it is not unusual to update key outcomes as new information emerges.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Due to lower than expected hospitalisations and mortality in PRINCIPLE, and to allow measurement of effects on illness duration, the primary outcome was changed to a coprimary outcome of self-reported time to recovery, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation or death, analysed using a gate-keeping approach. This change occurred before any interim analyses were done. This approach, in which interventions that meet prespecified futility criteria on time to recovery are stopped, assumes that interventions that did not show benefit on time to recovery are unlikely to show a benefit on reducing COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths. This design enables the platform trial to cycle through multiple interventions using response adaptive randomisation, and increases the probability of achieving the trial objectives of identifying effective community treatments for COVID-19.</p>
