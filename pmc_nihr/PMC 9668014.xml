                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Persistent physical symptoms (which cannot be adequately attributed to physical disease) affect around 1 million people (2% of adults) in the UK. They affect patients’ quality of life and account for at least one third of referrals from General Practitioners (GPs) to specialists. These referrals give patients little benefit but have a real cost to health services time and diagnostic resources. The symptoms clinic has been designed to help people make sense of persistent physical symptoms (especially if medical tests have been negative) and to reduce the impact of symptoms on daily life.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the symptoms clinic intervention plus usual care compared with usual care alone. Patients were identified through GP searches and mail-outs and recruited by the central research team. 354 participants were recruited and individually randomised (1:1). The primary outcome is the self-reported Physical Health Questionnaire-15 at 52 weeks postrandomisation. Secondary outcome measures include the EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level and healthcare resource use. Outcome measures will also be collected at 13 and 26 weeks postrandomisation. A process evaluation will be conducted including consultation content analysis and interviews with participants and key stakeholders.</p>

                  <p>Ethics approval has been obtained via Greater Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee (Reference 18/NW/0422). The results of the trial will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, presented at relevant conferences and disseminated to trial participants and patient interest groups.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), which cannot be adequately attributed to physical disease, affect approximately 1 million adults in the UK (2% of the adult population).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Many patients with such symptoms receive repeated referral and investigation<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which provides little benefit<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> but has real costs to health services time and diagnostic resources.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> When patients are told that medical tests do not show a cause for their symptoms they are commonly disappointed in their interactions with clinicians.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Patients want to have those symptoms explained in acceptable ways<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> in order to know that their symptoms are legitimate,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to adapt to them and to manage them. Without an explanation for their symptoms many patients seek further healthcare use while at the same time losing confidence that it will help them. With acceptable explanation, patients may be able to move from looking for a cause, to self-managing their symptoms.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
                <p>PPS represents a broad category of disorders, including defined syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome but also non-specific symptoms and combinations of symptoms from different syndromes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> The term replaces older and unhelpful terms including ‘medically unexplained symptoms’.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Recent thinking suggests that PPS, such as chronic pain, should be regarded as disorders in their own right.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This fits with models of symptoms as consequences of disturbed interoception—the non-conscious sensing, interpreting and regulating the body.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> Disturbed interoception, or more specifically disturbed predictive interoceptive coding,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> provides a fundamental explanation for PPS which can then be elaborated in a number of psychological<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and biopsychosocial<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> models for persistent symptoms. These often use frameworks such as predisposing, precipitating and persisting factors to structure explanations.</p>
                <p>We developed a model of ‘rational explanation’,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> which enables clinicians to integrate knowledge from processes such as disturbed interoception, with patients’ reported experiences, to develop explanations for symptoms. These rational explanations make sense of symptoms in terms of brain and body processes and are acceptable to doctor and patient.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> They leave room for psychosocial influences without placing them as the cause, and they provide opportunities to guide self-management, which has been found to be of value to patients.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In rational explanations, psychological factors such as heightened vigilance to symptoms or persistent worry about symptoms are presented as understandable mechanisms by which symptoms persist rather than signs that symptoms have a ‘psychosomatic’ cause. In contrast, previously advocated explanatory models such as somatisation are rejected by patients as too simplistic<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and leave patients with PPS dissatisfied with the explanations they receive. Rational explanations based on signalling between the brain and the body also open up the possibility of using symptom management techniques which influence interoception and the autonomic nervous system including slow paced breathing.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>Improving PPS could have a substantial effect on health and on its impacts in terms of lost productivity and increased care needs. Physical symptoms not explained by disease account for very substantial costs<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>—between 40% and 60% of all referrals across a range of specialties,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> estimated at £3 billion annually to the National Health Service (NHS) and £14 billion to the wider economy.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
                <p>The symptoms clinic is a primary care intervention, designed to explore acceptable explanations for symptoms and to reduce the impact of PPS on daily life. The Multiple Symptoms Study 3 (MSS3), randomised control trial (RCT), builds on successful preliminary studies which have shown the feasibility, and acceptability of the symptoms clinics.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p>
                <p>The primary aim of MSS3 is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the ‘symptoms clinic’ intervention for patients with persistent (‘medically unexplained’) physical symptoms.</p>

                <title>Adaptations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
                <p>The MSS3 RCT was originally designed and delivered as a face-to-face intervention. Prior to March 2020, enrolment appointments and delivery of the symptoms clinic took place in local GP practices or community research facilities. After a short pause due to COVID-19 restrictions the trial was redesigned to allow for remote delivery as described in this protocol. No changes were made to the content of the intervention. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore differences in those receiving the intervention face to face and remotely, with a further sensitivity analysis removing those cases that were randomised immediately before the pause, for whom there was a substantial delay in the delivery of the symptoms clinic (so whose 13-week outcomes were sometimes collected before the intervention had begun; those randomised to the usual care group during the same period will also be removed for this sensitivity analysis). Qualitative interviews will explore participant and stakeholder opinion of the different delivery modalities.</p>

GPs of patients allocated to the symptoms clinic also received a letter from the symptoms clinic doctor (copied to the participant) after the first and last appointments which outlined the formulation and any planned actions.</p>

                  <p>The participant was then randomised and informed of their allocation. If assignment was to the intervention, the first symptoms clinic appointment was scheduled.

Sessions 5–7 and 9–11 comprised protected time to see patients of the GPs own practice using newly learnt skills and reflection on this. Sessions 8 and 12–13 were training sessions focusing on consolidating skills and knowledge. In sessions 9–11 each ER-GP recorded a set of three consultations for review, quality assessment and constructive feedback by a panel comprising the CI and two other investigators.</p>
                  <p>During the study, ER-GPs received supervision with one of the investigators approximately every 1–2 months.

                <p>Consultations before March 2020 were delivered face to face. Subsequently consultations took place via video consultation or telephone. The symptoms clinic consists of up to four consultations; an initial long consultation (approximately 50 min) followed by up to three medium length consultations (15–20 min) approximately every 2 weeks. Clinicians had flexibility to increase the gaps between sessions if required.</p>

                  <p>All symptoms clinic consultations were audiorecorded. A random sample of approximately one-third are transcribed for quality assurance and process assessment and the remainder are archived for quality assurance purposes. It was ensured that a sample from each ER-GP was selected.</p>
                  <p>Fidelity is assessed from consultation transcripts or recordings against standards developed in the preliminary studies. The protocol originally proposed that this would include the proportion of consultation time spent on different components and the number and type of explanations. These proved difficult to operationalise and a simpler approach was adopted in which a framework of items in the intervention was used as a template and for each consultation the presence of each item was indicated and evidenced by using an extract or quote from the transcript. A traffic light system was used where clearly present was marked green, possibly present marked amber and absent marked red.</p>

We have thus powered the trial on a between group difference of two points on the PHQ-15 (equivalent to a clinically important three point change from baseline).</p>
                <p>We have based calculations of effect size on a pooled SD of 5; this is larger than that seen in our preliminary studies owing to their restricted eligibility range and more in keeping with observational studies.

The initial recruitment target was thus 376 participants. In October 2021, this was reduced in discussion with the funder, to 350 because lost to follow-up at 52 weeks postrandomisation was 18% rather than the anticipated 25%.</p>

Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar manner within a generalised linear modelling framework using appropriate link functions for the outcomes’ distributions. Models will adjust for sex, age, whether the intervention was delivered in person or online, and baseline values of outcomes. A repeated measures analysis on PHQ-15 at all four measurement points will be conducted as a further secondary analysis using a multilevel growth curve model with time as a quadratic term, and a treatment-time interaction included in the model.</p>
                <p>Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for the primary analysis of all outcomes, with complier average causal effect analysis as a secondary analysis. The primary outcome will be analysed using observed data with no imputation for missing data, but we will assess the amount and patterns of missing data and test the sensitivity of estimates of treatments effects using an appropriate imputation strategy such as multiple imputation by chained equation. We will explore potential modification of the treatment effect by including treatment-by-subgroup interactions in models. All treatment effect estimates will be presented with 95% CIs in forest plots.</p>
                <p>A single main analysis will be performed at the end of the trial when follow-up is complete. Interim analyses will be performed if requested by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) and the trials unit SOPs will be adhered to maintain the integrity of the trial.</p>

Interviews will be transcribed and analysed thematically, recognising that there are likely to be changes in intrapersonal understanding and interpretation (for which an interpretive phenomenological approach is likely to be valuable) and interpersonal or social understanding and interaction. Particular attention will be paid to patients’ views on what aspects of the Symptoms Clinic were particularly valuable to them and how these translated into perceived changes in thoughts, behaviours and symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Stakeholder interviews will examine acceptability of the clinic concept and processes, skills learnt and knowledge transferred, value for GPs and perceived value to patients.</p>

                <p>We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the symptoms clinic plus usual care compared with usual care alone from the primary perspective of the UK NHS and personal social services. This will be based on HCRU (including primary and secondary care contacts such as GP consultations, diagnostic tests and investigations, physical and mental health specialist referrals, and prescription psychotropic and pain-related medications) and outcome data collected during the trial. It will take the format of a within-trial CEA and use a cost-utility framework to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.</p>
                <p>The effects of the intervention will be estimated as gain in QALYs at 52 weeks using health-related quality of life data collected at baseline, 13, 26 and 52 weeks and the area under the curve method.

                <p>Generalised linear regression analyses will be used to estimate the differences (and associated 95% CIs) in per patient mean total costs and differences in mean total QALYs comparing the symptoms clinic intervention plus usual care compared with usual care alone, adjusting for baseline differences in cost, utility and other patient characteristics (eg, age, gender, PHQ-15 score). Uncertainty will be explored by conducting a range of one-way and multiway deterministic sensitivity analyses (or probabilistic sensitivity analysis if more appropriate) to test the robustness of the base case results including assuming a broader cost perspective (eg, including private healthcare costs), evaluating the effect of missing values (comparing results based on complete cases and those estimated using multiple imputed values) and potential bias due to high-cost patients (removing these expensive participants from the analysis). Cost per QALY data will also be presented in the form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves to show the probability that the intervention is cost effective for different values of willingness to pay per additional QALY.</p>
