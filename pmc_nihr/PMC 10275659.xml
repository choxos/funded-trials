                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>This was the first study to investigate the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous or fractional second dose COVID-19 vaccine regimens in adolescents.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A phase II, single-blind, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial recruited across seven UK sites from September to November 2021, with follow-up visits to August 2022. Healthy 12-to-16 years olds were randomised (1:1:1) to either 30 µg BNT162b2 (BNT-30), 10 µg BNT162b2 (BNT-10), or NVX-CoV2373 (NVX), eight weeks after a first 30 µg dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was solicited systemic reactions in the week following vaccination. Secondary outcomes included immunogenicity and safety. ‘Breakthrough infection’ analyses were exploratory.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>148 participants were recruited (median age 14 years old, 62% female, 26% anti-nucleocapsid IgG seropositive pre-second dose); 132 participants received a second dose. Reactions were mostly mild-to-moderate, with lower rates in BNT-10 recipients. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. Compared to BNT-30, at 28 days post-second dose anti-spike antibody responses were similar for NVX [adjusted geometric mean ratio (aGMR) 1.09 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84, 1.42] and lower for BNT-10 [aGMR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.99)]. For Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, the neutralising antibody titres for BNT-30 at day 28 were similar for BNT-10 [aGMR 1.0 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.54) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.48), respectively], but higher for NVX [aGMR 1.7 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.69) and 1.43 (95% CI: 0.96, 2.12), respectively]. Compared to BNT-30, cellular immune responses were greatest for NVX [aGMR 1.73 (95% CI: 0.94, 3.18)], and lowest for BNT-10 [aGMR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.15)] at 14 days post-second dose. Cellular responses were similar across the study arms by day 236 post-second dose. Amongst SARS-CoV-2 infection naïve participants, NVX participants had an 89% reduction in risk of self-reported ‘breakthrough infection’ compared to BNT-30 [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.86)] up until day 132 after second dose. BNT-10 recipients were more likely to have a ‘breakthrough infection’ compared to BNT-30 [aHR 2.14 (95% CI: 1.02, 4.51)] up to day 132 and day 236 post-second dose. Antibody responses at 132 and 236 days after second dose were similar for all vaccine schedules.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Heterologous and fractional dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents are safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic. The enhanced performance of the heterologous schedule using NVX-CoV2373 against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant suggests this mRNA prime and protein-subunit boost schedule may provide a greater breadth of protection than the licensed homologous schedule.</p>

              <p id="p0030">Paediatric immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 has now been recommended in the majority of high-income countries, particularly in light of the sharp increase in infection rates in children and paediatric hospitalisations worldwide following the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0035">An increased incidence of myocarditis has been observed following receipt of a second dose of an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, particularly in male adolescents, with up to 105.9 cases per million reported.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> This risk may be reduced by using another vaccine or fractional dose for the second vaccination (a mixed schedule), or variation to dose intervals.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>

              <p id="p0040">Heterologous vaccination schedules in adults have been shown to be safe and immunogenic and have been implemented in Canada and northern Europe.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> They have been approved by the World Health Organisation to enhance vaccination coverage, particularly where supplies are limited.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In the Com-COV2 trial a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedule utilising the Matrix-M adjuvanted recombinant nanoparticle spike protein vaccine NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) as the second dose following BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), was found to be less immunogenic in 50-to-70-year-olds than two doses of BNT162b2. The BNT/NXV-CoV2373 schedule was, however, still more immunogenic than two doses of the adenoviral-vectored ChAdOx1 n-CoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine, which is highly effective against hospitalisation and death.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0045">Fractional dose BNT162b2 schedules are now approved for 5-to-11-year-olds. A phase 2/3 study in participants aged 5-to-11-years showed a homologous two-dose regimen of 10 μg BNT162b2 induced immune responses comparable to that of a two-dose regimen of 30 μg BNT162b2 administered to 16-to-25-year-olds and was associated with a lower incidence of systemic adverse events.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>

              <p id="p0050">No data have previously been published on the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of mixed and fractional COVID-19 vaccine schedules in an adolescent population. Here we report a randomised-controlled trial to determine the reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adolescents receiving 30 μg BNT162b2 as a first dose and a second dose of either 30 μg BNT162b2 (schedule hereafter referred to as BNT-30), 10 μg BNT162b2 (schedule hereafter referred to as BNT-10), or NVX-CoV2373 (schedule hereafter referred to as NVX) given at least 8 weeks later.</p>

                <p id="p0055">Com-COV3 is a single-blind, randomised, phase II, multi-centre study to determine reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mixed COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents. The study consists of two cohorts. This paper reports the results of the first cohort investigating the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous and fractional second dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents. The second cohort will examine mixed third dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents and will be reported separately. Recruitment for the first cohort commenced on 27<sup>th</sup> September 2021 and occurred across seven UK National Health Service and academic institutions. The study was approved by the South-Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (21/SC/0310) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline was followed. The study protocol is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://comcovstudy.org.uk/study-protocol" id="ir0005">https://comcovstudy.org.uk/study-protocol</ext-link>.</p>

                <title>Changes to the planned protocol</title>
                <p id="p0065">Following a change to UK national immunisation policy on 29<sup>th</sup> November 2021 recommending that all 12-to-15-year-olds should be offered a second dose of 30 μg BNT162b2, the study design was reviewed with the Trial Steering Committee. Recruitment to the study was stopped (thus the pre-planned sample size was not met), and the study amended to focus on the immune response to BNT162b2. After this date, enrolled participants who had not yet received their second vaccination were randomised to either BNT-30 or BNT-10. Participants were no longer randomised to the NVX study arm in order to prioritise those groups more likely to inform UK immunisation policy.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="p0070">Adolescents aged 12-to-16-years inclusive, who were COVID-19 vaccine naïve or had received a single dose of 30 μg BNT162b2, were eligible. ‘High-risk’ individuals who were advised to receive additional doses of BNT as part of the UK COVID-19 vaccination programme (e.g., confirmed, or suspected immunosuppressive condition or serious chronic illness) were excluded. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an exclusion criterion. (See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://comcovstudy.org.uk/study-protocol" id="ir0010">https://comcovstudy.org.uk/study-protocol</ext-link> for protocol eligibility criteria).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and Masking</title>
                <p id="p0075">Computer generated randomisation lists were prepared by the study statistician. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 at the time of their second vaccination to BNT-30, BNT-10, or NVX. After 29<sup>th</sup> November 2021, when UK national immunisation policy changed to offer all 12-to-15-year-olds a second dose of BNT, a protocol amendment was implemented and participants who had already received their first dose of BNT162b2 within the study were randomised 1:1 to receive 30 µg BNT162b2 or 10 µg BNT162b2 as a second dose.</p>
                <p id="p0080">Randomisation was performed using block randomisation. Block sizes of three and six were used before 29<sup>th</sup> November 2021, and block sizes of two and four used thereafter. Randomisation was stratified by study site and baseline anti-nucleocapsid IgG serostatus.</p>
                <p id="p0085">Participants were blinded to allocation until one-month after second dose. To maintain the blind, vaccines were prepared out of sight of the participant, and masking tape applied to the vaccine syringe. Laboratory staff were blinded to the study arm, staff involved in the study delivery were not. Statisticians were unblinded throughout the trial.</p>

              <sec id="sec0035">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="p0090">Informed consent was obtained from participants aged 16 years or from their parents or guardians if younger than 16 years, and written assent obtained from participants aged 12-to-15-years. All participants and parents had the opportunity to read the Participant Information Sheet (customised versions available for parents, participants aged 16 years, and 12-to-15-years to enhance comprehensibility) and to discuss trial participation with a member of the study team before signing the consent form. COVID-19 vaccine naïve participants attended a screening/enrolment visit and those eligible received a 30 µg BNT162b2 first dose. Participants who had received 30 µg BNT162b2 in the community attended a screening visit eight weeks afterwards. All participants were randomised and vaccinated at least eight weeks after their first dose.

Secondary outcomes included solicited local reactions, immunogenicity [anti-spike immunoglobulins (total Ig), cellular responses by ELISpot)], safety (AEs, SAEs and AESIs), cardiac markers (NT-proBNP and troponin), and characterisation of anti-nucleocapsid IgG seropositivity at baseline and subsequent seroconversion.

                <p id="p0120">The primary outcome analysis was conducted on the safety analysis population and included participants who received a second vaccine in the study. The maximum severity for each solicited systemic AE across seven days after second vaccination was derived for each participant and summarised by group. Analyses were conducted similarly for local reactogenicity.</p>
                <p id="p0125">Immunogenicity analyses were conducted on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) populations at 28, 132, and 236 days following second vaccination overall and stratified by pre-second dose serostatus (defined by anti-nucleocapsid value pre-second dose or pre-first dose if missing). The mITT populations excluded participants who withdrew, had no blood sample, received a third dose in the community before their visit or self-reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 14 days after second vaccination. Immunogenicity outcomes were summarised using geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMRs) and 95% CIs were calculated comparing groups to BNT-30 as the reference, adjusting for study site in the linear regression models.</p>
                <p id="p0130">Immunogenicity secondary and sensitivity analyses were conducted on anti-spike antibodies 28 days after second vaccination. Secondary analyses were further adjusted for pre-second dose anti-spike antibodies and interval between two doses. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the per-protocol population, excluding those randomised after 29<sup>th</sup> November 2021, and excluding those who self-reported a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 28 days after second vaccination. Immunogenicity sensitivity analyses were conducted on anti-spike antibodies at 132 and 236 days after second vaccination excluding participants who were considered to have had an infection before their visit. A ‘breakthrough infection’ between second dose and day 236 visit was defined as either: a self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection &gt;14 days after second dose, a two-fold rise in anti-nucleocapsid IgG, a two-fold rise in anti-spike antibodies, or a seroconversion of anti-nucleocapsid IgG serostatus.

              <p id="p0150">Between 27<sup>th</sup> September and 29<sup>th</sup> November 2021, 179 volunteers were screened across seven UK sites, and 148 participants were enrolled. Of these participants, 81 received their first vaccination in the trial. Sixteen participants withdrew prior to randomisation before second vaccination. Prior to 29<sup>th</sup> November, 117 participants were randomised to three study arms (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Fig. 1</xref>, Supplement). Following an amendment to remove the NVX arm, a further 15 participants were randomised to two study arms. In total, 132 participants were randomised and received a second dose in the trial. Recruitment occurred prior to a period of increased SARS-CoV-2 infections, initially due to the Delta Variant, and subsequently Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Fig. 2</xref>, Supplement).</p>
              <p id="p0155">Of all 148 participants enrolled, the median age was 14 years (range 12–17), 62% were female, and six participants (4%) were from an ethnic minority group (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 2</xref>, Supplement). Forty-eight participants were randomised to BNT-30, 47 to BNT-10 and 37 to NVX. The median interval between two doses was 59 days (range 56-109) and was similar across the study arms. Of 132 participants randomised, 65 received their first dose in the trial, of whom 19% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG prior to their first dose. Seropositivity increased to 30% prior to second dose.</p>
              <p id="p0160">Generally, solicited systemic adverse reactions occurred more frequently in BNT-30 and NVX groups compared to BNT-10, while solicited local reactions were least common in the NVX group (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Most reactions were mild-to-moderate, with no clear difference in the frequency of severe reactions across the groups. There was no clear difference in the frequency or severity of reactions when stratified by serostatus (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplement). These findings were reflected in paracetamol usage after second dose (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 3</xref>, Supplement).</p>
              <p id="p0165">Two SAEs occurred: the first four months after second vaccination (toxic substance ingestion, considered unrelated to immunisation), the second seven months after vaccination (anorexia nervosa, also considered unrelated to immunisation) (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 4</xref>, Supplement). There were 65 AESIs, all of which were self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 5</xref>, Supplement). Unsolicited AEs are reported in <xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 6</xref>, Supplement. Almost all participants had a troponin value below the LLOD after second vaccination (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Table 7</xref>, Supplement). At 14 days post-second vaccination, detectable troponin levels were seen in seven participants, with all but one participant (3.5 ng/L) reporting prior vigorous exercise (<xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Tables 7</xref>-8, Supplement and <xref rid="sec0080" ref-type="sec">Fig. 4</xref>, Supplement).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0215">This study demonstrated that NVX following a first dose of 30 µg BNT162b2 elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, with higher neutralising titres against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants than BNT-30. While the lowest antibody response occurred in the BNT-10 group, seropositive BNT-10 participants demonstrated antibody responses comparable to BNT-30 and, irrespective of serostatus, elicited similar NAb titres to BNT-30 against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants. BNT-10 recipients had the least reactogenic profile, and no safety concerns were identified in any group. However, during a wave of predominantly Omicron variant infections, differences in the risk of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection were evident across the study arms. Amongst participants naïve to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the second dose, the lowest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed in the NVX group, which elicited the highest humoral and cellular immune response overall across the study groups.</p>
              <p id="p0220">The NVX and, especially, BNT-10 schedules studied here had favourable side-effect profiles compared to BNT-30, with the NVX reactogenicity findings consistent with studies in adults.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This was reassuring in this adolescent study given the increased reactogenicity previously observed in younger versus older COVID-19 vaccine recipients.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Although increased reactogenicity has been reported in those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found no clear difference in reactogenicity when stratified by serostatus.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> There was no evidence of myocardial inflammation in any study arm clinically or by troponin measurement, although population-based studies are required to definitively assess very rare side effects.</p>
              <p id="p0225">We found BNT-10 was immunogenic in adolescents. However, in participants who were infection naïve (i.e., seronegative to nucleocapsid antigen prior to the second dose), point estimates of binding antibody concentrations were lower than in BNT-30 participants. Furthermore, higher rates of self-reported breakthrough infections were observed in seronegative BNT-10 participants and, once participants experiencing breakthrough infections were excluded, lower antibody concentrations remained evident at day 132. This is consistent with a more rapid loss of protection from infection against VOCs observed following two doses of 10 μg BNT162b2 in 5-to-11-year-olds than following 30 μg BNT162b2 in 12-to-17-year-olds.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, consideration of its use (or that of any COVID-19 vaccine regimen) in infection-naïve adolescents is now largely irrelevant. The current UK and global situation is that of near universal prior infection with SAR-CoV-2,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and in our study among participants previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to their second COVID-19 immunisation, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were similar between BNT-10 and BNT-30 groups, with few breakthrough infections in either group and comparable antibody concentrations at day 236.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This is consistent with recent studies showing that “hybrid immunity” afforded through prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, provides enhanced protection against symptomatic re-infection.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> These findings highlight the important role of antigen encounter in shaping the immune response to vaccination and support the potential use of fractional dosing when providing the third (or fourth) antigen exposure. This approach of reduced dosing for post-primary immunisation has been adopted by the mRNA vaccine manufacturer Moderna for its monovalent booster vaccines, albeit at a dose (50 μg) that remains above that of the full dose BNT162b2 vaccine studied here, and for its bivalent Omicron containing variant vaccines (which contain 25 μg for each of its two target strains).<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The potential for 10 µg BNT162b2 to be used as a third dose is currently being assessed in an extension to this Com-COV3 study.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In the meantime, the utility of homologous 10 µg BNT162b2 schedules for primary immunisation in adolescents remains under investigation and will be further informed by an ongoing phase I adolescent study of homologous 10μg BNT162b2.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0230">Overall, the highest humoral (including neutralising antibody titres) and cellular immune responses, were observed in the NVX group; this pattern persisted out to day 132 even when participants with SARS-CoV-2 infections following vaccination were excluded from the analysis. Correspondingly, the lowest rate of self-reported and serologically confirmed infections were recorded in this group. Furthermore, when compared to the number of serologically confirmed infections, a lower number of self-reported infections were reported in the NVX group, suggesting these participants also experienced milder symptoms on infection. The majority of breakthrough infections for the NVX group occurred later in the study compared to BNT-30 and BNT-10 groups, consistent with the gradual rise in antibody responses seen from day 132 to day 236. NVX-CoV2373 has already been shown to be highly immunogenic in adult populations and to provide protection against VOCs.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Our findings also concur with the preliminary results from the adolescent PREVENT-19 Phase 3 trial in which NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated protective efficacy of 79.5% against SARS-CoV-2 and 82% vaccine efficacy against the Delta variant.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It has been postulated that the success of the vaccine’s performance may be attributable to the presence of the novel Matrix M adjuvant, previously shown to enhance immunogenicity.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0235">This is the first study to examine immune responses to mixed COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents, and revealed striking differences in responses elicited by NVX compared with 50-to-70-year-olds.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Specifically, in the adolescent seronegative NVX group, higher anti-spike antibodies were observed compared to BNT-30 (aGMR 1.33), whereas in seronegative adults, this schedule induced concentrations that failed non-inferiority compared to BNT-30 (aGMR 0.53).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Cellular immune responses to NVX also differed, with a relatively low frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in adults (29 SFC/10<sup>6</sup>, aGMR 0.6 compared to BNT-30), versus adolescents (121 SFC/10<sup>6</sup>, aGMR 1.73).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> An age-related decline in immunogenicity (‘immunosenescence’) for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 vaccines is well recognised,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and is further evidenced by geometric mean NAb titres against the ancestral strain being 4-fold higher following BNT-30 in seronegative adolescents (Com-COV3) versus adults (Com-COV2) and the observation that two doses of 10 μg BNT162b2 in children elicits an immune response similar to BNT-30 in young adults.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, the relatively better immune response to NVX compared with BNT-30 in adolescents versus adults suggests that this age-related waning was more pronounced for NVX than BNT-30.</p>
              <p id="p0240">Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection may be expected to be associated with higher baseline, and hence post-vaccination spike-specific antibody levels. However, we found markedly greater binding and neutralising antibody responses in seronegative compared to seropositive NVX recipients. This unexpected finding in our NVX group should however be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample size. Two NVX recipients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the week following their second vaccination were excluded from the analysis to reduce the risk of confounding bias.</p>
              <p id="p0245">The limitations of this study include the use of a pragmatic approach, with no formal sample size calculations. The change to UK national immunisation policy which necessitated a change to the study design resulted in fewer participants recruited than originally planned, limiting the reliability of the conclusions which can be drawn from these data. The age and ethnicity of the study population affects the generalisability of the findings because of the limited representativeness when compared to the general population. The differences in self-reported infection observed in this study need to be interpreted with caution as the study was not powered to assess efficacy, and BNT-10 participants may have been more likely than other groups to self-test once unblinded at day 28 following vaccination. However, the pattern of infection across groups remained consistent for serologically defined infections which were not influenced by testing behaviour. Also, the formulation of BNT-10 used (a one-third dose of the adult preparation, administered in a 0.1 ml volume) differs from the licensed formulation of this vaccine (administered as a 0.2 ml dose).<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Further clarity on the relevance of this will be provided in the second cohort of the Com-COV3 study, investigating ‘third dose’ COVID-19 schedules, in which both preparations of the 10 μg dose are being compared directly. Considering the varied vaccine volumes used in the study, there is also a risk that participants may have been inadvertently unblinded at the time of vaccination. However, to maintain the blind, vaccines were prepared out of sight and the syringes covered with masking tape, thereby minimising this risk.</p>
              <p id="p0250">In summary, this study shows that heterologous and fractional dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules studied are well-tolerated and immunogenic in adolescents. BNT-10 demonstrated a highly favourable reactogenic profile, however it elicited the lowest peak immune response. Although BNT-10 neutralising activity against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants was comparable to BNT-30, BNT-10 participants were more than twice as likely to have a self-reported ‘breakthrough infection’ compared with BNT-30. NVX demonstrated the highest peak humoral and cellular immune response and had a comparable reactogenic profile to BNT-30. Furthermore, NVX elicited the highest neutralising activity against BA.1 and BA.2 and demonstrated a reduction in risk of self-reported ‘breakthrough infection’ during an Omicron predominant wave. The performance of NVX in this study supports its use in heterologous COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents, which could offer more flexible and efficient deployment of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies and provide important global policy relevant data. NVX is currently under review as a third dose option for adolescents in the second cohort of the Com-COV3 study.</p>
