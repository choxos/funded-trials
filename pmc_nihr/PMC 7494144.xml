                <title>INTRODUCTION:</title>
                <p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver condition worldwide. A weight loss goal of ≥10% is the recommended treatment for NAFLD; however, only a minority of patients achieve this level of weight reduction with standard dietary approaches. This study aimed to determine whether a very low calorie diet (VLCD) is an acceptable and feasible therapy to achieve and maintain a ≥10% weight loss in patients with clinically significant NAFLD.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS:</title>
                  <p>Patients with clinically significant NAFLD were recruited to a VLCD (∼800 kcal/d) intervention using meal replacement products. Anthropometrics, blood tests (liver and metabolic), liver stiffness, and cardiovascular disease risk were measured at baseline, post-VLCD, and at 9-month follow-up.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS:</title>
                  <p>A total of 45 patients were approached of which 30 were enrolled 27 (90%) completed the VLCD intervention, and 20 (67%) were retained at 9-month follow-up. The VLCD was acceptable to patients and feasible to deliver. Intention-to-treat analysis found that 34% of patients achieved and sustained ≥10% weight loss, 51% achieved ≥7% weight loss, and 68% achieved ≥5% weight loss at 9-month follow-up. For those completing the VLCD, liver health (liver enzymes and liver stiffness), cardiovascular disease risk (blood pressure and QRISK2), metabolic health (fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin), and body composition significantly improved post-VLCD and was maintained at 9 months.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>DISCUSSION:</title>
                  <p>VLCD offers a feasible treatment option for some patients with NAFLD to enable a sustainable ≥10%, weight loss, which can improve liver health, cardiovascular risk, and quality of life in those completing the intervention.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver condition worldwide, affecting an estimated 20%–33% of the population in Western countries (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This condition is directly linked to chronic excess calorie consumption, lack of physical activity/exercise and overweight/obesity. NAFLD is a spectrum of liver disease ranging from isolated fatty liver through to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis. Dual biopsy studies indicate that approximately 40% of patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver fibrosis (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Ultimately, 5%–11% develop advanced liver disease and have the potential to develop cirrhotic complications (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As a result, NASH is a common indication for liver transplantation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Stage of liver fibrosis is a strong predictor of both liver-related and all-cause mortality in patients with NAFLD (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). As such, a therapy that could halt or reverse liver fibrosis might reduce risk of liver-related complications.</p>
              <p>In the absence of approved pharmaceutical agents, lifestyle modification, involving weight loss, is the primary recommended therapy for NAFLD (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and a weight loss goal of 10% is recommended for patients with advanced NAFLD (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A 2015 study found that 90% of participants losing &gt;10% body weight had resolution of steatohepatitis and 81% showed improvement in fibrosis (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, only 10% of those participants maintained 10% weight loss at 1 year. A randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of weight loss on NASH (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported a relationship between percent weight loss and improvement in NAFLD activity score (NAS). Participants who achieved weight loss of &gt;7% had significant histological improvements in steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning injury, and NAS when compared with those losing &lt;7%. No change in fibrosis scores were reported, and mean weight loss in the intervention arm was 9.3%. These studies highlight the need for acceptable alternative interventions to elicit sustained weight loss of greater magnitude in a larger proportion of individuals.</p>
              <p>Very low calorie diets (VLCDs) have demonstrated to be a viable treatment strategy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Research has shown that VLCDs are effective for achieving substantial weight loss, with high levels of adherence and low levels of attrition in overweight and obese people with T2DM (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A large randomized controlled trial of VLCD (DiRECT) conducted in primary care involving patients with T2DM found that 24% of those in the intervention group lost ≥15 kg and mean body weight fell by 10 kg at 1-year follow-up (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition to this study reporting sustained weight loss, 46% of participants had normalization of blood glucose control. Another study showed that 45% of obese patients undertaking a 12-week VLCD maintained ≥10% weight loss at 1-year follow-up (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Research suggests that VLCD might also have a positive impact on fatty liver. A small study in patients with T2DM (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) found that individuals treated with VLCD had a reduction in liver fat (measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy) from 13% to 3%. Despite these findings, the VLCD approach has not been formally assessed as a treatment strategy for NAFLD. The totality of these changes could be beneficial to patients with NAFLD in reversing liver disease or halting disease progression and reducing other obesity-related risk factors.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of this study was to determine whether a minimum 8-week VLCD is a feasible and acceptable therapy to achieve a target weight loss of 10% in patients with clinically significant NAFLD and whether weight loss could be maintained for at least 6 months after completion of the VLCD. Secondary outcome data were collected to explore the potential effects of the VLCD on factors that influence the development and progression of NAFLD. However, these outcomes were exploratory.</p>

              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>Recruitment and patients</title>
                <p>Forty-five patients with a diagnosis of clinically significant NAFLD and a body mass index (BMI) &gt;27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were approached to take part in the study. Thirty patients agreed and were subsequently recruited from hepatology clinics within the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from January to July 2019. To facilitate recruitment, clinically significant NAFLD was defined using imaging evidence of steatosis plus an indeterminate or high NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) (≥−1.455) or Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) (≥1.3 if age &lt;65 years; ≥2.0 if age ≥65 years) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) or histological evidence of NASH with fibrosis. By including patients with “indeterminate/high risk” NAFLD without a liver biopsy, the pool of eligible patients was substantially increased, and this also meant that the results of the study were applicable to a wider NAFLD population. Patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score &lt;7) were also eligible to participate. Other inclusion criteria specified age ≥18 years, weight stability (±3%) since biopsy/noninvasive assessment of liver health, and capacity to provide informed consent.</p>

In addition, patients were encouraged to eat 3 portions (240 g) of nonstarchy vegetables and drink at least 2 L of water or calorie-free beverages each day. One-to-one support was provided weekly throughout the VLCD phase by a tailored combination of phone calls, emails, and face-to-face appointments to maximize adherence to the protocol and to minimize drop out.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Weight loss achieved through lifestyle behavior change is currently the recommended first-line treatment for NAFLD. Previous studies have shown that, if successful, these changes can improve liver histology and reduce risk of disease progression (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, few patients (10%) achieve the recommended target of sustained weight loss of &gt;10% using standard lifestyle interventions (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. This study shows that a VLCD intervention is an acceptable and a feasible method to enable significant sustainable weight loss in obese individuals with NAFLD. Overall, 90% of those enrolled completed the VLCD phase of the intervention and 59% of completers achieved ≥10% weight loss post-VLCD. Importantly, a large proportion of the whole cohort (34%) maintained ≥10% weight loss for at least 6 months after completing the VLCD intervention. Absolute weight losses were impressive, with a mean loss of 10.3 kg at 9-month follow-up consistent with previous studies of VLCD (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). This compares favorably to a study of standard clinical care (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that VLCD is a viable treatment option for some patients with NAFLD to enable significant weight loss. Despite the potentially perceived drastic nature of the intervention, recruitment to the study was straightforward; 30 patients were recruited at a single site within 6 months, and 67% of patients offered the opportunity to take part in the study were enrolled.</p>
              <p>Previous studies of VLCD have largely been conducted in individuals with obesity and T2DM, and these have consistently shown that a VLCD can facilitate weight loss, and this was associated with reversal of diabetes in 46% of participants (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Although it is acknowledged that many of the diabetic patients taking part in DiRECT would have had diagnosed or undiagnosed NAFLD, they were enrolled on the basis of treating their T2DM. Our research suggests that the motivations for uptake of the VLCD by patients with NAFLD are different than those of patients with T2DM (i.e. those embarking on a VLCD for T2DM). This is largely because NAFLD is less well understood by patients and does not raise the same level of concern (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). To date, the use, acceptability, and feasibility of the VLCD with patients with NAFLD has not been explored. Therefore, it was important to establish these important outcomes before trialing the intervention to assess the impact on clinical outcomes. In this study, patients with fibrotic NAFLD were included because these individuals are at risk of progression to cirrhosis. Significant improvements in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) were seen at the end of the VLCD phase, and this was maintained at 9-month follow-up. Previous studies assessing vitamin E and obeticholic acid showed that falls in ALT were associated with improvements in hepatic inflammation, so it is likely that improvements in liver enzymes associated with the VLCD indicate improved liver health of these individuals. In addition, liver stiffness significantly improved at 9-month follow-up, providing further evidence of improved liver health.</p>
              <p>Although NAFLD is a disease of the liver, CVD is the most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD, accounting for approximately 40% of deaths (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this study, there were improvements in the patients' cardiometabolic status after the VLCD, with significant reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and 10-year CVD risk, and improved blood glucose control. These findings were consistent with previous studies of the VLCD (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). By contrast, other drugs that have shown benefit in NASH, such as vitamin E and obeticholic acid, have not shown to have a positive effect on cardiometabolic status. Moreover, use of obeticholic acid in patients with NASH was associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol within the first month of treatment (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, 1 week into the VLCD, there was a significant increase in serum ALT and AST in participants, which returned to baseline by week 4, and transaminases level fell thereafter. The cause of this acute increase in transaminases was not determined. One potential mechanistic explanation might be that rapid weight loss increases lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in high levels of circulating free fatty acids that are taken up by the liver. These free fatty acids might cause lipotoxicity in hepatocytes leading to apoptosis and cell death and a consequent increase in liver enzymes. This pathophysiology of this phenomenon requires further investigation.</p>
              <p>At baseline, the mean BMI of our cohort was 42 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (morbidly obese), and this reduced to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 9 months after the intervention, meaning most of the were still obese. Despite this, there were significant improvements in liver and cardiometabolic health in the cohort even though patients did not achieve a “normal” BMI. This is an extremely important message to relay to patients who might feel that reaching a normal BMI is unachievable. A weight loss target of &gt;10%, with appropriate support, might be a more realistic goal that can have significant health benefits. Previously, there have been concerns that VLCD interventions might induce or increase sarcopenia among cohorts of overweight and obese patients (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In our study, there was no significant change in skeletal muscle mass after the VLCD, although this had decreased slightly at 9-month follow-up. This highlights the importance of monitoring muscle mass closely during and after a VLCD intervention and encouraging patients to increase their physical activity/exercise levels during the food reintroduction and weight maintenance phases and to maintain this in the long term to avoid sarcopenia.</p>
              <p>In addition to improving liver and cardiometabolic health, it would be advantageous for a treatment for NAFLD to improve QoL because previous studies have shown that patients with NAFLD report significantly impaired QoL. A recent study indicated a negative correlation between QoL and obesity, T2DM, and dyslipidemia in a population with NAFLD (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Therefore, a treatment option that significantly reduced patients' weight to improve obesity and associated comorbidities would be worthwhile to improve QoL. Data have also shown that populations with NAFLD are more likely to report burdens related to bodily pain, anxiety, shortness of breath, and an overall impairment in daily physical function (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Importantly, in this study, we found that there were significant improvements in QoL and there was a decrease in weight-related symptoms. Improvements in QoL after an intervention are very important, over and above improving liver and cardiometabolic health, because they might promote greater adherence to a treatment in the longer term as patients notice a benefit in their day-to-day life (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). It is worth highlighting that our sample included a large proportion of patients who had previously received advice to lose weight without success. Therefore, there is a case to be made for presenting patients with VLCD as a treatment option—i.e., it might not necessarily be those who are most motivated who engage with this approach, but it might be a case of preference and the desire for rapid weight loss outcomes.</p>
              <p>A feature of this study is that patients were not required to have a liver biopsy for inclusion in the study, which increases the widespread applicability of the findings. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD with an indeterminate NFS or FIB-4 score were eligible. These criteria were chosen because previous studies have shown that both the NFS and FIB-4 predict long-term outcomes, and patients with NAFLD and indeterminate or high scores have increased risk of liver-related and all-cause mortality. Therefore, these inclusion criteria are likely to have identified individuals in need for treatment of their NAFLD. Moreover, by contrast to many of the currently recruiting trials of pharmaceutical agents, our eligibility criteria were very inclusive and allowed patients with comorbidities, such as poorly controlled diabetes and/or morbid obesity, to take part. This means that the results of this study might be more generalizable to real populations with NAFLD where patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, when compared with some studies of pharmaceutical agents.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>We have presented the findings of a feasibility study designed to assess acceptability and feasibility of the VLCD intervention for achieving &gt;10% weight loss and associated study procedures. Therefore, the results of the secondary outcomes should be considered exploratory, that is, the study was uncontrolled and not powered to detect changes in secondary outcomes. Although it is acknowledged that a pilot randomized controlled trial design would have allowed us to explore estimates of variability, it was important to assess acceptability and feasibility before committing resource to a study involving a larger sample of participants. Now that we have established the intervention is acceptable and feasible, we can proceed with a pilot randomized controlled trial to rehearse a future main trial. Second, noninvasive tests rather than liver biopsy were used for inclusion of participants and monitoring of liver outcomes in the study, and as such, we were only able to report a global assessment of liver health using liver enzymes and liver stiffness measurement and were unable to report whether the improvements were in steatosis, hepatic inflammation, or fibrosis. We acknowledge that the NFS and FIB-4 are better tools for excluding fibrosis (as opposed to ruling in fibrosis) but were used as a pragmatic way to recruit patients with clinically significant NAFLD, alongside imaging, in the absence of liver biopsy. The outcomes selected mirror those recorded during routine clinical practice; thus, we did not include a precise measure of liver fat. We acknowledge the issues concerning the reliability of FibroScan to measure liver stiffness in obese patients (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>); however, this approach represents current clinical practice. Third, a significant proportion of patients (33%) were lost to follow-up at 9 months, and data on their outcomes were limited (although we did have follow-up data for weight). We were, therefore, unable to accurately describe all ITT outcomes for the whole population. Furthermore, if all outcomes for patients were included, overall cardiometabolic and liver outcomes might have been less pronounced. Fourth, patients on insulin for diabetes were excluded, which represents a significant proportion of the population with NAFLD. The decision to exclude patients on insulin was taken to ensure safety because rapid weight loss can cause hypoglycemia. Fifth, one of the primary objectives of this study was to assess the proportion of patients willing to undertake the VLCD as a treatment for NAFLD; however, it is likely to be a selection bias with clinicians potentially approaching more motivated patients. This could have contributed to the successful outcomes. Finally, the length of VLCD phase was not standardized, and participants could extend the intervention from 8 to 12 weeks if there were mitigating circumstances, and this allowed some participants to optimize their weight loss outcomes. Given that intervention effects started to wear off toward the end of the follow-up period, it is likely that 6-month postintervention follow-up is insufficient to assess weight loss maintenance. Further work is needed to assess outcomes in a larger cohort in a real-world setting using VLCD interventions of varying length.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Overall, this study showed that delivery of a VLCD is feasible, acceptable, and potential treatment option for some individuals with NAFLD, with a significant proportion of those who complete the intervention achieving &gt;10% weight loss and maintaining it at 9-month follow-up. Importantly, the weight losses achieved in this study exceed those reported for standard clinical care. Improvements were also observed in liver health, metabolic control, cardiovascular risk, and QoL in those completing the intervention at 9-month follow-up. A VLCD intervention offers a holistic treatment option that could be incorporated as part of clinical care for some patients with NAFLD.</p>
