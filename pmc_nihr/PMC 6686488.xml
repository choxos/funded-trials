                  <p id="Par1">Prolonged acute hospital stays are a major problem for older people and for health services. Failure to effectively manage the psychological and social aspects of illness is an important cause of prolonged hospital stays. Proactive Psychological Medicine (PPM) is a new way of providing psychiatry services to medical wards. PPM is proactive, focussed, intensive and integrated with medical care. A major aim of PPM is to reduce the time older people spend in hospital because of unmanaged psychological and social problems. The HOME Study will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PPM.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A two-arm parallel-group randomised controlled superiority trial, with a linked health economic analysis and an embedded process evaluation, will be conducted at three sites. A total of 3588 participants will be recruited and randomised to usual care or usual care plus PPM. The primary outcome is the number of days spent as an inpatient in a general hospital in the month (30 days) post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for each participant (measured at 1 and 3 months) include quality of life, independent functioning, symptoms of anxiety and depression, cognitive function, and their experience of the hospital stay.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The trial has been designed to produce findings that are generalisable to all older medical inpatients (including those with cognitive impairment). It will provide information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PPM, which we hope will be of value to patients, clinicians, managers and service planners.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Prolonged acute hospital stays are a major problem for older people and for health services. In the UK, National Health Service (NHS) acute hospitals have more than two million unplanned admissions of people aged 65 and older every year. The greater length of stay of older patients means that these admissions account for most (70%) of the available emergency bed days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Excessive time in hospital is bad for patients: it leads to hospital-acquired illnesses, demoralisation and loss of independence after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also bad for the hospitals as it reduces the availability of beds for other people and increases costs. For these reasons, health services are seeking to reduce the time older people spend in hospital and to improve out of hospital care. A recent review of organisational interventions to reduce length of stay in hospital found that, whilst many of the initiatives that aimed to achieve this showed promise, none were of proven effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">The reasons for prolonged hospital stays include not only the complexity of older patients’ medical problems, but also inadequately managed psychological and social problems. The psychological problems include psychiatric illnesses such as delirium, dementia and depression as well as minor cognitive impairment or anxiety, all of which may slow patients’ discharge from hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The social problems include delays in organising post-discharge care arrangements, family members’ expectations or concerns about where the patient will go when they leave hospital, and miscommunications and conflicts about discharge planning within the clinical team. Failure to effectively manage these problems is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">These psychological and social problems are usually addressed by providing a type of psychiatric care to medical wards called liaison psychiatry. Liaison psychiatry services consequently have the potential to reduce the time that older people spend in hospital. However, they currently have limited ability to do this because: (a) they operate using a referral model and therefore see only the small minority of patients identified as having obvious psychiatric problems by medical teams, (b) they do not have a consistent focus on reducing time in hospital, (c) their contributions to the care of these patients is typically limited to consultations and advice and (d) they have limited integration with the patient’s clinical team. Perhaps not surprisingly, the current evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such services is very limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">We have developed a new service model called Proactive Psychological Medicine (PPM), which aims to be more effective in reducing time in hospital. The new model aims to address the limitations of the current approach: (a) it is proactive in seeing all admitted patients (building on the experience of a proactive psychiatric consultation service initiated in Yale Newhaven Hospital in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), (b) it takes a broad biopsychosocial approach focussing on facilitating prompt discharge, (c) it provides an intensive contribution to care with comprehensive consultant assessment and daily follow-up and (d) it is integrated, with PPM clinicians working as members of the patient’s extended medical team. We have piloted this new PPM service model and found it to be both feasible and acceptable in an NHS general hospital setting.</p>
              <p id="Par9">The HOME Study aims to determine whether adding PPM to usual care reduces the time spent by older patients in acute hospital wards in the month (30 days) after randomisation (primary outcome), when compared with usual care alone. A number of secondary outcomes, including patients’ views of their length of time in hospital and their quality of life will also be evaluated. We will also determine the cost-effectiveness of adding PPM to usual care.</p>

For the primary outcome (number of days spent in hospital in the 30 days post-randomisation), the difference between the means with a 95% confidence interval will be reported. This will be obtained from a linear regression model. This model will include: (a) centre (Cambridge, Exeter or Oxford) by treatment interaction terms, (b) stratification factors (hospital, sex and age; which will be treated as continuous in the analysis model, but in three categories for stratification) as fixed effects and (c) wards as either fixed or random effects (the final choice being dependent on the number of wards included). The primary outcome will be a weighted mean of the three centre-specific treatment effects, with weights proportional to the number of people randomised at each centre. As a check on the robustness of results to normality assumptions, non-parametric bootstrap (bias corrected and accelerated, 2000 replications, with allowance for stratification) methodology will be used to construct the confidence interval. Secondary continuous outcomes will be analysed in an analogous fashion to the primary outcome. For binary outcomes, odds ratios will be estimated. These will be obtained from logistic regression models (with adjustment for stratification factors). The effect measure will be the exponent of the weighted means of the three centre-specific log odds ratios, reported as an adjusted odds ratio. Further secondary analysis will consider time until leaving hospital as a survival time, with adjusted Cox models used to estimate hazard ratios. The effect measure will be the exponent of the weighted means of the three centre-specific log hazard ratios, reported as an adjusted hazard ratio. </p>

The DMC will focus on the number of participant deaths that occur within 30 days of trial enrolment. Interim analyses of the primary outcome data will not be undertaken because these require data that will not be available during the relatively short recruitment period. There are, therefore, no statistical stopping rules for this trial related to the primary outcome and the DMC will recommend stopping only on safety grounds.

              <p id="Par96">A major consideration in the design of this trial was whether to use cluster or individual randomisation. Cluster randomisation was considered on the basis that PPM teams work in an integrated way with patients' other hospital clinicians and there is a potential for usual care to be contaminated by elements of PPM. However, we concluded that individual randomisation was most suitable because:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par97">PPM is designed to affect patient care at the individual level and delivered with this in mind (e.g. PPM teams work in collaboration with other clinical staff but do not provide formal education or seek to change the way a ward operates).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par98">Contamination is likely to be minimal because PPM is so dissimilar to traditional liaison psychiatry consultations that participants allocated to usual care would only receive it if a major change were to occur in the configuration of existing services.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par99">There is no clearly appropriate natural cluster (e.g. a ward) because hospitals are organised differently. Some have ward-based medical teams, whereas others have teams that are responsible for patients admitted during the course of a given period (on-take teams).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par100">If we randomised wards, these would be open clusters. The ward’s allocation to PPM or usual care would be known to clinical staff and might influence which patients they admitted to each ward.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par101">We have, therefore, elected to use individual randomisation and to take precautions to limit contamination, including ensuring that ward teams understand the need to adhere to randomised patient allocation and the separation of PPM teams from those delivering liaison psychiatry services as part of usual care.</p>
              <p id="Par102">We also carefully considered which measures should be used. The primary outcome uses routinely collected data and therefore neither places a burden on participants nor depends on their ability to respond to questions from a researcher. We conducted pilot work to ensure the secondary outcome measures would be suitable for unwell older people who may have cognitive impairment. They were chosen for their suitability to be delivered by telephone or face to face, and to proxies when participants are unable to provide data.</p>
              <p id="Par103">The trial aims to provide robust information on the role of psychiatry in the care of older medical inpatients, which we hope will be of value to patients, clinicians, managers and service planners.</p>
