                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">A colorectal resection is standard treatment for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the procedure results in significant post-operative mortality and reduced quality of life. Maximising pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness could improve post-surgical outcomes. PREPARE-ABC is a multi-centre, three-armed, randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of exercise interventions, with motivational support on short and longer-term recovery outcomes in CRC patients undergoing major lower-gastrointestinal surgery. The trial included an internal pilot phase with parallel process evaluation. The aim of the process evaluation was to optimise intervention implementation for the main trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Mixed methods process evaluation conducted in 14 UK hospitals between November 2016 and March 2018. Data included a site profile questionnaire and telephone scoping interview with hospital staff, 34 qualitative observations of standard care and 14 observations of intervention delivery, 13 semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 28 semi-structured interviews with patients. Data analysis focused on describing intervention delivery within each arm, assessing fidelity, acceptability and how variation in delivery was linked to contextual characteristics.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Standard care exercise advice was typically limited to maintaining current activity levels, and with lead-in time to surgery affecting whether any exercise advice was provided. Variation in HCP capacity affected the ability of colorectal units to deploy staff to deliver the intervention. Patients’ exercise history and motivation prior to surgery influenced HCP perceptions and delivery of the motivational components. Observations indicated a high level of fidelity to delivery of the exercise interventions. All but one of the 28 interviewed patients reported increasing exercise levels as a result of receiving the intervention, with most finding them motivational and greatly valuing the enhanced level of social support (versus standard care) provided by staff.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Hospital-supervised and home-based exercise interventions were highly acceptable for most patients undergoing surgery for CRC. Delivery of pre- and post-operative exercise within the CRC care pathway is feasible but systematic planning of capacity and resources is required to optimise implementation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth commonest cancer in the UK, with 40,000 patients diagnosed per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The current standard, and best-proven treatment for this patient group is a surgical resection with approximately 25,000 patients in the UK undergoing a major abdominal resection each year. Colorectal resection offers the best chance of cancer survival, with a 90-day post-operative mortality of 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Considerable research has focussed on improving post-surgical outcomes. Studies have reported an association between cardiopulmonary fitness and post-operative recovery outcomes in cancer patients, including those undergoing colorectal resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This suggests that maximising pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness could improve post-surgical outcomes. However, delivery within cancer care pathways and adoption by patients presents challenges within resource-constrained healthcare systems. Variability of implementation across different NHS contexts, and where the interventions are being delivered by multiple individuals, provides an additional layer of complexity. Process evaluation is therefore critical for understanding how exercise interventions can be effectively implemented within hospital settings, by assessing the extent to which they are implemented as intended, identifying reasons for variation in delivery and specifying the circumstances under which the intervention is likely to succeed.</p>
              <p id="Par14">The process evaluation reported here formed part of the pilot phase of PREPARE-ABC, a multi-centred, three-armed, randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of exercise interventions, with motivational support on short and longer-term recovery outcomes in CRC patients undergoing major lower-gastrointestinal surgery. The trial included an internal pilot phase to allow an assessment of stop/go criteria for progression to a full trial. The aim of the process evaluation was to identify recommendations for improving intervention delivery within the main trial. A full protocol of the trial is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Here, we describe the organisational context of the hospital sites delivering the PREPARE-ABC exercise interventions, the nature of standard care, how staff organised intervention delivery within their particular care setting and how patients experienced the intervention.</p>

                <p id="Par16">The delivery of the exercise interventions was underpinned by self-determination theory (SDT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] which aims to develop an individual’s motivation towards sustainable behaviour change, achieved by satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs – to feel autonomous, competent and related (having a sense of belonging). Participants randomised to one of the exercise interventions attended an initial 45-min counselling session at their treating hospital to initiate this process of self-determination, followed by face-to-face exercise sessions in the hospital-supervised arm, and motivational telephone calls in the home-supported arm.</p>
                <p id="Par17">There were pre- and post-operative phases to intervention delivery and participants randomised to one of the exercise interventions were asked to follow a structured exercise programme during both of these phases. After the initial counselling session, patients in the hospital-supervised arm were asked to attend up to three aerobic interval exercise sessions per week on a cycle ergometer over the 3–4 weeks prior to surgery, plus two home-based resistance exercise sessions per week using resistance bands. Patients randomised to the home-supported arm were asked to comply with current public health physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] by engaging in at least 150 min of moderate-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise per week (e.g., brisk walking/jogging/cycling/ swimming), as well as completing two weekly sessions of resistance exercise using resistance bands. Six weeks after surgery, patients in the hospital-supervised arm were offered monthly “booster” supervised exercise sessions at the hospital, whilst those in the home-supported arm received monthly 15 min telephone counselling calls to support continued engagement in their programme. In the post-operative phase, both groups were encouraged to comply with current public health physical activity guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients randomised to the control arm received standard care, which did not include formalised pre- and post-operative support for undertaking exercise.

                <p id="Par18">MRC guidance on process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was used to design a mixed methods process evaluation during the pilot phase of PREPARE-ABC. The process evaluation aimed to: 1) describe the wider context into which the interventions were introduced and the nature of standard care; 2) assess how the exercise interventions were delivered and fidelity to the intervention protocol; 3) assess patients’ and staff experiences and acceptability of the interventions; and 4) assess any variation in non-receipt of the interventions in the control arm and any sources of contamination. Here, we focus on the first three of these objectives, in order to make recommendations on how to implement the exercise interventions in hospitals more widely. Methods and results have been described using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par19">Data were collected from the first cohort of 14 hospitals participating in the trial, using a site profile questionnaire to collect quantitative data on characteristics (Supplementary File 1) of each colorectal unit; a telephone scoping interview with hospital staff collecting quantitative and qualitative data on standard care patient pathways (Supplementary File 2); qualitative researcher observations of standard care consultations and intervention sessions; and qualitative semi-structured interviews with staff and patients.

                <p id="Par20">Participants were aged 18 years or over and were undergoing surgery for CRC. HCPs were those with a role in providing CRC care, including colorectal nurse specialists (CNS), consultant colorectal surgeons, physiotherapists, research practitioners, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) technicians and exercise practitioners. There were two streams of patient and staff recruitment for the process evaluation:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par21">To evaluate the wider context into which the interventions were introduced, a sample of patients were recruited before the internal pilot trial commenced. Patients requiring surgery for colorectal cancer were approached by staff for written consent to allow a researcher to observe their pre- and post-operative consultations received as standard care. Research staff approached members of staff to advise them that participation was optional and to obtain consent where appropriate. Patients and accompanying adults recruited via this stream were not recruited to the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Patients and staff who had already provided consent to participate in the trial were approached to participate in an observation, or interview (3–6 months following surgery), about their experience of the intervention or standard care. Participants were provided with additional written information, informed that participation was optional and their informed consent secured.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par23">Delays in site set-up and recruitment, and logistical challenges of observing exercise intervention sessions necessitated design changes to the sampling strategy. Instead of purposively sampling patients and staff across all 14 hospitals, we obtained a convenience sample within eight of the 14 participating sites, comprising: 16 patients and 23 clinicians across four hospitals who had at least one pre- and/or post-operative standard care consultation observed; eight patients and five clinicians across five hospitals who had at least one intervention session observed; 13 clinicians across seven hospitals who were interviewed about delivering the intervention; and 28 patients across seven hospitals who were interviewed about their experience of the intervention or standard care (hospital-supervised arm = 10; home-supported arm = 13; standard care = 5). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> provides a breakdown of characteristics of patient participants randomised to each trial arm.

Telephone scoping interviews with staff were conducted at all 14 hospitals, nine of whom completed and returned the site profile questionnaires. A total of 34 consultations of standard care were observed across the patient journey, totalling 13 ½ hours of observation time, including pre-operative consultations for diagnosis, pre-operative assessments, CPET appointments and post-operative consultations with a surgeon or CNS. These observations were designed to deepen our understanding of the wider context into which the intervention was being implemented, identify differences in practice between the trial interventions and standard care, including insight into what specific information was provided regarding exercise, and to establish what changes would be required within sites to deliver the exercise interventions.

                <p id="Par25">A total of 14 observations of intervention delivery were carried out across five sites, totalling 13 h of observation time. Eight patients were observed. One patient was observed on five occasions and one on three occasions. The remaining patients were observed once. A range of professionals were observed delivering the counselling and exercise sessions, including two physiotherapists, one research practitioner, one exercise practitioner and one colorectal consultant. A semi-structured guide was used for all observations, requiring the researcher to take fieldnotes of how different consultation activities were structured, delivered by staff and responded to by patients.</p>
                <p id="Par26">A semi-structured interview schedule was used to guide the 13 staff interviews which aimed to cover experiences and perceptions of delivering the different components of the counselling and exercise sessions, organisational and individual barriers and facilitators of delivery, and views of how patients responded to motivational and exercise elements of the intervention. Staff included nine research practitioners, three physiotherapists and one exercise practitioner. The 28 patient interviews were semi-structured around a topic guide designed to explore the patient’s experience of participating in the trial, their experiences of being diagnosed with and receiving treatment for colorectal cancer, previous habits, motivation for exercise and behaviour change, following participation in the study. Patients were typically interviewed at home, 3–6 months following surgery. Data were primarily collected by AV (Social Scientist) supported by JMc (Colorectal Research Nurse) and JM (Social Scientist). AV, JMc and JM had no involvement in the running of the main PREPARE-ABC trial or delivery of the intervention. All procedures for data collection, analysis and write-up of the process evaluation was conducted independently from delivery of the main trial.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par27">Audio recordings of qualitative interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. A deductive coding framework was then used to structure thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] of transcripts (Supplementary File 3), an appropriate approach where specific questions about intervention components were identified a priori, in this case how the different elements of the counselling and exercise sessions were delivered by staff and received by patients. Transcripts were also analysed inductively to allow unanticipated themes to be identified, using techniques of constant comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to identify themes relevant to delivery, fidelity and acceptability, including searching for disconfirming cases and any themes not captured by the coding framework. Qualitative fieldnotes from observations were analysed to provide a description of standard care, or intervention delivery and fidelity, and for how variation in delivery was linked to relevant contextual features within sites.</p>
                <p id="Par28">To interpret intervention fidelity, we examined how the sequence, structure and delivery of intervention sessions corresponded to delivery set out in the intervention manual, documenting a description of how each activity was carried out, noting any deviations from the protocol. We then triangulated these descriptions with perspectives of delivery reported in interviews in order to identify evidence of variation from our interpretation of fidelity and how delivery needed to adapt according to the patient and circumstances of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Conversely, to interpret acceptability of the intervention we analysed interview transcripts to look for points of convergence and divergence between participants regarding each intervention component. We then triangulated our interpretations (manifested as themes) with observational fieldnotes to assess the extent to which views of acceptability were evident in how the practitioner and patient negotiated each activity within the intervention session, for example looking for evidence that patients were engaged whilst carrying out aerobic activity on the cycle ergometer.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Analysis was undertaken by AV and JMc, whose respective backgrounds provided points of convergence and divergence in interpretation. Disagreements were resolved through validating within and between interview transcripts and observational fieldnotes, and where possible with participants. Quantitative data collected from site profile questionnaires and telephone scoping interviews were analysed to provide descriptive statistics of each colorectal unit. All data were triangulated to generate a ‘thick description’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] of how each arm of the study was delivered, maintained and experienced by staff and patients. The analysis of the interview and observational data was therefore iterative, with knowledge gained from observations of both standard care and intervention delivery used to strengthen the interview topic guide and provide additional insights during analysis.</p>

                  <p id="Par36">Patients saw a range of professionals pre-operatively. Staff at all 14 sites reported it was standard care for patients to attend a diagnosis appointment with a consultant colorectal surgeon and see a CNS pre-operatively. In 12 out of 14 sites, patients also attended a pre-assessment clinic, which usually included an appointment with an anaesthetist. We identified only one site where patients saw a physiotherapist prior to surgery. The primary purpose of the pre-operative appointments was to inform patients of their diagnosis, and discuss their treatment plan and surgical options. The pre-operative sessions were also an opportunity for HCPs to advise patients to get themselves as medically fit as possible prior to surgery, referring patients back to their GP or a specialist to treat any underlying medical conditions. Fifty percent of sites stated that patients were routinely offered advice about exercise in the pre-operative phase. However, while it was emphasised that fitness was important for surgery outcomes, we found that patients were not encouraged to increase activity levels.<disp-quote><p id="Par37">CNS: <italic>“What keeps you busy?”</italic></p><p id="Par38">Patient: <italic>“Golf, snooker and TV”</italic></p><p id="Par39">CNS suggests “<italic>carrying on as normal.”</italic></p><p id="Par40">(Observation, Pre-operative appointment, CNS)</p></disp-quote>Nine out of 14 sites reported that patients completed a CPET in order to assess their fitness prior to surgery. Typically, CPETs appeared to function purely as a mechanism for the anaesthetist to determine the patient’s fitness for surgery.

                  <p id="Par44">Patients were routinely transferred to a high dependency unit for the first 24 h following surgery. At all sites, once patients were transferred to the ward, they were seen by a CNS at least once. At 13 out of 14 sites, patients were seen by a physiotherapist (including non-colorectal cancer physiotherapists) to provide support with mobility and respiratory health. The number of visits by the physiotherapist during the patient’s hospital stay ranged from daily to only one occasion and focussed on patient’s fitness for discharge.</p>
                  <p id="Par45">In contrast to pre-operative advice, patients received more targeted guidance on the importance of activity following surgery: <italic>“Both operations come with some kind of risks and it’s important that we go through those.”</italic> The surgeon explains that there is a risk of post-operative bleeding and clots in the legs and lung, and to prevent that: <italic>“we bully you a bit to get you up and moving as soon as possible after the operation.”</italic> (Observation, Diagnosis appointment, Surgeon).</p>
                  <p id="Par46">Clinical advice on the importance of activity was reinforced with leaflets detailing post-treatment rehabilitation courses tailored to the individual recovering from cancer treatment. However, advice was delivered as a general suggestion rather than a prescribed and systematic exercise regimen and there was no evidence of staff attempting to encourage exercise targets or support the patient’s motivation to exercise.</p>

                  <p id="Par49">Motivating such patients required practitioners to deploy sophisticated communication skills as illustrated in the following interaction between a physiotherapist and patient:<disp-quote><p id="Par50">Physiotherapist (Ph): <italic>“Are you doing any activity at the moment?”</italic></p><p id="Par51">Patient (Pt): <italic>“Um, no, no not since I had to have my dog put down, no … I was walking with him.”</italic></p><p id="Par52">Ph: <italic>“But since then not much of anything?”</italic></p><p id="Par53">Pt: <italic>“No.”</italic></p><p id="Par54">Ph: <italic>“O.k. that’s fine.

Patients supported their claims by citing numbers of steps walked, providing information regarding previous and current exercise levels and showing the interviewer their completed exercise diaries.

Our data revealed how acceptability of the exercise interventions could not be isolated from the wider context of delivering the intervention within busy hospital settings. Themes of acceptability therefore represent this relationship, representing perspectives of intervention components and the ability to implement in everyday clinical practice.

                  <p id="Par70">Despite many patients reporting being active and having motivation to exercise prior to participating in the trial, there was evidence that patients experienced the exercise sessions as motivational.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par80">PREPARE-ABC is a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial aimed at investigating the clinical health benefits and cost-effectiveness of hospital-supervised and home-supported exercise programmes delivered as part of CRC care pathways within UK NHS Foundation Trusts. The trial has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, in which a parallel process evaluation component aims to explore the barriers and facilitators to implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on these findings it appears that the interventions in PREPARE-ABC offer a clear and distinct approach to promoting exercise that was not observed in the delivery of standard care at any of the sites included in our sample. Although there was evidence that exercise within the context of daily activity was encouraged at some sites, this was typically limited to encouraging ongoing routine physical activity. During the pre-operative phase, advice, when given, was very general and focused on maintaining current activity levels. Similarly, post-operative advice was typically concerned with helping patients to return to their pre-operative levels of health and activity.</p>
              <p id="Par81">In our observations of standard care consultations, we did not identify staff attempting to provide support for exercise targets or motivating patients to exercise, and this probably reflects logistical challenges associated with providing exercise support within the resource-constrained NHS. The difficulty of engaging busy HCPs with many competing priorities in exercise provision cannot be overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, the short time period prior to CRC surgery presents a significant challenge for exercise prehabilitation. Targets set by NHS England dictate that following general practitioner referral for a suspected cancer, patients are to be investigated within 31 days and treated within 62 days, resulting in a time-window between decision to operate and surgery of 31 days (though this can vary due to medical decisions and availability of operating slots). Our process evaluation provides confirmatory evidence of these logistical challenges and suggests that hospitals need to implement systemic changes to effectively deliver pre- and post-operative exercise programmes with a motivational component. This will require planning to ensure pre-operative exercise is feasible given the short lead-in times to surgery and an assessment of capacity and resource allocation to provide dedicated exercise sessions within hospitals.</p>
              <p id="Par82">Staff successfully delivered each component of the hospital-supervised and home-supported exercise interventions, demonstrating a high level of fidelity to the intervention protocol. Patients also responded very positively to the exercise interventions, which suggests a good level of acceptability and potential effectiveness in scaled-up implementation. However, our findings clearly highlight the importance of HCPs tailoring the exercise counselling (motivational) aspects of the interventions according to patients’ exercise history and current level of motivation to increase activity levels. This evidence supports key tenets of SDT, specifically that the experience of patient autonomy and competence, in terms of previous exercise behaviours and self-efficacy, is critical for autonomous engagement which is ultimately associated with long term exercise participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par83">Participants also discussed the importance of socialisation and connection with the HCP (experiencing the need for relatedness), which is also associated with long-term behaviour change, in particular exercise uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This was evident for patients undertaking exercise sessions in the hospital-supervised arm as well as those receiving telephone counselling sessions in the home-supported exercise arm. In a similar way to the initial counselling sessions, HCPs need to flexibly deliver the supportive elements of these calls according to individual patient needs, thus supporting patient autonomy over their recovery and preventing exercise beyond their perceived capacity. However, the challenge lies in the extent to which HCPs can use the fundamental principles of motivational support to change patient behaviour in everyday cancer care settings and to consider which HCPs are best placed to do this; doctors, nurses, physiotherapists or other allied health care professionals. It is probable that hospitals will need to be pragmatic about which HCPs formally deliver the motivational sessions based on resources and availability, with constant re-enforcement with each HCP contact likely to be critical for improving effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par84">The findings from the process evaluation are limited by the available data, particularly the limited number of observations of intervention delivery. Delays in setting up sites for the main trial and process evaluation, compounded with a slow recruitment rate had an impact on our ability to purposively sample staff and patients and to obtain evidence from a range of appointments/sessions within each study arm. As a response, we focused on obtaining evidence across different data types within a more limited number of hospitals, enabling us to analyse data laterally to triangulate findings across staff and patient interviews, and observational fieldnotes. Future research should consider the relative risks and benefits of conducting process evaluation work during an internal pilot to optimise main trial implementation against later evaluation across a wider variation of participants and hospitals which might provide more in-depth insights into intervention delivery.</p>
                <p id="Par85">The sample included a high number of patients who reported already being motivated to exercise and carrying out a high level of exercise prior to participating in the trial. However, our main pilot study findings found that the majority of patients were only undertaking light intensity physical activity at the point of randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], suggesting that there was capacity for the intervention to motivate patients to increase activity levels. Our findings support this, the initial exercise counselling session provided a platform for nurturing autonomy and competency, while the ongoing social support sessions developed a sense of belonging, also deemed important for sustainable adherence to exercise interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The motivational component of exercise interventions embedded within cancer care pathways is therefore likely to be an important factor influencing the effectiveness of scaled-up NHS implementation beyond this research.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par86">This process evaluation provides evidence that hospital-supervised and home-supported exercise interventions delivered as part of the CRC care pathway are highly acceptable for many patients, and provide a motivational form of social support for helping to embed exercise in the patients’ preparation for surgical treatment and recovery. Appropriate communication skills are needed to ensure that motivational support is tailored to the individual, taking account of previous exercise behaviours and self-efficacy, to ensure patients feel adequately motivated and able to increase their activity levels. Delivery of hospital-supervised and home-supported exercise within the CRC pathway is feasible but systematic planning of capacity and resources is needed to optimise implementation. This may require significant changes to organisational and clinical delivery within colorectal units.</p>
