              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dental caries is the localized destruction of susceptible tooth tissues by acidic by-products from bacterial fermentation of dietary products[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In most high income countries caries in primary teeth is decreasing, but it is still common. 31% of 5 year olds in the UK experienced decay in 2013[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and similar rates exist in other European and North American countries[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are approximately 30,000 hospital admissions a year in the UK for dental related issues amongst children, with the majority of these being for treatment under general anesthetic (GA)[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Severe early childhood caries (S-ECC), an extreme presentation of childhood caries, is the most common reason for dental GA[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the risks of GA are low, there is substantial financial costs to the NHS and morbidity to the patient[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>The role of vitamin D in primary caries has been debated and two mechanisms by which vitamin D might influence caries have been suggested. Vitamin D is likely to act through the vitamin D receptor and polymorphisms within this gene have been associated with dental caries[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Low vitamin D may facilitate topical demineralizing of teeth, in a similar way to its known action on bone, via reduced concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions. Vitamin D may also modulate caries via immunological factors such as cathelicidins[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Vitamin D is recorded in blood by measuring 25(OH)D a precursor to the active form (1α, 25 hydroxyvitamin D).</p>
              <p>Epidemiological and intervention studies investigating this relationship have been of variable quality and reported contradictory findings[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An umbrella review and meta-analysis of vitamin D and its health benefits, highlighted vitamin D supplementation of children as an effective way to reduce primary caries (relative risk 0.53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43, 0.63)[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the author of the original review, that forms the majority of this evidence, described the findings as having low certainty and high sources of bias since few were randomized studies and most did not compare baseline characteristics or assess outcomes blind to interventions[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants known to be reliably associated with a risk factor of interest to derive estimates of the causal effect of that risk factor on health outcomes[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes <italic>CYP2R1</italic>, <italic>DHCR7</italic> and <italic>GC</italic> (rs10741657, rs7944926 and rs2282679) are associated with 25(OH)D concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CYP2R1 and DHCR7 encode proteins involved in the 25(OH)D synthetic pathway and GC encodes a 25(OH)D transport protein. The three SNPs are not thought to effect dental caries directly, other than via 25(OH)D. These SNPs have previously been used in MR studies to examine the causal effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cancer mortality and obesity in adults[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the difference in mean 25(OH)D between the minor and major homozygotes for the <italic>GC</italic> variant has been shown to be of a similar magnitude to that of supplementation[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study aims to investigate the relationships between 25(OH)D and childhood caries experience, onset and severity, as well as dental GA experience. Causal effects will be estimated by conducting MR using a genetic instrument to proxy the effect of 25(OH)D.</p>

                <p>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective cohort that recruited pregnant women living in the South West of England and who had expected delivery dates between April 1991 and December 1992[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Children of non-white ethnic origin as identified using genetic data were excluded from all analyses. Offspring dental health data was recorded both via one or more parent-reported questionnaires at 38, 54, 65 and 77 months and a child self-reported questionnaire at 91 months. A random 10% sample of ALSPAC children born in the last 6 months of the study (June–December 1992) were invited to take part in a sub-study called Children in Focus[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At 31, 43 and 61 months of age, these children underwent a dental examination with decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth (dmft) recorded[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The parents gave written informed consent to the participation of their children in the study. All aspects of the study were reviewed and approved by the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee, which is registered as an Institutional Review Board. (Approval was also obtained from the local research ethics committees, which are governed by the UK Department of Health.)

                <title>Measurement of 25(OH)D concentrations</title>
                <p>Measurement of 25(OH)D was done primarily on stored serum that had been collected at the 9 year follow-up assessment (mean age 9 years 9 months). If no samples were available from the assessment at age 9, samples from the 11-year assessment or the 7-year assessment were used. In total 6,504 children had a measure of serum 25(OH)D (4,441 from the 9 year assessment, 1,055 from the 7 year and 1,008 the 11 year assessment). The age range of the children with a vitamin D measure was 85 to 163 months.</p>
                <p>After collection, samples were immediately spun, frozen, and stored at −80°C. Assays were performed after a maximum of 12 years in storage with no previous freeze-thaw cycles. The 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> concentrations were measured with HPLC tandem mass spectrometry using internal standard in a laboratory meeting the performance target set by the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme Advisory Panel for 25(OH)D assays. Interassay coefficients of variation for the assay were less than 10% across a working range of 2.5–624 nmol/L for both 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated as the sum of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and adjusted for seasonality.</p>

                <title>Outcome variables</title>
                <p>Parental completed questionnaires obtained data on whether the child had ever had a filling or extraction; those who answered yes were defined has having experienced caries. It was not possible to obtain information on untreated decay from parental completed questionnaires. Child self reported questionnaires obtained data on if the child had ever had a filling, an extraction or had current untreated caries. Whether a child had received a GA for a dental extraction by 91 months was also recorded in both questionnaire types. The age of the child when the case-identifying questionnaire was completed was used as a measure of first caries experience. Questions from parental and child reported questionnaires are available in <xref rid="pone.0143769.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>. All participants had at least one parental reported and one child reported questionnaire, case status in either was used to identify a case. For the subgroup of children who were clinically assessed, evidence of untreated and treated caries were obtained and combined into a single variable representing examination assessed experience of caries. Severity of caries was recorded as dmft. For those with questionnaire and clinic assessment data (N = 624), caries experience was used to validate questionnaire data by identifying misclassified caries experience cases.</p>

                <title>Potential confounding factors</title>
                <p>Consistent with other studies we have previously shown that season, age, sex, pubertal status, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, time spent outdoors and body mass index (BMI) are related to 25(OH)D concentrations[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For BMI a previous MR study has shown that it causally influences 25(OH)D concentration[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and observational studies have reported associations between BMI and caries[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Of the remaining we considered that age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic position were also risk factors for dental caries and therefore confound the observational association. In this study we restricted analyses to participants who reported their ethnicity as “white”. Season of measurement of 25(OH)D was determined from the date at which the blood sample was obtained and values were adjusted for seasonality using a sine-cosine regression method as previously described[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Household occupational social class and maternal highest educational qualification were tested as measures of socioeconomic position with data on these obtained by questionnaire at recruitment of the mothers. Maternal educational qualification was found to have more of an effect than household occupational social class or both variables together, and therefore used alone in multivariable analyses. Sex was recorded at birth and age at the clinics when 25(OH)D was assessed. 25(OH)D and caries measurements were not recorded at the same time, the lag time between the last caries measure and the 25(OH)D measure was calculated.</p>

                <p>Multivariable regression analyses and MR instrumental variable analyses were employed to test observational and causal effects of the associations between 25(OH)D with dental caries outcomes. To explore the extent to which missing data might have biased our findings, we presented means (medians if the data were skewed) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables in the potentially available participants, participants involved in multivariate analysis and participants involved in MR analysis.</p>
                <p>In both multivariable regression and MR instrumental variable analyses we examined the relationship of 25(OH)D and seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D as continuous variables, examining the association of each greater 10 nmol/L 25(OH)D with outcomes, as in previous studies. In the multivariable regression analyses we also examined associations with 25(OH)D categorized as: sufficient (&gt;50 nmol/L), insufficient (30–49 nmol/L) and deficient (&lt;30nmol/L)[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

                <p>In the subset of participants with both clinical and questionnaire dental data we used a T-test to compare mean 25(OH)D between correctly and incorrectly classified cases.</p>
                <p>We examined the associations of potential confounding factors with 25(OH)D categories and also with the SNP genotypes by presenting means or proportions by categories of 25(OH)D and genotype and using an F-test or χ<sup>2</sup> to test for differences. Our a priori assumption was that 25(OH)D categories would be related to many of the confounders whereas the SNPs would not.</p>

                  <p>Logistic regression was used to examine the association of 25(OH)D (continuous or categorical variable) with caries experience, dental GA, caries onset and clinically measured caries experience. The clinical assessment severity data had a non-normal distribution. In STATA zero-inflated Poisson regression (‘zip’)[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was used to assess the association of 25(OH)D with caries severity (dmft), using robust variance estimators (‘vce(robust)’) [<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The Poisson regression coefficients were back transformed into dmft counts. In these analyses we present six models: unadjusted; 1—adjusted for season; 2 –adjusted for season and time lag between 25(OH)D and caries measure; 3 –adjusted for season, time lag sex and age; 4—adjusted for model 3 plus mothers highest education and 5—adjusted for model 3 plus BMI.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Existing literature has shown that vitamin D exposure in early life may play a role in caries prevention[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, in work here where 25(OH)D is available there was little evidence for an observational associations with caries experience. There was evidence of an association between 25(OH)D concentration with GA experience and earlier onset of caries—both of which could be seen as a proxy for more severe disease.</p>
              <p>Within this population-based sample, the previously reported relationships between 25(OH)D and <italic>CYP2R1</italic>, <italic>DHCR7</italic> and <italic>GC</italic> were replicated[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0143769.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When combined these SNPs were confirmed as a strong genetic instrument for 25(OH)D, with per allele changes of a clinically relevant magnitude. This genetic instrument showed no association with factors potentially confounding the vitamin D—dental caries relationship. Therefore, in the absence of coordinated vitamin D and outcome data this genetic instrument was used to model a life-course difference in vitamin D exposure for use in MR analyses.</p>
              <p>MR analysis has not given substantive evidence for an association between caries experience and vitamin D. This is in contrast to a meta-analysis which reports on 14 controlled clinical trials assessing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as a supplement, compared to no supplement as a control[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. They report a 49% (95% CI: 35, 60, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) decrease in the relative rate of caries. This meta-analysis reports the relative rate of caries incidence, calculated by dividing the risk of caries by the length of the study, and not the odds of having caries experience, as done here, therefore comparison is difficult. Evidence here also sits in the context of recent work suggesting a potential role for vitamin D receptor in adult dental caries. The findings in this work were not replicated in the ALSPAC study (data not shown)[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Observationally, participants with higher serum 25(OH)D had reduced odds of receiving a GA for dental extractions. It is of note that an observational association exists with GA experience but not with caries experience despite the former usually considered a proxy for the latter. This may be because GAs are a memorable event and therefore more likely to be reported accurately. It has also been reported that GA for dental extractions is much more common in lower socio-economic groups[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and despite adjusting, may be additionally confounding the link between vitamin D and GA experience. Care is needed when interpreting this result as it presumes vitamin D concentrations are consistent throughout childhood, although evidence remains after correcting for the time lag between caries and vitamin D measurement. The MR analysis is underpowered with wide confidence intervals meaning inference is limited. Interestingly, early caries onset MR point estimates, are in the opposite direction to that of the other two caries outcomes, although a larger sample size would be required to clarify these results.</p>
              <sec id="sec021">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Using questionnaire data for outcomes has several weaknesses and is likely to underreport caries compared to the “gold-standard” clinical examination. In this study we were able to internally validate the questionnaire findings in a sample of participants who also had clinical dental examinations (<xref rid="pone.0143769.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 13% of questionnaire reported controls had clinically recorded caries experience and 6% of cases has no clinically recorded caries. There was no substantive evidence of vitamin D being different across mis-allocated groups with there being similar 25(OH)D concentrations across data origins. There was also no association between the questionnaire type that identified a participant as a case (parent or self report) and 25(OH)D (<xref rid="pone.0143769.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). The unresolved problem with the questionnaire data is under-identification of untreated disease. This was only asked in the child reported questionnaire at 91 months but even so, is likely to have poor sensitivity and therefore be responsible for the majority of the underreporting.</p>
                <p>The binary caries outcome does not account for disease severity, although dmft (which showed comparable results) provides a measure for this. Additionally, the caries onset analyses relied on the dates of questionnaire completion, rather than the actual age at which caries was diagnosed, introducing error. The time difference between vitamin D and outcome measures is a limitation in the observational part of this study. In the observational analysis we attempt to correct for this by including lag time between caries and 25(OH)D measures as a confounder. In the MR analysis we address this by using a life-course genetic instrument for vitamin D, however this does assume the effects of the genes used to instrument vitamin D are stable throughout childhood.</p>
                <p>This study is large in comparison to previous observational studies assessing the association between vitamin D and caries, however it has relatively low power to detect associations between vitamin D and dental caries smaller than those previously reported in observational studies. Given the prevalence of caries in this population and the strength of the genetic instrument this study had sufficient size to detect an effect similar to that reported by Hujoel[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Considering the observational results in this study it is likely the effect size in this population is smaller, resulting in the MR analysis being underpowered. This genetic instrument has favorable properties when investigating the association between 25(OH)D and caries, but there is currently no conclusive evidence of a causal effect. Further effort is required in the field of oral health epidemiology to collect good quality clinically recorded outcomes alongside genetic data. These improvements in sample size and measurement will allow more precise estimates of causal association in future work.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>With the use of a genetic instrument, a life-course 25(OH)D exposure model was used to test associations between vitamin D and dental caries. In contrast to a recent meta-analysis[<xref rid="pone.0143769.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] we found little evidence of an observational association between 25(OH)D and caries experience and severity and only weak evidence for caries onset and receiving a dental GA. Genetic instruments for 25(OH)D appeared not to be confounded and were strong, though MR estimates spanned the null for all outcomes. Genetic study designs of this type show promise for the future and efforts should be made to identify other potential instrumental variables for use in oral health research.</p>
