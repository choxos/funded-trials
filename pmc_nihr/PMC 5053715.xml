                <p>The mechanism of the anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) activity of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is not understood. We tested the hypothesis that EPA reduces expression of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), a pro-inflammatory chemokine with known roles in metastasis.</p>
                <p>We measured CCL2 in clinical samples from a randomized trial of EPA in patients undergoing liver surgery for CRC liver metastasis (LM) and preclinical models. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of tumors from EPA-treated patients was performed.</p>
                <p>EPA decreased CCL2 synthesis by CRC cells in a dose-dependent manner. CCL2 was localized to malignant epithelial cells in human CRCLM. EPA did not reduce CCL2 content in human or mouse tumors compare to control. However, EPA treatment was associated with decreased plasma CCL2 levels compared with controls (P=0.04). Reduction in plasma CCL2 following EPA treatment predicted improved disease-free survival (HR 0.32; P=0.003). Lack of ‘CCL2 response’ was associated with a specific CRCLM gene expression signature.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, reduction in plasma CCL2 in patients with CRCLM treated with EPA predicts better clinical outcome and a specific tumor gene expression profile. Further work is needed to validate CCL2 as a therapeutic response biomarker for omega-3 fatty acid treatment of CRC patients.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Approximately one third of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients develop liver metastasis (LM) within 5 years of colorectal surgery, which was originally performed with curative intent, and CRCLM is the commonest cause of death from CRC [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, only one quarter of CRCLM patients are suitable for curative liver resection surgery and there is no truly effective medical therapy for either prevention or treatment of CRCLM. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for safe, well-tolerated therapy for prevention and treatment of metastatic CRC</p>
              <p>There is a large body of human observational studies and experimental animal data suggesting that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3FAs) C20:5 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and C22:6 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have anti-colorectal cancer (CRC) activity [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Randomized clinical trial (RCT) data prove that EPA 2 g daily, in the free fatty acid (FFA) form, has chemopreventative efficacy in familial adenomatous polyposis patients [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the same formulation and dose of EPA has been evaluated in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this RCT (The EMT study; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT01070355), patients awaiting liver resection surgery for CRCLM were randomized to either EPA-FFA 2 g daily (n=43) or placebo (n=45) prior to surgery, for a median duration of 30 [range 12-65] days and 26 (15-73) days, respectively [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In this group of patients, EPA treatment was safe and well-tolerated [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Preliminary data suggested that pre-operative EPA treatment may improve overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Understanding of the mechanism(s) by which O3FAs have anti-CRC activity is limited but several putative modes of action are recognized including modulation of prostaglandin (PG) metabolism by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, as well as cell surface receptor signaling [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A central tenet of O3FA mechanism(s) of action, pertaining to potential use in several human disease states, including cancer and cardiovascular disease, is that O3FAs exhibit anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines link inflammation and carcinogenesis, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These include chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), which has been implicated in carcinogenesis and metastasis, including in CRC and breast cancer [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In clinical studies, treatment with O3FAs as fish oil has been demonstrated to reduce plasma and adipose tissue levels of CCL2 in obese patients with metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that EPA decreases plasma and tissue CCL2 levels in pre-clinical rodent CRC models and samples from the RCT of EPA in CRCLM patients (The EMT study).</p>

                <title>EPA treatment is associated with decreased plasma CCL2 levels in CRCLM patients awaiting liver surgery</title>
                <p>As fish oil treatment for 12 weeks has been demonstrated to reduce plasma CCL2 levels in obese individuals [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we took advantage of the prospective tissue bio-bank obtained from the EMT study [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in order to determine whether a similar phenomenon occurred in CRC patients randomized to EPA treatment compared with placebo. Pre-treatment plasma CCL2 levels were well matched between treatment groups (P=0.66, Mann-Whitney test). However, reduction in plasma CCL2 after EPA treatment was more common (in 19 of 29 [66%] individuals) than that at the end of placebo treatment (in 10 of 26 [38%] cases; P=0.04; χ<sup>2</sup> test; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A-B</xref>). Overall, there was an increase in plasma CCL2 level in the placebo group at the end of the intervention period, with a median increase in CCL2 level of +13.3 pg/ml (range −93.1 to +206.2 pg/ml), compared with an overall decrease in plasma CCL2 level in those randomized to EPA, who exhibited a median change of −12.1 pg/ml (range −119.0 to +155.1 pg/ml; P&lt;0.05, Mann-Whitney test). These results are consistent with negative regulation of CCL2 production by EPA in patients with metastatic CRC.</p>

                <p>Colorectal cancer liver metastasis tissue analysis from the ‘window of opportunity’ EMT study was limited to tissue collected after intervention because tumor biopsy prior to liver surgery was not possible in patients undergoing routine CRCLM surgery [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, we were unable to examine whether EPA treatment reduced CCL2 content in individual CRCLMs. However, we demonstrated that CCL2 is localized predominantly to cancer cells in CRCLMs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) rather than in stroma-associated cells, as described previously [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We also measured post-treatment CRCLM CCL2 levels in a random subset of CRCLMs from the EMT trial by immunoassay. There were a wide range of CCL2 values in CRCLM tissues from patients in both placebo and EPA arms of the trial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference in tissue CCL2 content between CRCLMs from patients treated with EPA before surgery (median 151.5 [IQR 25.5-275.0] pg/mg; n=5) compared with the placebo arm (median 82.0 [IQR 34.2-231.3] pg/mg; n=7). Consistent with similar CCL2 levels in CRCLMs, there was no significant difference in the density of CD68-positive tumor-associated macrophages in CRCLMs from patients treated with placebo (median 272 cells [IQR 222-375] per hpf; n=24) compared with EPA (median 281 cells [IQR 188-362] per hpf; n=28) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p>
                <p>We next performed a screen of three human CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HCA-7) and observed that only HCA-7 human CRC cells generate detectable CCL2 in conditioned medium (data not shown). There was a concentration-dependent relationship between EPA exposure and CCL2 release into medium conditioned by human HCA-7 CRC cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), consistent with anti-proliferative activity of EPA against this cell line [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In order to further investigate the relationship between EPA treatment and CCL2 levels, we tested the effect of EPA on CCL2 production in MC38 cells, which can be used as a syngeneic CRC model in C57Bl/6 mice and are widely used to model human CRC <italic>in vivo</italic> based on similarities in gene expression profile [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Growth of MC38 mouse CRC cells was inhibited by EPA in a biphasic manner (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.5±1.0 μM and 154.0±1.1 μM, data not shown) and was also associated with a concentration-dependent decrease in CCL2 synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The impact of EPA treatment on CCL2 production and cell proliferation was greater in MC38 cells than in the HCA-7 cells, which is consistent with the fact that HCA-7 cells were less sensitive to EPA than MC38 cells (HCA-7 IC<sub>50</sub> 154.0±1.1 μM, data not shown). We demonstrated that EPA treatment also reduced the CCL2 receptor CCR2 expression in MC38 mouse CRC cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B–2C</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that exposure to 100 μM EPA for 24 hours decreased CCR2 expression in MC38 cells to 36±4% of the level in untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p>

Neither PGE<sub>2,</sub> nor the selective EP4 receptor agonist PGE<sub>1</sub>-alcohol, rescued down-regulation of CCL2 by EPA. In addition, neither the EP4 receptor antagonist ONO-AE3-208, nor inhibition of MAP kinase by PD98059, decreased CCL2 synthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Therefore, EPA abrogates CCL2 synthesis and release in a PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP4 receptor-independent manner in MC38 mouse CRC cells.</p>

                <p>Control MC38 tumors exhibited a wide range of intra-tumoral CCL2 levels (median 142.0 [range 21.1-279.8] pg/mg). The levels measured in tumors from mice fed a 5% EPA-containing diet were lower (median 106.8 [0.3-220.8] pg/mg) but the difference was not statistically significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), consistent with the human CRCLM data, which was also limited to post-treatment analysis. There was no significant difference in the percentage of F4/80-positive tumor-associated macrophages relative to total cell population analyzed in tumors from the two treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). There was also no significant difference in tumor-associated macrophage M1-M2 phenotype polarization, as determined by CD11c and CD206 phenotyping, with a dominant CD11c+ CD206- M1 F4/80+ CD11b+ macrophage population observed in both treatment groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We conclude that treatment with the O3FA EPA is associated with an overall reduction in plasma CCL2 concentration in patients with CRCLM. Moreover, an increase in plasma CCL2 during EPA treatment predicts worse clinical outcome after CRCLM surgery and selects for a distinct CRCLM gene expression profile.</p>
              <p>Our data are consistent with other studies, which have reported that plasma CCL2 levels in CRC patients are in the pg/ml range [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and that O3FA treatment is associated with a reduction in circulating CCL2 concentration [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, a shorter-term (8 weeks) study with daily dosing of 3.6 g mixed O3FAs did not detect a change in plasma CCL2 levels [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Potential confounders of the plasma CCL2 level in CRC patients include body weight and physical activity [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Tissue CCL2 content predicts poor clinical outcome in colorectal cancer and breast cancer [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, CCL2 immunoreactivity in primary CRC tumors, as measured by immunohistochemistry, predicts future liver metastasis [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and CCL2 staining in CRCLMs predicts CRCLM recurrence and overall survival after CRCLM resection surgery [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, we were unable to obtain specific, reproducible immunostaining of fixed CRCLM tissue using any commercially available anti-CCL2 antibody, with which to explore whether CRCLM content predicts survival. Circulating CCL2 levels in CRC patients have only been described once [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Szczepanik and colleagues have reported that the pre-operative serum CCL2 level is a prognostic factor in patients undergoing primary CRC resection [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>We suggest that EPA treatment most likely reduces CRC cell CCL2 production in a PGE<sub>2</sub>-independent manner based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> data and those of others [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We also found a concomitant reduction of the CCL2 receptor CCR2 expression in CRC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is in keeping with a study by Fang <italic>et al</italic>., which described a correlation between CCL2 and CCR2 expression levels in breast cancer [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We hypothesize that our inability to detect a reduction in tumor CCL2 content <italic>in vivo</italic> is due to the lack of paired human or mouse tumor tissue samples before and after EPA treatment combined with tumor heterogeneity of CCL2 expression.</p>
              <p>It remains unclear what the cellular source of plasma CCL2 is. It is established that human colorectal adenomas and CRCs have elevated levels of CCL2 protein [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is localized to cancer cells, consistent with the production of CCL2 by human CRC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We established that human CRCLMs contain CCL2 by immunoassay but were unable to detect any correlation between tissue CCL2 protein concentration and the post-treatment plasma CCL2 level in individuals from either the placebo or EPA arms of the EMT trial (data not shown). Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> PBMC culture experiments suggest that circulating monocytes are not the predominant source of CCL2 in plasma relevant to its role as a putative predictive biomarker, on the basis that EPA did not significantly alter <italic>ex vivo</italic> PBMC CCL2 production.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, given the role of CCL2 in tumor-associated macrophage chemotaxis [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and association between CCL2 content and macrophage infiltrate in colonic tumors [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we did not detect any effect of EPA on macrophage content of either human or mouse tumors, or any significant change in macrophage polarization in MC38 CRC cell tumors from C57BL/6 mice exposed to EPA in the diet. Despite this, it is clear that a reduction in plasma CCL2 associated with EPA treatment is linked to a marked difference in tumor biology evidenced by the differential gene expression between tumors from patients who did or did not exhibit a ‘CCL2 response’.</p>
              <p>Importantly, the plasma ‘CCL2 response’ predicted clinical outcome in patients who received EPA treatment prior to CRCLM surgery. The predictive value of the plasma ‘CCL2 response’ to EPA treatment should be tested prospectively during planned phase III evaluation of adjuvant EPA treatment in patients undergoing CRCLM surgery. The interaction between CCL2 expression/activity and CRC recurrence requires further investigation in light of the opposite relationship between the change in plasma CCL2 level and CRC recurrence in the absence of EPA treatment, although the relatively small effect size could imply a chance finding. The possibility of combining EPA treatment with therapies targeting the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway should be explored. Several groups have recently reported that blocking CCL2 signaling may be effective in breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer patients [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However a recent report suggests that anti-CCL2 therapy may result in a surge in CCL2 levels and subsequent tumor growth after the treatment phase has ended [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It may be that targeting the CCR2 receptor will be more efficacious. A phase I trial is currently underway to assess to safety and tolerability of such an approach in pancreatic cancer patients (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02345408).</p>

                <p>MC38 mouse CRC cells were a gift from D. Beauchamp (Vanderbilt University, TN, USA). HCA-7 human CRC cells were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were obtained from the ATCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org/">www.atcc.org</ext-link>). HCA-7 cells were authenticated by STR profiling. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax® supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
                <p>Cell chemosensitivity to EPA was determined using the MTT assay [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. The following day, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing EPA for 96 hrs at 37°C. Cell survival was determined using the MTT assay. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using Prism6™ software and are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments.</p>
                <p>Culture medium was conditioned by 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells in 6-well plate wells at 37°C for 24 hrs, in the presence or absence of 50-200μM EPA, EP receptor agonists/antagonist and 30μM PD98058. CCL2 levels were measured using a mouse or human CCL2 immunoassay (both R&amp;D Systems).</p>

                <p>Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 hrs. Cells were treated with 2 ml of fresh medium containing ethanol carrier or varying concentrations of EPA for 24 hrs. Following methanol fixation, CCR2 detection was performed using rabbit anti-mouse CCR2 antibody (GeneTex GTX61660) followed by AlexaFluor® 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted on slides using DAPI-Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Fluorescence intensity was measured using ImageJ software. Integrated intensity was calculated as the mean fluorescence intensity from 5 independent fields minus the mean background intensity from 5 areas with no cellular fluorescence. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments</p>

                <p>C57BL/6 mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment. All experiments were undertaken with UK Home Office approval. Female, 8 week-old C57BL/6 mice were administered isocaloric diets (n=16 per group) <italic>ad libitum</italic> for 14 days based on a modified AIN-93G diet base, in which 7% soybean oil was replaced by either 5% (w/w) EPA and corn oil, or corn oil alone (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Fresh diet was manufactured by IPS Ltd. (London, UK) every 8 days and delivered within 48 hrs in vacuum-packed 100 g foil bags in order to minimize oxidation [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Uneaten food was replaced every day with fresh diet from a previously unopened bag.</p>
                <p>On day 15, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> MC38 mouse CRC cells in 100 μl sterile PBS were injected subcutaneously on the flank. Animals continued on the same diet and were weighed daily for a further 14 days until sacrifice. Immediately after sacrifice, tumor weight and volume were measured blind to diet allocation. Each tumor sample was fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, prior to embedding in paraffin, and was snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> before storage at -80°C.</p>
                <p>Single tumor cell suspensions were prepared using 1 mg/ml type IV collagenase and 40 μg/ml DNase (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) in HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS) at 37°C for 20 min. All suspensions were passed through a 4 μm cell strainer and washed thoroughly before re-suspension in PBS with 0.5% (w/v) BSA for antibody staining. Cell suspensions were stained with CD45-Peridinin Chlorophyll Protein Complex (PerCP) (30F11), CD11b-R-phycoerythrin (PE) (M1/70), CD11c-Brilliant Violet 421 (BV421) (N418) (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), F4/80-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Cl:A3-1) (AB Serotec, Kidlington, UK), CD206-Allophycocyanin (APC) (clone 15-2) (Biolegend, London, UK). Surface antigen expression was assessed by flow cytometry using a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p>

                <title>Whole genome expression analysis</title>
                <p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRCLM blocks were sampled using a TMA needle as previously described [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit (Qiagen Ltd., Manchester, UK). Fifteen of twenty CRCLM blocks yielded total RNA of sufficient quality (RNA concentration &gt;20 ng/μl and A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> &gt;1.95) for microarray analysis. Two samples were run with technical duplicates, which showed good reproducibility for hybridization, normalization of the data and clustering (data not shown). Whole genome expression profiles were generated using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 (&gt;6 million probes). Gene expression data were pre-processed using proprietary Affymetrix® Expression Console™ v1.3 software. The raw gene expression data (CEL files) were processed using the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) algorithm [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] which fits a linear model at probe level allowing the effect of differences in probe-specific affinity to be minimized and providing increased sensitivity to detect small changes between experimental and control samples. The RMA algorithm performs global background adjustment of the data from each chip prior to inter-array quantile normalization. Probe level expression values were then summarized to give gene-level expression values. Raw CEL files and processed RMA files are available in the GEO repository under the series set GSE79266.</p>
                <p>Differential gene expression analysis was performed in R [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Bioconductor genefilter package was used to perform a two-sided, two-class t-test for each gene against experimental status (increased or decreased CCL2 plasma level) [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Genes with an equivalent fold change of ±1.2 (the median fold-change value) and a p-value of &lt;0.05 were determined to be differentially expressed. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes was performed using the pheatmap package [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
                <p>MetaCore™ v6.21 (build 66768) software (Thomson Reuters, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.genego.com/">https://portal.genego.com</ext-link>.) was used to identify which pathways were enriched from the list of differentially expressed genes.</p>
