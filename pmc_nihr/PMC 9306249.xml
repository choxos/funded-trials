                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Autism is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting over 1% of UK children. The period following a child’s autism diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis. Best practice guidelines recommend timely post-diagnostic family support. Current provision is patchy, largely unevidenced, and a source of dissatisfaction for both families and professionals. There is a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support focusing on caregiver mental health and adjustment, alongside autism psycho-education. This trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new brief manualised psychosocial intervention designed to address this gap.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multi-centre two-parallel-group single (researcher)-blinded randomised controlled trial of the Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual versus usual local post-diagnostic offer plus treatment-as-usual. Caregivers of children aged 2–15 years with a recent autism diagnosis will be recruited from North West England NHS or local authority centres. Randomisation is individually by child, with one “index” caregiver per child, stratified by centre, using 2:1 randomisation ratio to assist recruitment and timely intervention. Empower-Autism is a group-based, manualised, post-diagnostic programme that combines autism psycho-education and psychotherapeutic components based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to support caregiver mental health, stress management and adjustment to their child’s diagnosis. The comparator is any usual local group-based post-diagnostic psycho-education offer. Receipt of services will be specified through health economic data. Primary outcome: caregiver mental health (General Health Questionnaire-30) at 52-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes: key caregiver measures (wellbeing, self-efficacy, adjustment, autism knowledge) at 12-, 26- and 52-week follow-up and family and child outcomes (wellbeing and functioning) at 52-week endpoint. Sample: <italic>N</italic>=380 (approximately 253 intervention/127 treatment-as-usual). Primary analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles using linear mixed models with random intercepts for group membership and repeated measures. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses will be over 52 weeks, with decision modelling to extrapolate to longer time periods.</p>

                  <p id="Par23">The trial tests the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a new manualised psychosocial intervention called Empower-Autism, designed to be deliverable within the NHS and to directly address the combined informational, relational, and emotional needs of caregivers in the post-diagnostic period and thereby improve the mental health and adjustment of caregivers of recently diagnosed autistic children.</p>

                  <title>Caregiver response to autism diagnosis</title>
                  <p id="Par24">Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental disability affecting over 1% of UK children, defined by differences in social reciprocity, communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behaviour, interests, and cognition. The impact of these clinical features is variable across individuals, but often bears a significant influence on development, functioning, and wellbeing across the lifespan. The period following a child’s diagnosis can present real challenges in adaptation for families. Twenty to 50% of caregivers show clinically significant levels of mental health need within the post-diagnostic period and on an ongoing basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent systematic review of UK caregiver experiences of autism diagnosis in their child emphasised three distinct areas of post-diagnostic need: emotional, relational, and informational [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Emotional responses to the diagnosis are heterogeneous: feelings of grief, disorientation, and disempowerment are common; feelings of relief and validation also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Caregivers of autistic children can experience social isolation, judgement, and stigma. Many actively want to understand and parent their child as best they can and actively seek out support with this. The mental health and wellbeing of caregivers is of public health importance in and of itself. In addition, improved caregiver wellbeing is likely to have downstream effects on family and child wellbeing and may result in more effective uptake of subsequent evidenced-based caregiver-mediated interventions known to bring long-term benefits for both the caregiver and their autistic child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>

                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Current provision</title>
                  <p id="Par25">Best practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] recommend provision of timely post-diagnostic family support. However, current provision is patchy across the UK and represents a source of increasing dissatisfaction for both families and professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There has been a recent step change in identifying effective episodic interventions for autistic children within robust randomised trials. For example, current evidence supports the effectiveness of caregiver-mediated communication intervention strategies on dyadic caregiver-child interaction and on child autism impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite these significant developments and the fact that caregiver psycho-education is amongst the most used autism interventions, post-diagnostic psycho-social intervention for caregivers has received relatively little research attention and remains a large evidence gap, not only in the UK but internationally. There are long-standing local and national clinical initiatives to provide group-based caregiver psycho-education groups to address informational (and to some extent, relational) needs, some of which have evidence of acceptability or observational evidence suggestive of positive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Internationally, there have been a small number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psycho-education with generic/child outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and one RCT with a treatment effect on parental mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there is no well powered trial to date and there remains a pressing need for an evidenced programme of post-diagnostic support for caregivers which includes a focus on caregiver emotional and mental health, as well as autism psycho-education.</p>

                  <title>Acceptance and commitment therapy</title>
                  <p id="Par26">There is increasing focus within the autism context on interventions that support caregivers’ emotional needs, including adjustment to the diagnosis, long-term stress management, resilience, and stigma protection, with approaches such as mindfulness, cognitive restructuring, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]). ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] has a growing evidence base for effectiveness in adult mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It shares lineage with cognitive-behavioural interventions and shows similar general effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Several teams have now recognised the relevance of ACT to the distinct psychological task faced by caregivers of newly diagnosed children due to the following: (i) its emphasis on psychological acceptance (validating challenging emotions and cognitions, rather than seeking to change them) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; (ii) incorporation of mindfulness techniques (successful in reducing caregiver and child mental health difficulties) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] but in a way that is more sustainable than full mindfulness interventions that have high time and training costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; and (iii) a ‘core values’ focus that may help caregivers re-assert parenting values challenged by realisation of the child’s condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] identifies 8 studies investigating the use of ACT to improve the mental health of caregivers of autistic children: one small-scale randomised controlled trial, one quasi-experimental study, and six observational studies. The RCT (<italic>N</italic>=18; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]) compared a four-hour ACT programme against no intervention and reported a large treatment effect on parental depression. Juvin and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] concluded that there was preliminary promising evidence that ACT can be helpful for the parents of autistic children but that larger randomised controlled trials were needed. A second systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] focussing on neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs) more broadly found nine articles centred on autism and two on other NDDs and also concluded that there was provisional support for the use of ACT with caregivers of children with NDDs but that further research was needed. A more recent small randomised controlled trial (<italic>N</italic>=20; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]), not included in the two systematic reviews, tested a 36-h ACT intervention for parents of autistic children against a more traditional parent training programme and reported significant reductions in parent stress in the ACT intervention group. These authors also pointed to the need for larger randomised controlled trials.</p>

                  <title>Development of Empower-Autism</title>
                  <p id="Par27">Empower-Autism was designed during a pre-trial development and feasibility testing phase. It grew out of two pre-existing foundational approaches. The first was a psycho-educational workshop model developed and delivered over 10 years within the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Published evaluations of this approach reported excellent feasibility and acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The second foundational approach was a manualised 5-h acceptance and commitment therapy programme developed specifically for caregivers of children with disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], used with the developers’ consent. An RCT of this programme as part of a package for parents of children with acquired brain injury compared to treatment-as-usual (<italic>N</italic>=59; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]) found moderate effects on parental stress, anxiety, and parenting confidence. In unpublished work, the same ACT programme then showed good applicability and acceptability when applied post-diagnostically with groups of parents of autistic children, with very positive qualitative feedback (Sofranoff, pers comm). A comprehensive and iterative stakeholder co-production process was undertaken to further develop and blend these two approaches, with additional elements as indicated by stakeholder involvement, informed by a Theory of Change framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The pre-trial feasibility phase provided quantitative and qualitative evidence of feasibility and acceptability of the new programme and recommendations for further refinement and co-design prior to finalising the intervention protocol for the RCT.</p>

                  <title>Response to COVID-19 pandemic</title>
                  <p id="Par28">Onset of the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with pre-trial feasibility study of the in-person manual. In response, the trial team investigated online delivery of the programme through video-conferencing. The implications of a move to online delivery were discussed with stakeholders and optional online adaptations were included within the intervention manual. Following work to adapt the intervention manual for online delivery, an additional feasibility test of this adaptation was undertaken. This provided quantitative and qualitative evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of online delivery in relation to both practitioners and participants.</p>

                  <title>Empower-Autism</title>
                  <p id="Par29">The final programme is described in detail below. In brief, it is a 15-h group-based programme, with associated online and physical resources, that integrates problem-focused psycho-education to enable empowerment through knowledge of autism, connection with peers, and the ability to make informed and positive choices for ongoing care, and ACT-informed psychotherapeutic components to support with the immediate challenge caregivers face in adjusting to the diagnosis and coping with the ongoing stress faced by many caregivers of disabled children. If shown to be effective, this theoretically based targeted approach to caregiver education, empowerment, and stress reduction will fill a key evidential gap in the provision of efficient and effective developmentally sequenced autism interventions from diagnosis onwards.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Prior to the commencement of trial recruitment (Sept–Oct 2020), trial procedures were adapted in response to the pandemic and ongoing social distancing requirements in place at that time and which continued until at least 2022. These included online intervention delivery through a video-conferencing platform; data collection through remote procedures (video-conferencing, telephone, post, electronic correspondence); recorded verbal informed consent procedures; and the addition of a COVID impact questionnaire. All such adaptations were reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee, funder, and sponsor, prior to implementation. In 2022, the target sample size was increased to maintain statistical power in response to early indicators of higher attrition than anticipated, attributed partly to pandemic-related factors; the timeline was extended accordingly. No further major modifications needed to be made to the design, participants, outcomes, randomisation or blinding procedures, or analyses (as of 2022) during the course of the trial.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par62">The trial tests the new Empower-Autism programme plus treatment-as-usual (TAU) against the usual local post-diagnostic offer plus TAU. The comparator is therefore any post-diagnostic, group-based, psycho-education intervention available as part of the standard local offer. Any such TAU intervention, identified in discussion with each trial centre, is offered as per standard practice to families randomised to the TAU arm, but is restricted to families randomised to the experimental intervention arm who access the Empower-Autism programme in its place. Participants in both trial arms can access all other services and interventions on offer in their locality, as per usual care.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">With regard to the risk of contamination across trial arms, it is unlikely that families in the intervention arm will be close to other families in the TAU arm and unlikely that detailed intervention information would be shared between participants.</p>

                    <p id="Par64">Standard care pathways are specified, for example, in the NICE guidelines, but vary considerably across services and NHS Trusts. Within the trial, participating families randomised to TAU will access their usual local post-diagnostic, group-based, autism psycho-education single- or multi-session programme offer (where one exists; in some localities there is no offer) plus any more general TAU services and interventions on offer in their locality, as per usual care (which may include, for example, individual review, individual needs-led interventions, needs-led group-based interventions, onward referral, etc). Centre differences in TAU will be captured via detailed service-use data collection and factored into the design and analyses by stratifying the randomisation by centre.</p>

                    <p id="Par65">Participants randomised to the experimental treatment arm will access the Empower-Autism programme instead of their usual local post-diagnostic group-based programme offer (where one is offered). Like the TAU group, they will continue to access any general TAU services and interventions on offer in their locality, as per usual care. The Empower-Autism programme is a closed-group manualised and holistic programme, designed to address the needs of a wide range of caregivers in the post-diagnostic period, with a particular focus on caregiver mental health and wellbeing. It is composed of five 3-h sessions, delivered online via video-conferencing. Each programme is delivered by a lead and supporting practitioner and attended by a maximum of 12 participants (with one additional non-trial adult per family, if desired). The programme integrates:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par66"><italic>Autism psycho-education</italic>: The programme consists of high-quality, up-to-date, and evidence-informed autism psycho-educational content, including: information about autism, the diversity and complexity of autism presentations including reflection on how it presents within their own child; core characteristics of autism including communication, social interaction, thinking styles, sensory needs, emotion and energy regulation, and behaviour; and child-centred strategies to support each of these areas. First-hand autistic perspectives are included through videos, descriptions, quotes, and exercises and through signposting to materials that offer personal accounts. The aim of the psycho-educational content is caregiver understanding, insight, empathy, and empowerment through knowledge of the condition, practical strategies for use in daily life, and ability to make informed and positive choices for ongoing care. A range of delivery methods are employed to ensure sessions are enjoyable and interactive; to share information, ideas, and experiences; and to consolidate, apply, and extend learning.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67"><italic>Autism context</italic>: This content comprises information about the education system as it relates to children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, reflection on working together with educational settings, and sources of local, national, and online sources of information and support.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68"><italic>ACT content and philosophy</italic>: Empower-Autism offers an experiential and skills-based introduction to ACT tools, philosophy, and processes to support participants with their own emotional responses to the diagnosis and parenting their child, and to adapt and flex to any challenges that may arise as a result of their child’s condition, the surrounding context, or any other factors. Emphasis is placed on the need for caregivers to value and give time and space for their own emotional wellbeing and stress management. The programme adopts the ACT Matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] as the main delivery framework and includes the following concepts: mindful awareness and pausing; mindful noticing of thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations; cognitive defusion (choosing whether or not to engage with unhelpful thoughts and unhooking from them); expansion (accepting and making space for difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting against them); values clarification (reflecting on what is important to you as a person and as a caregiver); and committed action (making a commitment to small steps in a direction consistent with your values). These principles are introduced and reinforced through group discussion, experiential exercises, metaphors, videos, and individual reflection and tasks and are modelled by group facilitators within all discussions and activities. The ACT philosophy asserts the shared humanity and expertise of participants and group facilitators, autism- and neurodiversity-positivity, flexibility and responsiveness to individual needs and group dynamics, and acceptance of and compassion for the diverse range of thoughts, feelings, and experiences brought by group members.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69"><italic>Social support and validation</italic> is promoted through group formation, networking, sharing of experiences and expertise, facilitated group discussions, and linkage to local, national, and online sources of community.

Home practice suggestions are made at the end of each session and consist of exercises, strategies, or reflections that can be carried out as part of daily life.</p></list-item></list></p>

                  <p id="Par71">The trial intervention would be discontinued by the research team for a given trial participant if there was a serious adverse event and/or multiple adverse events, possibly or definitely related to the intervention. The intervention would also be discontinued at participant request or decision. Participants may withdraw from the trial or intervention programme at any time, without giving a reason. The research team may withdraw a participant for welfare or safeguarding reasons, or if participation is no longer in their interest. The research team will update a withdrawal log stating the date and reason for withdrawal. Data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be used. Participants will not be replaced.</p>

                  <p id="Par72">Intervention fidelity (practitioner adherence): Intervention variability will be minimised through frequent individual and group supervision of lead practitioners. During all sessions, the lead practitioners (but not participants) will be videotaped with audio recording of practitioners and participants. A random sample of 10% of sessions will be assessed formally for fidelity to the manual by a fully trained (including ACT-trained) independent senior practitioner. This will occur at regular intervals across the intervention period. To test the reliability of these ratings, 25% of fidelity sessions will be double-scored by a second rater, also a fully trained (including ACT-trained) senior practitioner. A core competency framework which assesses key psycho-education and ACT components and ACT processes will be used to formally rate fidelity and will be accessed throughout the study by the Practitioners to aid their self-assessment of adherence. Feedback from fidelity ratings will be shared with practitioners via their usual lines of supervision. Where fidelity drops to below threshold on the scale, remedial action will be taken. If ratings fall below this threshold on a consistent basis, the individual will discontinue intervention delivery.</p>
                  <p id="Par73">Participant adherence: Research staff and intervention practitioners will be trained in practices that minimise non-compliance and drop-out. The expectation that participants attend the full course of five sessions is emphasised pre-randomisation by researchers and post-randomisation by intervention practitioners. Participant attendance at and engagement with the sessions will be documented following each session. In the event of missed sessions, practitioners will contact participants to explore the reasons for non-attendance and to offer a summary of the information covered within the session, including signposting to related information in the handouts and intervention online resources. Receipt of other interventions outside of the protocol will be collected.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p id="Par76">Caregiver mental health, measured by the General Health Questionnaire-30 (GHQ-30; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]), measured by the total score at baseline and 12-, 26-, and 52-week follow-up. The GHQ is the gold standard self-report measure of mental health in the general population or within community/non-psychiatric clinical settings. It is widely used in mental health trials, is well-validated, and has excellent sensitivity to change and psychometric properties, yielding normally distributed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. There is no well-validated blinded measure of caregiver mental health for use within clinical trials. The GHQ is appropriate to measure mental health needs this context, in which caregivers are epidemiologically at risk but are not themselves selected on the basis of a mental health diagnosis. It will be, therefore, more sensitive to change than other screens/diagnostic tools designed for psychiatric populations. It provides a unitary measure of symptoms of both depression and anxiety. It assesses current mental state, rather than long-standing attributes of the respondent, and is therefore suited to measuring shorter term change that may be influenced by the child’s recent diagnosis. The GHQ has been successfully used to show a treatment effect on mental health in caregivers of autistic children in several previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], including an RCT of a psycho-education group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and an observational study of ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The GHQ-30 is the most widely validated version of the GHQ with over 29 validity studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It was developed from the GHQ-60 but takes half the time to complete (3–4 min as opposed to 6–8 min)—important when participants will be completing several questionnaires at multiple time points. At an item level, the GHQ-30 is more appropriate than the GHQ-28 to administer to this non-clinical patient group (e.g. fewer items on suicidality). The GHQ-30 has published clinical cut-offs so rates of caseness can be used to assess meaningful and clinically significant change alongside the total score as a measure of absolute change.</p>

We will prioritise collaborating with referring diagnostic teams that assess large numbers of children and will open up new referral sites, as necessary, to access new participant waiting lists. Potential participants will be initially approached by a clinician from their local team, where possible, to maximise initial trust and engagement with the trial. Within the trial itself, there will be flexible scheduling of research appointments to accommodate participants’ preferences. Intervention groups will also run on a range of days and in daytime and evening to enable participation from caregivers with professional and caring commitments.

Caregiver-rated primary and secondary outcomes are not blind-rated; researcher-scored/coded secondary outcomes will be blinded (and subject to reliability checking), as will teacher-rated secondary child outcomes. We have established blinding procedures from our previous trials. There will be separate clinical and research leads and separate training and supervision structures. Researchers will be housed separately from staff involved in training and delivery of the Empower-Autism intervention. Mid- and endpoint research assessments will be conducted to avoid inadvertent divulging of information that could infer treatment status. Data collection staff will be uninformed on the details of the intervention. The senior statistician will be kept blind throughout the trial; the junior statistician will become unblinded once the statistical analysis plan (SAP) is signed off prior to accessing any outcome data that is required to be summarised split by arm, as this will unblind due to unequal arm allocation. All analysis will be pre-specified in the SAP and the trial dataset will be generated with a dummy variable for group allocation so that the primary analysis code can be reviewed by the blinded senior statistician.</p>

                <p id="Par104">Recruitment of participants will be via our partner NHS/local authority diagnostic teams. A member of the local clinical team will initially identify potential participants and screen for eligibility. An NHS practitioner/clinician will then provide a brief introduction of the trial and, with consent, pass over the contact details to the University research team.</p>
                <p id="Par105">All research activity and data collection will be carried out by trained, blinded Research Associates/Assistants in accordance with pre-specified trial standard operating procedures. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, research activities will take place remotely. Following a referral, an introductory email and the Participant Information Sheet will be emailed to the potential participant. A member of the research team will then contact the family and have a more detailed discussion about the trial, go through the Participant Information Sheet with the participant and answer any questions they may have. Once participants have had sufficient time to consider participating, ask questions, and discuss it with family and friends, the researcher will proceed with fully informed audio-recorded verbal consent. Each case will be registered and assigned a participant ID number. The baseline assessment will then be undertaken by Research Assistants prior to randomisation. Follow-up data collection will take place at 12, 26, and 52 weeks after randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par106">Data collection will take place remotely wherever possible. Questionnaire data will be collected via post or electronically via email, online survey or via telephone and/or videoconferencing, with visits to participants’ homes only when necessary and COVID-related guidelines permit. Researchers will sit and/or discuss over the phone/videoconference with participants during questionnaire completion to assist with understanding where necessary and to minimise missing data. Interviews will also be completed remotely via telephone and/or videoconferencing, or at the participant home. The Autism Five Minute Speech Sample will be audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by research staff. Teacher questionnaires will be collected at baseline and endpoint either via school/nursery visits and/or remotely. Data collection forms are available through their publishers/authors; trial-specific forms are available on request.</p>
                <p id="Par107">Process evaluation data will be collected post-endpoint for a subgroup of participants, sampled purposively, via remote (telephone or videoconferencing) semi-structured interviews.

                <title>Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes {20a}</title>
                <p id="Par114">A detailed statistical analysis plan will be approved by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and Trial Steering Committee before analysis of unblinded data. Analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles and follow the CONSORT statement for non-pharmacological interventions. Analyses will post-date final follow-up assessments, with due consideration of potential biases from loss to follow-up. Baseline data will be presented using appropriate summary statistics with no testing for baseline differences.</p>
                <p id="Par115">To satisfy Objective 1, treatment effects on the primary and secondary clinical outcomes will be estimated using linear mixed models fitted to outcome variables at all time points. Fixed effects will be centre, baseline assessment for the outcome under investigation, treatment, time, and time×treatment interactions. Participant and group number will be included as random intercepts, treating the control participants as ‘groups’ of size 1. Marginal treatment effects will be estimated for outcomes at each timepoint, and reported separately as mean adjusted differences in scores between the randomised groups with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values. The random effect structure will account for repeated measures and clustering due to the partial nested design and allow estimates of the ICC in the intervention arm.</p>
                <p id="Par116">For secondary outcomes only measured at baseline and 52 weeks, the same approach will be used without the time×treatment interaction and time as fixed effects, since there is only one measurement occasion.</p>
                <p id="Par117">For all analyses, each intervention group will contain only the outcome measures on an index caregiver, and so beyond the group-level clustering, no further adjustment for multiple caregivers is required.</p>

                  <title>Health economic analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par118">The economic analysis will use a within-trial, intent to treat approach and include all participants randomised to the two trial arms. The primary analysis will use the NHS and social care (costs) and parents/primary caregivers (health benefits) perspectives, with a 12-month time horizon. Costs will be estimated from health and social care service use data collected via the SUI and Caregiver Group-based Interventions Questionnaire. National unit costs will be used to cost each of the services used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Health benefit for the primary analysis is the QALY (EQ-5D-5L version, and published utility tariffs recommended by NICE at the time of the analysis). Health economic regression analysis, adjusted for key covariates, will estimate the net costs and QALYs of the intervention. Missing data will be accounted for in the analyses of net costs, net QALYs, and cost effectiveness acceptability. The methods used to deal with missing follow-up data will be determined according to the extent and pattern of missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The estimates of net costs and QALYs from the regression analyses will be bootstrapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] to simulate 10,000 pairs of incremental cost and QALY outcomes of the intervention. This will include (i) plotting the distribution of pairs of net costs and QALYs on a cost-effectiveness plane, (ii) generating a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, (iii) estimating the probability that intervention is cost-effective, and (iv) estimating a net benefit statistic. Sensitivity analyses will explore the intervention’s cost-effectiveness using (i) GHQ-30 (caregiver mental health), (ii) the adapted Child Health Utility-9D Index (child wellbeing), and (iii) wider perspective to include indirect costs of lost productivity. A simple decision model will explore the potential cost-effectiveness of the intervention over longer time horizons.</p>
                  <p id="Par119">A detailed economics analysis plan will be approved by the DMEC and TSC prior to analysis.

It is possible that during the intervention sessions, participants may report “adverse events” to the Trial Practitioners. These will be recorded as part of the therapy log that practitioners will complete after each session. These events will be referred to as ‘therapy reported negative events’ as they will only be applicable to one arm of the Trial. These events will be monitored internally as there is the risk of unblinding researchers. Any serious events will however be reported the same as adverse events.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par133">Care pathways for autistic children and their families need to be proactive, evidence-based, developmentally phased, and scalable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This trial addresses a key evidence gap required within such a care pathway model by providing a robust and well-powered test of a new intervention programme designed to be inclusive and deliverable within a publicly funded health system and to meet the diverse informational, emotional, and relational needs of caregivers in the weeks and months following their child’s diagnosis. The provision of careful, targeted, and holistic support at this critical time will potentially improve wellbeing and prevent escalation of need for both caregivers and their autistic children. If shown to be clinically and cost effective, this programme will fill an important evidence gap within current care pathways within the UK and internationally.</p>
              <p id="Par134">The trial adopts an ambitious primary outcome: caregiver mental health across a 12-month period, with a range a secondary outcomes relating to caregiver and family wellbeing, understanding, and functioning. Blind-rated outcomes complement those that measure first-hand experience. The trial will therefore generate knowledge about the impact of the Empower-Autism programme on diverse facets of caregiver experience, but also any downstream effects on the family and autistic child. Health economic analysis will provide important information about the costs and benefits of this comprehensive programme, compared to standard caregiver post-diagnostic psycho-education offers. Importantly, the nested process evaluation will inform implementation and sustainability beyond the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par135">The trial commenced in October 2020 coinciding with the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic; significant national and local restrictions were in place throughout 2020–2022. Modifications to remote intervention and research delivery were made prior to the commencement of the trial and were then applied throughout the trial timeline. The pandemic brought significant practical and emotional challenges to families of children with disabilities within the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and these challenges will impact upon trial recruitment and retention. To mitigate this, the following measures have been taken: increase in sample size to mitigate attrition, addition of COVID impact questionnaire to measure the adverse effects of the pandemic on individual families across the timeline of their participation in the trial, and qualitative data on effects of pandemic collected within the process evaluation.</p>
