                  <p>The antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties of azithromycin suggest therapeutic potential against COVID-19. Randomised data in mild-to-moderate disease are not available. We assessed whether azithromycin is effective in reducing hospital admission in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This prospective, open-label, randomised superiority trial was done at 19 hospitals in the UK. We enrolled adults aged at least 18 years presenting to hospitals with clinically diagnosed, highly probable or confirmed COVID-19 infection, with fewer than 14 days of symptoms, who were considered suitable for initial ambulatory management. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg once daily orally for 14 days) plus standard care or to standard care alone. The primary outcome was death or hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation. The primary and safety outcomes were assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04381962" id="interrefs20">NCT04381962</ext-link>) and recruitment is closed.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>298 participants were enrolled from June 3, 2020, to Jan 29, 2021. Three participants withdrew consent and requested removal of all data, and three further participants withdrew consent after randomisation, thus, the primary outcome was assessed in 292 participants (145 in the azithromycin group and 147 in the standard care group). The mean age of the participants was 45·9 years (SD 14·9). 15 (10%) participants in the azithromycin group and 17 (12%) in the standard care group were admitted to hospital or died during the study (adjusted OR 0·91 [95% CI 0·43–1·92], p=0·80). No serious adverse events were reported.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed without hospital admission, adding azithromycin to standard care treatment did not reduce the risk of subsequent hospital admission or death. Our findings do not support the use of azithromycin in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.</p>

              <p id="para10">Azithromycin is an orally active synthetic macrolide antibiotic with a wide range of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Early in 2020 it was highlighted by in silico and in vitro<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> screens as a potential candidate therapy to be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, have previously been used to treat other viral infections, including one in three severe cases of MERS-CoV,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> although randomised controlled trial data for its use in any coronavirus disease were absent.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Azithromycin is inexpensive, safe, and widely available, and—stimulated by a small, non-randomised clinical report<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>—its use in the context of COVID-19 has become widespread in clinical practice and clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="para20">In vitro azithromycin has broad antiviral activity against human viruses, including human rhinovirus, Zika virus, enteroviruses, Ebola virus, SARS-CoV,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and against SARS-CoV-2, being shown to reduce viral replication alone<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> or in combination with hydroxychloroquine.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Azithromycin was also associated with reduced viral load of non-SARS-CoV-2 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses in children receiving azithromycin during a mass distribution programme.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although antivirals probably have little efficacy in severe disease after viraemia has peaked,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> azithromycin does have anti-inflammatory properties, including dose-dependent suppression of lymphocyte expression of perforin, and a range of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-18, G-CSF, and GM-CSF<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and other components of the IL-1β–IL-6-induced acute phase response such as serum amyloid protein A.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para30">Despite these theoretical considerations, large-scale clinical trials of azithromycin either alone or co-administered with hydroxychloroquine have not shown clinical efficacy in reducing mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital admission, or clinical status on ordinal outcome scores in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, these trials were all done in late-stage, severe disease with 17–40% mortality. They did not study patients at earlier stages of disease in the community and are not able to make conclusions about the effectiveness of azithromycin outside the hospital setting. The efficacy of therapies in COVID-19 depends on the timing in the course of disease and in the populations being studied. Dexamethasone showed a strong survival benefit with treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 but no benefit, or even potential harm, in those not requiring oxygen therapy.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Conversely, studies of neutralising antibodies showed benefits in early disease<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> but not in patients admitted to hospital.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin are suited to earlier-stage disease; thus, we studied an ambulatory population to establish whether it averts disease progression.</p>

                  <p id="para60">We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials with the terms (“azithromycin”) AND (“COVID” OR “COVID-19”) AND (“clinical trials”), until March 25, 2021, with no language restrictions. We identified 42 studies, among which there were four completed randomised trials of azithromycin (with or without hydroxychloroquine) in patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 disease, and three completed randomised trials of azithromycin in patients with mild COVID-19 in primary care. The four randomised trials in patients admitted to hospital assigned 8988 participants to azithromycin or standard care or hydroxychloroquine and found no evidence of a difference in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or peak disease severity. The three trials in primary care settings randomly assigned participants with early disease to 3 days or 5 days of therapy, and only one assessed azithromycin as standalone therapy. That trial was a large, adaptive platform trial in the UK that randomly assigned 540 participants in primary care to 3 days of treatment with azithromycin and 875 participants to standard care alone and found no meaningful difference in time to first reported recovery or in rates of hospital admission (3% in both groups), and there were no deaths. We did not identify any randomised trials in patients with COVID-19 managed in ambulatory care.</p>

                  <p id="para80">The ATOMIC2 trial was uniquely designed to assess azithromycin as a standalone therapy in those with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 presenting to emergency care but assessed as appropriate for initial ambulatory management without hospital admission. ATOMIC2 also uniquely assessed high-dose, long-duration treatment to investigate the efficacy of putative anti-inflammatory effects. We found that azithromycin 500 mg daily for 14 days did not reduce the proportion of participants who died or required hospital admission from any cause over the 28 days from randomisation compared with standard care.</p>

Attendance for assessment in secondary care will have occurred via referral from primary care, or a national helpline, or self-referral. Key exclusion criteria were known hypersensitivity to any macrolide or the excipients, fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency, current therapy with a macrolide antibiotic, hydroxychloroquine, or chloroquine, significant myocarditis, prolongation of a corrected QT interval (QTc) of more than 480 msec, significant electrolyte disturbance, clinically relevant bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, unstable severe cardiac insufficiency, and inability to understand written English.

Optional study samples were taken at baseline and on one further occasion if the participant was admitted: oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and nasal and blood samples for RNA transcriptomic analysis. Bloods and chest x-rays were done if clinically required.</p>
                <p id="para160">Patients in the azithromycin group received 500 mg azithromycin once daily orally plus standard care for 14 days and those in the control group received standard care according to local guidelines. Use of corticosteroids, other immunomodulators, antibiotics, and antivirals was permitted after randomisation, but the protocol excluded concomitant use of quinolone or macrolides antibiotics at enrolment or during follow-up. Subsequent assessments were conducted by telephone at days 14 and 28, and radiology results and clinical notes were assessed daily during hospital admission if this occurred.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis and protocol changes</title>
                <p id="para190">We had originally planned for the trial to recruit up to 800 participants and use the following primary outcome: the proportion of participants with hospital admission with respiratory failure requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation or death from any cause within 28 days from randomisation. However, a decision was made at the preplanned interim analysis of 109 participants reaching the 28-day post-randomisation timepoint to update the primary outcome, because no primary outcome events had occurred at that stage. This implied that the original primary outcome, specified early in the pandemic when data on hospital admission rates in this population were unknown, proved incorrect for this population. The change was adopted in line with advice from the data safety monitoring committee and in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO Blueprint for COVID-19 Therapeutic Trials<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> that the primary endpoint should be responsive to the eligible patient population and the definition of the endpoint should be fine-tuned for the pivotal phase, based on the pilot phase of the trial. This change was approved by the research ethics committee and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on Feb 4, 2021, and implemented before final analyses were done. Two other protocol amendments were made while the trial was ongoing to broaden inclusion criteria to include and ensure the safety of participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 144</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para200">Based on WHO recommendations that a pilot phase with 100 patients would be sufficient to inform follow-on clinical research,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> an interim analysis was planned to establish a definitive sample size. Following the revision to the primary outcome and based on masked data from the pilot phase, the definitive sample size was determined. Assuming a 15% rate of all-cause hospital admission or death in the standard care group, we estimated that a minimum of 276 participants providing primary endpoint data would provide 80% power and 5% (two-sided) significance to detect a difference from 15% to 5% in the azithromycin group, a relative reduction of 66%. To allow for 5% loss to follow-up we therefore aimed to recruit a minimum of 291 participants. The full statistical analysis plan is in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 40–86</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para210">For the primary outcome, the difference in proportions between the treatment groups was assessed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test and a 5% (two-sided) significance level. Adjusted analysis was done using logistic regression with progression as the binary outcome, adjusting for the following stratification factors: centre, hypertension, diabetes, and sex. A supporting analysis was also done to further adjust for the following important prognostic variables: age 65 years and older, presence of chronic lung disease, and treatment for cancer. Time-to-event analysis was also done to explore whether the active treatment delays progression. The success of the trial was based on the adjusted analysis. Both relative and absolute differences in proportions are reported together with 95% CIs. Other binary outcomes were assessed using similar methods. Peak severity of illness was considered a categorical variable and assessed using ordinal logistic regression analysis. The change in severity scale score from baseline was summarised on a continuous scale using means, SDs, medians, IQRs, and ranges. We explored consistency of results for the following prespecified stratification factors: hypertension, diabetes, sex, and age using treatment by variable interaction tests and forest plots. Analyses were done using Stata IC, version 15.1.</p>

The remaining two trials also used short courses of azithromycin 500 mg for 1 day followed by 250 mg for 4 days and taken in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine. Q-PROTECT recruited healthy, SARS-CoV-2-positive men in a quarantine site in Qatar and found no difference in time to virological cure (p=0·82),<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> with low rates of hospital admission in all groups (2·4%). A study in the USA assessed progression to lower respiratory tract infection, hospital admission, or death and time to viral clearance in SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients, but was stopped early for futility because of a low rate of clinical outcomes in this population, and found no difference in the co-primary outcome of time to virological clearance (HR 1·25 [95% CI 0·75 to 2·07], p=0·39).<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> No studies have assessed azithromycin in patients presenting to hospital with substantial symptoms, but early enough in the disease process to be managed in ambulant care, and neither have previous studies assessed high-dose, long-duration azithromycin therapy in early disease.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our study investigated this intermediate population with early disease, but at high risk of deterioration, in whom 11% required subsequent hospital admission. Therefore, our population represents those with the optimal chance of demonstrating clinical benefit in early disease. We did not observe a significant difference in our primary outcome. Given the small absolute event rates for the primary outcome in our study, a smaller but clinically relevant effect cannot be entirely ruled out, but would be unlikely to change clinical practice. Nonetheless, this finding, taken together with clear negative results across the disease course from early, low-risk patients, to patients admitted to hospital with severe disease, provides strong confirmation that azithromycin is not effective in treating COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para340">A unique feature of ATOMIC2 was its successful implementation at the interface between community and secondary care, which is often a challenging location to recruit due to pressures for rapid clinical decision making. This implementation was made possible by electronic screening, consent, and recruitment. This platform, along with simplicity and broad inclusion criteria, have facilitated a second strength of the study: inclusion of an ethnically diverse population, with 32% of participants recruited from Black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. This is important as COVID-19 is a global pandemic, with a disproportionate impact on BAME groups, yet these groups are under-represented in many COVID-19 trials, which might reduce external validity.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Another strength of our study is that in contrast to other studies, the high dose (500 mg daily) and long duration (14 days) of azithromycin was used to ensure that we adequately assessed potential antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory benefits. COVID-19 is considered to have a distinct early viraemic phase and a late inflammatory phase in some individuals, and therefore assessment of antiviral activity needs to be early in the disease course before onset of severe disease.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Conversely it was not known what doses might be required to produce an adequate anti-inflammatory effect so it was necessary to give a high dose of long duration to ensure the anti-inflammatory effect was tested throughout the late stage of innate or acute phase inflammatory cytokine dysregulation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> An additional strength is that we were also able to exclude a significant benefit from azithromycin's antibiotic effects, which was not possible in studies of patients in hospital where co-prescribing of β-lactam and other antibiotics was common.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Our data show that secondary bacterial infection is not a major driver of hospital admission in this population.</p>
              <p id="para350">A limitation of our trial is that it was open-label, because of the difficulty obtaining appropriate placebos early in the pandemic and is therefore at risk of bias particularly on patient-reported outcomes. However, our choice of hospital admission and death as the primary outcome is unlikely to be markedly influenced by selection, detection or observer bias. Detection of admission to hospital has been easier because of restricted movement during lockdowns, from use of regional and national electronic health records, and by systematic contacting of all participants, with more than 95% follow-up. Moreover, a placebo effect from perceived benefits of treatment would tend towards a positive effect of azithromycin, which was not observed. Knowledge of treatment allocation might also lead to a tendency to more antibiotic prescribing in the placebo group—an effect we observed—which would tend to prejudice against azithromycin as an antibiotic, although concomitant use of macrolides specifically was prohibited by the protocol. A second limitation is that, like other studies,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> we used a clinical diagnosis for inclusion, rather than requiring PCR confirmation, and PCR data were not available for all participants—particularly at the early stages of the pandemic in the UK where low testing capacity was directed to patients who needed admission to hospital. While it is likely some participants who did not ultimately have COVID-19 might have been enrolled, this decision reflects the situation in many urgent care settings globally where PCR confirmation is not immediately available, and enhances the generalisability of our findings. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 66% of those with successful PCR assays in our study, which is much higher than the 31% PCR-positive rate observed in PRINCIPLE,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and study results were similar in the overall ITT group and the predefined PCR-positive subgroup analysis. An ITT analysis was selected as the most appropriate approach to establish whether this intervention affects clinical outcomes. While throat swab PCR assays have high specificity, they have low sensitivity in routine clinical practice, and consequently where there is a high pre-test probability for COVID-19, as was the situation in those enrolled, a negative PCR result has a low negative predictive value and most negative results will be false negatives.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> A third limitation is the relatively young mean age of the study population (45·9 years), which reduces the proportion who are likely to have severe disease. Nonetheless, the primary outcome occurred in more than 10% of participants, and globally, individuals of similar age could have been receiving azithromycin therapy in many countries. Other limitations are incomplete compliance to the long treatment regimen in some individuals and absence of data on microbiology or long-term outcomes beyond 28 days.</p>
              <p id="para360">In the past year, more than 40 clinical trials of azithromycin in COVID-19 have been registered.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Given positive data from in silico and in vitro<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> screens and data showing suppression of innate inflammatory cytokines in vitro, and clinical trial data in non-SARS-CoV-2 alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> why might these have not translated into clinical efficacy? Other antiviral molecules have had little clinical effect in COVID-19 compared with immunosuppressive therapies, except in very early disease. In common with influenza, antivirals are probably only efficacious in the early viraemic disease stage and are ineffective in severe disease, which is more closely linked to differences in host immune factors. In contrast to influenza A pandemics, the antibacterial effects of azithromycin are unlikely to translate into significant clinical benefit in a disease where secondary bacterial pneumonia is rare.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> While many studies have shown azithromycin suppression of innate cytokines known to be key mediators of severe disease, including IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL-8, TNF, and GM-CSF, some of these data might be confounded by antibacterial effects in the original studies, and it might be that the suppression achieved by azithromycin is simply insufficient to overcome the overwhelming cytokine production triggered by this virus in susceptible individuals.</p>
              <p id="para370">We found no evidence of safety concerns associated with azithromycin, despite the quite high dose and long course prescribed. In particular, there were no adverse cardiac events; a concern raised by studies of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine co-prescribing.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> In a Danish cohort analysis of 10·6 million prescriptions, azithromycin prescribing has been associated cardiovascular death (rate ratio 2·85 [95% CI 1·13–7·24]) compared with no antibiotics, but this is probably because of the underlying indication because, when compared with penicillin V, there was no increased risk once adjusted for propensity scores (rate ratio 0·93 [0·56–1·55]).<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This analysis was performed in a population with a low baseline risk of cardiovascular death, and it should be noted that we excluded patients with a prolonged QT interval at baseline electrocardiogram. Nonetheless, there are considerable population risks of unwarranted prescribing of azithromycin, which is a highly valuable antimicrobial and yet has a particularly high propensity for inducing antimicrobial resistance, both to macrolides and to other drug classes, including β-lactam antibiotics.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para380">In conclusion, our findings in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed in ambulatory care, taken together with trials in early disease in primary care and from trials in patients admitted to hospital with severe disease, suggest that azithromycin does not reduce hospital admissions, respiratory failure, or death compared with standard care, and should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
