                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Randomised controlled trials of typhoid conjugate vaccines among children in Africa and Asia have shown high short-term efficacy. Data on the durability of protection beyond 2 years are sparse. We present the final analysis of a randomised controlled trial in Malawi, encompassing more than 4 years of follow-up, with the aim of investigating vaccine efficacy over time and by age group.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this phase 3, double-blind, randomised controlled efficacy trial in Blantyre, Malawi, healthy children aged 9 months to 12 years were randomly assigned (1:1) by an unmasked statistician to receive a single dose of Vi polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid vaccine (Vi-TT) or meningococcal capsular group A conjugate (MenA) vaccine. Children had to have no previous history of typhoid vaccination and reside in the study areas for inclusion and were recruited from government schools and health centres. Participants, their parents or guardians, and the study team were masked to vaccine allocation. Nurses administering vaccines were unmasked. We did surveillance for febrile illness from vaccination until follow-up completion. The primary outcome was first occurrence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Eligible children who were randomly assigned and vaccinated were included in the intention-to-treat analyses.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 21, 2018, and Sept 27, 2018, 28 130 children were vaccinated; 14 069 were assigned to receive Vi-TT and 14 061 to receive MenA. After a median follow-up of 4·3 years (IQR 4·2–4·5), 24 (39·7 cases per 100 000 person-years) children in the Vi-TT group and 110 (182·7 cases per 100 000 person-years) children in the MenA group were diagnosed with a first episode of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. In the intention-to-treat population, efficacy of Vi-TT was 78·3% (95% CI 66·3–86·1), and 163 (129–222) children needed to be vaccinated to prevent one case. Efficacies by age group were 70·6% (6·4–93·0) for children aged 9 months to 2 years; 79·6% (45·8–93·9) for children aged 2–4 years; and 79·3% (63·5–89·0) for children aged 5–12 years.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>A single dose of Vi-TT is durably efficacious for at least 4 years among children aged 9 months to 12 years and shows efficacy in all age groups, including children younger than 2 years. These results support current WHO recommendations in typhoid-endemic areas for mass campaigns among children aged 9 months to 15 years, followed by routine introduction in the first 2 years of life.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Typhoid fever imposes a high burden of disease and an increasing threat to public health in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The scarcity of diagnostic tools and surveillance platforms makes estimating the burden of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhi (<italic>S</italic> Typhi) challenging and, as a result, typhoid fever incidence is underestimated in many low-income settings.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The case fatality rate for typhoid fever is estimated to be 1% in Asia, rising to 5·4% in Africa,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and is highest when treatment and access to care is delayed or inadequate. Severe and complicated disease, which is estimated to comprise 26% of cases, is associated with substantial morbidity.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The global emergence of antibiotic resistance, including multidrug resistance against first-line agents (ie, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility, has contributed to transcontinental spread of typhoid fever, and reduces the efficacy of existing treatments.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The rise of extensively drug-resistant typhoid strains in Asia further threatens public health, heightening the importance of introducing typhoid vaccination in endemic regions.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Before 2017, globally available vaccines against typhoid fever included a parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-PS) and the live oral Ty21a vaccine. Neither, however, are approved for use in children younger than 2 years, and both require repeated dosing for durable efficacy. A Cochrane systematic review estimated that the efficacy of Vi-PS fell from 69% (95% CI 63–74) after 1 year to 55% (95% CI 30–70) after 3 years.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The vaccine efficacy of Ty21a was estimated to be 50% (95% CI 35–61) after 2·5–3 years. As a result, although these vaccines are used for travellers from high-income settings and for outbreak control, and although they are recommended by WHO,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> they have not been used in routine immunisation programmes in low-income and middle-income countries.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">Until 2018, the only WHO-recommended vaccines available were Vi polysaccharide or Ty21a live oral vaccines, which were not suitable for children younger than 2 years and were accordingly rarely used in low-income settings. WHO recommended typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in 2018 for mass catch-up campaigns for those up to 15 years of age and routine introduction at age 9–15 months in endemic countries, with priority to countries with high typhoid incidence or high antimicrobial resistance among <italic>S</italic> Typhi isolates. Randomised controlled trials in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Malawi established the efficacy of the vaccine at 18–36 months after vaccination.</p>
                  <p id="para60">We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for clinical trials involving children using the terms “typhoid conjugate vaccine” and “efficacy” between Jan 1, 1970, and March 29, 2023, with no language restrictions and filters for the following age ranges: 1–23 months, 2–5 years, 6–12 years, and 13–18 years. Five clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of TCV in children in Malawi, Nepal, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and India were identified. The TCV efficacy trials conducted in Malawi, Nepal, and Bangladesh used single-dose Vi-TT and reported vaccine efficacy against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever of 80·7% (95% CI 64·2–89·6) at 18–24 months in Malawi, 79·0% (61·9–88·5) at 24 months in Nepal, and 85% (97·5% CI 76–91) at 18 months in Bangladesh.</p>
                  <p id="para70">The other two trials identified in the search used two-dose regimens of Vi polysaccharide conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (Vi-rEPA; in Viet Nam) and Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugated typhoid vaccine (PedaTyph; in India). The trial of Vi-rEPA began in 1998 and found a vaccine efficacy of 91·5% (95% CI 77·1–96·6) against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever through 27 months of follow-up in children aged 2–5 years. After unmasking, passive surveillance was conducted for another 19 months, with a vaccine efficacy of 82·4% (22·3–99·1) during that period. The Vi-rEPA did not progress further in development and was not marketed. The PedaTyph trial reported a vaccine efficacy of 100% (97·6–100) for a two-dose regimen over a 12-month surveillance period in children aged 6 months to 12 years. In addition to the short follow-up, this trial enrolled a small sample size, was not individually randomised, and did not include a control vaccine.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">This is the first randomised, controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the longer-term efficacy of single-dose TCV in a typhoid fever-endemic setting from 9 months of age. Our study provides evidence that Vi-TT provides durable overall protection beyond 48 months after vaccination among children vaccinated between 9 months and 12 years of age, with little decline in efficacy over time. We estimated that vaccine efficacy reduced over time by only 1·3% per year over 4 years. The longer durability of protection translates into a lower number needed to vaccinate to prevent each case of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. An age-stratified analysis found that the vaccine is efficacious in all age groups, including children younger than 2 years old.</p>
                  <p id="para100">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para110">Our data support robust and durable overall protection—for at least 4 years—in children vaccinated according to the WHO recommendation of a single dose of TCV for infants and children in typhoid-endemic areas. The results from this longer term trial support the high estimated cost-effectiveness of these vaccines, generated using assumptions that were based on previous trials of shorter duration. Further long-term data to assess the durability of protection, particularly in young children following WHO-recommended routine introduction of TCV, are warranted.</p>

              <p id="para120">In endemic areas, typhoid fever occurs over a broad age range, from the first year of life into adulthood, with incidence peaking in most endemic settings among children aged 5–15 years.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> WHO prequalification of a typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) comprising a Vi polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid (Vi-TT, Typbar TCV, Bharat Biotech International) in 2017, and a TCV comprising a Vi polysaccharide conjugated to a variant of diphtheria toxin (Vi-CRM197, TYPHIBEV, Biological E) in 2020, offers a major opportunity to address the substantial burden of typhoid fever with vaccines more suitable for use in endemic settings. TCVs can be administered to children younger than 2 years of age and induce more durable immunity than previous vaccines, enhancing their suitability.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> WHO has recommended single-dose TCV be incorporated into the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) at 9 months or 15 months of age.

MenA was chosen as the comparator because MenA is WHO-prequalified, and, like Vi-TT, is a single-dose polysaccharide-conjugate vaccine approved for the age groups enrolled. Block randomisation was used with block sizes of 6–12. The randomisation allocation sequence was generated by an unmasked statistician using the blockrand package (version 1.3) in R (version 3.4.1). The randomisation allocation sequence was uploaded to password-protected tablets and accessed only by a restricted number of unmasked vaccination nurses in real time, immediately before vaccination, in screened-off vaccination areas. Masking was monitored in real-time by senior study team members who supervised the general flow and process from outside the blinded vaccination area. Participants, their parents or guardians, and the study team involved in subsequent disease surveillance screening, eligibility assessment, and follow-up were masked to vaccine allocation.</p>

Children who met the prespecified case definition (ie, measured axillary temperature of ≥38°C; history of documented or subjective fever for 3 days or more; or hospital admission with fever of any duration) had blood-culture and malaria rapid diagnostic tests performed. Clinical details and previous antibiotic use by the participants were recorded on an electronic case report form by study team clinicians.

                <p id="para230">All trial data were collected directly on tablets by study staff and uploaded to a REDCap database. Data were carefully reviewed and incomplete, incorrect, or inaccurate data were identified and modified through site queries and additional investigation. When this process was complete, the database was locked. Details of sample size and power calculations have been reported.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Briefly, assuming 75% vaccine efficacy, the minimum number of total cases needed to test the null hypothesis that the vaccine has no protective efficacy (ie, vaccine efficacy ≤0), with 90% power, was 30. The primary analysis was conducted under the intention-to-treat principle, in which all children who were randomly assigned and received a dose of a vaccine were included in the analysis; vaccine group was defined based on the vaccine that was randomly assigned not the vaccine that was actually received. In the intention-to-treat analysis, all first occurrences of blood culture-confirmed typhoid cases after vaccination were used. In the per-protocol analysis, only children who received the assigned vaccine and completed the trial without any protocol deviations were included. All occurrences of blood culture-confirmed typhoid cases within 14 days after vaccination were excluded in the per-protocol analysis.</p>
                <p id="para240">For each child, the follow-up time since the date of vaccination was calculated as the smallest of the following: time to the first episode of typhoid fever; time to withdrawal from the trial, loss to follow-up, death, or confirmed relocation out of the trial area; or the time to the end of the analysis period (Sept 30, 2022). Typhoid incidence rate was calculated as the number of first episodes of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever divided by the total follow-up time. The vaccine efficacy was calculated as (1 – incidence rate ratio) × 100%, where the incidence rate ratio was defined as the ratio of the incidence rate in the Vi-TT group to that in the MenA group. The absolute risk reduction was calculated as the risk of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever in the MenA group minus that in the Vi-TT group. The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever was calculated as 1 divided by the absolute risk reduction.</p>
                <p id="para250">Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the incidence rate of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever, incidence rate ratio, and vaccine efficacy among the following prespecified subgroups: age at the time of vaccination (ie, &lt;2 years; 2–4 years; ≥5 years), sex, and study site residence (ie, Ndirande or Zingwangwa). The test of homogeneity in incidence rate ratio and vaccine efficacy across subgroups was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel method.</p>
                <p id="para260">We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the cumulative incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever since the date of vaccination for each vaccine group with p values calculated using both a log-rank test and Wilcoxon–Breslow–Gehan test. The incidence rate for each vaccine group and the vaccine efficacy were computed for various time intervals: cumulative at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and up to 4·61 years (the longest follow-up observed up to the prespecified end-date) after vaccination; and in discrete time periods, 0–1 years, 1–2 years, 2–3 years, 3–4 years, and 4–4·61 years after vaccination. The trend in vaccine efficacy over the discrete intervals was examined using a weighted linear regression. All analyses were performed using Stata/SE version 17.</p>

The overall vaccine efficacy was similar among the three age groups (70·6% for children younger than 2 years, 79·6% for children aged 2–4 years, and 79·3% for children aged 5–12 years; p=0·85). The number needed to vaccinate was also similar across all age groups. Vaccine efficacy was not significantly different by sex (82%, 95% CI 64·3–91·8 among males and 74·5%, 53·6–86·9 among females; p=0·44), nor by study site residence (76·4%, 58–87·5 in Ndirande and 80·9%, 60·5–91·8 in Zingwangwa; p=0·65; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para360">During the duration of the trial, there were 15 hospital admissions due to typhoid fever in the MenA group, and six hospital admissions due to typhoid fever in the Vi-TT group. There was one death from typhoid fever in a child who received the MenA vaccine. Secondary endpoint safety results per protocol (solicited and unsolicited adverse events to 30 min, 7 days, and 28 days; serious adverse events to 28 days and 6 months) have been reported previously.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> There were no serious adverse events or deaths attributable to the vaccine at any point in the trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para380">In this large, randomised controlled trial among Malawian children aged 9 months to 12 years at vaccination, a single dose of Vi-TT offered at least 4 years of protection against blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever, with a cumulative vaccine efficacy of 78·3%. The loss of vaccine efficacy over time, across all age groups, was estimated to be only 1·3% per annum over more than 4 years. By showing durable protection, this study further highlights the probable public health benefit and economic value of TCVs. Longer follow-up until at least 48 months has identified an increased number of cases prevented by the original single-dose vaccine intervention. The estimated number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of typhoid is based on the reduction in absolute risk of typhoid in individuals vaccinated with Vi-TT compared with those vaccinated with MenA. Our data show that the estimated number needed to vaccinate is now 163 children, which is substantially lower than the previous estimate of 278 children reported at the 18–24-month analysis, due to the additional infections prevented with the longer duration of follow-up. These results are likely to be reflected in more beneficial cost-effectiveness analyses, representing enhanced value for policy makers.</p>
              <p id="para390">We found protection in all age groups, including children younger than 2 years of age. Durability of protection in those younger than 2 years is particularly important, given our findings that the incidence of typhoid fever in the control group is similar across age-bands. Therefore, the WHO-recommended single-dose TCV administered in the first or second year of life will need to protect a child over many years of risk. Our vaccine efficacy point estimate of 70·6% in this youngest age group is similar to the total vaccine effectiveness point estimate of 81% reported for Vi-TT in children younger than 2 years of age in a cluster-randomised trial in Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The slightly higher point estimate in Bangladesh can be attributed to the shorter duration of follow-up (17 months in the Bangladesh study versus 4·3 years in this study), and the potential for indirect effects in the cluster-randomised study design.</p>
              <p id="para400">Although the results of this study are strongly supportive of current WHO recommendations, continued data are needed from real-world post-introduction effectiveness and impact studies, to assess the strength and durability of protection, particularly in those children who receive vaccine during the routine EPI visit. Although the point estimates of vaccine efficacy in our study did not differ significantly by age group, the lowest point estimate was seen in the youngest children. This pattern is similar to that reported from an individually randomised efficacy trial in Nepal, where children younger than 5 years had a lower point estimate of vaccine efficacy for Vi-TT than children aged 5 years and older.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Insufficient numbers of children were enrolled in the Nepal study before 2 years of age to assess efficacy in that age stratum. Further, immunogenicity data from both the Nepal and this trial showed numerically more rapid decline in vaccine-induced antibody titres in younger children compared with older age groups but this did not reach statistical significance.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of <italic>S</italic> Typhi predicted that a waning of vaccine-induced immunity could lead to a rebound in typhoid incidence 5–15 years after vaccine introduction, emphasising the need for longer term efficacy data.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Whether additional benefit could be gained with a second dose of vaccine is unknown. An immunogenicity study of a booster dose of Vi-TT administered approximately 5 years after the initial dose of Vi-TT among a subset of the youngest children who were enrolled in this study is currently underway in Malawi.</p>
              <p id="para410">This trial had some limitations. The number of children presenting for passive surveillance and blood culture collection decreased during the first 2 years. Any such cohort trial conducted over more than 4 years in an urban African setting would be expected to have some loss to follow-up or declining surveillance attendance due to migration out of the study area and increasing age of the cohort. Although this decline could result in underestimation of the true incidence of disease, it would not be expected to cause bias or affect the vaccine efficacy result, as these factors would be unrelated to vaccine allocation groups, for which participants and their parents or guardians were masked. The under-estimation of true disease incidence, however, would result in a number needed to vaccinate that is lower than calculated herein, meaning that the probable health and economic benefits of vaccination would be even greater than identified from the data presented here.</p>
              <p id="para420">The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted surveillance activities, with an initial suspension of study activities for nearly 5 months, followed by resumption of surveillance. In keeping with other trends in Malawi, health facility attendance recovered only gradually, which was reflected in reduced blood culture collection and case detection between year 2 and year 3 after the trial start date. Importantly, however, attendance and case detection recovered in the later stages, allowing us to robustly assess the durability of protection. Again, although this might result in the true incidence being underestimated, in most scenarios we would not expect that the effect of COVID-19 on attendance would cause bias or affect the estimates of vaccine efficacy, which were based on the comparison of incidences between groups, since both vaccine allocation groups should be equally affected. In the unlikely scenario that substantial typhoid cases occurred during the COVID-19 pause, then the efficacy reported herein is likely an underestimate.</p>
              <p id="para430">In summary, this study has found high and durable efficacy of a single dose of Vi-TT across all age groups, providing crucial evidence for the probable cost-effectiveness and success of routine immunisation and mass vaccination campaigns in areas of high disease burden. Since November, 2019, Pakistan, Liberia, Zimbabwe, Samoa, and Nepal have introduced TCV through campaigns followed by routine immunisation. In Malawi, our findings informed a nationwide TCV campaign, conducted in May, 2023, for all children aged 9 months to 15 years, followed by integration of TCV into routine EPI at 9 months of age. Importantly, the previously shown high tolerability of TCV and its lack of interference with other routine vaccines<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> allowed the Malawi campaign to be integrated with the delivery of the measles–rubella vaccine, oral poliovirus vaccine, and vitamin A. This integrated health programme in Malawi has come at a crucial time, when Malawi and other regional African countries are struggling with climate change, extreme weather events, and increased urbanisation; patterns which are likely to contribute to increases in enteric diseases, including typhoid fever, in the absence of urgent interventions. Importantly, the surveillance infrastructure existing in this study area for more than 10 years, and strengthened through this trial, will be used to assess the effect of the new vaccination programme.</p>
