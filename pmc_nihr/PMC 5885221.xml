              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes 20% of all ischemic strokes<sup><xref rid="noi170126r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> It is thought that a diffuse arteriopathy of the cerebral small vessels results in hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral autoregulation, with subsequent ischemia leading to white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) visible on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as lacunar infarction.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Hypertension is the most important risk factor for SVD.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Prior studies have reported that more intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering (typically targeting a systolic BP of approximately 120 mm Hg compared with the standard target of 140 mm Hg) is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events in primary prevention<sup><xref rid="noi170126r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and with decreased recurrent stroke risk in secondary prevention in unselected patients with stroke.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Such approaches may also be beneficial in SVD, but concern has been raised that overzealous BP lowering could exacerbate hypoperfusion,<sup><xref rid="noi170126r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> extending brain injury.</p>
              <p>Studies<sup><xref rid="noi170126r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="noi170126r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> have shown reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the white matter (WM) (and normal-appearing WM [NAWM]) of patients with SVD and have shown that the degree of hypoperfusion correlates with the severity of WMHs, consistent with a causal role in the disease pathogenesis. It has also been demonstrated that the limits of autoregulation are shifted upward as a consequence of structural vascular adaptation in individuals with chronic hypertension.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> This evidence has led to the hypothesis that a higher systemic BP is required to maintain adequate CBF in SVD and that excess BP lowering may increase ischemia and worsen WMHs and cognition.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>However, a 2013 study<sup><xref rid="noi170126r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> demonstrated that intensive BP lowering in elderly patients with hypertension without stroke was associated with increased CBF, hypothetically due to a reshifting of the cerebral autoregulatory curve. In addition, a large trial on SVD showed a trend toward reduced recurrent stroke with intensive BP lowering.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, many patients in that study had isolated lacunar infarction without WMHs. Whether intensive BP lowering may be associated with worse outcome in patients with severe SVD and confluent WMHs, which is the group in whom severely reduced CBF and autoregulation have been reported, remains uncertain. To address this question, we performed a randomized clinical trial to investigate if standard vs intensive BP lowering in patients with lacunar stroke and confluent WMHs has different effects on CBF over 3 months.</p>

                <p>The PRESERVE study has a parallel trial design. After recruitment, participants were randomized (stratified via site) to either the standard (systolic BP target, 130-140 mm Hg) or intensive (systolic BP target, &lt;125 mm Hg) treatment group (aiming for a systolic BP difference between treatment groups of ≥15 mm Hg) in a 1:1 ratio via a centralized, online system (based at the Mental Health and Neurosciences Clinical Trials Unit, King’s College London) by a research nurse or physician, who then allocated the participant to the assigned group. No changes were made to the methods or trial outcomes after trial commencement. There were no interim analyses or stopping guidelines. Treatment allocation was known to participants and clinical staff (B.M., U.K., and other nonauthors), but analysis of data was performed masked.</p>
                <p>Assessments in clinic were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Additional clinic or telephone check-ups were performed as necessary. Participants took daily sitting readings with home BP monitors for at least 3 days before each check-up. During clinic visits, systolic and diastolic BP was measured in a sitting position 3 times after a 10-minute rest period in a quiet room. The recorded BP was the mean of the second and third measures. At each check-up, if the participant’s BP was above his or her study target (and provided that hypotensive symptoms did not prevent it), an increase in antihypertensive medication was prescribed. Results presented and used in the analysis were clinic BP readings.</p>

                <p>Site 1 used a 3-T Achieva TX imaging system (Philips Medical Systems), while site 2 initially used a 3-T Achieva (n = 24) and then a 3-T Achieva TX (n = 5) after an upgrade (all participants received both scans on the same scanner). At baseline, the protocol included 3-dimensional (3-D) T1-weighted (T1W) and 2-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and pulsed ASL sequences. The T1W and ASL sequences were repeated at the 3-month time point. Details of each sequence are given below.</p>
                <p>Sagittal 3-D T1W images included turbo field echo, voxel size of 1-mm isotropic, field of view (FOV) of 240 × 170 mm<sup>3</sup>, and repetition time/echo time of 8.27/4.61 milliseconds (site 1) and 9.81/4.60 milliseconds (site 2). Axial FLAIR included voxel size of 0.48 × 0.48 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, FOV of 230 × 230 mm<sup>2</sup>, 57 slices, repetition time/echo time of 11 000/120 milliseconds, and inversion time of 2800 milliseconds.</p>
                <p>Axial pulsed ASL included FOV of 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, 10 slices, and inversion time at the most inferior slice of 1500 milliseconds. Site 1 used echo-planar imaging-based signal targeting by alternating radiofrequency pulses (EPISTAR),<sup><xref rid="noi170126r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> with a voxel size of 3.2 × 3.2 × 6 mm<sup>3</sup>, repetition time/echo time of 4000/27 milliseconds, 40° flip angle, and 120 tag/control pairs.

                <p>Additional images were acquired for the ASL sequences. These included M0 and Geo EPI images for EPISTAR (voxel size of 3.2 × 3.2 × 6 mm<sup>2</sup>, FOV of 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, 10 slices, 90° flip angle, 1 acquisition, and repetition time/echo time of 15 000/27 milliseconds for M0 and 500/18 milliseconds for Geo) and sets of 6 acquisitions at inversion times of 900, 1200, 1800, 2100, and 2400 milliseconds for FAIR (same acquisition as the main sequence).</p>
                <p>To ensure standardization, 4 healthy individuals underwent the full imaging protocol at each site before study commencement.

                  <p>Arterial spin labeling is an MRI technique that quantifies CBF without exogenous contrast agent. It instead uses the difference in signal between images where blood has or has not been magnetically tagged and converts this into CBF (in milliliters per minute per 100 g) via a model that takes into account variables such as the efficiency of the magnetic tag.

              <p>The PRESERVE trial began recruitment on February 29, 2012. The last patient included was recruited on October 21, 2015. Recruitment across all PRESERVE sites closed on October 30, 2015. Patient flow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="noi170126f1">Figure 1</xref>. Sixty-two participants returned complete, usable data sets (36 at site 1 and 26 at site 2, including 33 in the standard group and 29 in the intensive group). Across this group of 62 participants, the mean age was 69.3 years, and 60% (n = 37) were male; sex distribution within treatment groups was 64% (21 of 33) in the standard group and 55% (16 of 29) in the intensive group. Characteristics of those who dropped out (n = 6) were descriptively similar to those who remained in the study. For those who dropped out, the mean age was 69.4 years, 4 of 6 were male, the mean baseline systolic BP was 152 mm Hg, and the mean baseline Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was 24.50. For those who stayed in the study, the mean age was 69.5 years, 61% (39 of 64) were male, the mean baseline systolic BP was 151 mm Hg, and the mean baseline MoCA was 24.72.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial, we investigated the effect of standard vs intensive BP lowering on CBF in patients with severe symptomatic SVD, as manifested by both lacunar stroke and confluent WMHs. Our results showed no difference in change in CBF (of any studied ROI) over the 3-month follow-up period between the 2 treatment groups. Furthermore, we found no excess of AEs in the intensive group, including potentially hypotension-related events. This provides support that intensive BP reduction regimens do not cause hypoperfusion in patients with severe symptomatic SVD.</p>
              <p>Intensive BP lowering has been shown to reduce cardiovascular end points in patients without previous cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, there is concern that it may be hazardous in patients with extensive SVD, in whom reduced CBF and impaired cerebral autoregulation have been previously demonstrated.<sup><xref rid="noi170126r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Therefore, our results are reassuring that intensive treatment can be used in this patient cohort.</p>
              <p>These findings complement the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes 3 trial,<sup><xref rid="noi170126r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which did not measure CBF but applied a similar BP regimen to patients with MRI-confirmed lacunar stroke (but not necessarily confluent WMHs). The intensive treatment was tolerated compared with the standard treatment with regard to outcomes such as SAEs and also showed a trend toward a reduced stroke rate. However, our findings do not support previous work in patients with hypertension without stroke or SVD,<sup><xref rid="noi170126r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> which found that intensive treatment raised CBF via resetting of the cerebral autoregulatory curve. This may be due to patients with SVD having more severe cerebrovascular disease than the elderly participants with hypertension included in that study, meaning that a potential increase either may not be possible because of the extent of their preexisting damage or may take longer to achieve. The PRESERVE study will investigate this last point when the 2-year study is completed.</p>
              <sec id="H2-14-NOI170126">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study has limitations. The ASL sequences differed slightly; however, baseline CBF values were not significantly different between sites. Because randomization was stratified across sites, this should not have influenced any analyses. The year the study was planned (2010-2011) also restricted ASL techniques; as such (and to maintain data consistency throughout the study duration), recent advances such as QUIPSS (quantitative imaging of perfusion using a single subtraction) were not used. The lack of a FLAIR scan at the 3-month time point means that new WMHs would be classified as NAWM at follow-up (but NAWM findings did not differ from other ROIs, so this is unlikely to have affected any interpretation). Although we achieved our target treatment group BP difference of 15 mm Hg (systolic), only 62% (18 of 29) of intensive group participants reached their target. This diminishes power for the primary and secondary ANOVAs (by data noise and low numbers, respectively). While the regression analysis (which would be unaffected by this) also supports our conclusion of no connection between BP and CBF change, these considerations, as well as the Bayes factor showing moderate support for the null hypothesis, mean that interpretation should be approached with a degree of caution. Finally, because patients who had a stroke within 3 months were ineligible for the study, our findings are not applicable to acute poststroke treatment.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>While 38% (11 of 29) of intensive group patients failed to reach their target BP, our overall findings are consistent with there being no association between BP lowering and change in CBF (or increased clinical AEs) over a 3-month period compared with standard BP lowering. This suggests that intensive BP lowering does not cause cerebral hypoperfusion in patients with severe SVD.</p>
