                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Lynch syndrome is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and with a broader spectrum of cancers, especially endometrial cancer. In 2011, our group reported long-term cancer outcomes (mean follow-up 55·7 months [SD 31·4]) for participants with Lynch syndrome enrolled into a randomised trial of daily aspirin versus placebo. This report completes the planned 10-year follow-up to allow a longer-term assessment of the effect of taking regular aspirin in this high-risk population.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the double-blind, randomised CAPP2 trial, 861 patients from 43 international centres worldwide (707 [82%] from Europe, 112 [13%] from Australasia, 38 [4%] from Africa, and four [&lt;1%] from The Americas) with Lynch syndrome were randomly assigned to receive 600 mg aspirin daily or placebo. Cancer outcomes were monitored for at least 10 years from recruitment with English, Finnish, and Welsh participants being monitored for up to 20 years. The primary endpoint was development of colorectal cancer. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN59521990.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between January, 1999, and March, 2005, 937 eligible patients with Lynch syndrome, mean age 45 years, commenced treatment, of whom 861 agreed to be randomly assigned to the aspirin group or placebo; 427 (50%) participants received aspirin and 434 (50%) placebo. Participants were followed for a mean of 10 years approximating 8500 person-years. 40 (9%) of 427 participants who received aspirin developed colorectal cancer compared with 58 (13%) of 434 who received placebo. Intention-to-treat Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significantly reduced hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 (95% CI 0·43–0·97; p=0·035) for aspirin versus placebo. Negative binomial regression to account for multiple primary events gave an incidence rate ratio of 0·58 (0·39–0·87; p=0·0085). Per-protocol analyses restricted to 509 who achieved 2 years' intervention gave an HR of 0·56 (0·34–0·91; p=0·019) and an incidence rate ratio of 0·50 (0·31–0·82; p=0·0057). Non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers were reported in 36 participants who received aspirin and 36 participants who received placebo. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses showed no effect. For all Lynch syndrome cancers combined, the intention-to-treat analysis did not reach significance but per-protocol analysis showed significantly reduced overall risk for the aspirin group (HR=0·63, 0·43–0·92; p=0·018). Adverse events during the intervention phase between aspirin and placebo groups were similar, and no significant difference in compliance between intervention groups was observed for participants with complete intervention phase data; details reported previously.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">There is extensive evidence from case-control studies, epidemiology, polyp prevention studies, and long-term review of historical aspirin cardiovascular prevention trials that regular intake of aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs over long periods is associated with reduced incidence of colorectal and other cancers. Two trials explored the protective effects of aspirin with cancer as a primary endpoint; the Women's Health Study showed no effect of alternate day 81 mg aspirin up to study end at 10 years, but a subsequent reduction in colorectal cancer in the second decade. The CAPP2 Study randomised 861 carriers of hereditary cancer, Lynch syndrome, average age 42 years, to 600 mg aspirin or 30 g resistant starch, or both in a factorial design. There was no effect at the end of intervention (average 2·5 years) but there was a significant per-protocol protective effect of the aspirin at an average of 4·6 years follow-up.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">The mechanisms of action of aspirin of relevance to colorectal cancer prevention, including for Lynch syndrome, are unknown, thus there is no insight into the time that the intervention takes to come into full effect or the period over which a time-limited intervention will allow protection. By monitoring people with known intervention and disease status, this study examines the magnitude of the effect and provides some indications as to the magnitude of the long-term effect.</p>
                  <p id="para70">The cancer histories of all participants in CAPP2 were reviewed where possible up to the planned 10-year follow-up and a subset in three countries was followed via national registries for up to 20 years. Aspirin prescription ended in 2007 at the latest. Intention-to-treat Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that aspirin protected against the primary endpoint of colorectal cancer (HR=0·65 [95% CI 0·43–0·97], p=0·035). Negative binomial regression, considering all primary cancer diagnoses in the cancer spectrum of Lynch syndrome found similar evidence of aspirin protection (incidence rate ratio 0·58, 95% CI 0·39–0·87, p=0·0085). For those who took aspirin for the planned minimum 2 years, the effect was similar; HR 0·56, CI 0·34–0·91, p=0·019.</p>
                  <p id="para80">There were half as many endometrial cancers in the aspirin group but, overall, non-colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome cancers were not significantly different in the longer follow-up. In the second decade, there was some evidence of a decline in non-Lynch syndrome cancers that did not reach significance.</p>
                  <p id="para90">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">Two standard aspirins per day for 2 years results in a significant reduction in colorectal cancer incidence in Lynch syndrome carriers, which persists for over a decade but does not become apparent until about 5 years from commencement. During intervention, serious adverse events did not differ significantly from the placebo group in this relatively young group. The ongoing CaPP3 Study is a dose non-inferiority trial which will inform optimal doses for cancer prevention versus adverse events. There is now a strong case for prescribing aspirin to young adult carriers of a germline DNA mismatch repair gene defect.</p>

              <p id="para110">The Cancer Prevention Programme (CaPP), originally called the Concerted Action Polyposis Prevention (CAPP) project, was launched in 1993 to investigate therapeutic prevention in those with a proven genetic predisposition to colorectal and other cancers. CAPP1<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> focused on adolescents with familial adenomatous polyposis.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> CAPP2,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which began in 1999, focused on people with Lynch syndrome, formerly known as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, which results from pathogenic variants in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In both trials, the potential cancer preventives were aspirin and resistant starch and a factorial design was used; in CAPP2, participants received 600 mg enteric-coated aspirin or placebo and 30 g of Novelose, a resistant starch, or placebo corn starch, daily. Recruits could opt to be randomly assigned for a single agent only. If a participant agreed to be randomly assigned for aspirin, recruits were treated for 2 years with aspirin or placebo; after a formal review, the design was adapted to allow recruits to consent to continue for a further 2-year period.</p>
              <p id="para120">When participants had completed this intervention phase, data analysis revealed no significant impact on neoplasia which combined colorectal adenoma and carcinoma formation.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> At that stage, there were 20 diagnosed colorectal cancers.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The protocol had anticipated a delayed effect on cancer incidence as is evident from epidemiological studies in the general population<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and provided for follow-up to 10 years. When the first recruits reached their 10-year follow-up (mean follow-up of 4 years 7 months), intention-to-treat analysis showed a non-significant protective effect on colorectal cancer in the aspirin limb compared with placebo<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> (hazard ratio [HR]=0·63, 95% CI 0·35–1·13; p=0·12) with a similar result for all Lynch syndrome cancers. Per-protocol analysis was restricted to those who took aspirin or placebo for the defined minimum 2-year intervention period. This showed significant protection against colorectal cancer (HR=0·41, 95% CI 0·19–0·86; p=0·02) and a similar reduction for all Lynch syndrome cancers (HR=0·45, 95% CI 0·26–0·79; p=0·005).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> We now report the planned 10-year analysis, in which all participants were beyond the 10-year anniversary of their recruitment; this includes the period in which the participant was taking the agent. In addition, we complemented these data through access to the National Cancer Registration &amp; Analysis Service via Public Health England, which provided robust cancer data for the English and Welsh recruits up to 20 years; equivalent data was obtained for the Finnish participants over the same time period.</p>

These data were then linked to study number, anonymised, and sent to the University of Leeds (DTB and FE) for statistical analysis. Participants consented in writing to have their health records followed for 10 years. The study had a pre-planned design for 10-years' follow-up and at the time of this analysis, the last enrolled participant had reached the 10-year threshold.

Secondary clinical outcomes were the size and number of adenomas and of other Lynch syndrome-related cancers.</p>
                <p id="para180">This analysis focused on the 861 CAPP2 study participants randomly assigned to 600 mg aspirin (n=427) or placebo (n=434) from the date of entry until the latest date for which we had information about cancer status, often corresponding to the date of last surveillance attendance and, for recruits in England, Finland, and Wales, supplemented with passive recording of cancer registration. The analysis included Lynch syndrome cancer diagnoses; those that occurred during the intervention phase and subsequent to exit from the intervention phase. Designation of a reported diagnosis as being within the Lynch syndrome cancer spectrum was a clinical assessment, masked to intervention; endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, small bowel, gall bladder, ureter, stomach, and kidney cancers and cancer of the brain were included.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Adverse events during the intervention phase between aspirin and placebo groups were reported previously.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">Power calculations suggested that to detect a 40% reduction in cancer risk among those taking aspirin with 90% power at a 0·05 significance level, about 100 cancer diagnoses post-recruitment were required, indicating approximately 1000 recruits and a 10-year follow-up. In total, 937 eligible patients with Lynch syndrome, mean age 45 years, commenced treatment, of which 861 agreed to be randomly assigned to the aspirin group or placebo and the mean intervention period was 2·5 years. When participants had completed this intervention phase, data analysis revealed no significant effect on neoplasia which combined colorectal adenoma and carcinoma formation.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> At that stage, there were 20 diagnosed colorectal cancers.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The protocol had anticipated a delayed effect on cancer incidence as is evident from epidemiological studies in the general population<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and provided for follow-up to 10 years. When the first recruits reached their 10-year follow-up (mean follow-up of 4 years 7 months), intention-to-treat analysis showed a non-significant protective effect on colorectal cancer in the aspirin group compared with placebo with a similar result for all Lynch syndrome cancers.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Per-protocol analysis was restricted to those who took aspirin or placebo for the defined minimum 2-year intervention period. This showed significant protection against colorectal cancer and a similar reduction for all Lynch syndrome cancers.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para200">Intention-to-treat analyses were done (ie, according to aspirin randomisation; aspirin or placebo). However, as the intention of this trial was to test the efficacy of 2-year intervention with aspirin, we also did a per-protocol analysis that was restricted to those participants who achieved the full 2-year intervention. Participants were provided with two 300 mg tablets daily over the first 2 years of the intervention phase and the numbers of aspirin (or placebo tablets) remaining were recorded. At clinic visits during the intervention period, each participant was asked to show the aspirin (or placebo) remaining, this number was recorded to allow estimation of the number of tablets taken. Participants whose study records indicated having taken at least 1400 tablets were considered as per protocol.</p>
                <p id="para210">Two analytical approaches were used: time to first occurrence of colorectal cancer (our primary endpoint) was examined by means of life-table methods and Cox proportional hazards; and investigation of multiple primary cancers at the same anatomical site or multiple anatomical sites, a feature of Lynch syndrome, by means of negative binomial modelling which considers the complete Lynch syndrome cancer history since randomisation. Previously, we had applied Poisson regression but analysis of this extended dataset indicated over-dispersion, so we have applied negative binomial regression.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para220">For life-table analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis, end of follow-up was determined as the time to first diagnosis of colorectal cancer (or other Lynch syndrome cancer, as appropriate), if the participant was diagnosed with cancer following random assignment, or the last recorded date at which clinical status was known. For the negative binomial regression analysis, exposure time was calculated from randomisation until the date of last known clinical status, or 10 years if this came earlier (20 years if resident in England, Finland, or Wales). Analyses were further done as intention to treat (ie, intervention assigned at randomisation) and per protocol. Beyond 10 years, cancer diagnosis follow-up data from England and Wales were obtained from Public Health England and their Welsh counterparts (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>); all data released by Public Health England was with the approval of their Office for Data Release and within the policy and legal frameworks for the use of patient data collected by the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. Data from the Finnish national registry maintained by the Department of Surgery, Central Finland Healthcare District, Jyväskylä were accessed similarly (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para230">Sex-adjusted and age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) estimates and 95% CIs were calculated by means of Cox proportional hazard models, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess non-parametrically the outcome differences between the aspirin and placebo groups; these adjustments were deemed desirable given the variation of cancer risk with age and the different spectrum of cancer in females and males. The assumption of proportional hazard was tested by means of Schoenfeld residuals. Sex-adjusted and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios were calculated by means of negative binomial regression to estimate the effect of aspirin from log-linear models for the number of primary cancers diagnosed after randomisation and until the last follow-up.</p>
                <p id="para240">A secondary analysis examined the incidence of non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers. A final analysis examined the total burden of Lynch syndrome-related cancers.

Each group had approximately 25 months of intervention and a mean of more than 7 years' follow-up post-intervention. The distribution of time since recruitment was also similar between the groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>); 58 (14%) of the aspirin group and 67 (15%) of the placebo group had no follow-up after the intervention phase, predominantly because of refusal to consent to long-term follow-up (61%) or loss to follow-up (34%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Since randomisation, 40 (9%) of 427 participants randomly assigned to aspirin developed colorectal cancer compared with 58 (13%) of 434 allocated to placebo (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).

There was almost complete concordance in reporting of colorectal cancer diagnoses between the CAPP centre and the national sources; however, concordance for both non-colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome diagnoses and non-Lynch syndrome diagnoses was lower, most notably for Finland.

              <p id="para370">This analysis of data from people with Lynch syndrome recruited to the CAPP2 study shows that the protective effects of aspirin against colorectal cancer has persisted in this long-term analysis of up to 20 years' follow-up. The CAPP2 study data were analysed at the end of the intervention, again when the first recruits reached their 10-year follow-up and now when all participants reached 10-years' follow-up and some approached 20 years since recruitment. Colorectal cancer incidence began to diverge about 5 years after initiating aspirin treatment and this lower cancer incidence was maintained throughout the period of observation.

As would be expected, the effect sizes in the intention-to-treat analysis are less extreme than the per-protocol analysis. The support from this intention-to-treat analysis reduces any concerns that the previous per-protocol finding was attributable, not to aspirin, but to an unidentified confounding factor which associated with non-adherence.</p>

              <p id="para410">The response to aspirin might reflect an effect on the viability of cells with malignant potential as suggested by studies in cell lines and mouse models.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Salicylates in plants modulate the apoptotic response to infection<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and might have a similar pro-apoptotic influence in the gut.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Enhanced destruction of premalignant abnormal cells would offer an explanation for the long time-lag in response to aspirin intervention. The progressive decline in mitochondrial function, on which apoptosis is reliant, in the gut in old age might then contribute to the lesser response to aspirin chemoprevention in old age.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The widespread occurrence of aberrant colonic crypts, defective in mismatch repair, in Lynch syndrome<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> suggests that these might be the premalignant lesions that are suppressed or destroyed by long-term aspirin exposure, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. In addition, whether this occurs via enhanced apoptosis<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> or improved immune surveillance,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> or a combination of these and other mechanisms are important areas for future investigation.</p>
              <p id="para420">It has been suggested that the results of the first follow-up analysis might have reflected a temporary delay in progression of premalignant lesions rather than a true prevention of cancer. This is not supported by the continued separation of the cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer in the two treatment groups.</p>
              <p id="para430">It is noteworthy that the effect on non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers was of similar magnitude to the lower intestinal effects in the 10-year data. The benefit in prevention of non-colorectal cancer tumours was not apparent in the data available for the second decade, suggesting that any preventive effect is not sustained. This is in keeping with the long-term follow up of the Women's Health Study<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> in which the effect of low dose aspirin, which appeared at 10 years, was evident for colorectal cancer only.</p>
              <p id="para440">Weaknesses of this trial are that the geographically dispersed recruitment over a long period made collection of details of endoscopy difficult, so data on adenomas are incomplete and the current analysis is restricted to cancer as an endpoint. We were unable to comment on effect on mortality as the death rate in patients with Lynch syndrome undergoing surveillance is low; that would require a much larger study. Our study attempted to recruit patients with a confirmed, significant mutation in a mismatch repair gene. On that basis, we suggest that the finding is generalisable across all patients with Lynch syndrome. However, we do not have the power to indicate if particular subgroups (eg specific genes or mutations) have effect sizes different from the population overall. Side-effects of treatment were minimal in this relatively young population but are likely to be much higher if aspirin continues to be used into old age as illustrated by the ASPREE trial.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Conversely, the report of an overall anticancer benefit in people over 65 years of age<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> is a reminder of the potential long-term benefits of aspirin as a means of therapeutic prevention of cancer in the wider population. It is noteworthy that 427 participants had 18 fewer colorectal cancers as a result of taking two aspirins a day for an average of 2·5 years, a number needed to treat of 24.</p>
              <p id="para450">The CAPP2 study tested the effect of a single dose of aspirin (600 mg per day) and this study provides evidence that this dose was effective in long-term prevention of colorectal cancer. However, whether this is the optimum aspirin dose in respect of the balance between benefit (cancer risk reduction) and risk (gastrointestinal bleeding) remains to be determined. To address the issue of dosage, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN16261285" id="interrefs30">CaPP3</ext-link> is a randomised dose non-inferiority trial of the dose of 600 mg daily, compared with 300 mg and 100 mg, delivered in a blinded fashion for 2 years followed by open-label treatment for a further 3 years and assessment of Lynch syndrome cancers annually thereafter.</p>
              <p id="para460">With a minimum target of 1500 mismatch repair gene defect carriers, the study closed to recruitment on March 31, 2019, having randomly assigned a total of 1882 Lynch syndrome gene carriers in the UK and four other countries. The first analysis of data from the randomised trial will be done in 2024.</p>
              <p id="para470">In conclusion, the data reported here support the recommendation that adult carriers of a pathogenic mismatch repair gene defect (Lynch syndrome) should be advised that taking 600 mg aspirin daily for at least 2 years significantly reduces the risk of a future cancer, bearing in mind that this effect does not become apparent for at least 4 years.</p>
