                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Full dilatation caesarean sections are associated with recurrent early spontaneous preterm birth and late miscarriage. The risk following first stage caesarean sections, are less well defined, but appears to be increased in late-first stage of labour. The mechanism for this increased risk of late miscarriage and early spontaneous preterm birth in these women is unknown and there are uncertainties with regards to clinical management. Current predictive models of preterm birth (based on transvaginal ultrasound and quantitative fetal fibronectin) have not been validated in these women and it is unknown whether the threshold to define a short cervix (≤25 mm) is reliable in predicting the risk of preterm birth. In addition the efficacy of standard treatments or whether benefit may be derived from prophylactic interventions such as a cervical cerclage is unknown.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), defined as spontaneous birth less than 37<sup>+ 0</sup> weeks’ gestation, is a significant health issue and is the most important single determinant of adverse infant outcome with regards to survival and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Morbidity is inversely correlated to gestational age, and the most significant adverse outcomes are associated with very preterm birth, defined as occurring less than 32<sup>+ 0</sup> weeks’ gestation. Preventative measures which prolong fetal gestation by 1 week, such as those proposed by this study, could save health services £939 million per year in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">While factors such as previous sPTB and cervical surgery are known risk factors for sPTB and late miscarriage (LM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], recently associations have been reported with full dilatation caesarean sections (FDCS). Emerging evidence has shown an association between late miscarriage (LM) (14–24 weeks’ gestation) and sPTB in women with a FDCS at term (affecting approximately 13.5% of these women), and in women who have had an in-labour caesarean section &lt; 10 cm dilated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is hypothesised to be due to a uterine incision, that is inadvertently too low, in or near to effaced cervical tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This occurs because the cervix becomes continuous with the lower segment of the uterus at full dilatation and the anatomy can often be distorted. In addition, tears and angle extensions are common due to the low position of the presenting part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Disruption and scarring of this cervical tissue is thought to result in cervical weakness in future pregnancies. The association between FDCS and LM/sPTB has been recognised in the last 5 years and it presents a pressing clinical problem.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Over 25% of all deliveries in the United Kingdom (UK) are by CS, but up to 20% of in-labour caesarean sections occur at full dilatation, which could affect up to 20,000 women in the UK per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These women have a six-fold increased incidence of subsequent preterm birth compared with women who undergo CS in the first stage of labour (adjusted odds ratio 5.8; 95% confidence interval 1.08–30.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; 13.5% in comparison with 2%. This equates to around 2500 women per year in the UK. In women who lose a pregnancy, more than half will also go on to experience recurrent pregnancy losses in spite of intervention, compared to 14% of women with a history of preterm birth without previous FDCS (relative risk 3.06 95% confidence interval 1.22–7.71) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is thought to be a continuum of risk, i.e. the later in-labour the CS is carried out, the higher the risk of sPTB in future pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">The insertion of a suture around the cervix under regional anaesthesia is an established management strategy in those women at high risk of sPTB. There is little consensus on the optimal procedure, technique, or timing of insertion. Its mechanism of action has been hypothesised as not only supportive but as reinforcing the immunological barrier which protects the fetus from ascending vaginal infection. The benefit of an ultrasound indicated cerclage following evidence of cervical shortening (≤25 mm) on transvaginal ultrasound scan has been reported to demonstrate a significant reduction in delivery &lt; 35 weeks’ gestation compared with expectant management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">A screening programme to assess for cervical shortening in women with a previous FDCS is due to be implemented across England as part of new National Health Service (NHS) commissioning guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the revised <italic>Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is unknown whether transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening for a short cervix predicts outcome in this group and there is currently limited evidence to inform optimal management of these women. It is also unknown whether first-line interventions for short cervix ≤25 mm (vaginally-placed cerclages inserted in the distal cervix during pregnancy), which is used in other high-risk groups of women, is effective in this cohort. Preliminary data indicates that these interventions may be less efficacious, likely due to the injury having occurred in the proximal cervix, above the cerclage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Currently the ultrasound-assessed cervical length (CL) is the only parameter used in clinical practice to guide management of women at high risk of sPTB and this has not been validated in women with previous FDCS. There is a need to assess the features of the cervix and any scar tissue by both MRI and US to evaluate which characteristics can accurately determine which women are likely to go on to experience LM/sPTB. Preliminary data indicates that scars can be consistently identified on ultrasound and their location defined in relation to the internal-os of the cervix. MRI can provide additional information regarding tissue microstructure. Previous studies have indicated that changes in signal intensity of cervical stromal layers have been found on T2 weighted images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and alterations in basic diffusion imaging (sensitive to Brownian motion of water molecules in tissue enabling assessment of microstructure) with relation to the onset of labour reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This will help evaluate the value of imaging and our ability to predict who will need a cerclage – for example location of scar from FDCS.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The development of sophisticated diffusion-imaging techniques such as Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM), has enabled assessment of tissue microstructure, diffusivity and perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. IVIM separates diffusion perfusion from true diffusion effects, the signal decay is described by a biexponential instead of a mon-exponential model which yields a more accurate description of the underlying tissue properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This technique has been used to assess perfusion in cervical carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] but has not been investigated in relation to sPTB. Professor Daniel Alexander (UCL), a world leading expert in the field of diffusion MR imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], has previously harnessed these techniques in the assessment of the breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this project, his team will facilitate optimal data acquisition and analysis of the cervix using IVIM.</p>

                <p id="Par47">Due to MR imaging equipment availability, the CRAFT-IMG subgroup will be recruited from participants attending 2 hospital sites only: University College London and St Thomas’ Hospital, London. All participants will have had a had a prior FDCS and will include women with and without cervical shortening in the current pregnancy based on their CL monitoring. Participants will be allocated to one of three groups: a) women with cervical length of ≤25 mm with no cerclage in place (<italic>n</italic> = 15), b) women with cervical length of ≤25 mm with a cerclage (n = 15), c) women with cervical length of &gt; 25 mm (<italic>n</italic> = 30).</p>
                <p id="Par48">Ultrasound is a commonly used modality in obstetrics to quantify the CL. The CS scar can be identified in the lower uterine segment or cervical tissue using transvaginal ultrasound examination and colour Doppler. The endocervical mucosa and the level of the uterine arteries bilaterally in the para-cervical region is used as a guide to the relative position of the internal cervical os. The CS scar position will be measured in relation to this. The full Caesarean Scar and Niche Measurement Protocol can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

The site of previous scar tissue and any other abnormalities (for example the presence of cysts, niches, sonolucent areas, hypoechoic areas and/or anechoic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) will be recorded where present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Recruited patients will have up to 3 serial transvaginal ultrasounds and MRIs during their pregnancy, as scars are not static and change throughout the course of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Scar interpretation therefore must take gestational age into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par50">The study will be verbally explained to potential participants who will be given a written patient information sheet and adequate time for consideration and clarification of any queries. They can take the information home. For CRAFT-OBS and CRAFT-IMG, eligible patients will have until their next appointment to decide on participation and provide informed written consent. For CRAFT-RCT, eligible patients will generally have up to 48 h to decide on participation, depending on the length of their cervix and urgency of treatment as determined by the attending clinician.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Written consent will be confirmed by a clinician or researcher who has undertaken Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training and who is in the local hospital site delegation log (signed by the Investigator at that site). Three copies of the consent form will be taken (1 for participant, 1 for clinical notes (unless electronic records), 1 for site file). At the time of recruitment, a unique study number will be allocated to the patient. Only one copy of patient identifiable data linked to this number will be recorded on a password protected computer in order that recruits can be contacted and delivery outcomes recorded by the local hospital. The research record will contain minimal identifiers such as initials and date of birth. Keeping initials and date of birth on this research database allows the data to be double-checked against source outcome data, therefore enhancing the reliability of the data.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Consent will be sought to obtain NHS numbers for future tracking of outcomes. NHS numbers (mother and baby) will be collected to aid linkage to these future health records as well as follow up pregnancy and neonatal outcomes for recruits who move away from study sites. NHS numbers will be held separately from main study data and only linked with study ID. Access to this information will be limited to specific study staff. They will also be explicitly consented for use of the study data for future research, collection of additional data on any future pregnancies and whether they would be happy to be contacted about participation in further research studies that may be of interest to them.</p>

An average district general hospital has 4000 deliveries per year, of which 648 (16.2%) might be by emergency caesarean. However, considering individual hospital variations of in-labour caesarean rates, workload of clinical research at individual sites, and that not all women approached will wish to take part, the aim is for 40 maternity hospital sites in the United Kingdom to pragmatically achieve our target of 2200 women (approximately 55 recruits per hospital site).</p>

Assuming 10% event rate, 1000 women (100 cases and 900 controls) would allow use to estimate the sensitivities of qfFN and CL to within 10% and the specificities to within 3% of the true value.

                <p id="Par58">For CRAFT-RCT women will be randomly assigned (1:1) to cerclage or observation at time of recruitment. Computer randomisation will be performed by the co-ordinating research team, and recruiters will be informed the results over the telephone. Due to the nature of the interventions, the study is not blinded to the care providers or patient. Recruiters will not have access to the randomisation sequence. Women will be informed at time of recruitment to which arm they have been randomised. A ‘minimisation’ procedure, using a computer-based algorithm, will be used to avoid chance imbalances in important stratification variables. Stratification variables will be a) previous sPTB, b) previous failed assisted delivery and c) CL of ≤15 mm. Women will not know what treatment they will be allocated prior to recruitment. REDCap, the study specific database management system, will hold a randomisation log accessible by study coordinators and database manager. For more information on the management of data, please see the ‘data management’ section. Contact information will be obtained from the patient. Demographic measures, such as ethnicity and body mass index (BMI), will be entered into the trial database.</p>
                <p id="Par59">Following randomisation in CRAFT-RCT, the attending clinician will arrange for either a cervical cerclage (to be carried out within 7 days) or observation as the randomisation indicates. There is no “emergency code break” procedure as the trial is open label randomised trial. The method and materials used will be according to local protocol, clinician and the individual woman’s preference and documented in the trial database.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Indications for withdrawal of treatment (removal of cerclage) include participant request, elective preterm delivery, fetal membrane rupture, symptomatic placenta praevia and completion to 37 weeks’ gestation. Indication for additional treatment (rescue/emergency cerclage) include exposed membranes or open cervix at 16<sup>+ 0</sup>–27<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation.</p>

This will include current and previous monitoring procedures and/or pregnancy interventions (e.g. cervical length measurements and cerclage). Gestational age will be calculated using ultrasound estimated date of delivery predicted at the 12–15 week ultrasound scan. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes will be collected from NHS patient records postnatally. Those with access to inputting data on the study database will have to complete test participants before gaining full access to ensure they are trained appropriately.</p>
                <p id="Par104">Participants with a history of term FDCS will be referred to a preterm surveillance clinic where they will be offered cervical length assessment (with or without other tests, such as fetal fibronectin) from 14<sup>+ 0</sup> to 23<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks gestation as per current standard care pathway. Cervical length will be measured with transvaginal ultrasound in accordance with local protocols, measurements will be taken in triplicate and the shortest measurement used. If the cervical length is, or becomes ≤25 mm during this period the participant will be offered the opportunity to take part in CRAFT-RCT. Further explanation and a separate information sheet will be provided and additional written consent will be obtained. If the participant is unwilling to participate in this randomised controlled trial she will continue to be monitored and cared for as per local protocol/clinicians’ experience and continue in the observation arm of the CRAFT study. Women who provide written informed consent will be randomised to either cervical cerclage or observation. Both arms will receive follow-up as per local guidelines.</p>

They will be given additional information and asked to sign another consent form. CRAFT-IMG involves serial transvaginal ultrasound measurements of cervical length (which they may already be offered as part of standard care, utilising the protocol methodology described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and up to 3 MRI scans of the lower uterus and cervical structure (which are not part of standard care).</p>
                <p id="Par106">Serial MRI scans will be performed on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner at St Thomas’ Hospital. Conventional imaging will include high resolution T1 and T2 weighted images, MR relaxometry and MRI diffusion. The first advanced protocol transvaginal ultrasound and MRI will occur at any time from 14 weeks’ gestation (which is the lower gestation limit for CRAFT-IMG recruitment). Where delivery has not occurred, further imaging will be offered (up to a maximum of 3 MRI and 3 transvaginal ultrasound scans).</p>
                <p id="Par107">Outcome data: Participant data will be collected up to discharge following delivery. Neonatal outcomes will be collected up to discharge or 28 days (whichever is sooner). Prompts on the database will alert the research midwife/assistant when each trial participant reaches her delivery date. Birth registers and in-patient records will be used to track hospital admissions and pregnancy outcomes. Outcome data (medical and healthcare utilisation) will be collected by review of NHS maternity and medical records. If information is unavailable, e.g. if the delivery occurred elsewhere, the patient, patient’s GP or other hospital will be contacted.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par135">Despite emerging evidence on the association between FDCS and the risk of sPTB/LM, many uncertainties remain, including the degree of risk following an in-labour CS, before full dilatation. Our decision support tool, the QUiPP app [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], utilises predictive models based on transvaginal ultrasound and quantitative fetal fibronectin, but these are not validated for use in this specific cohort of women. It is unknown whether the commonly used clinical threshold of cervical length ≤ 25 mm is a reliable predictor of sPTB in women with a history of in-labour CS. These women may benefit from prophylactic treatment, such as placement of cervical cerclage before, rather than after, the cervix has started to shorten. Certain defects are visible on MRI and ultrasound but whether this is of use clinically remains unclear, and could be of benefit in understanding the mechanism of LM and sPTB following CS. The CRAFT project will investigate the role of previous in-labour caesarean section as a risk factor for future sPTB, and will inform the development of management strategies to optimise the care we can offer to this recently identified group of high risk women.</p>
