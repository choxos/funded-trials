                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed as monotherapy for patients with focal epilepsy, but there is uncertainty as to whether they should be recommended as first-line treatments because of insufficient evidence of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine in people with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This randomised, open-label, controlled trial compared levetiracetam and zonisamide with lamotrigine as first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Adult and paediatric neurology services across the UK recruited participants aged 5 years or older (with no upper age limit) with two or more unprovoked focal seizures. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) using a minimisation programme with a random element utilising factor to receive lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. Participants and investigators were not masked and were aware of treatment allocation. SANAD II was designed to assess non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide to lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. Anti-seizure medications were taken orally and for participants aged 12 years or older the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine 50 mg (morning) and 100 mg (evening), levetiracetam 500 mg twice per day, and zonisamide 100 mg twice per day. For children aged between 5 and 12 years the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine 1Â·5 mg/kg twice per day, levetiracetam 20 mg/kg twice per day, and zonisamide 2Â·5 mg/kg twice per day. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The per-protocol (PP) analysis excluded participants with major protocol deviations and those who were subsequently diagnosed as not having epilepsy. Safety analysis included all participants who received one dose of any study drug. The non-inferiority limit was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1Â·329, which equates to an absolute difference of 10%. A HR greater than 1 indicated that an event was more likely on lamotrigine. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 30294119 (EudraCt number: 2012-001884-64).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>990 participants were recruited between May 2, 2013, and June 20, 2017, and followed up for a further 2 years. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine (n=330), levetiracetam (n=332), or zonisamide (n=328). The ITT analysis included all participants and the PP analysis included 324 participants randomly assigned to lamotrigine, 320 participants randomly assigned to levetiracetam, and 315 participants randomly assigned to zonisamide. Levetiracetam did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis of time to 12-month remission versus lamotrigine (HR 1Â·18; 97Â·5% CI 0Â·95â€“1Â·47) but zonisamide did meet the criteria for non-inferiority in the ITT analysis versus lamotrigine (1Â·03; 0Â·83â€“1Â·28). The PP analysis showed that 12-month remission was superior with lamotrigine than both levetiracetam (HR 1Â·32 [97Â·5% CI 1Â·05 to 1Â·66]) and zonisamide (HR 1Â·37 [1Â·08â€“1Â·73]). There were 37 deaths during the trial. Adverse reactions were reported by 108 (33%) participants who started lamotrigine, 144 (44%) participants who started levetiracetam, and 146 (45%) participants who started zonisamide. Lamotrigine was superior in the cost-utility analysis, with a higher net health benefit of 1Â·403 QALYs (97Â·5% central range 1Â·319â€“1Â·458) compared with 1Â·222 (1Â·110â€“1Â·283) for levetiracetam and 1Â·232 (1Â·112, 1Â·307) for zonisamide at a cost-effectiveness threshold of Â£20â€ˆ000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness was based on differences between treatment groups in costs and QALYs.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>These findings do not support the use of levetiracetam or zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine should remain a first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and should be the standard treatment in future trials.</p>

                  <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para30">At the time of the design of this trial (SANAD II) lamotrigine had been identified as a first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy based in part on results of the first SANAD trial (published in 2007), which found lamotrigine to be non-inferior to carbamazepine for seizure remission but significantly less likely to fail as it is better tolerated. Lamotrigine was also found to be more clinically effective than gabapentin or topiramate and was also identified as a cost-effective alternative. Lamotrigine was therefore selected as the standard treatment in SANAD II.</p>
                <p id="para40">Levetiracetam and zonisamide had been licensed for use as monotherapy in patients with focal epilepsy on the basis of non-inferiority regulatory trials in which they had been compared with carbamazepine. The primary outcome in those trials was 6-month seizure freedom, which is too short a timeframe to assess clinical effectiveness in a long-term condition such as epilepsy. Consequently, the longer term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide were unknown. This knowledge gap is reflected in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence epilepsy guidelines, which do not recommend either drug as a first-line treatment. Nonetheless, levetiracetam in particular has been increasingly prescribed in clinical practice on the basis of assumptions about its ease of use, tolerability, and efficacy.</p>
                <p id="para50">A Cochrane review and individual participant data network meta-analysis that included data from SANAD I found that, compared with carbamazepine, levetiracetam was inferior for time to 12-month remission and no significant difference was found compared with zonisamide. For time to treatment failure, levetiracetam was found to be superior to carbamazepine, but no difference was found between carbamazepine and zonisamide.</p>
                <p id="para60">
                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the longer term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of levetiracetam and zonisamide as first-line treatments for patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. The study is pragmatic in design and recruited a cohort of participants older than 5 years from routine UK National Health Service clinics, and the results are relevant to every day clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="para80">Levetiracetam did not meet our definition of non-inferiority for time to 12-month remission compared with lamotrigine, and it was inferior for time to treatment failure. Zonisamide did meet our definition of non-inferiority for time to 12-month remission but it too was inferior for time to treatment failure. Neither levetiracetam or zonisamide were found to be cost-effective alternatives.</p>
                <p id="para90">
                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para100">For people with focal epilepsy, there is evidence that both levetiracetam and zonisamide have efficacy when used as monotherapy. However, the evidence does not support their use as first-line treatments. Our results support the continued use of lamorigine as first-line treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and its use as a standard comparator in future comparative trials.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para110">Epilepsy is a common condition with a prevalence of 0Â·5â€“1% and lifetime incidence of up to 5%.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Epilepsy is a complex disorder with many seizure types and causes. It is uniquely stigmatising and negatively affects quality of life (QOL), education, and employment prospects.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Anti-seizure medications are the mainstay of treatment and approximately 70% of people with epilepsy will achieve a remission from seizures, half of whom may be able to stop treatment without a seizure recurrence.</p>
              <p id="para120">Around two-thirds of people with epilepsy have focal epilepsy; seizures that start in a neuronal network limited to one cerebral hemisphere. Seizure types include focal aware seizures (previously called simple partial seizures), focal seizures with impaired awareness (previously called complex partial seizures), and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (previously called secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizures).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Focal epilepsy can start at any age, and the incidence distribution is U shaped, with higher incidence in young and elderly people. Because of ageing populations, in many countries the incidence of focal epilepsy is higher in older people than in younger people.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para130">Although focal epilepsies can be classified according to site of seizure onset and cause, there is no evidence to suggest that one syndrome or cause responds better to one specific treatment than to another.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The drug management is therefore generally similar whatever the cause or syndrome. Guidelines typically recommend lamotrigine or carbamazepine as first-line treatment,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> in part informed by the first standard and new antiepileptic drug trial (SANAD I),<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which identified lamotrigine as non-inferior to carbamazepine for time to 12-month remission and superior to carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate for time to treatment failure.</p>
              <p id="para140">Since the publication of SANAD I, several newer treatments have become available, including levetiracetam and zonisamide. Levetiracetam is a commonly prescribed anti-seizure medication with evidence of efficacy as monotherapy in patients with focal epilepsy based on finding non-inferiority compared with carbamazepine for 6-month seizure remission and similar tolerability in a regulatory trial<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> that did not assess longer term effectiveness. A second open-label trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> compared levetiracetam with physicians' choice of carbamazepine or valproate, and it showed no significant difference between carbamazepine and levetiracetam for time to first seizure and time to treatment failure. However, that trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> had a maximum follow-up of 12 months and therefore could not assess longer term outcomes needed to inform policy.

Participants were eligible for recruitment if they were aged 5 years or older (there was no upper age limit), had a history of at least two unprovoked epileptic seizures requiring anti-seizure medication, their clinical diagnosis was one of focal epilepsy with or without an electroencephalogram, and they had never been treated with an anti-seizure medication except for emergency treatment in the previous 2 weeks.

                <p id="para180">After providing consent, participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive either lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or zonisamide. We used a secure, centrally controlled, 24-h web-based facility to implement a minimisation program with random element utilising factors, which were not made known to reduce the risk of predicting allocation. These factors were centre, sex (ie, male or female), and number of previous seizures (ie, 2, 3â€“5, 6+). Recruiting clinicians were required to initiate trial treatment within 7 days of randomisation. Participants and investigators were not masked and were all aware of treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para190">SANAD II was an open-label trial. Trial treatments were prescribed as per routine NHS practice and dispensed by hospital and community pharmacies, and clinicians prescribed the formulation they considered most appropriate. The trial protocol provided guidance on initial drug titration and maintenance doses based on routine practice, although clinicians were able to tailor these as appropriate. All anti-seizure medications were taken orally. For participants aged 12 years or more, the initial advised maintenance doses were lamotrigine (50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening), levetiracetam (500 mg twice per day), and zonisamide (100 mg twice per day). For children aged 5â€“12 years, the initial daily maintenance doses advised were lamotrigine (1Â·5 mg/kg twice per day), levetiracetam (20 mg/kg twice per day), and zonisamide (2Â·5 mg/kg twice per day). Subsequent dose and treatment changes at follow-up visits were done following routine clinical practice according to treatment response and adverse effects.</p>
                <p id="para200">We aimed to complete recruitment over a 4Â·5 year period but a 12-month extension was required to meet the sample size target, after which the trial cohort was followed up for a further 2 years, allowing a minimum follow up of 2 years and maximum of 7Â·5 years. Patients were followed up according to clinical need, and minimum trial visits were expected at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. At visits, data were collected for seizure type and frequency, anti-seizure medication, and adverse reactions. Participants continued in follow-up whether they were still taking their allocated treatment or not. For participants lost to hospital follow-up, outcome data were sought from their general practitioner.</p>
                <p id="para210">For adults, QOL outcomes were assessed using subscales of the quality of life in newly diagnosed epilepsy battery (NEWQOL) and the Impact of Epilepsy Scale.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> For children and adolescents aged &lt;16 years, QOL assessment involved both patient and parent-based measures: children aged 8â€“15 years completed a generic health status measure validated for use in epilepsy, the KINDL;<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and the epilepsy impact and attitude to epilepsy subscales of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE-AD).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Parents of all children completed proxy QOL questionnaires.

The secondary seizure outcomes were time to 24-month remission and time to first seizure. There were three secondary outcomes for treatment failure: (1) time to treatment failure overall, defined as days from randomisation to a decision to withdraw the randomised drug, or to add a new anti-seizure medication because of inadequate seizure control or unacceptable adverse reactions; (2) time to treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control; and (3) time to treatment failure due to unacceptable adverse reactions. The other secondary outcomes were adverse reactions, QOL, and health economic outcomes based on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para240">SANAD-II was designed to detect non-inferiority of both levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with lamotrigine for the primary outcome of time to 12-month remission. The International League Against Epilepsy Commission on Antiepileptic Drugs defined limits of equivalence of Â±10% for the primary outcome in antiepileptic drug monotherapy studies.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Calculations were informed by the SANAD I study,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> which estimated the 12-month remission-free probability (at 24 months) of 0Â·43 (and an exponential hazard rate of 0Â·0352) for lamotrigine. Two primary comparisons were of interest (levetiracetam <italic>vs</italic> lamotrigine, and zonisamide <italic>vs</italic> lamotrigine), therefore the one-sided significance level was divided by two (one-side alpha of 0Â·0125). Assuming a 10% absolute difference in survival probability, the non-inferiority margin on the hazard ratio (HR) scale was ln(0Â·43)/ln(0Â·53)=1Â·329. Therefore, assuming a HR of 1 and 80% power with a one-sided alpha of 0Â·025, 330 patients were required in each of three treatment groups, allowing for 5% losses to follow-up, as occurred in SANAD I (990 total patients).</p>
                <p id="para250">Primary analyses were done on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We used a 0Â·025 level of significance and 97Â·5% CIs for analysis of the primary outcome because of the two prespecified comparisons. All secondary outcomes were analysed using a 0Â·05 level of significance and 95% CIs. The statistical and health economic analysis plans were developed before doing the final analyses and are available in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1</xref> and <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2</xref>.

                <p id="para260">Time to event outcomes were summarised by Kaplan-Meier curves for each treatment group and Cox proportional hazards regression models explored using two different models: (1) the primary analysis, including the treatment effect only; (2) including the treatment together with gender (ie, male or female), number of seizures before randomisation (ie, 2, 3â€“5, 6+); and random effects for centre. The assumption of proportional hazards was investigated by examining Schoenfeld residual plots and incorporating time-dependent covariates in all models. If the assumption of proportional hazards was not valid, an additional Cox model with time-dependent covariates was used. For the primary outcome (ie, 12-month remission) non-inferiority hypothesis, we present 97Â·5% CIs, in which the upper limit of the 97Â·5% CI needed to be less than 1Â·329 to conclude non-inferiority.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para490">Our results indicate that lamotrigine should remain a first-line standard treatment for patients with focal epilepsy and that neither levetiracetam or zonisamide should be used routinely as first-line anti-seizure medications. This pragmatic multicentre randomised open-label trial was powered to assess non-inferiority of levetiracetam and zonisamide compared with the standard treatment lamotrigine in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy. Zonisamide met our definition of non-inferiority for the primary outcome time to 12-month remission (ITT analysis) compared with lamotrigine but levetiracetam did not, as the possibility of a clinically important differences could not be excluded. No significant difference was found between lamotrigine and zonisamide for time to 24-month remission and time to first seizure. However, levetiracetam and zonisamide were significantly more likely to fail than lamotrigine and a competing risk analysis indicated that this treatment failure was due mainly to adverse reactions associated with levetiracetam and zonisamide. The PP analysis of time to 12-month remission, which accounted for treatment failure, found lamotrigine to be superior to both levetiracetam and zonisamide.</p>
              <p id="para500">Initiating treatment with lamotrigine was associated with fewer adverse reactions than levetiracetam or zonisamide and there were more psychiatric adverse reactions associated with levetiracetam and zonisamide. Although there were 37 deaths, there was no indication of a higher death rate with a particular drug, which is reassuring given the concerns reported by the US Food and Drug Association, including cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Also, there were more pregnancies and miscarriages for patients who initiated zonisamide, but the numbers are too small to draw any conclusions.</p>
              <p id="para510">QOL analyses found that, compared with lamotrigine, levetiracetam and zonisamide were associated with worse overall patient reported QOL and depression. In addition, levetiracetam was worse for patient reported anxiety, depression, and stigma.</p>
              <p id="para520">The cost utility analysis found that neither levetiracetam or zonisamide were cost-effective compared with lamotrigine at thresholds of cost-effectiveness operating in the NHS in the UK. This finding was consistent in sensitivity analyses, and for the subgroup analysis of adults. However, levetiracetam appeared most cost-effective in children who were younger than 16 years, although these results are limited by the small sample size and were principally due to a single participant who had an atypical medical journey.</p>
              <p id="para530">This study has several limitations. Data for the occurrence of seizures were collected using seizure diaries and reports at clinic visits. It is therefore possible that seizures were missed or not reported, which might have influenced decisions about dose and treatment changes, treatment failure, and reporting of adverse reactions. Only 177 (17Â·9%) of patients recruited were younger than 18 years, limiting the applicability of our results to children. The most likely explanation for the small number of patients from this age group was because of lack of experience with zonisamide among paediatricians as it is not currently licensed as monotherapy in children. It is possible that the maintenance doses chosen introduced a systematic bias, but the similar time to first seizure rates for lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide provide assurance against this possibility, as well as concerns that the slower titration rate required for lamotrigine could expose individuals to a risk of early seizure recurrence. It is also important to acknowledge that there are no data from randomised trials to inform the choice of initial maintenance dose of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, or most other anti-seizure medications, and that in SANAD II, clinicians chose and adjusted doses according to their usual practice. There was also a low return rate for QOL questionnaires and although the rates of return were not unusually low for postal questionnaires, this factor will have diminished our ability to identify differences in QOL between groups. A further limitation of our study was that other newer anti-epileptic drugs were not assessed, in particular lacosamide, which is now licensed as monotherapy for both adults and children, and perampanel, which is only licenced as an adjunctive therapy.</p>
              <p id="para540">The economic analysis in our study was also limited by the poor return of participants' questionnaires, the inclusion of free-text questions within the resource-use questionnaire, and the assumption that unanswered questions implied no use of resources. However, these limitations were largely mitigated by more complete data for hospital episode statistics given that hospital costs were the main cost driver and were associated with the more complex recall requirement. The effect of missing QALY data was lessened because of the area under the curve methodology, in which QALYs could be calculated provided two or more EQ-5D questionnaires had been returned. Our use of the EQ-5D-3L-Y and proxy version of the EQ-5D-3L was limited by the unavailability of appropriate value sets and by having to apply the adult tariff for estimating utilities. These factors represent a weakness in many economic evaluations of interventions in paediatric populations,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> although a valuation of children's EQ-5D-3L-Y health states is in development.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para550">These results should be interpreted in context with previous studies, although most anti-seizure monotherapy randomised controlled trials have been done to meet regulatory requirements<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and fail to provide evidence about longer term clinical effectiveness. SANAD I identified lamotrigine as a first-line treatment as it was non-inferior to carbamazepine for time to 12-month remission and superior to carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate for time to treatment failure.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> An individual patient data network meta-analysis,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> which included data from SANAD I and combined direct and indirect comparisons, used carbamazepine as the standard treatment comparator for patients with focal epilepsy. Results indicated that levetiracetam was inferior to carbamazepine for time to 12-month remission and no significant difference was found for carbamazepine compared with gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, valproate, or zonisamide. For time to treatment failure, lamotrigine and levetiracetam were superior to carbamazepine, phenobarbital was inferior to carbamazepine, and no difference was found between carbamazepine and the other assessed treatments. SANAD II therefore provides much needed longer-term head-to-head data to better inform treatment policy and guidance.</p>
              <p id="para560">Results from SANAD II have important implications for clinical practice and research. Although levetiracetam and zonisamide are licensed for used as monotherapy in patients with focal epilepsy in Europe and worldwide, our results do not support their use as first-line monotherapy. This finding is most relevant to levetiracetam, which has become a commonly prescribed first-line anti-seizure medication because of its ease of titration and assumed efficacy and tolerability. Further studies are now required to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of other anti-seizure medications (eg, lacosamide, brivaracetam, and perampanel) and the design of future studies should be debated given that the SANAD I and SANAD II trials provide historical control data.</p>
