                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">To reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, public health campaigns often provide fear-based information about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Meta-analyses have found that fear-based campaigns in other contexts are likely to be ineffective unless respondents feel confident they can carry out the recommended behaviour (‘self-efficacy’). This study aimed to test the likely impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-efficacy elements, on patient consultations/antibiotic requests for influenza-like illnesses, using a randomised design.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We hypothesised that fear-based messages containing empowering information about self-management without antibiotics would be more effective than fear alone, particularly in a pre-specified subgroup with low AMR awareness. Four thousand respondents from an online panel, representative of UK adults, were randomised to receive three different messages about antibiotic use and AMR, designed to induce fear about AMR to varying degrees. Two messages (one ‘strong-fear’, one ‘mild-fear’) also contained empowering information regarding influenza-like symptoms being easily self-managed without antibiotics.

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasingly serious threat to global public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], estimated to account for 10 million deaths annually worldwide by 2050, and potentially imposing similar economic costs as climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A recent European study found that the burden of antibiotic-resistant infections (excluding tuberculosis) in terms of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) is similar to influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Strong links have been found between the volume of human antibiotic consumption and AMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, better stewardship of existing antibiotics, reducing inappropriate use without compromising essential access, is crucial to control AMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for around 50% of antibiotic prescribing in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], much of which fails to benefit patients as the infections are self-limiting or viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Antibiotic use for RTIs not only affects resistance among possible causative bacterial pathogens, but also drives resistance among commensal flora, which can later cause resistant infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p>
              <p id="Par15">Differences in clinical consultation rates explain much of the variation in non-hospital antibiotic usage in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and clinicians are more likely to prescribe antibiotics when patients request them or are perceived to want them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, in healthcare systems such as that of the United Kingdom (UK), where general practitioners act as gatekeepers to prescriptions, decisions whether to consult, and whether to request antibiotics, for RTIs could each play a significant role in ‘unnecessary’ antibiotic consumption. A review of public campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] aimed at improving antibiotic use among outpatients in high-income countries concluded that several campaigns had a positive effect. However, nearly all were multi-faceted, simultaneously targeting physicians and the public with multiple interventions. Therefore, it was difficult to unpick whether improvements were due to changes in the behaviour of patients, physicians, or both or whether the observed improvements were related to confounding factors which would have happened without the campaigns. All campaigns in the review tried to convey the message that AMR is a serious problem, sometimes using a fear message. Most also tried to educate the public that antibiotics are often ineffective for RTIs.</p>
              <p id="Par16">However, in other healthcare areas, meta-analyses have found that while such ‘fear-appeal’ messages can be effective, they are likely to be ineffective and may even backfire if people are not confident that they will be able to successfully take the recommended action (‘self-efficacy’) or that the recommended action will be effective (‘response-efficacy’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a previous survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we found that an AMR ‘fear message’, which contained no information about how to successfully manage influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms (generally not requiring antibiotics), was likely to backfire among those with low AMR awareness: paradoxically, significantly more of these respondents said they would be more likely, rather than less likely, to ask a doctor for antibiotics for ILI given the information. We hypothesised that fear-based messages also containing empowering information about successful self-management without antibiotics would be more effective, particularly among those with low AMR awareness, who we hypothesised would respond less favourably than others to fear-based messages in general. We therefore developed an experiment to test several AMR ‘fear messages’, with and without empowering content intended to provide confidence that ILI symptoms can be successfully self-managed without antibiotics. The aim was to identify the form of words most likely to discourage people from asking for antibiotics for ILI, particularly among those with low AMR awareness (pre-specified based on our previous survey) and those who believe antibiotics are effective for ILI (exploratory analysis).</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par17">The randomised experiment was conducted using an online survey of adult members of the UK general public, in two waves. Wave 2 was conducted as a validation study, using identical methods but analysed separately on an independent sample, after analysing data from wave 1.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Survey design</title>
                <p id="Par18">The survey (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) asked respondents to imagine Health State A: ‘a temperature, aching muscles, a headache, a dry chesty cough, a sore throat, and you feel weak’, representing, and hereafter referred to as, ILI. A symptomatic description was used, rather than specifying ‘flu’ or a ‘virus’, firstly, because individuals are likely to interpret specific terms differently, and secondly, because people may know that antibiotics are not indicated for viral conditions, yet not recognise ILI symptoms as being more consistent with a viral, than bacterial, infection.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Respondents were randomised to receive one of three different messages about antibiotics and AMR (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In each wave, <italic>N</italic> = 1000 received version 1, a ‘fear message’ about the dangers of AMR, and AMR being caused by inappropriate antibiotic use. Two other groups (both <italic>N</italic> = 1500 in each wave) also received a ‘fear message’ but together with empowering information that ILI symptoms can easily and effectively be self-managed without antibiotics, differing only by the strength of the ‘fear message’ (stronger fear level in version 3 than the relatively mild version 2). Version 1 was a slight variant of the ‘fear message’ previously found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to backfire among respondents who found this AMR information surprising. Version 2 and version 3 were developed based on health-psychological theory, incorporating empowering ‘self-efficacy’ and ‘response-efficacy’ aspects to mitigate or remove backfiring potential.

                <p id="Par20">Respondents were then asked ‘To what extent is this information new to you?’ [very new/somewhat new/not very new/not at all new], ‘How will this information affect whether you visit a doctor the next time you have symptoms like Health State A?’ [much more likely to visit/more likely to visit/no effect/less likely to visit/much less likely to visit/do not know], and ‘How will this information affect the likelihood of you asking a doctor for antibiotics if you were to visit for these symptoms?’ [much more likely/more likely/no effect/less likely/much less likely/do not know] (co-primary outcomes: <italic>likelihood of visiting a doctor and of requesting antibiotics</italic>). Respondents with children were additionally asked analogous questions regarding how they would act if their youngest child had ILI symptoms (secondary outcomes in the subgroup with children).</p>
                <p id="Par21">Based on our previous survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the impact of each randomised message on all outcomes was considered separately by whether or not respondents said the AMR information was ‘very/somewhat new’, formally compared using interaction tests. A limitation of comparing respondents for whom information is ‘new’ across the three versions is that this may not compare like with like—for example, some respondents might find version 3 ‘new’ but not version 2. In exploratory analysis, the impacts of the randomised messages were therefore also considered separately by whether or not respondents thought antibiotics would ‘definitely/probably help’ an ILI which persisted for 5 days.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The survey captured information on socio-demographic characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity, education, employment status, geographic region, and having dependent children. Both the original AMR message (‘fear-only’) and the survey were designed with clinical experts (<italic>n</italic> = 3; primary care physician and two junior doctors) and a public and patient involvement panel (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Amendments to the AMR message were designed primarily by health psychologist authors on this paper (STC, NH, SM, AS).</p>

                <title>Survey respondents</title>
                <p id="Par23">Both survey waves were conducted online using respondent panels provided by Survey Sampling International (SSI). In each wave, SSI was commissioned to obtain 4000 completed responses, representative of the UK adult population in terms of sex, age, ethnicity, and geographic region. Surveys were completed over 17 days during October/November 2016 (wave 1) and 22 days during March 2017 (wave 2). In wave 1, invitations were emailed to 28,887 SSI panel members; 8317 panel members were emailed in wave 2. It was also possible for SSI panel members to access the survey via SSI’s website. The two waves were completely independent, with no respondent overlap. Respondents were offered an incentive to complete the questionnaire in the form of ‘Nectar-points’ (a loyalty card scheme via which customers accrue discounts at outlets including supermarkets and restaurants), worth a total of approximately £0.60. To mitigate self-selection bias, specific project details were not included in the invitation. In each wave, sample sizes for groups receiving version 2 and version 3 were powered to quantify the proportion of individuals who, in response to the information, said they would be ‘less/much less likely’ to visit a doctor the next time they have ILI symptoms, at a 95% confidence level, with a maximum margin of error of 2.5%.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par24">Wilcoxon’s single-sample sign-rank tests were performed to test whether respondents were more or less likely to consult/request antibiotics for ILI in response to the information, overall and within subgroups defined by whether respondents said the information they were given about AMR was ‘very/somewhat new’ (and, in exploratory analysis, by whether antibiotics would ‘definitely/probably help’ an ILI). For each randomised message, Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests were used to analyse whether the distribution of responses differed significantly between subgroups. Ordered logit regressions were used to test for interactions between message treatment effects and subgroups, with the extent of being more/less likely to consult/request antibiotics the dependent variables. All statistical analysis was conducted using Stata MP v13.1.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">In this study, we hypothesised that fear-based informational messages about AMR, intended to reduce consultations and antibiotic requests for ILI, are more likely to be effective, particularly among those with low AMR awareness, if they contain empowering information about successful self-management without antibiotics. We examined this hypothesis by developing three fear-based messages about AMR, with and without an empowerment element, and testing them in a randomised survey experiment. The aim was to inform future public campaigns intended to reduce antibiotic requests for ILI, although our findings have broader application. We found that for all the informational messages tested, there were stark differences in how respondents said the information would affect their future consultations and antibiotic requests. The magnitude of these differences depended on whether the information they were given was new to them or whether they thought antibiotics would help ILI. Those for whom the information was not new (or who did not think antibiotics would help) stated that the information was likely to make them less likely to consult or request antibiotics, regardless of which message they were given. This suggests that repeated campaigns may be important for re-educating those who think they are already well informed about appropriate antibiotic use. Crucially, however, where the information was new, <italic>only</italic> those given the ‘strong-fear-plus-empowerment’ message said they would be no more likely to consult <italic>and</italic> less likely to request antibiotics. Those given the ‘mild-fear-plus-empowerment’ message were not significantly less likely to consult or request antibiotics for ILI. This is consistent with the most recent meta-analysis on fear-appeal messages which found that in general, they are more effective when relatively high fear levels are employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There was no evidence that those given the ‘fear-only’ message were less likely to request antibiotics for ILI, and consistent with our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], they were more likely to consult.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The key study limitation is that it relies on how survey respondents claimed they would behave in response to information. Reported intentions may differ from actual behaviour. However, there is evidence from meta-analyses that intentions predict infrequent, non-habitual behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and that changing behavioural intentions engenders behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Another limitation is that only members of the online survey panel were eligible. Thus, the sample was limited to those with an interest in completing surveys, internet access, and basic computer literacy. However, the use of this panel also meant that age, gender, ethnicity, geographic region, and employment status were broadly representative of the general UK population, though the percentage with higher education (44%) was higher than the population average (27%).</p>
              <p id="Par37">Previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we found that fear messages about AMR could potentially backfire among respondents poorly informed about AMR. There, those who found a ‘fear-only’ message (almost identical to version 1) ‘very/somewhat surprising’ said they were more likely to consult and to request antibiotics for ILI. Based on evidence from behavioural science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we hypothesised that the unintended response to this information may be because the original message lacked empowering information about effective self-management of ILI without antibiotics. A major study strength is that this insight from behavioural science was used, apparently successfully, to develop informational messages likely not only to avoid backfiring, but to effectively reduce antibiotic requests for ILI. With just minor changes to wording, this study also attempted, and broadly succeeded, in replicating the results reported in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], by testing a ‘fear-only’ message (included in Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> as ‘Prior Survey’ to facilitate comparability).</p>
              <p id="Par38">To address the limitation that the respondents for whom information was ‘very/somewhat new’ varied across the three versions tested, in our exploratory analysis, we also disaggregated respondents according to beliefs about antibiotic effectiveness for ILI, rather than how new the information provided was. Using this common indicator, which did not vary across randomisations, provided similar results.</p>
              <p id="Par39">While here we developed and tested fear messages intended to improve thinking and behaviour about antibiotic use, the phenomenon we studied is widely prevalent. Meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] have identified the importance, generally, in fear campaigns of including empowering messages that the ‘call-to-action’ is relatively easy, and will be effective in mitigating the danger referred to. This is the first study to explicitly apply and test this finding in the context of fear messages about AMR. Our results strongly suggest that this general point is highly relevant to the development of public campaigns warning of the dangers of AMR, and support its importance more generally in campaigns.</p>
              <p id="Par40">We found that a ‘strong-fear-plus-empowerment’ message was likely to be effective at reducing both consultations and requests for antibiotics among adults. However, even this relatively successful version was likely to lead to increased consultation for children with ILI. The overall effect on requests for children was not consistent, with those who believed antibiotics would help their child’s ILI being more likely to take their child to a doctor, but less likely to request antibiotics if they went. It is possible that our self-care advice (plenty of fluids and sleep, or to take paracetamol) may be perceived as difficult to implement, or too generic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], by parents of young children, and they may feel they require advice from a primary care physician about management.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Children account for a large proportion of antibiotics taken for ILI, and the factors which affect consulting and prescribing are not the same as for adults. More research is needed on developing informational messages for parents that could safely and effectively reduce unnecessary prescribing for ILI in children by reducing consultations and antibiotic requests. More broadly, future research could test fear messages which vary with regard to the nature of the empowerment content employed, incorporating respondent self-efficacy and response-efficacy elements via different forms of wording. Future research should also address whether the hypothetical future behaviour our respondents reported in response to our informational messages can be replicated in studies testing actual behaviour. In particular, it would be valuable to design a randomised trial to test the effect of the provision of informational messages, such as those developed here, on more objective measures of antibiotic use. It may also be valuable to investigate the long-term effects of such messages, as these could differ from the short-term effects. It is conceivable, for example, that repeated exposure to even the least effective message in this study could ultimately have positive long-term effects by improving AMR awareness over time and thereby making respondents more likely to respond favourably to future messages. More generally, our results emphasise the importance of testing any proposed public antibiotic-stewardship campaigns before they are rolled out to wide audiences.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par42">This study developed and tested, using a randomised design, fear-based messages about antibiotics and AMR, both with and without empowering information that influenza-like symptoms are self-limiting and can easily be self-managed, e.g. with paracetamol, rest, and fluids. Consistent with meta-analyses on the effectiveness of fear-based messages in other healthcare areas, the evidence from this study suggests that fear-based messages about antibiotics and AMR are more likely to be effective in reducing consultations and antibiotic requests, especially among those with low AMR awareness, if they include ‘empowering’ information about effective self-management without antibiotics.</p>

              <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
              <p id="Par43">This study is based on data from three surveys. The first survey data existed prior to this study, having been developed separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], on attitudes to antibiotics and awareness of AMR. Respondents had volunteered to receive information about such surveys from SSI. Completion of the survey was considered as indicating consent, and respondents were able to refuse to participate in the survey at any stage in the process. The third survey (second wave of this study), which is identical to the second survey (first wave of this study), was approved by the University of Oxford’s Central University Research Ethics Committee—reference number R49463/RE001. Following approval of the third survey, the original and second survey were retrospectively considered by the same committee (reference number R57213/RE001) who deemed that ‘it is probable that, had the documentation and a full application been submitted for ethical opinion at the correct time, the committee would have granted ethical approval (perhaps subject to some amendments of the documentation).’ Respondents gave written informed consent before taking part.</p>
