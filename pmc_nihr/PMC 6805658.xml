                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), also known as medically unexplained symptoms (MUS), affect approximately 50% of patients in secondary care and are often associated with disability, psychological distress and increased health care costs. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has demonstrated both short- and long-term efficacy with small to medium effect sizes for PPS, with larger treatment effects for specific PPS syndromes, including non-cardiac chest pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Research indicates that PPS conditions share similar cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms, such as avoidance and unhelpful beliefs. This suggests that a transdiagnostic approach may be beneficial for patients with PPS.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic CBT-based intervention for PPS. 322 participants with PPS will be recruited from secondary care clinics. Participants stratified by clinic and disability level will be randomised to CBT plus standard medical care (SMC) versus SMC alone. The intervention consists of 8 CBT sessions delivered by a qualified therapist over a period of 20 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at 9, 20, 40- and 52-weeks post randomisation. Efficacy will be assessed by examining the difference between arms in the primary outcome Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at 52 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes will include mood, symptom severity and clinical global impression at 9, 20, 40 and 52 weeks. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by combining measures of health service use, informal care, loss of working hours and financial benefits at 52 weeks.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This trial will provide a powered evaluation of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic CBT approach versus SMC for patients with PPS. It will also provide valuable information about potential healthcare pathways for patients with PPS within the National Health Service (NHS).</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par40">Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) refer to persistent bodily symptoms cannot be adequately explained by organic pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the umbrella term MUS is commonly used in health care, previous literature suggests that patients prefer the term <italic>persistent physical symptoms (PPS)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For this reason, the patient-centred label PPS will be used throughout this paper to refer to MUS.</p>
              <p id="Par41">In secondary care, it is estimated that up to 50% of new referrals experience PPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These symptoms are often associated with profound functional impairment and psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Approximately 50% of patients with PPS present with co-morbid conditions, including anxiety, depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Left untreated, the prognosis of PPS patients is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. PPS are frequently seen in most medical specialties: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in gastroenterology, non-cardiac chest pain in cardiology, fibromyalgia (FM) in rheumatology, respiratory cough and breathlessness in respiratory medicine, and functional neurological symptoms in neurology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Large amounts of healthcare and financial benefits go towards the diagnosis and treatment of PPS, with NHS costs amounting to approximately £3 billion per annum in the working population. Output losses due to sickness absence amounts to several billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Overall quality of life in people with PPS is poor with many not being able to do the things healthy people take for granted.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The management and treatment of patients with PPS is one of the most difficult tasks facing medical specialists in secondary physical healthcare services. An increasing body of evidence shows that cognitive behavioural interventions can be effective in reducing PPS severity and healthcare-related expenditures. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to have both short- and long-term efficacy with small to medium effect sizes. Two meta-analyses examined the clinical effectiveness of short-term psychological therapies (including CBT, reattribution training, psychodynamic therapy, hypnosis etc.) for treating patients with PPS. The results indicated a beneficial effect of CBT for PPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Improvements have also been reported for several specific PPS syndromes, including non-cardiac chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, more effective treatments undoubtedly need to be developed as effect sizes are at best modest. People with different PPS conditions often share similar cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms, including fear avoidance beliefs and catastrophic misappraisal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This suggests the possibility of transdiagnostic aetiological factors underlying these disorders, as well as common perpetuating processes and pathways.</p>
              <p id="Par43">There is an accumulating evidence base supporting the efficacy of transdiagnostic approaches for affective disorders. A transdiagnostic approach assumes that similar psychological processes maintain symptoms and disability across conditions. A previous systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that transdiagnostic approaches may be as effective as diagnosis-specific treatments for alleviating anxiety and may even be superior for treating depression. However these conclusions were based on a small number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Norton &amp; Berra (2012) conducted a non-inferiority RCT comparing the efficacy of transdiagnostic CBT to disorder specific CBT for anxiety disorders. The results revealed treatment equivalence between transdiagnostic and disorder specific approaches, providing support for the efficacy of transdiagnostic treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given the large overlap between PPS syndromes, transdiagnostic interventions are needed, which can effectively target these factors to alleviate PPS, increase participation in life and reduce healthcare costs. Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is a proposed logic model for this trial, and it illustrates the potential benefits of using a transdiagnostic approach for patients with PPS.

              <p id="Par44">This paper presents a study protocol for the PRINCE (Persistent physical symptoms Reduction Intervention: a system Change and Evaluation in secondary care) Secondary trial, which aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a therapist delivered transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural approach for treating patients with PPS in secondary care. Common transdiagnostic processes will be targeted with a view to bringing about a change in functional impairment and therefore will be measured alongside primary and secondary outcomes. These transdiagnostic process have been previously found to mediate change in chronic fatigue and chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <title>Planned intervention: Transdiagnostic cognitive Behavioural therapy</title>
                <p id="Par74">The intervention will consist of a maximum of 8 one-hour CBT sessions delivered by one of three qualified trial therapists over a period of 22 weeks. Ideally, CBT sessions will be delivered face-to-face every fortnight. Telephone/skype appointments will be offered in exceptional cases (e.g. for patients with mobility issues). The treatment approach will be transdiagnostic and will be flexible to accommodate the needs of the individual and specific issues associated with specific problems. Thus, it will focus on previously identified symptoms that are overlapping across patient groups included in the trial, as well as common cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms. The treatment will be manualised to aid the standardisation of treatment delivery and facilitate a potential rollout within the NHS and other healthcare systems if found to be effective. CBT sessions will be structured according to four distinct stages: (1) engagement and rationale giving; (2) reducing avoidance by exposure techniques; (3) dealing with symptom-related cognitions and emotions; and (4) relapse prevention. Overall, the intervention aims to help patients to:

However, the transdiagnostic approach will also be flexible to accommodate specific issues associated with specific problems. For example, participants with IBS may benefit from discussing bowel related problems.

The research team will then be responsible for screening patients to check eligibility for the trial as there will be no structured clinical interview prior to inclusion. Eligible patients will then be provided with verbal and written information on the trial to read through. To formally enrol, patients will be required to complete and return a signed informed consent form. Once consent is obtained, they will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire pack within 1 month of screening. Participants will then be randomised to one of two arms: CBT plus SMC or SMC alone. Outcomes will then be determined at 9, 20, 40 and 52-weeks after randomisation. Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> provides a CONSORT diagram, outlining the journey of all participants through the trial.

Randomisation will be at the level of the individual, using block randomisation with random block sizes, stratified by clinic (e.g., cardiology, neurology etc.) and disability level (moderately severe impairment or significant impairment) as indicated by the Work and Social Adjustment Scale.</p>
                <p id="Par94">Treatment allocation will be communicated by email to the trial manager within a period of 24 h. The trial manager will inform the participant of their treatment group by telephone/email that same day. Following allocation to the treatment group the trial manager will inform the therapist, who will contact the participant to arrange the first session.</p>

We used data from this trial as it also used the work and social adjustment as an outcome. Based on the White et al. study, we calculated a treatment effect of − 3.6 points on WSAS comparing CBT at 12 months. The within-group SD at 12 months was estimated to be 9.4 points giving a standardised effect size of Cohen’s d = 3.2/9.4 = − 0.38. The sample size calculation (Stata command sampsi) suggests that 161 patients per arm (322 in total) are needed to detect this effect size or a larger one with 90.14% power allowing for a deflation for including baseline measures in the analysis model (factor 0.84 assuming a correlation between baseline and 9-month WSAS of 0.4) and an attrition rate of 25%.</p>

This trial used the same quality assurance methods. In summary, self-report measures and therapy data will be entered onto the InferMed MACRO online database, hosted by the King Clinical Trial Unit (KCTU). This system is used for clinical trials that are managed by the Clinical trials Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. It follows Good Clinical Practice and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 regulations.</p>
                <p id="Par97">Data entry and management will be undertaken by the research assistants and random checks will be undertaken by the trial manager. The Chief Investigator will be the custodian for the trial data. Patient data will be pseudo-anonymised (allocation of a unique personal identification number (PIN)) after randomisation. Data will be stored on a password-protected computer and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Data will be archived and stored in line with requirements of the sponsor.

Outcomes are all self-report measures and will be collected via post or email. Aside from the trial manger, the trial management team including the chief investigator, statisticians and the independent oversight committees will be blind to treatment allocation.

                <p id="Par100">Participants will be asked to complete self-report measures either in writing, electronically via email or over the telephone. If participants decline to complete the full follow-up assessment but have not revoked their consent to be followed up, they will be asked to fill in only the primary outcome questionnaires. Participants who do not return their questionnaires will be contacted by the research worker via telephone/text/email, to remind them to post back their questionnaires or to invite them to complete them over the telephone.</p>

                <p id="Par143">A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed by the statisticians and agreed with the trial team before database lock. The formal statistical analyses will estimate the difference in mean outcomes between patients randomised to CBT plus SMC and SMC by intention to treat at the various post-treatment observation time points. Estimates of effect sizes together with 95% confidence intervals will be reported. It is planned that the main statistical analysis will use a linear mixed model with maximum likelihood estimation. The data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.</p>
                <p id="Par144">The linear mixed model will contain post-treatment measures of the primary outcome (at the four follow up time points, i.e. 9, 20, 40 and 52 weeks) as the dependent variables. Fixed effects will consist of:

                <p id="Par152">Baseline measures of the outcome variable are included as they are known predictors of the outcome and thus should help us to gain precision for effect estimates of interest.</p>
                <p id="Par153">A random effect for participant will be entered into the model to account for correlations between the four repeated measures per participant. A more complex correlation structure (e.g. random intercept and slope model) may be considered if it proved to provide a better model fit.</p>
                <p id="Par154">Standardised effect sizes will be computed to measure the effect of treatment on primary and secondary outcomes at various assessment time points. This will be done by dividing the estimated trial arm difference by the baseline standard deviation of the measure.</p>
                <p id="Par155">We will investigate empirically whether non-adherence with CBT predicts loss to follow-up, and if this were the case, we will use multiple imputation instead of linear mixed modelling to generate inferences that are valid under a realistic missing at random assumption.</p>
                <p id="Par156">We will ensure that patterns of missing data and reasons for missingness are consistent with the CONSORT diagram. Baseline characteristics will be assessed to see if they predict missingness, if so, they will be included in the analysis model. We will check if any post randomisation variables such as compliance are predictive of missingness, and if so this will inform our missing data approach.</p>

                <p id="Par157">This analysis aims to compare the 1) service use and costs between CBT + SMC vs SMC, and 2) and assess the cost-effectiveness of CBT + SMC in relation to SMC. Two economic measures will be used to solicit data; i.e., the CSRI and the EQ-5D-5 L. The cost of services will be calculated by combining service use data with relevant unit costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Informal care and lost employment will both be valued using average wage rates. The use of services will be described by reporting the number of participants (%) accessing services in each group at different study points and the mean (SD) number of contacts for those using them (i.e. excluding those with zero use). Mean (SD) costs of individual services across the whole sample will also be reported and compared between the two study groups.</p>
                <p id="Par158">Health states data elicited using the EQ-5D-5 L will be combined with population utility weights to derive quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) used to measure health benefits in cost-utility analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed by combining the costs data (separately for each perspective) with the WSAS and QALYs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be computed and uncertainty around the results addressed using cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves.</p>

                <p id="Par161">In summary, the reporting of SAE’s will be based on the following criterion; (i) death of a participant, (ii) life threatening event (iii) hospitalisation (not including elective hospitalisation for pre-existing condition) (iv) deliberate self-harm or (v) any important medical condition which may influence the participants safety. In addition, an SAE will be reported, if the participant deteriorates in that the level of disability worsens and they are unable.to carry out important daily activities for more than 4 weeks.</p>
                <p id="Par162">All serious adverse events and reactions will be reviewed, by two members of the DMEC without the presence of the CI.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par169">PPS are highly prevalent in both primary and secondary care, and are associated with severe physical disability, psychological distress and high health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This paper outlines the study protocol of an RCT designed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural intervention for adults with PPS in secondary care. The PRINCE Secondary study will be the first trial worldwide to address the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a manual-based, transdiagnostic, approach for PPS. If it proves to be efficacious, this treatment approach could significantly improve overall functioning in patients with PPS and may lead to substantial long-term economic benefits to the NHS. Moreover, this approach could also be potentially beneficial for treating patients with other debilitating long-term conditions, including diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease.</p>
              <p id="Par170">There are several limitations that need to be considered when assessing the potential impact and implications of our findings. First, we do not have an attention control so any change that occurs in the transdiagnostic CBT group cannot be attributed to the specific contents of the intervention. Second, the present trial protocol deviates from the original protocol. The intention of this study was to recruit a representative sample of therapists to deliver the intervention. However, only three therapists were recruited as opposed to eight which was outlined in the original protocol. This protocol deviation led to the trial becoming an evaluation of the efficacy of CBT delivered by these three therapists. This change in trial objective also led us to recalculate the sample size requirement with the approval of Camberwell St Giles REC.</p>
