                  <p>Patients received levosimendan 1 mg daily, 1 mg two times a day or placebo during three 14-day crossover periods and levosimendan 1–2 mg daily during open-label follow-up.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 66 patients randomised, 59 contributed to the double-blind results and 50 entered open-label follow-up. Sitting SVC was not significantly different between the treatments. In post hoc analysis using period-wise baselines, supine SVC favoured levosimendan over placebo, estimated mean differences from baseline being −3.62% on placebo, +0.77% on levosimendan 1 mg daily (p=0.018) and +2.38% on 1 mg two times a day (p=0.001). Headache occurred in 16.7% of patients during levosimendan 1 mg daily (p=0.030), 28.6% during 1 mg two times a day (p=0.002) and 3.3% during placebo. The respective frequencies for increased heart rate were 5.1% (p=0.337), 18.5% (p=0.018) and 1.7%. No significant differences between the treatments were seen for other adverse events.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Levosimendan did not achieve the primary endpoint of improving sitting SVC in ALS. Headache and increased heart rate were increased on levosimendan, although it was otherwise well tolerated. A phase III study to evaluate the longer term effects of oral levosimendan in ALS is ongoing.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons resulting in progressive weakness, with death occurring from respiratory failure commonly as a result of diaphragmatic weakness typically within 3–4 years. None of the current therapies offer substantial clinical benefit for patients with ALS, riluzole having a modest effect on survival and edaravone on the rate of functional decline.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite the beneficial effects of non-invasive ventilation,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> poor respiratory function is a major source of disability, fatigue, morbidity and mortality in ALS, and there is an urgent need for an effective therapy to improve symptoms associated with the respiratory decline.</p>
              <p>Levosimendan binds selectively to troponin C sensitising cardiac and skeletal muscles to calcium,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and currently, an intravenous formulation of levosimendan is indicated for the treatment of acute worsening of severe heart failure. The mean elimination half-lives of levosimendan and its two active metabolites, OR-1855 and OR-1896, are about 1 and 60 hours, respectively. Due to its having similar free plasma concentrations to levosimendan, OR-1896 is believed to contribute to therapeutic efficacy during prolonged treatment (Orion Pharma, data on file). Levosimendan does not increase consumption of ATP or oxygen<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and does not cross the blood–brain barrier.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
              <p>There is a compelling scientific rationale for the development of an oral formulation of levosimendan for symptomatic treatment of ALS. Two experimental studies have shown that in diaphragm muscle fibres obtained from rats and humans, levosimendan improves submaximal force generation of diaphragm (both slow and fast muscle fibres) by about 15%–25%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> In addition, levosimendan has been reported to improve neuromechanical efficiency of human diaphragm function by 21% in healthy people.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Further support is provided by the development programmes of other calcium sensitisers, tirasemtiv and reldesemtiv. In a phase IIb study, tirasemtiv showed a positive effect on sitting slow vital capacity (SVC), but not on the primary efficacy endpoint ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>We therefore carried out a phase two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral levosimendan in ALS.</p>

The main exclusion criteria were other causes of neuromuscular weakness, diagnosis of another neurodegenerative disease, assisted ventilation or gastrostomy within 3 months and history of significant cardiac disease or cardiac events.

                <p>The primary endpoint was SVC (% of predicted normal) measured in the sitting position. Secondary endpoints included SVC measured supine, sniff nasal pressure (SNP), ALSFRS-R, overnight oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), hand grip strength, submaximal hand grip strength endurance, Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) assessed by patients and investigators, visual analogue scale (VAS) assessing fatigue and quality of life (QoL) scales (five-level EuroQoL five dimension (EQ-5D-5L) and Short Form-36 (SF-36)). Non-invasive ventilation support, permanent continuous ventilator dependence, tracheostomy and survival were recorded. During the 6-months open-label follow-up period, sitting and supine SVC, SNP, ALSFRS-R, EQ-5D-5L and SF-36 were assessed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP7">online supplementary file</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP5">online supplementary table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Sample size estimation was based on additional results from the BENEFIT-ALS trial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> SVC was assumed to decline during each double-blind crossover period by 4% for placebo and 1% for levosimendan, with a common SD of 9% and within subject correlation of 0.70. A sample size of 54 provides over 80% power at 5% significance.</p>
                <p>Intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for missing data was used throughout reporting. Appropriate descriptive statistics, frequency tables and plots were used to summarise all data.</p>
                <p>The primary efficacy endpoint was change in sitting SVC, comparing baseline (period 1 day 1) and day 14 predose assessments. Due to a significant period effect, changes from period-wise baselines (period 1 day 1, period 2 day 1 and period 3 day 1, respectively) were analysed as primary comparisons post hoc. Analysis of co-variance, appropriate to crossover design, was used for primary analysis. The statistical model included treatment dose, baseline SVC, treatment sequence and period as fixed effects and subject and site as random effects. All pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s adjustment. Slope of decline in SVC was evaluated including all data from both double-blind crossover and open-label follow-up using a random slope and intercept model.</p>
                <p>Secondary efficacy endpoints were primarily evaluated at the end of the double-blind crossover. A two-sided 0.05 significance level was allocated for the analyses of secondary variables. The secondary efficacy variables were analysed using the same statistical principles as the primary variable. Respiratory function and quality of life endpoints were evaluated during the open-label follow-up using descriptive statistics only.</p>
                <p>Levosimendan, OR-1855, OR-1896 and riluzole concentrations were summarised and plotted using descriptive statistics. Acetylation status was determined from all subjects participating in the study. Acetylation status was summarised by treatments and the effects of acetylation status on levosimendan, metabolites, SVC, SNP and ambulatory heart rate (HR) were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) appropriate for the crossover design. Potential effects of levosimendan treatment on riluzole concentration were evaluated using ANOVA.</p>

However, due to a significant period effect (p&lt;0.0001) with period-wise baseline affected by previous treatment period, the data did not allow appropriate interpretation of efficacy using the period 1, day 1 baseline for all periods.

                  <p>There is no formula to predict the effects of age, height and gender on supine SVC, and expected values were therefore calculated using the formula for sitting SVC. Using the original baseline definition, mean differences from baseline were −4.51% for placebo, −2.57% for levosimendan 1 mg daily (p=0.35 vs placebo) and −1.97% points for levosimendan 2 mg daily (p=0.17 vs placebo).

                <p>During the double-blind crossover part of the study, 13 of the 66 patients discontinued the study due to an AE, the most common reason being increase in HR fulfilling a predefined study treatment stopping rule (one during levosimendan 1 mg daily, eight during 2 mg daily and one during placebo). Based on the 24 hours Holter-ECG, mean changes from baseline in mean HR were 5.2 beats per minute (bpm) during levosimendan 1 mg daily, 10.7 bpm during 2 mg daily and −0.4 bpm during placebo. Other AEs leading to discontinuation of the study during the crossover periods were headache (n=1) and atrial fibrillation and ECG QT prolonged (n=1) during levosimendan 2 mg daily, and bradycardia and cardiac arrest (n=1) during placebo. During the open-label follow-up, six subjects discontinued the study due to AEs, five of them being serious adverse events (SAEs) (pulmonary embolism, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction and dysphagia) and one non-serious AE (HR increased).</p>
                <p>During the crossover part of the study, SAEs were reported in four (7%) patients both during levosimendan 1 mg daily and placebo and in two (3%) patients during levosimendan 2 mg daily. Nineteen patients (38%) reported SAEs during open-label follow-up. The most commonly reported SAE terms were respiratory failure, dysphagia and ALS. Two of the SAEs were assessed as related to the study treatment by the investigator: bradycardia and cardiac arrest during placebo in the crossover part and acute myocardial infarction during the open-label follow-up. Five patients died during the study (one during the crossover and four during the open-label part of the study); in all cases, the death was assessed as not related to the study treatment by the investigator. Two patients died of ALS and one each of ‘pneumonia aspiration, ‘pneumonia bacterial, myocardial infarction and pneumothorax’ and ‘respiratory failure’.</p>
                <p>Mean changes from baseline in supine systolic blood pressure were numerically greater after levosimendan (from −4.0 to −8.6 mm Hg) than after placebo (from 1.9 to −0.1 mm Hg). Changes in diastolic blood pressure were similar to those in systolic blood pressure. No differences were seen in mean orthostatic test results between treatments.</p>

Fourteen-day treatment periods were selected based on earlier studies reporting that a single oral 1 mg dose of levosimendan was able to increase cardiac output in patients with severe heart failure by 22% (p&lt;0.005; Orion Pharma data on file) and that a short levosimendan infusion improved diaphragm function in healthy people.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It was expected, however, that most of the outcome measures such as ALSFRS-R<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and QoL scales would not show any differences within 14-day periods.</p>
              <p>In contrast to our primary assumptions, there was a clear period effect (but no carryover effect) seen in the crossover part of the study, and therefore the efficacy results were analysed period-wise, using period-specific baselines (post hoc analyses). Although the primary endpoint of sitting SVC did not show significant differences between the treatments, supine SVC in the post hoc analyses indicated a dose-related treatment effect favouring levosimendan against placebo (4.39% points difference between placebo and levosimendan 1 mg and 6.00% points difference between placebo and 2 mg). Similar results were seen during all three periods, effectively replicating the findings two further times, thus strengthening our confidence in the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Diaphragmatic performance is reduced more dramatically by lying than by sitting, and the first clinical signs of respiratory insufficiency often appear during sleeping or when lying down.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Seeing differences between the treatments in supine but not sitting SVC is supported by the finding that in patients with ALS, supine vital capacity is a more sensitive measure of diaphragmatic strength than that measured in the upright position, suggesting that upright vital capacity might not reveal abnormalities becoming noticeable in the supine position.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> There is also evidence that supine vital capacity is a better predictor of survival than upright vital capacity,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> and among several different respiratory measures, it has been reported to correlate most closely with diaphragmatic weakness, especially in patients with vital capacity &lt;75% of predicted.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Treatment effects seen in supine SVC between levosimendan and placebo treatments in patients with SVC &lt;75% predicted at baseline are in line with this expectation. Although no significant changes were seen, both the ALSFRS-R total score and respiratory domain subscore numerically favoured levosimendan, supporting the supine SVC results. However, one needs to be cautious in interpreting ALSFRS-R results as the absolute differences were small and the treatment duration was short. Apart from supine SVC, other secondary efficacy endpoints did not show any difference between treatments.</p>
              <p>All 50 patients completing the crossover part of the study continued to the open-label follow-up. Mean supine SVC at study baseline was 73.3% points and declined to 61.8% points at the end of the 6 months open-label follow-up. In turn, mean ALSFRS-R total score was 36.7 points at baseline and declined to 28.9 points at the end of open-label follow-up. During the entire 9-months study, the mean decline in supine SVC and ALSFRS-R total score were 1.93% points/month and 1.03 points/month, respectively. Mean declines were smaller over the last 6 months when all patients were on levosimendan. Based on a previous retrospective analysis, slowing the rate of decline of SVC by 1.5% point monthly (from −4.23 to −2.73 and to −1.23) corresponds to a reduction of about 20% in the risk for respiratory events or death.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In light of this analysis, our results are encouraging, but no conclusions can be drawn since our uncontrolled data from the open-label follow-up are not directly comparable due to differences in study design and duration, and the position in which SVC was measured.</p>
              <p>In patients with rapid acetylator status more active metabolite OR-1896 of levosimendan is formed<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and the active metabolite levels were higher in rapid than slow acetylators in this study. Despite this, there was no difference in the change of supine SVC. This is in line with the earlier findings in patients with heart failure, in whom haemodynamic effects were similar in rapid and slow acetylators.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>Levosimendan was generally well tolerated. Headache and increase in HR were more common during levosimendan treatment than placebo showing a dose-dependent increase in frequency. Headache, most probably due to vasodilatation by levosimendan, was usually short lasting and did not result in discontinuation of the study except for one patient with a medical history of migraine. In most cases, the increase in HR was reported as an AE based on a predefined study treatment stopping rule (increase in mean HR of over 15 bpm from baseline in the 24 hours Holter recording) and was not due to subjective symptoms of tachycardia. Most of the other frequently reported AEs, such as falls, nasopharyngitis, dysphagia and respiratory failure, were not considered to be related to the study treatment, reflecting the signs and symptoms of ALS. Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in a low number of patients and were evenly distributed across the treatment arms. AEs such as dizziness or somnolence were reported as isolated events only and no AEs such as ataxia, agitation, confusion or delirium were reported in the study. All deaths and most other SAEs were assessed as not related to the study treatment by the investigator, indicating incidental events expected to be related to ALS.</p>
              <p>In summary, we found no evidence that levosimendan improves SVC in the sitting position. Levosimendan treatment was well tolerated but with a dose-dependent increase in headache and tachycardia compared with placebo. In the light of the post hoc analysis indicating a possible dose-dependent treatment effect of levosimendan on the supine SVC compared with placebo, a phase III study is ongoing to evaluate longer term effects of oral levosimendan in ALS (NCT03505021) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary video</xref>).</p>
