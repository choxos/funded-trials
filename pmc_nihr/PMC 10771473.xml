                <p id="Par1">This trial assessed the feasibility and acceptability of Kidney BEAM, a physical activity and emotional well-being self-management digital health intervention (DHI) for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which offers live and on-demand physical activity sessions, educational blogs and videos, and peer support. In this mixed-methods, multicentre randomised waitlist-controlled internal pilot, adults with established CKD were recruited from five NHS hospitals and randomised 1:1 to Kidney BEAM or waitlist control. Feasibility outcomes were based upon a priori progression criteria. Acceptability was primarily explored via individual semi-structured interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 15). Of 763 individuals screened, <italic>n</italic> = 519 (68%, 95% CI 65 to 71%) were eligible. Of those eligible, <italic>n</italic> = 303 (58%, 95% CI 54–63%) did not respond to an invitation to participate by the end of the pilot period. Of the 216 responders, 50 (23%, 95% CI 18–29%) consented. Of the 42 randomised, <italic>n</italic> = 22 (10 (45%) male; 49 ± 16 years; 14 (64%) White British) were allocated to Kidney BEAM and <italic>n</italic> = 20 (12 (55%) male; 56 ± 11 years; 15 (68%) White British) to the waitlist control group. Overall, <italic>n</italic> = 15 (30%, 95% CI 18–45%) withdrew during the pilot phase. Participants completed a median of 14 (IQR 5–21) sessions. At baseline, 90–100% of outcome data (patient reported outcome measures and a remotely conducted physical function test) were completed and 62–83% completed at 12 weeks follow-up. Interview data revealed that remote trial procedures were acceptable. Participants’ reported that Kidney BEAM increased their opportunity and motivation to be physically active, however, lack of time remained an ongoing barrier to engagement with the DHI. An randomised controlled trial of Kidney BEAM is feasible and acceptable, with adaptations to increase recruitment, retention and engagement.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par15">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 800 million adults worldwide and is associated with lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Physical activity and emotional- wellbeing self-management support have a beneficial impact on HRQoL in this population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and are key elements in the management of many long-term conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Despite this, there is limited access to this type of care for people with CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Digital health interventions (DHIs) may offer a clinically and cost-effective means of addressing barriers to accessing support for physical activity and emotional well-being<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Digital health interventions can significantly improve clinical outcomes in people with CKD, but existing DHIs do not specifically focused upon physical activity and emotional well-being<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. There is an urgent need for high-quality, large-scale trials focussing upon patient-centred outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, reviews of barriers and facilitators to physical activity DHIs suggest that they need to be tailored to the requirements of the specific long-term condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, yet here is little research into the specific views of people with CKD concerning DHIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Understanding these perspectives and beliefs is crucial to ensuring that DHIs meet the needs of a diverse range of people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p id="Par17">Kidney BEAM is a DHI which has been co-developed with people with CKD to support physical activity and emotional well-being self-management. A multicentre prospective, wait-list randomised controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate whether Kidney BEAM improves HRQoL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The aims of this trial’s internal pilot were to (1) establish the feasibility of a RCT investigating the effectiveness of Kidney BEAM and (2) explore participants’ perceptions of trial and intervention acceptability. This paper describes the development of Kidney BEAM, and the methods and results of the internal pilot.</p>

Internal pilots are a cost-effective way of assessing whether it is feasible to continue to a definitive trial, as data collected during the internal pilot phase contribute towards the final analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The results may allow trialists to modify the processes used to enhance the chances of successful recruitment and retention, alongside other important feasibility parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

These initial interviews were retained within the analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Interviews were conducted by experienced qualitative researchers, all of whom had experience of working with people with CKD (HMLY, EMC, RB, JB). Some of the participants may have been aware of the researchers from their role in developing and delivering physical activity and education as part of the DHI. Any influence of these dual roles on the data collection or analysis process was explored via reflexive journals kept by the qualitative research team throughout, creating an ‘audit trail’ of analytical decisions. The involvement of multiple researchers in the analysis and interpretation of the data facilitated discussion on the level of agreement between coders and ensured that analysis and interpretation remained grounded in the data. To enhance credibility, the findings were discussed with the wider multidisciplinary research team and the patient and public (PPI) group. Interviews were conducted at an appointment separate from the trial assessments via telephone or secure online video conferencing software and were audio-recorded.

                  <p id="Par57">Most participants found the online consent process straightforward but felt that telephone and face-to-face follow-up discussions remained important for informed consent. Emphasising the uniqueness and potential benefits of Kidney BEAM via diverse patient stories were suggested methods of increasing recruitment. Several people worried that allocation to the wait list control group would indicate they were not suitable for a physical activity-based intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Remote trial assessments were universally described as simple and quick, and most people had no concerns regarding safety. The main challenges were lack of space and concerns regarding validity. The remote PROMS were less acceptable and described as repetitive, with some of the questions within the KDQoL-SF1.3 perceived as irrelevant.</p>

                  <title>Kidney BEAM within the CKD journey</title>
                  <p id="Par60">Kidney BEAM was considered particularly relevant at the start of participants CKD journey. It was viewed as a trusted resource to address knowledge gaps and provide peer support. It was also felt to be useful following kidney transplantation, when participants were open to making lifestyle changes, but where there was a lack of specific guidance around effective and safe physical activity.</p>

                  <p id="Par61">Kidney BEAM was described as positively framed and praised for offering standing and seated physical activity options, which allowed people to adapt the sessions to their ability. The video format was helpful for those participants managing fatigue, as it was easier to concentrate and the ability to pause the on-demand videos enabled periods of rest. The opportunity to choose from a wide range of physical activity types was also valued. Participants suggested providing additional CKD and life stage specific content, and more detailed information for people with a good existing understanding (Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab9"><label>Table 9</label><caption><p>Illustrative quotations relating to participants’ perceptions of Kidney BEAM.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Kidney BEAM within the CKD journey</td><td align="left"><p>At the start of the kidney journey</p><p><italic>“</italic>I think for people who are new to kidney disease or, you know, maybe just had a transplant or whatever, maybe it would be helpful for them to get support and, you know, answer questions” (Female, 60 s, mixed background, CKD stage 3a, very high adherence)</p><p><italic>“When the doctor is telling you all this stuff, you blank out.

                <title>Enhancing the opportunity to be physically active, and the challenge of time</title>
                <p id="Par62">Participants were managing hectic and unpredictable work and caring responsibilities. Those receiving dialysis were additionally managing high levels of treatment and symptom burden. Fatigue was exacerbated by these busy lifestyles and, together with fluctuations in health and ability, this made scheduling physical activity challenging. Kidney BEAM allowed participants to save time by reducing travel and offering flexible opportunities to be physically active. Despite this, they continued to report having limited time to engage with the DHI. Most participants focused on the physical activity sessions and personally relevant educational topics and were unaware of the breadth of content available.</p>
                <p id="Par63">Suggestions for refinement centred around helping participants to maximise their available time. Kidney BEAM could be made easier to navigate, and participants suggested that a short video ‘tour’ and increased telephone or online support would also help. They also felt it was important to highlight new content and provide guidance on key content. Shorter session durations, a more extensive live class timetable and greater leeway with live class bookings were also suggested (Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab10"><label>Table 10</label><caption><p>Illustrative quotations relating to enhancing the opportunity to be physically active, and the challenge of time.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">Barriers to physically active</td><td align="left"><p>Hectic lifestyles</p><p><italic>“My biggest challenge which will probably be borne out later is…finding the time for all this.

                <p id="Par64">Despite the challenges with attending the live classes due to lack of time, those able to attend found them highly engaging. The instructors were perceived as warm, inclusive and knowledgeable. Areas for enhancement included making the relevance of increased physical activity on CKD more evident and offering one-to-one reviews. Participants with higher adherence underlined the importance of the community and accountability created by the live classes, which fostered ongoing participation. Text message reminders, mandating more than two classes per week, and using personal goals were highlighted as methods for further enhancing accountability. People with lower adherence were more likely to describe feeling self-conscious.</p>
                <p id="Par65">The physical activity diary was described as a motivational means of tracking progress and increasing ‘offline’ physical activity. Participants felt the ability to sync the diary with wearable monitors would reduce burden. Introducing summary analytics to help them understand how their physical activity levels are influenced by factors such as symptoms and time of the day was also suggested to support activity planning.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par68">The results of this pilot trial suggest that progression to a definitive trial is warranted, provided adaptations are made to enhance recruitment and retention rates. The progression criterion for outcome acceptability was achieved and there were no adverse events. Feedback regarding the acceptability of Kidney BEAM was positive, with suggested refinements focused on supporting people maximise their available time.</p>
              <p id="Par69">This trial is the first to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of a physical activity and emotional well-being DHI for people with CKD. The pre-specified progression criteria supported continuation and identified adaptations to enhance recruitment and retention. The recruitment rates observed in this trial are lower than those seen in other multi-centre trials of physical activity programmes delivered across the CKD spectrum, which range from ~ 41 to 69%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The reason for this discrepancy is likely due to these trials using face to face recruitment, rather than remote, recruitment and the interventions being highly structured and supervised, rather than delivered entirely online. Importantly, these interventions have failed to have been widely implemented within routine practice because the workforce and expertise required to do this are not routinely available to people with CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. When compared with other trials of self-management and physical activity DHIs for long-term conditions, rates of refusal within this pilot are comparable (also ~ 32%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Optimising the recruitment for Kidney BEAM and ensuring the wide reach and acceptability of this intervention, using the learning gathered from this internal pilot and the subsequent definitive trial, will ensure that safe, scaleable and effective physical activity and self-management intervention may be delivered to a demographically and geographically diverse population, bridging this significant translational gap.</p>
              <p id="Par70">Notably, the trial was also conducted during the pandemic, when many centres were not actively recruiting to trials. This undoubtedly contributed to the lower-than-expected recruitment rates. Trials planned during this time required protocols that were safe and deliverable, whilst also maintaining scientific validity and integrity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. A shift to remote trial delivery increased exponentially during this period, paving the way for more remote trials in the future. The results of our trial demonstrated challenges with converting potential participants into enrolees, supporting the findings of a recent systematic review, where conversion rates were higher in those recruited ‘offline’, and in some cases led to the recruitment of ‘atypical’ populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Existing evidence recommends a combination of on, and offline recruitment be used to derive a representative sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and a tool kit for remote trial delivery has been published since the inception of the Kidney BEAM trial, recommending staff training, follow-up and support for participants being recruited online<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. The learning from the pilot has led to several adaptations to the recruitment process which are outlined in Table <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">12</xref>. The adaptations needed to achieve the required sample size for the definitive trial included: the addition of further centres, following-up non-responders, and a script to support the recruitment of people not already contemplating becoming more active (Supplementary Material <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Similar recruitment strategies are effective in trials of DHIs in other long-term conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and may also address the high rates of non-responders and post-randomisation withdrawals.</p>
              <p id="Par71">Similarly, retention rates did not reach our a priori criteria. We were not able to explore this further within the interviews, which were conducted with participants who completed the trial. Other studies have reported similar challenges, and rates of retention of around 48%, within online trials and DHIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Considering this, our retention rate of 70% compares favourably, particularly for a physical activity intervention which requires significant engagement and motivation. Loss to follow up in online trials and digital interventions appears to be positively influenced by a range of factors including referral from a clinical team member, targeting motivated participants, incentivisation, nudges and reducing study complexity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. These strategies may be employed to increase retention, but must be balanced with the potential dangers of selecting participants which are not representative of all people with CKD.</p>
              <p id="Par72">The baseline characteristics of those recruited were largely representative of the UK CKD population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, providing reassurance relating to the potential external validity of the definitive trial. Whilst the demographics of those who declined were similar to those who participated, frailer participants were not recruited. The incidence of frailty is approximately 75% within the CKD population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and physical activity is an important component of frailty management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Physical activity DHIs for frail older people are effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and Kidney BEAM may represent an important intervention for this particularly vulnerable group, but it remains uncertain whether the challenges to recruiting this group are reflective of the acceptability of Kidney BEAM, or because the research teams inadvertently acted as gatekeepers to the trial, as has been observed in other trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par73">Kidney BEAM was well received due to its inclusivity, accessibility and flexibility. Similar findings have been reported in DHIs for other long-term conditions, where choice over how and where support is accessed increased a sense of control and reduced anxiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Kidney BEAM also increased participants’ opportunity and motivation to be physically active, however, lack of time continued to be the predominant ongoing barrier to engagement. Competing priorities has been highlighted as a major barrier to engagement with DHIs in other long-term conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Although the ‘go’ criteria for intervention acceptability was not achieved, adherence to kidney BEAM (58%) compared favourably with physical activity DHIs for other long-term conditions (55%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and face-to-face renal rehabilitation programmes (59%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Suggested refinements focused on further enhancing participants’ opportunity and motivation to engage, via individual tailoring. Allowing users to create personalised goals, customise the level of the information within the DHI and receive personalised reminders, have all been shown to increase engagement and effectiveness in other long-term conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and DHIs for people with CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. DHIs lend themselves well to tailoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and the feedback received from participants will be used to further personalise the content on Kidney BEAM in the future. The physical activity diary and goal-setting features were valued for helping participants track personal progress. Enhancing this by syncing the diary with wearable activity trackers and providing personal analytics has been shown to increase adherence across a range of other long-term conditions by supporting users to gain new understanding about how to manage their condition, whilst also reducing burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Participants highlighted that ease of use was key to increasing meaningful engagement. Intuitive and easy-to-use DHIs are important for securing initial engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and sustained use over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. In a similar manner to recruitment to the trial, healthcare professional support was also important for the delivery of the DHI, with engagement highlighted as important sources of motivation. The integration of healthcare professional support with DHIs has been consistently associated with increased adherence in other long-term conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, via increased self-confidence, development of skills and reduced isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par76">The community created via Kidney BEAM was an important motivator for some participants, but less appealing to others. This ambivalence has been observed in other trials and is related to individual preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> Kidney BEAM allowed participants to select an option which suited their personal preferences, enhancing acceptability and reducing the potential for negative social comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, family and friend support was also crucial for many participants, which was not anticipated in the development phase. Previous research suggests that targeting these wider support networks is important to increasing uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the results of this current trial indicate that it can also promote ‘offline’ activity outside of the DHI.</p>
              <sec id="Sec46">
                <title>Strength and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par77">To our knowledge, this trial is the first to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a remote trial of a CKD-specific DHI focused on physical activity and emotional well-being. A key strength is a strong emphasis on the co-production of the intervention using established, theory-informed approaches which have previously been lacking within this field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. An acknowledged limitation is the lack of exploration of the views of researchers and withdrawing participants which would have provided further useful insight.</p>
                <p id="Par78">One of the reasons the ‘go’ criteria may also not have been achieved was that not all people may have been able to access and use an English language DHI. Existing reviews indicate that although DHIs may lead to improvement in clinical outcomes across a range of long-term conditions, they are most often utilised by digitally and health literate people with access to technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Up to 20% of the general population do not possess fundamental digital skills, resources, motivation and confidence needed to effectively use DHIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Digital exclusion can perpetuate health inequality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and, given that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the introduction of DHIs with routine care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, exploration of digital exclusion in relation to online physical activity and emotional wellbeing self-management programmes is warranted. Not all patient populations are affected in the same way, or experience the same barriers, making understanding the perspectives of those who do not participate in the trial particularly important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Strategies that have proven beneficial to engaging frailer participants in other evaluations of DHIs include providing access to technology, providing support to increase ‘readiness’ to use the intervention, addressing concerns about injury, social isolation and security and avoiding stigmatisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. As part of the evaluation of Kidney BEAM, we are conducting a qualitative sub-study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> which will explore these challenges in people who declined to participate in the trial. The findings of this sub-study, alongside a substudy specifically examining the role and effectiveness of Kidney BEAM during the intradialytic period for people receiving HD, will more comprehensively inform strategies to address inequality of access and to improve the reach of Kidney BEAM.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Additionally, some of the qualitative researchers were known to the participants from their roles as physiotherapists delivering the classes or as the Principal Investigator at one of the sites. Although this may have influenced their responses, this risk was mitigated by ensuring participants were interviewed by a researcher unknown to them. In some instances, these dual roles were helpful, as knowledge of the trial and DHI allowed researchers to provide further prompts and explanations.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par80">A definitive trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Kidney BEAM feasible, with adaptation to increase acceptability. The results of this definitive trial will provide robust evidence for the role of DHIs in supporting physical activity and self-management in people with CKD. This will address an area of unwarranted variation in care and potentially lead to a step change in the clinical management of this population.</p>
