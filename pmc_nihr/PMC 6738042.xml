              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">The mortality from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), in the United Kingdom was 4227 in 2016.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In the UK the 5 year survival rate drops from 90% for the 31% of cases that are diagnosed at stage I; to 22% for the 49% of cases diagnosed at stage III or IV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> The non-specific nature of early EOC symptoms combined with the rarity of the disease presents a major barrier to increasing rates of detection of pre-clinical disease through the primary care setting. Achieving a mortality reduction in EOC will require a screening strategy capable of triggering intervention early enough to alter the natural history of ovarian cancer.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In the context of a screening programme cancers may be divided into indolent disease, patients with which tend to die of other causes; treatable disease which if caught and managed early may go into extended remission; and untreatable disease amenable only to management and palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> A successful screening programme must identify sufficient numbers of treatable cases for timely intervention, prior to their progression to untreatable disease, to outweigh the cost and associated harms of misdiagnosis of healthy individuals and unnecessary treatment of indolent cases.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Two screening trials for EOC based on a multimodal strategy involving the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> which determines risk of ovarian cancer by detecting a sudden rapid increase in CA125 level from baseline, have recently been published: the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) in low risk postmenopausal women,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS) in younger women with greater than 10% lifetime risk based on family history or gene mutation in BRCA1/2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> UKCTOCS demonstrated that a multimodal screening arm, incorporating ROCA as a first-line and transvaginal ultrasound as a second-line test, was able to diagnose EOC at earlier stage than the control arm whilst UKFOCSS demonstrated a stage shift in cases diagnosed during screening programme versus cases diagnosed over a year after screening stopped. At the time of the initial UKCTOCS mortality report, although the early detection by screening had not yielded a significant reduction it demonstrated a trend toward mortality benefit and further follow up is underway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> The need remains for a screening strategy which enables identification of treatable EOC cases leading to a mortality reduction.</p>
              <p id="Par8">A screening tool assigns a risk score to each participant. Every possible demarcation threshold on the range of risk scores represents a sensitivity-specificity pair which, combined with disease prevalence, defines a positive predictive value and a negative predictive value. Specificity and consequently positive predictive value depend on the false positive rate. The numbers of false positives must be kept low to minimise the burden on health services and healthy participants, but the majority of cases put to the diagnostic test will be healthy so even a low error rate will result in high absolute number of false positives. So, to make a screening tool clinically viable the threshold score must be raised, sacrificing sensitivity for specificity until false positive numbers fall to an acceptable level. The earliest most treatable cases are those to which a tool is least sensitive, and which will be missed on the first pass. Detecting these cases requires sensitive tests that retain the highest specificity enabling unambiguous diagnosis which permits rapid initiation of clinical investigation and progress to treatment. It is hoped that panels of complimentary biomarkers may offer improved specificity over single biomarker tests, as non-target diseases and benign conditions that dysregulate a single biomarker should have minimal impact on other members of the panel. Efforts to develop such a panel have not been successful to date.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Here, we describe the development of a panel using data from a subset of the prospectively collected serum samples spanning up to 7 years time-to-diagnosis (tDx), obtained in the course of the UKCTOCS trial. The 7-year tDx timespan permits the discovery of biomarkers in serum collected prior to clinical diagnosis of EOC; the period in which the asymptomatic but treatable early forms of EOC occur. It has previously been shown by a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) screening trial that a biomarker panel intended to supplement CA125 for EOC diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> showed no improvement over CA125 alone, greater than 6 months tDx.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Recently proposed panels for EOC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and for multiple cancers including EOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> which were also developed in clinically diagnosed cancers may suffer the same lack of sensitivity in pre-clinical samples as demonstrated by the PLCO study.</p>

                <title>Relationship between dysregulation scores and risk classification</title>
                <p id="Par22">The model takes as input dysregulation scores 0–6 for CA125, protein Z and LCAT and 0–7 for CRP. Considering risk classification attributed to different combinations of scores gives some insight into how the model might behave in a screening programme. The model input dysregulation scores would be as follows: {CA125; PROZ; LCAT; CRP} and the model results given as {model score; classification N,I,E or S}.</p>
                <p id="Par23">If this panel offers an improvement on the current test which is based on CA125, it would be expected to require contribution from more markers than just CA125 to attribute the highest risk scores. This is, in fact, the case as CA125 maximally dysregulated with no other biomarkers included is {6,0,0,0}→{0.80, E}. To attain a severe level classification requires the contribution of the maximum CA125 score with at least a single score on one of the other markers {6,1,0,0}→{0.87, S}; {6,0,1,0}→{0.85, S} {6,0,0,1}→{0.85, S}. The specificity of the test derives in part from the requirement that risk be indicated by multiple markers, by not detecting conditions known to elevate CA125 such as endometriosis. For this sample set higher EOC risk estimates generally resulted not from substantial dysregulation of a single marker in the panel but from lesser dysregulation of multiple panel members.</p>
                <p id="Par24">A successful panel would be expected to return a high risk of EOC for moderate dysregulation scores on each of the biomarkers in the panel. This is in fact the case as illustrated by the following score combinations: { 2, 3, 3, 3}→{0.86, S}; { 3, 2, 3, 2}→{0.85, S}; and { 3, 3, 2, 2}→{0.86, S}. Thus, scores for each individual marker, with specificity in the range of 90–97.5%, which would individually be of no use in a screen; combine to form a test that is highly specific, which retains sensitivity by drawing on the dysregulation of multiple markers.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The potential of CRP, which is known to elevate in many inflammatory events, to confound the screening tool with false positives is limited by the way the model has been constructed. The maximum score achievable by CRP dysregulation, with no contribution from other members of the panel, is 7. This would place an individual into the intermediate category {0,0,0,7}}→{0.24, I}. Thus, elevation of CRP alone would not trigger urgent intervention in a screening tool and the role of CRP in the model is to enhance the risk score afforded by the other more specific members of the panel.</p>

                <p id="Par26">Assigning classifications severe (S), elevated (E), intermediate (I) or normal (N) to samples depending on the PPV associated with the sample enables simulation of a simplified annual screening programme to enable consideration of how the screening tool might be implemented in a screening programme. The progress of individuals through the screening programme is visualised as a river plot Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2,</xref> which shows how classification of samples from women who developed Type I (not used to train model) or Type II (used to train model) EOC evolve over time. The visualisation shows the majority of women enter the simulated screening programme at 4-years tDx with samples classified as normal and subsequent samples show successively elevated risk towards diagnosis. For Type II EOC the novel panel assigns 64 and 28% of women to severe at 1 and 2-years tDx, respectively. For Type I EOC the novel panel assigns 53 and 20% of women to severe, at 1 and 2-years tDx, respectively. The controls show a majority at classification normal over the 4-year period, however, some controls (6 at year 4; 5 at year t3; 8 at year 2; 5 at year 1 tDx) were seen with classifications other than normal over this time. Within these samples there is a general pattern of risk estimates rising and then falling again, suggesting a repeat testing strategy like that deployed in UKCTOCS, might successfully eliminate them. There is a single control case that is classified elevated at 4, 3 and 2 years tDx, but which then rises to severe 1-year tDx. This case is more problematic and further investigation is required to understand how frequent cases like this might be and if strategies are available to deal with them.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>River plots showing the progress of women’s risk classification for years 4–1 tDx by taking the risk classification of the latest sample available prior to each annual screen cut-off.

                <p id="Par28">The data also reveal features that add confidence to the model’s veracity. For example, Type II cases diagnosed at stage III are generally given risk classifications E or S at longer lead times to diagnosis than cases diagnosed at stages I and II, as would be expected if the women had harboured undiagnosed tumours for long enough for disease to reach the later stages. Over half the cases diagnosed at stage III were given risk classifications of S 1–2-years prior to diagnosis in the course of the trial, which invites speculation into how clinical outcomes for these women might have improved were the panel to have been available to them.</p>

              <p id="Par30">Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease with tumour histology identifying multiple distinct types with differing prognosis, genetic markers and treatment regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> It is possible that some of these ovarian cancers are so aggressive they are essentially untreatable and their successful identification in a screening trial may not reduce mortality. The challenge is to increase the identification of those treatable cases that do exist and to do so before they progress and become untreatable.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In this study of prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed samples, the tool presented above demonstrates an improved performance over CA125 interpreted by ROCA alone for early detection of ovarian cancer in the studied sample set. The four protein model was able to offer up to a 1–2-year lead time in diagnosis over that achieved for the cases in the UKCTOCS trail for both Type I and Type II cases. A direct comparison to the ROCA algorithm applied in the UKCTOCS trial and UKFOCSS study, is not possible retrospectively and the smaller sample set used here is likely to have resulted in an overestimation of the achievable PPVs. However, the signal identified in the protein panel is certainly real and warrants further investigation in independent sample sets both in Type II and Type I EOCs.</p>
              <p id="Par32">The simulated screening programme shows the potential for relatively subtle dysregulation, against patient baseline, of multiple biomarkers in combination to return a sensitive and specific assessment of EOC risk. Since either up- or down-regulation of each marker contributed to risk estimation it may be better to think of these makers not being directly mechanistically linked to the initiation and progression of disease, but as independent polls on dysregulation of several physiological systems. The degree and direction of dysregulation being determined by multiple interacting feedback mechanisms. There is a general lack of correlation between biomarker scores indicating their independence whilst the cases with low CA125 scores may still have high EOC probability scores due to contributions from other biomarkers showing how that independence contributes to sensitivity.</p>
              <p id="Par33">A caveat to the current model that should be borne in mind is that the number of controls (141 samples from 31 women) may underestimate the variability of expression of these proteins in women without ovarian cancer. Higher variability would reduce the specificity of the test, reduce the PPV of risk estimates and erode the confidence in diagnosis. Specificity is critical at two points in the analysis. The first is where dysregulation from baseline is scored by specificity thresholds derived from the controls. The second is in the simulated screening programme where PPV thresholds are set to classify subjects as normal, intermediate, elevated or severe. One likely reason that this study has underestimated variation is that there may be non-EOC conditions, much more frequently occurring than EOC, but sufficiently rare as to have been excluding from this control set, that affect PROZ, LCAT and CRP levels just endometriosis and the menstrual cycle do for CA125.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Analysis of the longitudinal behaviour of these proteins in a much larger cohort of control women is required to obtain more precise estimates of specificity and PPV. In mitigation of this, however, the most concerning member of the panel in this regard (CRP) returns only intermediate risk if dysregulated alone. This indicates robustness to confounding conditions. Despite the important caveats above the investigation of the relationship between possible combinations of dysregulation score and risk estimate indicate that elevation of risk on a single biomarker, even CA125, does not return the highest risk estimates.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The strategy of developing a biomarker panel in the context of a simulated screening (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) programme based on the UKCTOCS trial has focused analysis on the clinically critical positive predictive value, which has further enabled risk estimates from the tool to be related to potential care pathways. The panel and associated model developed pursuing this strategy is able to detect EOC in samples drawn from women 1–2-years prior to their diagnosis in the course of the UKCTOCS trial. This time period is expected to contain a high proportion of cases at a treatable stage where patients may benefit from a 90% rather than a 22% 5-year survival rate which would be of substantial clinical utility.</p>
              <p id="Par35">This analysis from the concept of taking markers as independent polls on physiological dysregulation (indicative of disease), through to a simulated screening programme, provides not just an abstracted statistical relationship between marker and disease status; but a tangible worked example accessible to oncologists. This study alone is not sufficient to justify deployment as a screening tool given the limitations of the analysis we have highlighted. The new panel does, however, have sufficient potential to justify a larger scale validation study and confirms the presence of EOC detecting signal from protein biomarker panels in early asymptomatic EOC.</p>
