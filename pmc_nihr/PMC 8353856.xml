                  <p id="Par1">Unstable ankle fractures represent a substantial burden of disease, accounting for a mean hospital stay of nine days, a mean cost of Â£4,491 per patient and 20,000 operations per year. There is variation in UK practice around weight-bearing instructions after operatively managed ankle fracture. Early weight-bearing may reduce reliance on health services, time off work, and improve functional outcomes. However, concerns remain about the potential for complications such as implant failure. This is the protocol of a multicentre randomised non-inferiority clinical trial of weight-bearing following operatively treated ankle fracture.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Adults aged 18 years and over who have been managed operatively for ankle fracture will be assessed for eligibility. Baseline function (Olerud and Molander Ankle Score [OMAS]), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), and complications will be collected after informed consent has been obtained. A randomisation sequence has been prepared by a trial statistician to allow for 1:1 allocation to receive either instruction to weight-bear as pain allows from the point of randomisation, two weeks after the time of surgery (â<italic>early weight-bearing</italic>â group) or to not weight-bear for a further four weeks (â<italic>delayed weight -bearingâ group</italic>). All other treatment will be as per the guidance of the treating clinician.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants will be asked about their weight-bearing status weekly until four weeks post-randomisation. At four weeks post-randomisation complications will be collected. At six weeks, four months, and 12 months post-randomisation, the OMAS, EQ-5D-5L, complications, physiotherapy input, and resource use will be collected. The primary outcome measure is ankle function (OMAS) at four months post-randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">A minimum of 436 participants will be recruited to obtain 80% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of -6 points on the OMAS 4 months post-randomisation. A within-trial health economic evaluation will be conducted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment options.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par26">One hundred seventy patients sustain an ankle fracture in the UK every day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ankle fractures are grouped into those in which the bones remain aligned (stable) and those in which they do not (unstable). Unstable fractures require surgery to stabilise the ankle bones whilst they heal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. 20,000 ankle operations are performed every year in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They represent a substantial burden of disease, with an average length of hospital stay of nine days and an associated mean cost of Â£4,491 per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Post-operative mobilisation strategies are variable. Historically surgeons restricted patientsâ weight-bearing due to a fear that excessive loading of the bone and metal implants could lead to an early loss of alignment, soft tissue compromise, poor functional outcomes and a requirement for revision surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This weight-bearing restriction has a major impact on patients and health services through enforced use of walking aids, increased dependency and/or longer hospital stays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients also report significant time off work with the consequent personal and societal cost impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is reasonable that if there were minimal risk of harm, many patients would prefer to walk without weight-bearing restrictions.</p>
              <p id="Par28">High-quality systematic reviews conducted by Cochrane and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have found no credible evidence of harm associated with an early weight-bearing strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is a pressing need to definitively test the appropriateness of this component of the surgical treatment of ankle fractures.</p>

To align with recently published and ongoing NIHR multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on ankle fracture management, we have chosen to separate patients younger and older than 60 years old as the stratification cut-off to ensure balance across the treatment arms and for subgroup analysis for this trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par60">All NHS hospitals are familiar with giving rehabilitation instructions for weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing. All patients will be non-weight-bearing for the first two weeks in the immediate post-operative period to allow swelling to settle and the wound to start healing. The type of ankle immobilisation will be decided as per usual care by the treating clinical team.</p>
                <p id="Par61">The timeframes and definitions of early and delayed weight-bearing are in line with NICE NG38 standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Clear instructions for patients to avoid weight-bearing if they experience pain or discomfort will act as an additional safety measure. The decisions for both groups of the trial about which form of immobilisation, such as a plaster, boot or other (if any) is used and how much unloaded ankle exercise is allowed will be at the treating clinicianâs discretion but will be made prior to randomisation and will reflect their routine practice. This is a pragmatic trial so these co-interventions will not be specified; details of any will, however, be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs). At their routine two-week post-surgery clinic visit, participants will be randomised to either early or delayed weight-bearing.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Subsequent formal rehabilitation or adjunctive therapies will be left to the discretion of the treating clinician (e.g. referrals to physiotherapy). The type, frequency and duration of these will be recorded as part of the six weeks, four months and 12 months post-randomisation follow-ups.</p>

                <p id="Par63">The local clinical and research teams will be trained in providing standardised weight-bearing instructions to participants; this will include a written training guide with key points to reinforce. Participants will receive the instructions for weight-bearing in verbal and written form. They will be instructed to put as much weight through their affected leg as they feel comfortable and without causing pain. They will be informed that while they are allowed to walk on their operated leg, it does not mean they have to, or that they will feel able to immediately. They can continue to use the walking aids provided to them during their inpatient hospital stay, or they can discard them if they feel confident to walk without them at any point during the following four weeks.</p>

                <p id="Par65">Training of rehabilitation providers will be undertaken at each site by the WAX research team. The rehabilitation materials will be delivered using standardised verbal, written and/or electronic/online instructions. Adhering to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDIeR) checklist for description and replication of rehabilitation interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the initial rehabilitation instructions will be recorded on a rehabilitation CRF. In addition, the interactions between the clinician and trial participant will be recorded (verbal consent will be sought) and evaluated for at least one participant during the recruitment and intervention delivery phase of the trial at each recruitment centre. These recordings will be used to assess the level of success of the clinician to introduce the aims/rationale of either intervention strategy.</p>
                <p id="Par66">Objective measurement of weight-bearing through direct pedal pressure monitoring or gait assessment was deemed infeasible. Adherence assessment within this study will be based upon participant self-report.

                <p id="Par67">Safety reporting for each participant will begin at randomisation and will end when the participant has reached their final main follow up time point, at 12 months post-randomisation. When the local research team becomes aware of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) in a trial participant, the Principal Investigator (PI) will review the SAE locally and make a decision about the causality. All expected and related events shall be reported as complications rather than SAEs. For any SAEs assessed as unexpected and potentially related, the details of the event will be entered on an SAE reporting form on the database, and the local research team will notify the central team via email or telephone within 24 hours of the PI becoming aware of the event. Once the SAE form is received, causality will be confirmed by the Chief Investigator (CI) or delegate (Nominated Person). In the event that consensus is not reached between the PI and Nominated Person about assessment of causality and expectedness, this will be escalated to the CI for further discussion. All such events will be reported to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at their next meetings and to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) that issued favourable opinion within 15 working days. All participants experiencing SAEs will be followed up as per protocol until the end of the trial. As both groups are investigating procedures currently used in clinical practice, we will not be collecting unrelated SAEs.</p>

It has three domains related to ankle symptoms, lower limb-related activities, and overall function. It has nine items that add to give a score of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A difference of five points would represent someone who is able to walk upstairs without any difficulty compared to someone who could manage stairs, but with some difficulty.</p>

                <p id="Par78">The primary clinical outcome is OMAS at four months post-randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], as function has been shown to improve quickly in the first three months from surgery, improve little between three and six months and plateau thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated a minimally clinical important difference of 10 points for this instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] which is in accordance with expert opinion (for scales scoring 0-100) and statistical convention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We have selected a standard deviation (SD) of 21.1 based on the largest published RCT reporting OMAS within six months for operatively treated ankle fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Assuming a baseline SD (pre-injury) of 21.1 and a non-inferiority margin of -6 points on the OMAS, based upon data from the AIM trial, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] 392 participants providing data at four months (196 per arm) will provide 80% power and 2.5% (1-sided) significance. Allowing for 10% loss to follow-up (4.4% at six months in the AIM trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] this yields an overall minimum target of 436 participants (218 per arm).

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par80">A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) complete with full details of the statistical analyses planned for this study will be drafted and finalised prior to the primary outcome analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par81">Non-inferiority trials assess whether an intervention is not clinically worse than a control, and therefore the interest is one-sided. The OMAS score at four months post-randomisation is the primary outcome in this study and we have defined a non-inferiority margin (ÎT) of -6 points, which is the maximum difference we are prepared to tolerate and still consider early weight-bearing not to be clinically inferior to delayed weight-bearing. The null hypothesis is therefore that a difference of greater than ÎT exists in favour of delayed weight-bearing (H0: Î â¤ -ÎT). This will be assessed by creating a 95% confidence interval (95% CI), which should be entirely above the non-inferiority margin for the intervention to be declared non-inferior. As well as assessing if non-inferiority (and superiority) is demonstrated, sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to assess a range of potential biases that could have resulted from loss-to-follow-up, protocol deviations, withdrawal (including mortality).</p>
                  <p id="Par82">The result of the analysis for the primary endpoint should be one of the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par83">The 95% CI lies entirely above the non-inferiority margin (-Î<sub>T</sub>), so that non-inferiority may be concluded with only a small probability of error.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par84">The 95% CI includes points below the non-inferiority margin, then there is a possibility that the intervention is inferior to the control and non-inferiority cannot be safely concluded.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">The 95% CI is entirely above zero, indicative of a treatment effect, then superiority of the intervention can be concluded within a small probability of error.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">The 95% CI is entirely below the non-inferiority margin, indicative that the intervention is clinically inferior to the control.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par87">All analyses will be carried out on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and repeated for the per protocol population. Non-inferiority will be concluded only if both analyses show non-inferiority. This is due to the potential conservative nature of applying the ITT analysis only in a non-inferiority trial. A per-protocol analysis could introduce bias into the treatment comparison if there are differential numbers of protocol deviations in the different arms. Therefore, we will also undertake a Complier Average Causal Effect analysis which essentially compares the âcompliersâ in each group and is therefore randomisation preserving. This is therefore less prone to bias than a per-protocol analysis, although if the number of non-compliers is high this may affect the interpretation as the power is reduced for smaller subgroups (the compliers).</p>
                  <p id="Par88">The OMAS score will be compared between treatment groups as the dependent variable in a mixed-effects linear regression model for the primary analysis with adjustments for stratification factors and baseline (pre-injury) OMAS score. A random effect will be included to account for any heterogeneity in the response due to recruitment centre. Fixed effects will be included to adjust for participant age and gender.

                <title>Health economics evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par90">A prospective economic evaluation, conducted from an NHS and personal social services perspective, will be integrated into the trial design. The economic evaluation will estimate the difference in the cost of resource inputs used by participants in the two arms of the trial, allowing comparisons to be made between the two weight-bearing strategies following ankle fracture fixation and enabling costs and consequences to be compared. The economic assessment method will, as far as possible, adhere to the recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Reference Case.</p>
                <p id="Par91">Primary research methods will be followed to estimate the costs of the treatment options, including supplementary interventions (e.g. revision surgery) and rehabilitation inputs. Broader resource utilisation will be captured through to principal sources: (1) routine health service data collection systems and (2) patient questionnaires administered at baseline, six weeks and four and 12 months post-randomisation. Unit costs for health and social care resources will largely be derived from local and national sources and estimated in line with best practice. Primary research using established accounting methods may also be required to estimate unit costs. Costs will be standardised to current prices where possible. Health-related quality of life will be measured at baseline preinjury, six weeks, four and 12 months post randomisation using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L measure; responses will be used to generate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Utility weights will be estimated using recommended algorithms until a national tariff set for the EQ-5D-5L is available. We will in the first instance use self-reports of the EQ-5D measure. Where these data are not available, we will estimate health utilities at each time point using mapping equations between the OMAS and EQ-5D health outcomes on the basis of existing datasets held by the trial team.</p>
                <p id="Par92">Multiple imputation methods will be used to impute missing data and avoid biases associated with complete case analysis. The results of the economic evaluation will be expressed in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained. We shall use non-parametric bootstrap estimation to derive 95% CIs for mean cost differences between the trial groups and to calculate 95% CIs for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A series of sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the implications of uncertainty on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and to consider the broader issue of the generalisability of the study results. One such sensitivity analysis will involve adopting a societal perspective for the economic evaluation, which will incorporate direct costs to trial participants, informal care provided by family and friends and productivity losses. In the baseline analysis, and for each sensitivity analysis, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be constructed using the net-benefits approach. Heterogeneity in the trial population will be explored by formulating net-benefit values for trial participants from the observed costs and effects and then constructing a regression model with an intervention variable and covariates such as age and sex. The magnitude and significance of the coefficients on the interactions between the covariates and the intervention variable will provide estimates of cost-effectiveness of the treatment options by participant subgroup.</p>

                <p id="Par93">A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be set up. The study DSMC will adopt a DAMOCLES charter which defines its terms of reference and operation in relation to oversight of the trial. They will not be asked to perform any formal interim analyses of effectiveness. They will, however, review accruing data, summaries of the data presented by treatment group, and will assess the screening algorithm against the eligibility criteria. They will also consider emerging evidence from other related trials or research and review related SAEs that have been reported.</p>
                <p id="Par94">This study will be conducted as part of the portfolio of trials in the registered UKCRC Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU) at the University of Oxford. It will follow their Standard Operating Procedures ensuring compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki and any applicable regulatory requirements. The OCTRU Quality Assurance team will audit the trial at least once in the lifetime of the study, more if deemed necessary.</p>
