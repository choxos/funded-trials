                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In the UK, a compulsory ‘6-week hip check’ is performed in primary care for the detection of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). However, missed diagnoses and infants incorrectly labelled with DDH remain a problem, potentially leading to adverse consequences for infants, their families and the National Health Service. National policy states that infants should be referred to hospital if the 6-week check suggests DDH, though there is no available tool to aid examination or offer guidelines for referral. We developed standardised diagnostic criteria for DDH, based on international Delphi consensus, and a 9-item checklist that has the potential to enable non-experts to diagnose DDH in a manner approaching that of experts.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will conduct a controlled trial randomised by practice that will compare a diagnostic aid against standard care for the hip check. The primary objective is to determine whether an aid to the diagnosis of DDH reduces the number of clinically insignificant referrals from primary care to hospital and the number of late diagnosed DDH. The trial will include a qualitative process evaluation, an assessment of professional behavioural change and a full health economic evaluation. We will recruit 152 general practitioner practices in England. These will be randomised to conduct the hip checks with use of the study diagnostic aid and/or as per usual practice. The total number of infants seen during a 15-month recruitment period will be 110 per practice. Two years after the 6-week hip check, we will measure the number of referred infants that are (1) clinically insignificant for DDH and (2) those that constitute appropriate referrals.</p>

              <p>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is characterised by varying displacement of the proximal femur from the acetabulum with associated acetabular dysplasia. Dislocation occurs in 1–2/1000 infants per year but milder forms occur in 40–60/1000.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Early recognition of disease is associated with better outcomes. It is national policy<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> to examine all infants for the presence of DDH at birth and at age 6–8 weeks in primary care (6-week hip check). If diagnosed within the first 6–8 weeks, splinting of the hips is successful in 85% of cases.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Later diagnoses usually will require invasive treatment, with many years of continued monitoring.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Late diagnosed DDH is a common cause of medical negligence claims, with increased suffering for affected patients.</p>
              <p>Timely diagnoses of DDH remain a challenge despite the compulsory 6-week check.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In one study, the median age at diagnosis was 14 months, with only 40% of infants diagnosed during routine examinations and 60% presenting owing to parental concerns.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In another study, 30% of infants were not diagnosed by 12 weeks.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Because there is no further compulsory check after that at 6 weeks, it is vital that the 6-week check is effective. Also infants incorrectly identified with ‘DDH’ in primary care and referred to hospital remain a challenge for both families and National Health Service (NHS). This group does not require treatment and reassurance provided in primary care would avoid unnecessary anxiety and inefficient use of hospital resources. Of 1918 infants referred to hospital from primary care for DDH, only 64 (3%) had DDH<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but 1270 (66%) were identified as ‘DDH’ based on inappropriate criteria,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> for example, ‘crease asymmetry’ (n=234) or ‘click’ (n=648). If general practitioners (GPs) were able to discriminate better between benign abnormalities requiring reassurance (perhaps with a follow-up in primary care) and findings requiring referrals, outcomes of infants with and without DDH would improve.</p>
              <p>In prior research we suggested that too many diagnostic criteria<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and variability in the use of diagnostic criteria among clinicians<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> complicate the task of diagnosing DDH. We developed standardised diagnostic criteria to reduce the variability in assessment and management decisions in infants examined for DDH.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The weighted criteria demonstrated validity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In a study of 44 patients referred from GPs to hospital, the weighted criteria demonstrated a positive predictive value of 89% (95% CI 70% to 97%) and negative predictive value of 76% (95% CI 50% to 96%).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We refined these binary criteria, in form of a checklist with nine items, for use by GPs during the 6-week hip check and developed a training video, featuring a GP. This checklist and video were refined in a feasibility study which used qualitative methods to explore the acceptability of the format, style and delivery of the intervention (report available on request). The video explains the meaning of the diagnostic criteria; it also demonstrates how precisely to elicit the diagnostic criteria. For example, the video explains the difference between the Barlow and Ortolani manoeuvres, how to test for a leg length inequality or how to identify limitations in hip abduction.</p>

                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>Current referral patterns suggest there could be considerable health gains from improved diagnostic and referral decisions at the 6-week check.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> GPs, in a preparatory focus group, identified the need for a ‘comprehensive, structured guide’ for the 6-week check. Diagnostic aids enable physicians to overcome barriers in diagnostic reasoning<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> by shifting intuitive to analytical aspects of diagnostic reasoning. Decisions made under these circumstances approach normative reasoning and rationality more closely, and are more reliable and safer.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Building on our earlier research, we propose to facilitate GP’s diagnostic reasoning at the 6-week check by structuring current practice with use of a previously developed diagnostic aid. A diagnostic aid of this kind provides a structured approach to the assessment of infants and offers guidance about referrals.</p>

An internal pilot will be done in the first 4 months to ascertain accrual rates—we will progress to the main trial if we succeed in recruiting ≥12 practices per month (expected recruitment is ≥21 practices/month for the main trial). Incorporated in the trial are (1) a process evaluation investigating determinants of GPs’ referral behaviour and the implementation of the intervention in practice and (2) a health economic evaluation in a child’s lifetime.</p>

                <p>GP practices registered in England that carry out 6-week hip checks (at age 42–76 days) and agree (1) to being randomised and (2) to hospitals releasing data concerning infants they examine in the trial.

                <p>We anticipate that ≥110 infants per year will undergo the 6-week hip check in each of the recruited practices. Each practice will recruit infants for a period of 15 months and infants will be followed for 2 years. This trial is planned therefore to run for 44 months across 152 GP practices.</p>

                <title>Definitions for the purpose of this trial</title>
                <p>‘Appropriate referral’ denotes a referred hip deemed 'clinically significant', that is, is treated or monitored (at least one follow-up) by a specialist surgeon. Any ambiguous cases will be reviewed by our expert advisory panel who will assign an ultimate diagnosis in consensus. ‘Clinically insignificant’ are referred hips resulting in reassurance and discharge from surgeons’ clinics (ie, no treatment or monitoring). ‘Late diagnoses’ are cases of DDH diagnosed by a specialist surgeon at age 3–24 months.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref></p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>We based its calculation on Poisson regression and audit data from the Nottingham area (partially presented in Price <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and University College Hospital (audit of 3 years’ practice, unpublished data): a conservative estimate of the number of infants referred as a consequence of the 6-week check within the recruitment period of 1 year is, on average, 3 per practice. Based on the same data, we estimate that about one in three (or, on average, one per practice) of such referrals is correctly made (‘appropriate’ referrals, defined above as ‘clinically significant’, are a subset of these ‘correct’ referrals). Thus, on average, we expect 2 ‘incorrect’ referrals per practice. These are the ones we seek to reduce, and the intervention should serve to cut them by 50%. Thus we aim to detect a reduction, on average, from 3 to 2 referrals per practice in the intervention arm. To account for correlation within practices, which can also be thought of as overdispersion relative to the underlying Poisson variation, we assumed a between-practice component of variance of 20% of the average Poisson ‘counting’ variance per practice. For 90% statistical power and testing two sided at p=0.05, we need 76 practices per group (15% of this total comprises a safety margin to allow for potential challenges). Average referral rates from the Nottingham (2.8%) and University College Hospital data (2.7%) are very consistent, and suggest a target of about 110 children per practice per year to undergo the 6-week check.</p>

                <p>Number of referred infants that are considered ‘clinically insignificant’—this is a measure of the clinical importance of referrals in the 2-week hip pathway. We chose this outcome because it is extremely relevant clinically and one for which it is possible to power the trial.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> An intervention could be successful at achieving this outcome while missing infants who do have DDH; we thus specified a principal secondary endpoint.

Because of the nature of these data the conventional concept of missingness does not directly apply (eg, we will not have individually randomised subjects who cannot be followed up). However, if a practice withdraws from the trial, we will explore the consequences of this action by assuming a poor outcome among that practice if in the intervention group and a good outcome if in the control condition, to identify the potential consequences of their withdrawal. Complete case analyses will be conducted for secondary outcomes. If there is a mismatch between practices in the two treatment conditions, we will consider undertaking joint models examining simultaneously the binomial of missingness and the outcome measure of interest.</p>

                <p>Since this effectiveness trial will test whether the intervention can work under usual circumstances, we will rely on paediatric orthopaedic surgeons in determining the ultimate diagnosis of DDH. Variations in the surgeons’ diagnostic accuracy are inevitable hence the need for a randomised study. We will perform analyses by surgeon (or hospital) to quantify this variation. Blinding of GPs, practice staff, carers is impossible; however, most such outcomes will be assessed with validated questionnaires. Primary and principal secondary endpoints will be collected by an independent researcher blinded to treatment allocation. In case an infant is referred to hip ultrasound without an orthopaedic consultation, a trial-appointed advisory panel shall review the scan blinded and according to standard methods<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> to avoid reporting bias. There is a risk for verification bias—while our trial includes a 2-year follow-up to capture late presenting DDH, we cannot rule out that some infants with DDH will remain undiagnosed within this period, thus underestimating the number of late diagnosed DDH. However, the 2-year mark has previously been found to be a robust outcome.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This trial is part of a programme of research to improve the diagnosis of DDH: consensus-based diagnostic criteria were established in prior research, tailored for use in primary care, supplemented by a video designed for GPs. There has only been one randomised trial on the topic of DDH in the UK<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> but it explored the use of ultrasound screening—our trial focusses on the compulsory ‘6-week check’. Because the intervention tested in this trial is based on consensus of clinical experts, there is a risk that the opinions of experts change as clinical knowledge evolves. However, the criteria of the diagnostic aid have been in use for decades and will likely not loose relevance in the foreseeable future. The collection of outcome data from various hospitals connected to GP practices will be challenging; use of national health services databases should mitigate this challenge. While our trial includes a 2-year follow-up period to capture late presenting DDH, we cannot rule out that some infants with DDH will remain undiagnosed within this period. This trial has the potential to improve the compulsory 6-week hip check with use of a relatively simple intervention. It will also provide an understanding of the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in a whole lifetime horizon of a 6-week old. If successful, the intervention can be rolled out to clinical services relatively easily and at low costs.</p>
