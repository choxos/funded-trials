                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Previous trials finding an effect of self-monitoring on weight loss have considered the effect to be mediated by self-regulatory processes. However, a qualitative think-aloud study asking people to record thoughts and feelings during weighing showed that self-regulation occurs only rarely without further instruction. The aim of this trial is to test a novel intervention guiding people through the self-regulatory processes to see whether it facilitates weight loss.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analyses</title>
                  <p>A parallel group, randomised controlled trial will be conducted to test the concept that a self-regulation intervention for weight loss increases weight loss compared with daily self-weighing without further support. One hundred participants with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> will be randomised to either the control or intervention group. The control group will be asked to weigh themselves daily for 8 weeks, the intervention group will be encouraged to follow the self-regulation intervention. They will be prompted to weigh daily, track their weight using an app, plan daily actions for weight loss and reflect on their action plans on a weekly basis. This self-regulation cycle will allow them to experiment with different weight loss strategies and identify effective and sustainable actions. Primary and process outcomes will be measured at baseline and 8 weeks’ follow-up. Linear regression analysis of the primary outcome, weight change, will assess the early effectiveness of the intervention. The process outcomes liking, perceived effectiveness, as well as usage and barriers with regard to the self-regulation intervention, will be assessed through qualitative analysis of follow-up interviews and quantitative analysis of adherence rates and responses to a final questionnaire.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Self-monitoring of weight is often employed in multicomponent weight loss interventions, as evidence suggests it aids weight loss.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref> The weight loss effect has often been ascribed to a self-regulation mechanism, based on the hypothesis that self-monitoring triggers self-regulation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4–6</xref> In this context, self-regulation occurs in iterative cycles, starting by (1) contextualising the weight with previous measurements and goals, thus providing (2) an opportunity to reflect on previous behaviour and reinforce successful actions, enabling (3) the planning of actions to reach the goal, followed by (4) the performance of planned actions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> This cycle of processes allows for experimentation with different weight loss techniques, helping the user to build a personal portfolio of effective and sustainable strategies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p>
              <p>A study employing self-weighing as a standalone intervention did not find a significant weight loss effect, raising the question whether self-regulation is performed naturally after weighing or whether additional weight loss treatment components are necessary.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We addressed this question in a think-aloud study, where twenty-four participants were asked to record their thoughts and feelings during daily weighing for 8 weeks, without being prompted to self-regulate.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> On 90% of occasions, participants contextualised their weight measurement, and on 58% participants reflected on previous behaviours. Only on 20% of occasions did participants plan actions and specific action planning, defining a concrete action and time plan, was rare (6%). The frequency of specific action planning was, however, significantly predictive of weight loss. Hence, the study provided support to the notion that completing the last step of the self-regulation process can elicit weight loss. However, the think-aloud study also showed that self-regulation does not occur autonomously, and that people need support in developing self-regulation skills, especially action planning. Self-regulation, once learnt, has the potential to be a weight loss strategy that is performed autonomously and sustainably. It provides an opportunity for remote weight loss interventions that do not require resource-intensive support from healthcare providers.</p>
              <p>Several weight loss interventions including self-regulation components have been developed over the years. Some educate their users about self-regulation theory without providing active support for the key component—specific action planning.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4 13 14</xref> Others support users in action planning, but fail to imitate the iterative nature of self-regulation, as they do not allow the usage of self-monitoring feedback for adaptations to the action plans,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref> thus disabling self-regulation. Some interventions guide participants through iterative reformulation of action plans following self-monitoring feedback, but are delivered through face-to-face sessions,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> which are resource-intensive and not easily rolled out at large scale. Other interventions incorporating action planning dictate which actions participants are supposed to follow,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 21 22</xref> which might reduce goal ownership, a significant predictor of goal engagement and attrition.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> Notwithstanding these critiques, seven of the eleven studies cited here found significant weight loss, suggesting that components targeting the self-regulation cycle can enhance weight loss, encouraging further work in this area. Our critiques highlight the need for an intervention that guides participants through the whole and iterative self-regulation process in an autonomous, low-cost and scalable manner. Furthermore, since many interventions add self-regulation elements to a broader spectrum of weight loss treatment components,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 17 25–27</xref> a study testing self-regulation as a standalone intervention is needed to investigate whether iterative self-regulation is sufficient to achieve weight loss.</p>
              <p>With this study we aim to test the proof of concept of an intervention aiming to address this gap in the literature. The PREVAIL intervention (<italic>P</italic>eople <italic>RE</italic>gulating themsel<italic>V</italic>es to <italic>A</italic>chieve we<italic>I</italic>ght <italic>L</italic>oss) is a weight loss programme guiding people through the iterative self-regulation process. It encourages users to experiment with different weight loss approaches, and use the self-regulation mechanism to find their ideal set of tools.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this trial is to test the concept whether an intervention which trains individuals in self-regulatory processes, aids early weight loss in comparison to unsupported daily weighing. Other objectives pertain to the evaluation of usage and effectiveness of the self-regulation intervention components, as well as the qualitative analysis of participant experiences of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>An individually randomised, two arm, parallel group design will be employed, assessing superiority of the self-regulation intervention over daily self-weighing alone. Participation will last 8 weeks. This length was deemed sufficient to assess early effectiveness of the intervention, as previous studies have been able to detect weight loss effects after 2 months.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> If the results are promising, the data will provide good evidence to justify conducting a longer-term randomised controlled trial. Participants will attend two study visits, one at baseline and one after the end of the eighth week of the intervention. The primary outcome will be weight change. The study will take place in Oxfordshire, UK, and run between April and October 2019.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Two to four general practitioner (GP) practices around Oxford, UK, will function as participant identification centres and search their health records to identify suitable patients for the trial (age ≥18 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The GP will screen the search list and exclude patients who would be inappropriate to invite, including terminally ill or violent patients. Suitable patients will be sent an invitation letter from their GP. They will be encouraged to contact the research team if they are interested in taking part. GPs may also identify suitable patients during routine consultations. We will ask practices not to refer participants to commercial weight loss programmes, other obesity clinics or bariatric surgery, while they are enrolled as participants in this trial.</p>

                  <p>Participants will be asked to weigh themselves every morning after waking using standard body scales (Etekcity, California, USA) provided to them. In addition, they will be prompted to complete tasks which speak to the different steps of the self-regulation process, including (1) contextualising the weight measurement, (2) reflecting on behaviour and (3) planning weight loss actions. The individual tasks and their development are described in more detail below. Input from members of the public was sought at several stages of the intervention development.</p>

                      <p>Contextualising: In the think-aloud study participants struggled memorising daily measurements and keeping an overview of their weight loss progress, which impeded their ability to use weight measurements as constructive feedback. Participants stated they would have benefited from a weight tracking tool. Therefore, to support participants in contextualising their weight measurements, we will encourage them to use the app ‘Weight Loss Tracker, BMI’ by aktiWir GmbH. Research shows that digital tracking devices can significantly increase adherence to self-monitoring,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> perhaps because the visualisation of progress and feedback on weight loss success provides motivation and keeps users on track with their goals.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>

                      <p>Reflecting: The think-aloud study showed that participants struggled to interpret day-to-day weight changes due to daily fluctuations that were not caused by fat loss or gain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We therefore decided to encourage reflection on a weekly rather than daily basis. Participants will receive weekly emails with feedback on their weekly weight trends, asking them to complete an online questionnaire (Qualtrics, USA). The questionnaire will prompt reflection on the relationship between behaviours performed throughout the week and weight change observed. Participants will be asked to use this insight to evaluate the use of the weight loss actions they had performed throughout the week.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Action Planning: We aimed to strike a balance between ensuring that participants choose appropriate actions and allowing them to choose actions themselves, as lack of goal ownership predicts attrition.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Participants will therefore choose one weight loss action per day from a list of 53 actions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 1</xref>). To create the actions list, we first identified weight loss actions from effective weight loss interventions in the literature. These were reviewed, adapted and complemented during iterative brainstorming sessions with an interdisciplinary expert team, comprised of dietitians, GPs and psychologists. The rationale for daily action plans was twofold: (1) allowing participants to adapt their actions flexibly to their day and (2) giving participants exposure to a wider range of strategies. Based on action planning and implementation intention research, which shows that the specificity of action plans increases likelihood of implementation,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33–35</xref> we will ask participants to specify where, when and how they will perform their chosen action, which cues they will use, which barriers they might experience and how they will deal with them.</p>
                      <p>As participants only reflect on their behaviour on a weekly basis, we grouped the actions conceptually into seven categories, five of which cover diet-related actions and two of which cover physical activity-related actions. Participants will be asked to choose one category at the beginning of the week, and choose daily actions from this category for the rest of the week. Weekly behaviour reflection will therefore focus on the effectiveness of a category of actions. Taken together, the reflection and action planning process shall enable participants to experiment with different weight loss approaches and decide on their effectiveness and usefulness based on trends in weight data. At the beginning of weeks two through eight of the intervention, participants will be prompted to commit to some of the actions of previous weeks, as the performance of several weight loss actions increases chances for weight loss. Action planning support will be provided through daily questionnaires (Qualtrics, USA), which will be sent to participants every morning via email.</p>

<italic>lanning:</italic> Participants will receive a daily questionnaire helping them to plan a weight loss action. The questionnaire will start by asking participants to enter their morning weight. At the beginning of first week, they will then be asked to choose a category of actions, and they will be able to choose one of the actions within this category per day for the rest of the week. There are seven categories in total, five covering diet-related actions and two covering physical activity-related actions. Participants will be asked to specify for each action how, when and where they are going to perform it, and which cues they are going to use. They will also be prompted to think about how to overcome potential barriers. At the start of weeks 2 through 8, participants will be encouraged to try out a new category of actions. We will additionally ask participants on a weekly basis to commit to continuing some of the actions they tried out in previous weeks. In order to help participants to maintain an overview of the actions they performed so far, we will provide them with a non-digital action plan diary.<break/>
<italic>Report email:</italic> Once a week, participants will receive an email from the research team, informing them about their trend weight change for the last week.

On the basis of this evaluation, participants will be able to decide which actions they want to continue doing in the next weeks, and which ones to drop. Using this method of self-experimentation, participants will be able to try and test different weight-loss strategies and identify the ones that are effective and sustainable for them.</td>

                  <p>Participants in the control group will be instructed to self-weigh daily and see what daily weighing motivates them to do. They will not receive any further instructions. By using this comparator group, we want to test whether the self-regulation process can enhance self-weighing to be an effective weight loss tool. Participants will receive smart scales (BodyTrace, New York) which are equipped with a SIM card and automatically transfer measurements to a secure server via the 3G/4G network. This will allow us to assess adherence to daily weighing in the control group.</p>

                <title>Patients and public involvement</title>
                <p>Members of the public were involved in the design of the study at several stages. After creating the invitation letter, PIS, informed consent form, semi-structured interview guide and the baseline, daily, weekly and follow-up questionnaires for the PREVAIL intervention, we asked members of the public for feedback. Our department has a panel of &gt;100 members of the public with an interest in weight management. Based on phone calls with members of this panel we were able to make the materials clearer and more concise. The manual, explaining the intervention in detail, was further discussed with members of the panel in a focus group session. As a result of this focus group session, the manual was professionally edited to be shorter. We also added figures and graphs to present the procedures of the study more visually. The panel helped to revise the explanations of the different action plans.</p>
                <p>A test run of 4 weeks was conducted with five members of the department, who are not otherwise involved in this study. They provided feedback on the running of the intervention which, among other outcomes, led to the creation of a reminder email which will be sent out before the start of the intervention.</p>
                <p>No members of the public will be involved in conducting or analysing the study. However, we will gather input on the most suitable and effective ways to disseminate our research findings to the public.</p>

                <p>The statistical analysis of the primary outcome, effectiveness of the intervention for weight loss, will be carried out on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT). That is, after randomisation, participants will be analysed according to their allocated intervention group. We will endeavour to obtain full follow-up data on every participant to allow full ITT analysis. A linear regression, predicting weight at 8 weeks’ follow-up while adjusting for baseline weight and GP practice, will assess the effect of condition.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> We will assess the sensitivity of the analysis to different assumptions about missing data using a variety of imputation methods, including baseline observation carried forward analysis and an analysis of participants completing follow-up. A final analysis will impute the last home-measured weight for people who did not attend the final follow-up. All tests will be done at a 5% two-sided significance level.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes will be analysed in several ways. Adherence rates will be assessed and compared between the experimental and control condition. Moderator analyses will assess the effect of adherence, highest educational qualification, liking of weighing at baseline, and overall intervention rating at follow-up (only intervention condition) on weight change.</p>
                <p>Further exploratory analyses may be added post-hoc based on preliminary findings. The statistical analysis plan can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary appendix 2</xref>.</p>

                <p>The day-to-day management and operation of the study will be coordinated by KF. A Trial Management Group (TMG), consisting of the authors of this paper, will have oversight of the trial. The TMG will be responsible for the monitoring of all aspects of the trial’s conduct and progress and will ensure that the protocol is adhered to and that appropriate action is taken to safeguard participants and the quality of the trial itself.

                <p>This is a low risk trial where it is implausible that the intervention will lead to differences in the occurrence of adverse events so we decided that it was inappropriate to burden participants to collect and record these.</p>

                <p>Data will be kept in accordance with GCP, the Data Protection Act 2018 and General Data Protection Regulation. Two separate databases will be created, one containing all participant identifiable information, the other capturing all outcome data in an anonymised manner, using a unique participant ID. Weight, height and body composition measurements will be entered into the second database by the researcher. Data from the online questionnaires will be downloaded from Qualtrics and added to the second database. The two databases as well as the anonymised recordings and transcriptions from follow-up interviews will be stored on the secure departmental drive and will only be accessible by members of the TMG. After a lay summary of results has been sent out to participants, the database with participant identifiable data will be destroyed. We will retain the anonymised database for future secondary analyses.</p>
                <p>Direct access to study data will be granted to authorised representatives from the sponsor for monitoring and/or audit of the study to ensure compliance with regulations. This access, the reason for it and who has authorised it will be recorded by the TMG. Otherwise, confidentiality will be maintained and no-one outside the TMG will have access to the database.</p>

On completion of the trial, KF will submit an End of Study notification and final report tothese institutions.</p>
                <p>We intend to publish the results of this study in peer-reviewed journals, regardless of the nature of the outcome. Authorship will be determined in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines. We will also present our findings at national and international conferences, and publicise our publications through the departments’ online presence. Participants will be informed of the trial results through an information sheet prepared for a lay audience. We will also inform our patients and public involvement panel members about the findings of the study through their regular newsletter.</p>
