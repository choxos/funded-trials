                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. This Phase I, randomized, observer-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluated an investigational vaccine against RSV (ChAd155-RSV) using the viral vector chimpanzee-adenovirus-155, encoding RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid, and transcription antitermination proteins.</p>

                <sec id="s0101">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Healthy 18â€“45-year-old adults received ChAd155-RSV, a placebo, or an active control (Bexsero) at Days (D) 0 and 30. An escalation from a low dose (5 Ã— 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles) to a high dose (5 Ã— 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) occurred after the first 16 participants. Endpoints were solicited/unsolicited and serious adverse events (SAEs), biochemical/hematological parameters, cell-mediated immunogenicity by enzyme-linked immunospot, functional neutralizing antibodies, anti RSV-F immunoglobin (Ig) G, and ChAd155 neutralizing antibodies.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There were 7 participants who received the ChAd155-RSV low dose, 31 who received the ChAd155-RSV high dose, 19 who received the placebo, and 15 who received the active control. No dose-related toxicity or attributable SAEs at the 1-year follow-up were observed. The RSV-A neutralizing antibodies geometric mean titer ratios (post/pre-immunization) following a high dose were 2.6 (D30) and 2.3 (D60). The ratio of the fold-rise (D0 to D30) in anti-F IgG over the fold-rise in RSV-Aâ€“neutralizing antibodies was 1.01. At D7 after the high dose of the study vaccine, the median frequencies of circulating B-cells secreting anti-F antibodies were 133.3/10<sup>6</sup> (IgG) and 16.7/10<sup>6</sup> (IgA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The median frequency of RSV-Fâ€“specific interferon Î³â€“secreting T-cells after a ChAd155-RSV high dose was 108.3/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs at D30, with no increase after the second dose.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The global incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated acute lower respiratory tract infections in 2015 was estimated at 33 million cases in children younger than 5 years, with 10% requiring hospital admission and with up to 59 600 deaths, most of which occurred in developing countries [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. By the age of 3 years, over 85% to 100% of children have been infected. Furthermore, infection with RSV does not convey persistent immunity and reinfection is common [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
            <p>Whereas the severity of infection tends to decrease with age, there is evidence that RSV respiratory infections in early childhood could be associated with long-term wheezing and asthma [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The health and economic costs due to RSV infections keeps RSV a priority target for vaccine development.</p>
            <p>While the induction of effective antibodies against RSV is a fundamental mechanism to confer protection in the host [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the incomplete comprehension of the immune mechanism associated with RSV infection remains an obstacle for the development of a safe and effective vaccine. In the late 1960s, a formalin-inactivated whole virus RSV vaccine tested in clinical trials led to enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) in infants, causing a predisposition to an exacerbated immunopathology attributable to an induction of low-quality, non-neutralizing antibodies and a strongly biased Th2-like immune response on exposure to a natural infection [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7â€“9</xref>]. This experience has led to heightened safety concerns with pediatric RSV vaccine candidates.</p>
            <p>A vaccine based on recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying relevant RSV antigens, mobilizing both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune response, is considered a potential solution to induce a balanced and effective immune response against RSV virus in a naive population [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Chimpanzee-derived adenoviruses are good potential vector candidates for multiple infectious agents, as they are well tolerated in human clinical trials, are weakly neutralized by human sera, and have potent immunogenicity, mainly Th1-directed [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11â€“15</xref>].</p>
            <p>Accordingly, a new RSV vaccine is being developed for pediatric use, based on 3 RSV viral proteins encoded by chimpanzee-derived adenovector 155 (ChAd155-RSV). This investigational vaccine contains the fusion (F) protein, which is a major surface antigen and the main target of the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the nucleocapsid (N) and antitermination (M2-1) internal proteins, both known to be sources of many T cell epitopes, for the induction of cell-mediated immunity [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
            <p>The purpose of this first-in-human clinical trial in healthy adults was to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ChAd155-RSV.</p>

                <title>Study Vaccines and Administration</title>
                <p>The investigational ChAd155-RSV vaccine is a replicant-deficient recombinant viral vector manufactured using a synthetic DNA fragment from multiple strains encoding for protein F, with deletions from the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic regions (F0Î”TM), N, and M2-1. The vaccination regimen was 2 intramuscular injections of 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> (low dose [LD]; ChAd155-RSV-LD group) or 5 Ã— 10<sup>10</sup> (high dose [HD]; ChAd155-RSV-HD group) viral particles in the deltoid of the nondominant arm, according to a 0, 1-month schedule (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup10">Supplementary Methods</xref> for the determination of viral particle concentration).</p>
                <p>A placebo (saline) group was included as a control for the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity assessments. The use of a group B meningococcal vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero, GSK), was included as an active control. This was administered at the same 0, 1-month schedule, allowing the maintenance of blinding throughout the trial.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 2 doses of ChAd155-RSV, administered in a 0, 1-month schedule, up to 30 days after Dose 2. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the cell-mediated immunogenicity of ChAd155-RSV up to 30 days after Dose 2 and safety up to the study conclusion (Day [D] 360). Tertiary objectives included an assessment of functional antibody titers and evaluation of adenoviral presence in blood up to 30 days after Dose 2, the occurrence of RSV infections up to D360, and further exploratory immunology to detect vaccine-related immune responses, such as specific CD4/CD8 T cell determinations by intracellular cytokine staining/fluorescence-activated cell sorting (ICS/FACS) or antivector immunity.</p>
                <p>This was a Phase I, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study with 3 parallel groups in a 3-step staggered design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Details of randomization and progression through each step of the study are outlined in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup10">Supplementary Methods</xref>. Given the different appearances and storage conditions of the investigational RSV vaccine, placebo, and active control, double blinding was not possible; therefore, administrators of the vaccine were not blinded, whilst participants, staff undertaking clinical evaluations, and laboratory staff were blinded (observer blind). Participants were recruited at the Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, between July 2015 and January 2016.</p>

                <p>Study visits for safety evaluations occurred on D0 and D30, with 9 additional visits up to D360. Safety data included specified, solicited symptoms, collected by diary cards during D0â€“6 after each vaccination; unsolicited adverse events (AEs), collected up to 30 days after each vaccination; and serious AEs (SAEs), until the end of the study. Blood samples for the evaluation of biochemical and/or hematological parameters were taken at each study visit. Food and Drug Administration toxicity grading scales for hematology and biochemistry parameters were used [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Symptoms were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Adenoviral presence in whole blood was measured by DNA polymerase chain reaction at D0, D1, D3, D7, D30, D31, D33, D37, and D60. Passive RSV surveillance was performed during the study. If a participant developed respiratory symptoms at any point after Dose 1, a nasal swab was taken to test for RSV infection by polymerase chain reaction.</p>

                <p>Cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated at the prevaccination (D0), post-Dose 1 (D7 and D30), and post-Dose 2 (D37 and D60) time points. The frequency of interferon (IFN) Î³â€“secreting T-cells, of anti-F immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and/or of IgA antibody-secreting B-cells were obtained by ELISpot [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
                <p>Further exploratory tests were performed to detect vaccine-related immune responses, such as specific CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell determinations by ICS/FACS, identified after in vitro stimulation as CD4+/CD8+ T cells expressing interleukin 2, IFN-Î³, interleukin 4, and MIP-1Î².</p>
                <p>Humoral immune responses were assessed by determination of NAb titers against RSV-A at D0, D30, and D60 by a plaque-reducing, neutralizing test, with further characterization of palivizumab-competing antibody and anti-RSV-F IgG results by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-ChAd155 NAb were also measured as a tertiary objective.</p>

              <p>There were 72 participants who received the study vaccine, placebo, or active control as allocated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). There were 17 participants who withdrew prior to the end of the trial. Of these, all received 2 doses of the study vaccine, apart from 2 participants in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group: 1 each withdrew after D1 and D7. There was 1 participant in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group who withdrew at D37, and all the other 14 withdrawals occurred after reaching the safety endpoint at D60. No participants withdrew due to AEs; however, 1 participant in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group declined the second dose of the vaccine due to an oral temperature of 39Â°C following the first dose, but continued with safety and immunogenicity tests through the duration of the study. There were 66 participants included in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

No clear booster effect was observed following the second dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

No increase was observed following administration of ChAd155-RSV-LD, placebo, or active control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). At 7 days after the first ChAd155-RSV-HD administration, the median frequency of RSV-Fâ€“specific IgG antibodyâ€“secreting B-cells (per million PBMCs) was 133.3 (IQR 56.7â€“240.0), and 7 days after the second dose the median was 1 (IQR 1â€“5) per million PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, B-cells secreting anti-F IgA increased to a median value of 16.7 (IQR 5â€“30) at D7 after the first dose of ChAd155-RSV-HD. No further effect on this cell population was observed after the second dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

                  <p>To further characterize the cellular immune response of ChAd155-RSV, the functional phenotype of vaccine-induced T cells by ICS was tested. However, the frequencies of T cells measured were not consistently sufficient to draw a robust conclusion regarding CD4+ or CD8+ T cell compositions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">2</xref>).</p>

                  <p>All participants showed preexisting antiâ€“RSV-A NAb at baseline (â‰¥8 estimated dilution [ED] 60), with geometric mean titers (GMT) ranging from 346 (placebo) to 606 (ChAd155-RSV-LD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). At 30 days after the first dose, NAb GMTs were 2.4-fold (95% CI 0.9â€“6.7) and 2.6-fold (95% CI 1.8â€“3.6) higher than baseline for the ChAd155-RSV-LD and ChAd155-RSV-HD groups, respectively. The D30 GMT was 1474 (95% CI 1090â€“1993) in the ChAd155-RSV-LD group and 1293 (95% CI 835â€“2003) in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). No further increase was observed after the second dose.

As shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 57.7% of participants in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group met the vaccine response definition for NAb following the first vaccine dose; no further increase in this proportion was observed after the second dose. In 3 participants (16%) in the placebo group, we observed increases in Nab, which may have been secondary to asymptomatic RSV reinfections.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The results from this first-in-human study show that immunization with ChAd155-RSV is able to generate specific cellular and humoral immune responses, is well tolerated, and has no significant safety concerns. Solicited symptoms following ChAd155-RSV administration were generally mild to moderate in severity, were transient, and were consistent with those previously reported in similar studies with adenoviral vectored vaccines [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>It has been previously reported that NAbs are insufficient to prevent reinfection with RSV, but they can reduce the risks of RSV-associated severe diseases and hospitalization [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accordingly, the observed humoral immune response following the administration of ChAd155-RSV-HD is encouraging. ChAd155-RSV was able to induce more than a 2-fold increase in NAb titers, and approximately 60% of participants in the ChAd155-RSV-HD group met the predefined criteria for a vaccine response. This is despite RSV-specific serum preexisting antibodies being present in all participants, reflecting the universality of RSV infections throughout life. The evidence of high titers of preexisting antibodies may explain the lack of immune responses in the 40% of our study population.</p>
              <p>In healthy adults protected against severe RSV respiratory disease, the majority of the NAb repertoire is directed against the prefusion conformation of the RSV-F protein [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A potential limitation of the study is that the conformation of the F protein encoded by the ChAd155-RSV vaccine and its expression after vaccination have not been fully determined. However, it was important to explore whether immunization with ChAd155-RSV generates functional antibodies, especially as the antibodies induced by the formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine linked to ERD were not neutralizing [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Reassuringly, the geometric mean ratio between the fold-rise of antiâ€“RSV-F antibodies of IgG and the fold-rise of antiâ€“RSV-A NAb titers was close to 1 after the first and second doses in the ChAd155-RSV-HD groups, indicating that neutralizing antibodies are proportionally induced, as compared to total F Abs [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The potential risk of ERD can also be minimized by the induction of a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response, given that a strongly biased Th2-like immune response to the FI-RSV vaccine was also linked to ERD upon RSV exposure [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is a potential strength of the adenoviral vaccines [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. After the first dose of ChAd155-RSV-HD, a tendency towards increases in RSV-Fâ€“, -Nâ€“, and -M2-1â€“specific IFN-Î³ secreting T cells was observed, suggesting a Th1-directed immunogenicity. No increase was observed following the low dose of the study vaccine, the placebo, or the active control. While these data (along with evidence of NAb production) are in line with preclinical data showing no evidence of ERD from ChAd155-RSV immunization in mice, cotton rats, and bovine calves [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], they should be interpreted with the caveat that our study population had prior exposure to RSV, which was a significant factor that conferred protection to ERD in older infants following FI-RSV.</p>
              <p>The anti-RSV immune responses observed following immunization with ChAd155-RSV were seen despite the presence at baseline of antibodies cross-reactive to the viral vector in some of the adult participants, which was observed to reduce the induction of anti-RSV NAb. This, combined with the preexisting immunity to RSV, may explain the diminished response to the second vaccine dose. These high rates of baseline immunity may reflect a limitation of this study; namely, that it was conducted in adults rather than the target population of infants, who were likely to have low levels of immunity to both RSV and ChAd155. RSV infection in adults can be asymptomatic, and the number of volunteers reinfected during the study may have been underestimated. However, the peak of RSV season in the United Kingdom in 2015â€“2016 occurred before the majority of participants were enrolled in the HD group, where no RSV reinfections were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The safety and immune responses to 2 doses of ChAd155-RSV in 12- to 23-month-old children seropositive for RSV are currently being studied in clinical trial NCT02927873, providing a crucial step towards the evaluation of this vaccine in RSV-naive infants: the group most likely to benefit from protection.</p>
              <p>Another limitation to the study is the high number of withdrawals (17; 24%); however, none of these were for AEs, and all but 3 provided safety data at D60 following the second vaccine dose.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that in adults previously naturally exposed to RSV, ChAd155-RSV generates increases in specific humoral and cellular immune responses without raising significant safety concerns.</p>
