                <p id="Par1">The immune mechanisms mediating COVID-19 vaccine attenuation of COVID-19 remain undescribed. We conducted comprehensive analyses detailing immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus in blood post-vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a placebo. Samples from randomised placebo-controlled trials (NCT04324606 and NCT04400838) were taken at baseline, onset of COVID-19-like symptoms, and 7 days later, confirming COVID-19 using nucleic amplification test (NAAT test) via real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Serum cytokines were measured with multiplexed immunoassays. The transcriptome was analysed with long, short and small RNA sequencing. We found attenuation of RNA inflammatory signatures in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 compared with placebo vaccinees and reduced levels of serum proteins associated with COVID-19 severity. <italic>KREMEN1</italic>, a putative alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, was downregulated in placebo compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees. Vaccination ameliorates reductions in cell counts across leukocyte populations and platelets noted at COVID-19 onset, without inducing potentially deleterious Th2-skewed immune responses. Multi-omics integration links a global reduction in miRNA expression at COVID-19 onset to increased pro-inflammatory responses at the mRNA level. This study reveals insights into the role of COVID-19 vaccines in mitigating disease severity by abrogating pro-inflammatory responses associated with severe COVID-19, affirming vaccine-mediated benefit in breakthrough infection, and highlighting the importance of clinically relevant endpoints in vaccine evaluation.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Vaccines have been instrumental in preventing morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Within the first year of their implementation, an estimated 14 to 18 million deaths were averted through vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As of February 2023, over 5.5 billion people have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine, altering the course of the pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The success of COVID-19 vaccine programmes belies initial uncertainty surrounding when, or even if, an effective vaccine would be found. Failure rates in vaccine development are very high; some pathogens still have no licensed vaccines despite decades of work (e.g., HIV and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>). Furthermore, preclinical animal studies of vaccines against other coronavirus have raised theoretical safety concerns related to certain types of vaccines that could result in non-protective and potentially detrimental or disease-enhancing immune responses following coronavirus exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, this adverse phenomenology has not subsequently been observed in preclinical, clinical or post-implementation vaccine safety data of COVID-19 vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Although SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, with new variants emerging, breakthrough COVID-19 in vaccinated individuals is typically milder than in immunologically naïve unvaccinated individuals, despite viral loads sometimes being similar between the groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The immune mechanisms mediating disease attenuation are poorly understood, and this lack of understanding makes optimal vaccination policies (e.g., booster vaccine campaigns) aimed at minimising illness severity in the post-vaccination era challenging.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Recent studies use a plethora of contemporary methodologies to provide a detailed picture of the immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 at varying disease severities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, there is a paucity of detailed evaluation of how vaccination modifies these immunological responses in the absence of sterilising immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The phase 1 to 3 randomised single-blind controlled trials of the ChAdOx1-nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) offer a unique opportunity to explore how ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination influences the immune response during breakthrough infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Here we analyse the whole-blood coding, non-coding and small-noncoding transcriptome, and serum cytokines and chemokines to give a high-resolution description of immune responses during COVID-19 in ChAdOx1 nCoV19 or placebo (MenACWY) vaccinated participants. We also compare COVID-19 immune responses to non-covid infections with similar symptomology to give further insights into COVID-19-specific immune responses. Our study characterises the beneficial immune response conferred by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine during breakthrough infection at the fine molecular level. The study addresses a knowledge gap surrounding vaccine-mediated attenuation of infectious disease.</p>
              <p id="Par5">This information is a step towards optimal vaccination policies aimed at minimising illness severity associated with COVID-19 and a rationalised approach for future vaccine development and implementation (e.g., robust correlates of protection against severe disease). Moreover, molecular markers associated with disease severity may form targets for future drug development or therapies to augment vaccine-mediated protection.</p>

                <p id="Par6">During the phase 2/3 trials of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, we collected samples to capture the molecular response to COVID-19 in participants experiencing specific symptoms associated with COVID-19. All symptomatic COVID-19 cases included here occurred between June and December 2020 in vaccinated participants of the phase 2/3 trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In stage 1, we analysed samples from 16 symptomatic COVID-19 episodes (i.e. NAAT +ve episodes, 7 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees and 9 placebo vaccinees) and 17 NAAT-ve (8 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 9 placebo vaccinees) episodes—those with COVID-19-like symptoms who did not have COVID-19 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This stage enabled comparison of COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 episodes with similar symptomology. Baseline samples from 11 participants were available for comparison within this cohort.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study overview and cohort description.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Stage 1, symptomatic cohort: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees are shown in red.

                <p id="Par7">Stage 2 was designed to confirm distinct molecular responses to COVID-19 between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and placebo vaccinees in a larger independent cohort; thus, it was restricted to NAAT+ve episodes, of whom 21 received the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 30 received the placebo vaccine (MenACWY) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

                <p id="Par8">In the stage 1, we investigated the distribution and relationships between samples from different study groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed significantly enriched pathways between COVID-19 cases, symptomatic controls (i.e. COVID-19 negative cases), and health (baseline) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a–f</xref>), reflecting distinct next-gen RNA blood transcriptome profiles. The time since the last vaccination until CT was not affecting the clustering of NAAT+ve ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1i</xref>). There were 1,119 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at CT between NAAT-ve participants and NAAT+ve placebo vaccinees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), with GSEA revealing positive enrichment of terms such as “response to virus” in NAAT+ve placebo vaccinees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Conversely, no DEGs or enriched pathways were observed at CT between NAAT-ve participants and NAAT+ve ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g</xref>). We employed long-read 3<sup>rd</sup> gen RNA sequencing to improve identification of gene isoforms and enable differential transcript expression analysis. In-line with the gene expression data, differences in transcripts were observed between CT samples from NAAT+ve episodes and CT samples from NAAT-ve individuals and baseline samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">Small RNA (sRNA) features were differentially expressed between NAAT+ve placebo vaccinees and NAAT-ve participants at CT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). These sRNA features included microRNAs (miRNAs) and sRNAs not derived from miRNAs (e.g., tRNA fragments). Consistent with the gene expression results, no sRNAs were differentially expressed at CT between NAAT-ve participants and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1h</xref>). Furthermore, the magnitude of log<sub>2</sub> foldchanges and effect sizes were also smaller in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group vs the placebo group when compared with the NAAT-ve group in the sRNA data (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). MiRNA enrichment analysis suggested increased targeting of immune pathways in NAAT-ve participants compared with participants with COVID-19, potentially identifying a paucity of post-transcriptional regulation in COVID-19 infection compared with other infections or illnesses (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

                <p id="Par12">In this study’s first stage, we observed distinct molecular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection between ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated individuals and placebo vaccinees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). At COVID-19 onset, 684 DEGs were observed in the placebo vaccine arm, compared with baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Despite general agreement in gene regulation at COVID-19 onset amongst the two vaccine groups compared with baseline, gene perturbation was attenuated in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). Direct comparison of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and placebo vaccine groups at CT identified 5 DEGs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). GSEA of this comparison showed enrichment of pathways such as response to virus and type I interferons in the placebo vaccine group, while pathways related to formation of proteins in the cytoplasm were upregulated in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Similar findings were also seen at the transcript level (3<sup>rd</sup>-gen ONT RNA-seq) and sRNA data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, e, h and Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). Five sRNAs were differentially expressed in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees compared with placebo vaccinees at CT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). In addition, serum levels of IFN-γ and IP10 were higher at CT in the placebo vaccinees compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) (fdr = 0.045 and 0.034, respectively). 3<sup>rd</sup>-gen ONT RNA-seq revealed four differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, Supplementary fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>), including an isoform of <italic>MX1</italic> gene, MX1-201, which was upregulated at CT in placebo vaccines (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>, D0 vs NAAT+ve placebo fdr = 0.00345; NAAT-ve vs NAAT+ve placebo fdr = 0.003108; NAAT+ve ChAdOx1 vs NAAT+ve placebo fdr = 0.018).

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 associated attenuation in perturbation was also seen in the sRNA analysis with more differentially expressed sRNAs at COVID-19 onset versus baseline samples in placebo vaccinees compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees; 410 sRNAs versus 307 sRNAs respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>) with absolute foldchanges and effect sizes of those differentially expressed sRNAs being larger in the placebo group compared with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>). Differences in serum cytokine concentrations were again observed at COVID-19 onset between the placebo and vaccinees, with higher levels of IFN-γ, IL18, IP10, IL10 and TNF-α in placebo vaccinees (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c–e</xref>) (fdr = 0.042 and 0. 019 for IFN- γ, 0.034 for IL18, 0.0035 and 0.0044 for IP10, 0.013 and 0.013 for IL10, 0.0057 and 0.0057 for TNF-α at CT and CT + 7 respectively). We did not observe any differences in Th2 serum cytokines between vaccine groups during COVID-19 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). To assess if this “molecular attenuation” was mediated by viral load, the minimum cycle threshold values from the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR during the COVID-19 episode were compared between the placebo and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated groups — no statistically significant difference was seen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>, Wilcoxon test, p = 0.79 for stage 1, p = 0.93 for stage 2; p = 0.93 overall). In addition, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were similar during COVID-19 infection between the vaccine groups; median CRP in the placebo group was 3.7 (IQR 2.5,5.5), median CRP in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group was 3.85 (IQR 2,8.6), Mann Whitney p = 0.77 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Signatures of COVID-19 response from transcriptomics in larger cohort of NAAT+ participants.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Principal component analysis of blood RNA-seq transcriptome (next-gen RNA-seq) of study participants before (D0, n = 19) and at the time of COVID-19 (CT NAAT+ve ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 n = 21, CT NAAT+ve placebo n = 30). <bold>b</bold> Volcano plot comparing the next-gen RNA-seq blood transcriptome at COVID-19 onset (CT NAAT+ve), placebo vaccinees (n = 30) compared with baseline (D0, n = 19) samples.

                <p id="Par14">ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-specific responses were sought by identifying molecular features exclusively differentially upregulated at CT in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine group. While no such genes were identified consistently across both study stages, GSEA on the stage 2 data revealed several B cell-related pathways and simulated CD4 T cell pathways that were exclusively enriched in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees at onset of COVID-19 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 specific responses were also seen in the sRNA data; a global upregulation of snoRNA-derived sRNAs occurred at CT in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group was not seen until CT + 7 in the placebo arm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17</xref> for the relative abundance of each sRNA class. Though no miRNAs were unilaterally differentially expressed in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group during COVID-19, nCov-19-specific differences were observed at the pathway level. For example, by CT + 7, the GO pathway “negative regulation of interleukin-1-mediated signalling pathway” was positively enriched in the placebo group compared with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>). This pathway was positively enriched at CT + 7 compared with baseline in the placebo group (p = 0.016) but not the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group (p = 0.07). This suggesting increased miRNA repression of this pathway in the placebo vaccinees at CT + 7 compared with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group. Increased repression of mRNAs involved in “negative regulation of interleukin-1-mediated signalling pathway” implies potential increased IL-1 signalling at CT + 7 in the placebo group 7 days into infection compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>sRNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation of COVID-19 responses.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Class-wise changes in sRNA expression over time relative to baseline.

                <title>Release of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression may promote an inflammatory response in COVID-19</title>
                <p id="Par17">Differential gene expression analysis in the stage 2 cohort revealed global downregulation of individual miRNAs at COVID-19 onset (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The widespread release of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional repression coincided with upregulation of pathways involved in anti-viral and inflammatory responses. Conversely, restoration of miRNA expression 7 days after COVID-19 onset coincided with resolution of gene perturbation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>), with miRNAs that target pathways involved in immune responses recovering more quickly (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). This suggests that downregulation of miRNAs could play a role in promoting inflammation in COVID-19. In line with this, gene ontology pathways relating to the immune response were negatively enriched at CT compared with baseline, e.g., TRIF-dependent toll-like receptor signalling pathway, negative regulation of I-kappa B kinase, NF-kappaB signalling, positive regulation of lymphocyte activation and cell stress responses including cellular response to hypoxia and regulation of JUN kinase activity (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>, Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Furthermore, there was a reciprocal relationship between the expression of miRNAs and their target mRNAs/pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b, c</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> shows that targets of downregulated miRNAs were enriched in the mRNA results at CT versus baseline. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> shows pathways that were positively enriched at the miRNA level were generally negatively enriched at the mRNA level and vice versa (proportion test p = 2.2 × 10<sup>−15</sup>). These findings were consistent for CT + 7 vs baseline (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). In contrast to the resolving perturbation in miRNAs, there was persistence of differential expression in non-miRNA sRNAs at CT + 7 (e.g., sRNA features derived from snoRNAs). Anti-correlations were also seen at the individual miRNA-mRNA level – for example the expression of hsa-miR-150-5p and STAT1 (experimentally proven miRNA-mRNA target pairs) were anticorrelated at the sample level (Supplementary fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">23</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par20">Here, we comprehensively evaluated COVID-19 infection in the context of vaccination using a systems immunology approach. By leveraging the clinical trial setting where participants were randomised to receive either a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a placebo vaccine, we captured vaccine-induced modification of response to COVID-19 infection. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination attenuated the activation of immune responses associated with COVID-19 severity. Moreover, we described the downregulation of a putative alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor in blood during COVID-19 infection in unvaccinated individuals compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We found distinct blood transcriptome profiles between COVID-19 cases, non-COVID-19 symptomatic episodes, and health. In line with previous reports, we described upregulation of genes involved in response to virus and interferon signalling in blood samples from COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Pertinently, few studies have used another disease comparator group. Our symptomatic placebo group represent an unknown and likely heterogeneous aetiology group with commonality in COVID-19-like symptomology, allowing us to identify SARS-CoV-2-associated immune responses distinct from general immune responses to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">This study shows that vaccination ameliorates molecular perturbation in blood during COVID-19, a finding corroborated across all omics datasets. A reduction in viral load in the upper respiratory tract did not explain these effects. Although our cohort may be underpowered to observe small differences between the vaccine groups, larger studies also show a poor relationship between vaccine status and viral load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, previously described biomarkers of severe COVID-19, namely IP10, IL18 and IFN-gamma, were more highly expressed in the placebo vaccine group in our study at the protein level in serum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, IL-10, IL6 and TNF-alpha, also biomarkers of COVID-19 severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, were exclusively upregulated in the placebo group at the protein level in serum. Transcriptomic responses mirrored this finding, with enrichment of pathways involved in type I interferons at CT in Placebo compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Interestingly, we described a truncated isoform of MX1 protein, MX1-201, upregulated at the onset of COVID-19 in placebo group participants compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees. Human myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MX1 or MxA) is an interferon-induced GTP-binding protein encoded by the MX1 gene, which plays an important role in anti-viral activity by inhibiting a range of viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, measles, coxsackie, and hepatitis B virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Since the truncation significantly alters the protein structure, we hypothesise that it could potentially destabilise the hydrophobic core of the stalk and impair the oligomerisation of MX1, thereby making this isoform dysfunctional. The expression of the MX1-201 transcript may alter the immune response to the COVID-19 infection in the placebo vaccine recipients compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated group, where this isoform was almost absent. Interferon pathways have been associated with disease severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, results for the link between type 1 interferon and COVID-19 severity are conflicting and may vary over COVID-19 time course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. One hypothesis is that elevated type 1 interferon responses drive TNF- and IL-1-associated inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>; thus, vaccine-associated attenuation of type I interferon may explain how ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces disease severity.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Given that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induces both spike-specific CD8 + T-cells and antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, our study ties adaptive immune responses against spike to reduced stimulation of pro-inflammatory responses associated with immunopathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Supporting this, we found B cell and CD4 T cell pathways enriched in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees compared with controls at COVID-19 onset, revealing rapid, vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immune responses captured in real-time. Notably, the study revealed that vaccination attenuates pro-inflammatory responses rather than reducing viral load, decoupling control of infection from disease severity. Future studies focusing on mucosal early responses to infection in the context of vaccination could inform whether vaccine-induced decreased pro-inflammatory responses in the mucosa are associated with reduced viral load and/or faster viral clearance and thus potentially reduced transmission. Understanding this biology will be crucial for second-generation transmission-blocking vaccines.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Our findings showed that COVID-19 did not induce Th2-skewed immune responses in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated individuals. This is believed to be a desirable attribute for vaccines against respiratory viruses as some studies proposed that Th2-skewed immune responses are the basis for immunopathology in historical examples of vaccine-enhanced disease in animal models and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The ability of viral vector vaccines (such as ChAdOx1) to induce Th1 responses was known from preclinical and clinical studies and informed the design of this vaccine.</p>
              <p id="Par26">We measured the downregulation of <italic>KREMEN1</italic> at the onset of COVID-19 in placebo vaccinated individuals compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients. Interestingly, Kringle containing transmembrane protein 1 (KREMEN1) is a transmembrane receptor involved in WNT signalling that has recently been proposed as an alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. KREMEN1 is a known entry receptor for enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A10, and is expressed at potential virus entry sites (i.e., sinonasal, conjunctival and bronchiolar epithelium)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In blood, <italic>KREMEN1</italic> expression is mainly restricted to leucocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, T cells and B cells. While we observed a drop in absolute neutrophil count, we also predicted a cell-specific decrease in <italic>KREMEN1</italic> in the neutrophils of Placebo vaccinated individuals at COVID-19 onset compared with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees. SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to infect and replicate within human neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This has been shown to lead to the activation of neutrophils —including triggering of neutrophil extracellular traps — a process that can be inhibited by blocking interactions of S protein within the ACE2 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. This raises the possibility that the expression of viral entry receptors could impact the infection and activation of neutrophils, subsequently impacting their migration and/or survival.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Early in COVID-19 infection, we observed a mild but statistically significant drop in blood counts across all leucocyte subsets and platelets, which was more profound in placebo vaccinees. In a COVID-19 challenge study, neutropenia was a common finding; however, changes in other cell types were not described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Most studies recruit later in infection and contain more severe cases, potentially explaining why this has not been reported previously. A potential explanation for the observed fall in all leucocyte populations and platelets is transient bone marrow suppression. However, other possibilities exist, such as cell migration out of circulation and into infected tissues or destruction within peripheral blood, previously described in viral infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The decrease in granulocyte counts during COVID-19 was not associated with changes in levels of GCSF or GM-CSF in our cohort, composed mainly of mild illness. However, the drop in blood leucocyte counts may explain the emergency myelopoiesis and increase in immature neutrophils frequently observed in severe or critical COVID-1917. Despite our mostly mild cases, we noted markers of immature neutrophils suggesting this phenomenon is pervasive in COVID-19 infection, starting early after onset and abrogated by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Our study shows COVID-19 perturbs whole blood sRNA expression, with an overlap noted between differentially expressed miRNAs in this study and other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. For example, the global reduction in miRNA expression at COVID-19 onset was observed in a study of plasma miRNAs in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. The same phenomenon has been linked to greater COVID-19 disease severity based on miRNA measurement in nasopharangeal swab samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The mechanism of global miRNA downregulation at COVID-19 onset is unclear. At the gene expression level, DICER and three AGO proteins, important for miRNA maturation and function, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, were down-regulated—a phenomenon known to globally reduce miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Another possibility is increased miRNA turnover, given RBX1, part of the ZSWIM8 complex involved in target-directed miRNA decay, was upregulated at the mRNA level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The link between global miRNA downregulation and de-repression of mRNAs and pathways, including those involved in pro-inflammatory responses, potentially implicates dysregulated miRNA expression in COVID-19 immune responses. This fits with literature showing that miRNA downregulation is associated with inflammatory states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Widescale loss of miRNA gene regulation was specific to COVID-19, as miRNA pathway analyses at symptom onset identified increased miRNA-mediated pathway repression in the symptomatic COVID-19 negative compared with the COVID-19 group. This potentially reveals a distinct aspect of COVID-19 pathology. Overall, these results raise the possibility that dysregulated miRNA expression contributes to the pathogenic inflammatory response that makes COVID-19 such a serious disease. Functional work is required to prove causation between miRNA expression and inflammation in COVID-19, nevertheless such a possibility is supported by multiple studies showing that global miRNA reduction is associated with increased cytokine production and excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Our results open the door to further research on whether reinstating global or specific miRNA levels could ameliorate COVID-19 severity.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The changes seen in snoRNA-derived sRNA are supported by the findings of Wilson et al., who described this phenomenon later in COVID-19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Notably, sRNAs derived from snoRNAs were higher in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees at symptom onset, with a delayed increase appearing at CT + 7 in placebo vaccinees. sRNAs derived from snoRNAs are believed to act like miRNAs, post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and can be differentially expressed during inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. The temporal difference in the expression of snoRNA-derived sRNAs between the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and placebo vaccinees fits with the time course for the emergence of adaptive immunity in the two groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. This implies that snoRNA-derived sRNAs play a role in adaptive immune responses, a phenomenon not previously described.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In conclusion, our study shows that vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ameliorates the molecular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Concurrent with this is the early emergence of pathways involved in humoral and cellular immunity in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinees, tying a reduction in disease severity with adaptive immune responses at the molecular level. These data reveal immune-related biomarkers that can be used to identify vaccine benefit beyond sterilising immunity in a cohort of people generally at low risk of COVID-19. Our multi-omics approaches provide corroborative evidence that labelling breakthrough infection as “vaccine failure” is a misnomer, as there is clear evidence of impact at the molecular level. Our study also adds to the mechanistic understanding of COVID-19 immune responses, with a link between pro-inflammatory pathways at COVID-19 onset and a reduction in miRNA-mediated repression. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of real-world data showing how ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reduces disease severity. This is relevant to the emerging paradigm shift in vaccinology that refocuses vaccine evaluation away from sterilising immunity towards disease attenuation for pathogens where sterilising immunity may not be necessary or achievable.</p>

The RCTs are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001) and NCT04400838 (COV002). All individuals included in the analyses agreed to inclusion in this analysis as part of the vaccine trial consent, with the opportunity to opt-out. The trials were conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and approved by the South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (20/SC/0145 and 20/SC/0179) and the UK regulatory agency (the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). All participants included in this work had no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19-like symptoms prior to enrolment. Participants were randomised to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or meningococcal group A, C, W, and Y conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) and blinded to their allocation. The original protocol involved a single dose schedule, however an amendment was made to offer a booster dose (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / placebo) was implemented from 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2020. Participants second vaccination was the same as their initial vaccine. More information is contained in the original COV1/COV2 study paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Participants presented for a COVID-19 test visit (CT) during the study period as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, shortness of breath, fever, anosmia or ageusia). At this visit, they were medically assessed, a COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) was performed, and blood was taken for transcriptomic analysis or processed for serum cytokine assays. Seven days later, participants reattended for the same procedures (CT + 7). Participants then returned to standard follow-up until their next episode of COVID-like symptoms, when they would have another CT visit. See Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> for study schema. Blood samples were collected from participants with COVID-like symptoms who did (NAAT+ve) and did not (NAAT-ve) have COVID-19. NAAT-ve episodes thus represent a heterogeneous group of COVID-like illnesses. We analysed the study in two stages. Stage 1 involved samples taken at baseline, CT and CT + 7 from people who did and did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stage 2 included a larger group of participants, independent from the stage 1, and focussed on the differences between vaccine groups during acute COVID-19; thus, it did not contain samples from NAAT-ve episodes.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Visit schema.

Samples from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and placebo vaccine groups were selected to be matched for COVID-19 risk factors, as were samples from NAAT+ve and NAAT-ve individuals. Demographic matching of trial participants dictated which samples were included in the study and was limited to the number of breakthrough COVID-19 infections in the trial. Only samples from one symptomatic episode were included for each participant (first COVID-19 episode in the case of NAAT+ve individuals). The severity of all suspected symptomatic COVID-19 cases was classified into four groups according to the clinical study plan of the vaccine trial.

Thus, whether this study’s results generalise to more severe illnesses is unclear. Our study’s sample size is moderate but represents the largest to date from an RCT. Case-control or prospective cohort studies following patients at high risk of severe illness may be able to capture such cases in vaccinated populations but would lack the advantages of an RCT. Paired baseline samples were not available for every participant. As pairing can improve power by inherently controlling for biological noise, it is possible that some of our differential expression results provide conservative differential expression p-value estimates. We matched all subgroups for risk factors to mitigate bias. Small differences in group sizes could potentially affect the number of differentially expressed genes in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and placebo groups when compared with baseline or CT NAAT-ve samples however effect sizes and log<sub>2</sub> foldchanges were generally larger in NAAT+ve placebo comparisons supporting the idea that perturbation in gene expression is larger during COVID-19 in those who have not received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The main SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating during the study period were ancestral and Alpha, and the volunteers were naïve to prior infection at study enrolment. The ability of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine to protect against severe disease by other variants suggests results are generalisable to the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, but it is not clear what is the additional effect that further booster vaccine doses confer. Bulk sequencing in this study makes it challenging to separate differential expression due to intracellular changes from changes due to differences in the cellular composition of blood. However, the latter cannot account for all the differences between vaccine groups at the molecular level, as gene expression fold-changes were frequently greater than cell count foldchanges. Furthermore, CIBERSORTx inferred differential gene expression within cell populations; nevertheless, future studies employing single-cell RNA-seq or CITE-seq approaches would help improve resolution.</p>
