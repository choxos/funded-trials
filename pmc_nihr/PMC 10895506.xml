                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Achieving a sustained energy deficit is essential for weight loss, but the cognitive and behavioral strategies that support this goal are unclear.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The goal of this study was to investigate the number and type of cognitive and behavioral strategies used by participants who were enrolled in a 1-year weight loss trial and to explore associations between strategies and magnitude of weight loss at 3 months and 1 year.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>The study is a secondary post-hoc exploratory analysis of data collected as part of the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to Low-Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET), a randomized controlled trial conducted in general practices in England, United Kingdom, between January 2016 and August 2017.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Participants/setting</title>
                  <p>This study involved 164 participants from both intervention and control groups of the DROPLET trial who completed the Oxford Food and Behaviours (OxFAB) questionnaire to assess the use of 115 strategies grouped into 21 domains used to manage their weight.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomized to either a behavioral weight loss program involving 8 weeks total diet replacement (TDR) and 4 weeks of food reintroduction or a program delivered by a medical practice nurse over a 3-month period (usual care [UC]).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Weight was objectively measured at baseline, 3 months, and 1 year. Cognitive and behavioral strategies used to support weight loss were assessed using the OxFAB questionnaire at 3 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Statistical analysis performed</title>
                  <p>Exploratory factor analysis was used to generate data-driven patterns of strategy use, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to examine associations between use of these patterns and weight change.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>No evidence was found of a difference in the number of strategies (mean difference, 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.83, 5.65) or the number of domains used (mean difference, −0.23; 95% CI, −0.69, 0.23) between the TDR group and the UC group. The number of strategies was not associated with weight loss at either 3 months (−0.02 kg; 95% CI, −0.11, 0.06) or 1 year (−0.05 kg; 95% CI, −0.14, 0.02). Similarly, the number of domains used was not associated with weight loss at 3 months (−0.02 kg; 95% CI, −0.53, 0.49) or 1 year (−0.07 kg; 95% CI, −0.60, 0.46).</p>
                  <p>Factor analysis identified four coherent patterns of strategy use, identified as Physical Activity, Motivation, Planned Eating, and Food Purchasing patterns. Greater use of strategies in the Food Purchasing (−2.6 kg; 95% CI, −4.42, −0.71) and Planned Eating patterns (−3.20 kg; 95% CI, −4.94, −1.46) was associated with greater weight loss at 1 year.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The number of cognitive and behavioral strategies or domains used does not appear to influence weight loss, but the types of strategy appear of greater importance. Supporting people to adopt strategies linked to planned eating and food purchasing may aid long-term weight loss.</p>

              <p id="p0040">The Oxford Food and Activity Behaviours (OxFAB) taxonomy and questionnaire is a conceptual framework of 117 strategies grouped into 21 domains designed to provide details of the cognitive and behavioral strategies used during a weight loss attempt.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Other taxonomies focus on the strategies that constitute a specific intervention from the perspective of the practitioner offering support,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> but OxFAB focuses on the cognitive and behavioral strategies employed by the individual.</p>
              <p id="p0045">The OxFAB taxonomy was constructed through a qualitative analysis of existing resources and a review of existing behavior change taxonomies and theories. The taxonomy was translated into a questionnaire to identify strategies used by individuals, and the validity of the questionnaire and test–retest reliability have been established previously.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A cohort study following individuals undertaking a self-directed weight-loss attempt reported an association between weight loss at 3 months and the self-reported use of strategies relating to dietary impulse control, weight loss planning and monitoring, motivational support, information seeking, and self-monitoring.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>

                <p id="p0055">The Doctor Referral of Overweight People to Low-Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET) trial was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, open-label, individually randomized control trial. Eligible adults with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 and whose health would benefit from weight loss were invited by their general practitioner (GP) to participate. Those who had received or were scheduled for bariatric surgery, those participating in a weight management program, or those with contraindications to the total diet replacement (TDR) were excluded from participating (as detailed fully in the protocol).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Two hundred seventy-eight adult participants with obesity who were seeking to lose weight were enrolled from primary care practices in Oxfordshire, England, United Kingdom, between January and July 2016, and follow-up was completed in August 2017. An independent statistician produced a computer-generated randomization list with 1:1 allocation to the TDR program or usual care (UC) groups using stratified block randomization with randomly permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6, stratified by general practice and BMI (≤35 or &gt;35). After eligibility had been confirmed, participants were enrolled in the study, and the allocation was revealed using an online randomization program to ensure full allocation concealment.</p>

                <title>Low-Energy Total Diet Replacement Treatment</title>
                <p id="p0060">Participants met in-person with a counselor who had undergone training to deliver the behavioral weight loss support program involving TDR. For the first 12 weeks, participants met with the counselor in-person weekly for support, which comprised goal setting, feedback, encouragement, reassurance, and problem solving. Participants initially replaced all food with four portions of specially formulated food products daily (eg, soups, shakes, and bars), 750 mL of skim milk, 2.25 L of water or other low- or no-energy drinks, and a fiber supplement; energy intake was 810 kcal/day (3,389 kJ/day). Specially formulated foods were provided in discrete portions to participants by their counselor free of charge as part of the trial. After 8 weeks, there was a 4-week stepwise reduction in use of the specially formulated food products and reintroduction of conventional food-based meals. The counselors provided advice to participants on the kind of low-energy foods that should be consumed to maintain weight loss. During the weight maintenance phase from weeks 13 to 24, counselors encouraged participants to continue to meet with them monthly and to consume one specially formulated food product per day, with the remainder of the diet provided by conventional food. If weight was regained, the protocol allowed for participants to return to the TDR stage for up to 4 weeks. This program was free of charge to week 24.</p>

The questionnaire was designed to have a binary outcome (use of a strategy or not), but to improve discrimination four response options were provided in the questionnaire. For each question, participants were asked to indicate whether they used the strategy “most of the time,” “sometimes,” “never/hardly ever,” or “not relevant to me.” Participants could also mark questions as “unclear.” Two questions were omitted from the questionnaire booklet used in the DROPLET trial because they were deemed not relevant in the context of a trial in which doctors referred individual participants (“I am losing weight with a friend/family member/my partner and I'm trying hard to lose more than them” and “I feel like I am part of a team with my friend(s)/partner/family member. We are losing weight together”). Therefore, for this study, a maximum of 115 strategies were grouped within 21 domains.</p>

                <p id="p0110">Demographic characteristics and weight loss outcomes of those who completed the OxFAB questionnaire and other participants from the DROPLET trial who did not complete the questionnaire were compared using unpaired <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and <italic>z</italic> test of proportions for categorical variables.</p>
                <p id="p0115">Domain use was defined as the use of at least one strategy in which responses of “most of the time” and “sometimes” were deemed to indicate use of a strategy by a participant, and responses of “never/hardly ever” and “not relevant to me” considered evidence that participants did not use the strategy within a given domain.</p>
                <p id="p0120">The analyses used a multivariable linear regression model with treatment group, sex, age, baseline BMI, and IMD group (median split, most deprived IMD decile ≤8, least deprived IMD decile &gt;8) as independent variables and total number of reported strategies, or domains as the dependant variable to explore associations between treatment group and participant characteristics on the number of OxFAB strategies and domains. The association between using specific strategies and domains was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, with strategy or domain use as the dependent variable, and treatment group, sex, age, baseline BMI, and IMD as independent variables.</p>
                <p id="p0125">A multivariable linear mixed-effects model including adjustment for fixed effects of treatment group, visit, strategy or domain use, age, sex, and IMD as well as interaction terms for strategy or domain use by visit and strategy or domain use by group and participant as a random effect explored the effect of strategy and domain use on weight change from baseline.</p>
                <p id="p0130">Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify patterns of strategy use as described in detail previously.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Data-driven patterns of strategy use were derived by exploratory factor analysis for the binary strategy use variables, using a tetrachoric correlation matrix with orthogonal rotation (varimax option) to enhance factor identification and interpretability. Factors were retained based on eigenvalues &gt;1 and the proportion of variance explained. For each factor identified, every strategy has a factor loading, which is the correlation coefficient between each strategy and the factor. Only the strategies with factor loadings (<italic>z</italic>-score) &gt; 0.2 were retained and extracted in the factors identified.</p>
                <p id="p0135">The effects of using each of the identified strategy patterns on weight change from baseline was assessed using a multivariable linear mixed-effects model. This model included adjustment for fixed effects of the pattern use, visit, age, sex, IMD group, and baseline BMI, and interaction terms for pattern use by visit and pattern use by treatment group and a random effect of participant.</p>
                <p id="p0140">Finally, the study assessed whether the use of an <italic>a priori</italic> model of “essential weight loss strategies” was associated with weight loss. This model was developed previously and was shown to be associated with weight loss in previous work.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The essential strategies model contained nine components made up of 31 strategies: food intake targets (one strategy); weight targets (two strategies); impulse management (seven strategies); motivation to lose weight (15 strategies); advance meal planning (one strategy); monitoring of food intake (two strategies); swapping less healthy foods for healthier ones (one strategy); keeping unhealthy food out of the house (one strategy), and self-weighing (one strategy). Each participant was judged to have used each component if they reported using one or more of the strategies contained within the component “most of the time.” A total score (0–9) was calculated, with each component receiving equal weighting. This score represented the number of components within the “essential strategies” model that each participant used. Weight loss in participants who reported using the “essential strategies” (defined as seven or more of nine of the components in this “essential” model) was compared with weight loss in those who did not report using the full group of “essential strategies” (less than seven out of nine), using multivariable linear regression adjusted with fixed factors to include essential strategy use, visit, treatment group, sex, age, baseline BMI and IMD decile, interaction terms of essential strategy use × visit and essential strategy use × treatment group and participant ID as random factor.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0230">This study used the OxFAB questionnaire to explore the behavioral and cognitive strategies used by participants who were undertaking a weight loss attempt as part of a randomized controlled trial. No association was found between the total number of strategies or domains used and weight loss, but strategies linked to food purchasing and planned eating were associated with successful weight loss. Adherence to an <italic>a priori</italic> model of essential weight loss strategies was also associated with greater weight loss.</p>
              <p id="p0235">None of the strategies was associated with weight loss at 3 months; however, participants who reported using strategies in the goal setting, motivation, and use of weight management aids domains lost more weight than participants who did not report using these strategies at 1 year. Possibly the strategies that confer greater weight loss in the short term may be different from those that best aid with weight loss maintenance in the longer term.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0240">The results here are broadly consistent with the findings of a short-term cohort study using the same questionnaire in individuals who were attempting to self-manage their body weight.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The effective strategies varied, perhaps reflecting the difference between self-help approaches and the formal weight-loss programs studied here. Indeed, differences in the use of weight loss strategies in the two trial arms largely reflect the nature of the programs. Participants in the UC group reported varied use of strategies, whereas participants who were randomized to the TDR intervention had greater odds of reporting using strategies in the domains of information seeking, reward, support: motivational, and use of weight loss aids. However, of the domains more likely to be used by the TDR group, the use of strategies within these domains was not associated with weight loss at 3 months. Only the use of strategies in the weight loss aids domain was associated with significant weight loss at 1 year.</p>
              <p id="p0245">The strategies associated with weight loss at 1 year are consistent with observational data from the US National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), a self-selected population of more than 4,000 individuals who have lost at least 13.6 kg (30 lb) and kept it off for at least 1 year.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Participants in the NWCR report that strategies relating to food (eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet, eating breakfast regularly, and maintaining a constant eating pattern) were important for weight maintenance after weight loss.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0250">The findings from the current study indicate a striking difference between participants from the most and least deprived regions, with the former having 50% lower odds of seeking external support to manage their weight. This may reflect differences in awareness of support available or financial or other resource constraints that could limit to access these support systems. A recent review of strategies associated with weight change after behavioral weight loss programs found that the opportunity to access programs, usually involving additional support, after the initial weight loss phase was associated with slower weight regain.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This access to ongoing support may be contributing to disparities in health outcomes after weight loss interventions.</p>
              <p id="p0255">A strength of this study is that it used a questionnaire specifically developed and validated to assess the behavioral strategies used during weight loss. However, one of the limitations of the questionnaire is that it contains 117 questions (of which 115 were used in this study) and takes at least 15 minutes to complete. We believe that one consequence of its lengthy nature is that when the questionnaire was included in the package of questionnaires provided to participants in the DROPLET trial at 3 months, only 164 of the 278 (59%) participants completed it. This is similar to a cohort study that used the OxFAB questionnaire to assess cognitive and behavioral strategies used by people engaging in a self-directed weight loss attempt in which a similar proportion of participants failed to complete the questionnaire.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0260">The OxFAB questionnaire is continuously evolving, and to address issues on excessive length the authors recently reduced the existing 117-item questionnaire to 20 items.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0265">Limitations include that the analyses relied on converting ordinal variables into binary strategy use. However, the OxFAB questionnaire was designed to be analyzed using dichotomous outcomes (use of a strategy or not), but during the refinement process, participants provided feedback saying that it was difficult for them to provide a yes/no response, so additional response options were added, which made it easier for participants to respond while still allowing researchers to analyze the strategies and domains in a dichotomous manner.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Further limitations include the nature of multiple tests, and the possibility that some findings occurred by chance. Nevertheless, the data reduction technique used for multiple exposures could be considered a strength to the approach.</p>
              <p id="p0270">One further limitation to this study is the generalizability of the findings. The participants in the DROPLET trial were mainly white (British) and middle-aged, and from areas with low levels of deprivation, which, although not representative of the UK population as a whole, is representative of the local population. The people who completed the questionnaire were older and had lower baseline BMI, and there were also a greater proportion from the TDR treatment group and who self-reported to be of white ethnicity than those who didn’t complete the questionnaire. These differences may go some way to explain why differences in weight loss were observed between those who completed and did not complete the questionnaire. The provision of binary option for gender may have discouraged participation from nonconforming gender individuals or may have caused them to misclassify their gender. Nevertheless, the participants who completed the OxFAB questionnaire on average lost more weight at both 3 months and 1 year compared with the participants who did not complete the OxFAB questionnaire.</p>
              <p id="p0275">Although there were differences in age, baseline BMI, treatment group, and ethnicity between the people who completed the OxFAB questionnaire and those who did not, which may explain differences in weight loss between the groups, it is also possible, and perhaps more likely, that the people who were willing to take the time to complete the questionnaire represent a more motivated group of people than those who did not. Differences in motivation could explain why these people were more successful in their weight loss attempt. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the results of this sample reflect the strategies used by people that are more successful than the population as a whole, or the possibility that those who did not complete the questionnaire used different strategies than those who provided data in this study. The findings reported here cannot be assumed to be causal, but they may provide useful insights for the development of future programs. It is difficult to rigorously assess the internal validity of questionnaires such as this. In particular, self-report may not be reliable; however, the face/validity and repeatability of the questionnaire has been previously established,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> although we cannot rule out some reverse causality with recollections of strategy use influenced by the outcome of the weight loss attempt.</p>

              <p id="p0280">The number of cognitive and behavioral strategies or domains does not appear to influence weight loss; types of strategy appear of greater importance. Supporting people to adopt strategies linked to planned eating and food purchasing may aid long-term weight loss.</p>
