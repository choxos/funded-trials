                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Pelvic fragility fractures (PFF) are common in older people and associated with a significant burden of mortality and morbidity. This is related to the challenges of appropriate pain control and early mobilisation. The current standard for treatment of PFF is non-surgical management. Minimally invasive surgical techniques for sacral fracture stabilisation have been shown to improve outcomes in terms of pain control and mobility, and they are safe. Randomised controlled trials are required before recommendations can be made for surgical management of PFF to become the new standard of care. This feasibility study will explore several uncertainties around conducting such a trial.</p>

                  <p>ASSERT (Acute Sacral inSufficiEncy fractuRe augmenTation) is a single-site randomised controlled, parallel-arm, feasibility trial of surgical stabilisation versus non-surgical management of acute sacral fragility fractures in people aged 70 years and over. Patients will be randomised to either surgical or non-surgical group on a 1:1 ratio. Follow-up of participants will occur at 2, 4 and 12 weeks with safety data collected at 52 weeks. Primary objectives are to determine feasibility and design of a future trial, including outcomes on recruitment, adherence to randomisation and safety. This will be supplemented with a qualitative interview study of participants and clinicians. Secondary objectives will inform study design procedures to determine clinical and economic outcomes between groups, including scored questionnaires, analgesia requirements, resource use and quality of life data. Data analysis will be largely descriptive to inform outcomes and future sample size.</p>

              <p>Pelvic fragility fractures (PFF) are common in older people, as they are a frequent presentation of osteoporosis, a condition characterised by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Thus, PFF can occur as a result of low-energy trauma, typically following a fall from standing height or less.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The reported overall incidence of PFF is variable, between 25 and 92 per 100Â 000 persons-years, with the highest frequency reported in females over the age of 75 years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â8</xref> Epidemiology studies worldwide have consistently shown a sustained increase in the age-adjusted incidence of PFF, with numbers expected to continue to rise exponentially over the next 10 years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 6 7 9â11</xref> These patients are also increasingly requiring inpatient admission for management of their PFF, representing a considerable ongoing burden to hospital services.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 6 12</xref>
</p>
              <p>The pelvis is a complex ring like structure composed of three principal bones; the paired innominate bones and the sacrum. Fractures of the pelvis are a heterogeneous group of fractures and are most commonly described by the Young-Burgess classification, which relates to the predominant direction of the vector force at the time of injury.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Within this, lateral compression (LC) fractures are the most common and are further subtyped based on the resulting degree of displacement of the pelvic ring:<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Type I: Oblique or transverse ramus fracture and ipsilateral sacral compression fracture.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Type II: Rami fracture and ipsilateral posterior ilium fracture dislocation (crescent fracture).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Type III: Ipsilateral LC and contralateral anterior-posterior compression (windswept pelvis).</p></list-item></list>
</p>
              <p>The most commonly identified PFF presenting to hospital is that of the anterior ring in the form of fractures of the pubic rami.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 15 16</xref> 60%to 90% of these patients will also have a concomitant posterior ring fracture in the form of an insufficiency fracture of the sacrum.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 17â19</xref> Type 1 LC is therefore the most common subtype of PFF.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 20</xref>Â While anterior pelvic ring fractures can be identified on plain X-ray, those fractures of the posterior pelvic ring are most typically identified on CT or MRI, which now has a much wider availability on emergency admission to hospital.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 21</xref> From a biomechanical point of view, an undisplaced anterior pelvic ring is more stable than a posterior pelvic ring fracture, with the posterior ring providing the majority of structure and stabilisation of the pelvis on load-bearing.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>PFF, especially those involving the sacrum within the load-bearing posterior pelvic ring, result in pain-related immobilisation and increased care dependency.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â23</xref> PFF have been shown to confer poor outcomes like those reported extensively in hip fractures but covets much less attention.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Inpatient 30-day mortality sits at up to 11%, with a 12-month mortality up to 27%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 9 12 15â17 20 24â26</xref> This may be related to the demographics of patients admitted to hospital with PFF. This patient group commonly has significant comorbidities and over aÂ third exhibit cognitive impairment, leaving them more suspectable to the medical complications of pain-dependant immobility and associated prolonged hospital stay.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 17 25</xref> Inpatient mortality is often attributed to exacerbation of pre-existing comorbidity.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Around half of the patients admitted with PFF develop hospital and immobility related complications including pressure sores, infection, renal injury, venous thromboembolism and delirium.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 16 17 25â28</xref> The majority are unable to return home at their baseline level of mobility or independence on discharge.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 25 27</xref> In excess of this, those with confirmed combined anterior and posterior ring insufficiency fractures have hospital stays 2 weeks longer than those with isolated anterior ring fractures, higher complication rates, 30% more chance of losing previous independence and higher rates of institutionalisation.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 20 22 29</xref>
</p>
              <p>Current standard care for PFF is conservative, consisting of systemic analgesia and mobilisation as tolerated.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As a response to the high level of associated morbidity, management of PFF needs to be targeted at good early pain control in order to allow early mobilisation, return of independence and discharge.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 31</xref> Currently, standard pain management consists of the use of systemic analgesia, especially opioids, but pain control adequate to allow early mobilisation is difficult to achieve in this cohort.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Barriers to adequate pain management in PFF can include under-reporting of symptoms due to cognitive impairment, susceptibility to side-effects of opioids in the elderly and undertreatment due to perceived prescriber fear of opioid side-effects.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p>
              <p>Development of minimally invasive surgical techniques targeting fractures of posterior ringÂ sacral fractures may provide an alternative to improve adequate pain control in this significant subset of PFF.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Minimally invasive keyhole surgery techniques involving percutaneous cement augmentation with or without trans-sacral screw are increasingly being performed in order to stabilise sacral fractures.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22 31</xref> For those patients who have failed to progress with conservative management, these procedures have been shown to reduce pain and the amount of analgesia required postoperatively.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 33 34</xref> This in turn allows increased patient mobility with a quicker return to baseline function and shortened length of stay as well as having an established safety profile.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 22 30 33â39</xref> However, there are no randomised controlled trials that compare efficacy of sacral fracture surgery compared with conservative management in the early stages of recovery.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22 33</xref>

                <p>All patients admitted with a Type 1 LC PFF as identified on imaging (CT or MRI) will be invited to participate. The research team will be notified of the potential participant and will confirm eligibility with their clinical care team. The process for obtaining participant informed consent will be in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidance and will include consent for potential inclusion in the qualitative interview nested study.</p>
                <p>An Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) will be used as a screening tool for capacity assessment. If the admission AMT completed by the clinical team is documented as 5â6/10, then it will be repeated by the research team at the time of screening. A participant will be assumed to have capacity if their AMTâ¥7/10 at either point of assessment. An AMT&lt;7/10 will prompt a capacity assessment based on the principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 in relation to research.</p>
                <p>Relatives or carers of potential participants who are unable to provide consent independently, will be approached as the participantsâ personal consultee.

By recruiting 48 patients, the estimated recruitment rate has a SE of 5.5% (95% CI 48.4% toÂ 70.8%). Given the short active follow-up period, we are allowing for a lower 10% 3-month attrition rate. This estimates that 43 participants will complete the study, thus estimating the 90% retention rate with a SE of 4.4% (95% CI 77.3%; 96.5%). Completed follow-up on 43 patients will allow an estimated SE for the TUG of 1.2âs assuming the SD is about 8âs (95%âCI 6.6 toÂ 10.2) and an SE of 0.9 for the RMDQ, assuming the SD is about 6 (95% CI 4.9Â to 7.6).</p>

A statistical analysis plan will be agreed prior to database lock and a CONSORT flow diagram produced. Data analysis overall will inform future trial feasibility and the hypothesis analysis plan for a definitive trial.</p>
                <p>Characteristics of participants recruited will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics and compared with patients who were eligible but not randomised. Completeness of data collection will be reported by intervention group and overall.</p>
                <p>Descriptive summaries of outcome data at each follow-up time point will be presented by intervention group and overall. Outcome distributions for suggested floor and ceiling effects will be checked. Confidence intervals will be presented for the proportion of patients consented, randomised and retained in the trial completing assessment at 12 weeks, both overall and by treatment group. Confidence intervals for the SD of the secondary outcomes will also be calculated where appropriate.</p>
                <p>Exploratory analysis of continuous outcomes for the subsequent definitive trial will be performed to investigate potential treatment effects. Differences in mean values between baseline and 12 weeks will be presented, with 95% CI. This feasibility trial is not powered to perform hypotheses testing; however, descriptive statistics of the difference between randomised groups will inform the design of the main definitive trial. No subgroup analyses are planned, and no interim analyses will be performed aside from routine checks of safety data.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The growing older person population confers a large group of potential patients with complex medical and social needs, both in terms of medical comorbidities, susceptibility to hospital acquired complications and dependency. With the numbers of PFFs set to exponentially increase in the coming years, the potential healthcare resource burden within this group of patients is alarming. A recent systematic review concluded that randomised controlled trials were required to develop evidence-based protocols to reduce morbidity and mortality in older people with PFF.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 33 64</xref> Given that keyhole spinal sacral fixation is already an established treatment option with a sound safety record, we propose that surgical management should be considered earlier in the treatment of PFF in older people admitted to hospital. This is to maximise early pain management with the aim of preventing pain-related immobilisation and its short and long-term consequences.</p>
              <p>In order to ensure that the outcome of a clinical trial in this area has a high level of validity, it must be delivered within the constraints of the existing healthcare service, where the burden of patient care falls. This feasibility trial, delivered within this existing healthcare service, will analyse the outcomes posed by some of these constraints, to ensure that a future definitive trial is able to answer the clinical question efficiently. The inclusion of an economic evaluation will also demonstrate whether surgical fixation offers value for money as well as clinical effectiveness, an important consideration for existing services.</p>
              <p>Potential limitations of delivering a clinical trial of this kind within an active healthcare service include identification of the sacral fractures themselves. Any patient presenting with an anterior pelvic ring fracture would need to be referred for further imaging in order to identify sacral fractures and thus be considered within the eligibility criteria for this trial. However, as standard care for patients presenting with PFF is currently conservative care, clinicians may feel that further imaging would not change a patientâs treatment course and thus be an unnecessary expense. As an identified sacral fracture is a key requirement for the eligibility criteria, this clinician assessment may significantly affect recruitment.</p>
              <p>The target cohort in question may also provide further recruitment barrier. Cognitive impairment is common (up to 67%) in older patients presenting to hospital with PFF.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 17 25</xref> As these patients confer such a large proportion of the real world PFF cohort, it would severely affect the validity of the trial to exclude them. Therefore, we have included a consent process for those patients that lack capacity. Identification is by AMT as a surrogate marker of capacity, which is completed as part of the clinical assessment of all admitted patients and therefore does not add any unnecessary burden prior to recruitment. Patients without capacity are reliant on the presence of relatives or carers to act as personal consultees, which may add a logistics barrier and reduce the recruitment of this subset of participants. Participants with cognitive impairment that are recruited may also be less likely to complete data collection due to difficulty with engagement, introduce detection bias due to issues with recall and may be more likely to be lost to follow-up.</p>
              <p>Even once randomised, our participants remain under the existing healthcare serviceâs care for the entirety of the trial and are therefore at risk of protocol deviations due to the pragmatic setting of the study. The final decision to receive any intervention remains the responsibility of the patientâs clinical teams. For participants in the surgical intervention group, the decision to operate remains with the surgical team and may be susceptible to influence from factors such as surgeon experience and preference, belief in the clinical equipoise and theatre availability. Participants in the non-surgical (standard care) group may still be reviewed for surgical intervention based on clinical need identified by their clinical team, as determined by current practice. In order to assess the effect of this limitation, quantification and analysis of adherence to randomisation is an important outcome of this feasibility study.</p>
              <p>An area of confounding not specifically assessed in this feasibility trial is the possibility of variation in the usual care received by all participants in both groups. This is not set by the protocol and while minimised by using a single site setting, where staff are working from the same local guidelines, resources and practices, variation is likely inevitable due to the non-regimented workings of a real-world healthcare service. The effect of these innate differences could be further minimised by using analysis of variation in outcome measures from this feasibility trial in order to power a future definitive trial appropriately.</p>
              <p>This study is not powered to test the hypotheses, but the data collected will be able to provide a descriptive analysis on effectiveness of outcomes in order to inform analysis in a future definitive trial. The key outcomes address questions posed by the possible limitations of conducting such a trial within an existing public health service, specifically to recruitment and adherence to randomisation. The future aim is that the feasibility trial will advise a valid and fully powered randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that surgical intervention in PFF is of clinical benefit to patients as well as being cost effective and safe.</p>
