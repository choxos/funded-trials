                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Restricted and repetitive behaviours vary greatly across the autism spectrum, and although not all are problematic some can cause distress and interfere with learning and social opportunities. We have, alongside parents, developed a parent group based intervention for families of young children with autism, which aims to offer support to parents and carers; helping them to recognise, understand and learn how to respond to their child’s challenging restricted repetitive behaviours.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study is a clinical and cost-effectiveness, multi-site randomised controlled trial of the Managing Repetitive Behaviours (MRB) parent group intervention versus a psychoeducation parent group Learning About Autism (LAA) (<italic>n</italic> = 250; 125 intervention/125 psychoeducation; ~ 83/site) for parents of young children aged 3–9 years 11 months with a diagnosis of autism.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">All analyses will be done under intention-to-treat principle. The primary outcome at 24 weeks will use generalised estimating equation (GEE) to compare proportion of children with improved RRB between the MRB group and the LAA group. The GEE model will account for the clustering of children by parent groups using exchangeable working correlation. All secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar way using appropriate distribution and link function.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The economic evaluation will be conducted from the perspective of both NHS costs and family access to local community services. A ‘within trial’ cost-effectiveness analysis with results reported as the incremental cost per additional child achieving at least the target improvement in CGI-I scale at 24 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">This is an efficacy trial to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a parent group based intervention designed to help parents understand and manage their child’s challenging RRB. If found to be effective, this intervention has the potential to improve the well-being of children and their families, reduce parental stress, greatly enhance community participation and potential for learning, and improve longer-term outcomes.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p id="Par34">Autism spectrum disorder (hereafter, ‘autism’) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition affecting 1–2% of the population, with profound impact on diagnosed individuals, families, and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB) are one of two key behavioural domains required for a diagnosis of autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They include repetitive motor mannerisms, rigid adherence to specific routines, highly circumscribed interests and extreme responses to everyday sensory experiences. Some RRBs are reported by autistic adults to be enjoyable, functional and helpful. They may provide a basis for friendship and can also build areas of strength, supporting skill development and yielding employment opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, RRB may also be outward signs of anxiety or distress, deserving of attention and care from others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In some cases, RRB in children can have a distressing and negative impact for the child and their family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. RRB can interfere with learning opportunities, community participation, aspects of health such as sleep and nutrition, and deplete child, parent, and sibling wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Examples observed by practitioners include an elaborate and rigid bedtime routine lasting 3 h or more, a restricted diet of only 5 different foods and a repetitive pattern of pinching members of the public.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Here we use the term ‘challenging RRB’ to describe behaviours that fit the diagnostic description of a restricted and repetitive behaviour and that cause significant challenges for the child and in daily family life. A recent meta-analysis indicates that parents of autistic children experience higher levels of stress than parents of children with other disabilities and that stress is highly correlated with the presence of challenging RRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The impact is greater if parents/carers are not able to access appropriate advice and support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Challenging RRB may also incur direct risk of injury for the autistic child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They can take up large amounts of time, interfere with the child’s ability to engage in everyday living activities (e.g. personal care, mealtimes) and reduce access to learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Challenging RRBs are associated with increased rates of disruptive behaviours and aggression to others, which can further isolate the child and family and contribute to negative stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">Parents report they do not receive specific professional advice on how to recognise or understand their child’s challenging RRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is therefore critical that parents are supported to understand the different forms, functions and impact of RRB. They need to be able to distinguish possible underlying reasons for RRB and to identify those RRB that have the potential for deleterious impact on their child. They require evidence-based, effective and efficient strategies to specifically address challenging RRB. Such interventions, if found to be effective, have the potential to improve the well-being of autistic children and their families, reduce parental stress, greatly enhance community participation and potential for learning and improve longer-term outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par37">In the UK, the National Service Framework for Disabled Children and Young People and those with Complex Health Needs highlights the potential impact of care for parents of children with autism, and the need for effective and efficient, evidence-based parent training interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The evidence base for the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions for young children with autism has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, to date, most autism-specific early intervention programmes focus on social communication and rarely consider challenging repetitive behaviours despite this area being a priority for parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, a systematic review on effectiveness of treatments for RRB in ASD has established that strategies that involve understanding the behaviour were promising but lacked a sufficient evidence, as the majority of studies used single case designs and focused solely on stereotypy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Stereotypy is one specific type of RRB that is also less likely to be perceived as challenging. A review of trial databases (USNIH and UKCTG) indicates no current behavioural intervention trial registered for RRB (2020). There is one recently completed trial (completed Feb 2019) that aims to use mobile technology to reduce stereotypy (repetitive vocal and motor behaviours) in children with autism and is thus not relevant to the current trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">The Managing Repetitive Behaviours (MRB) parent group intervention and study protocol were developed jointly in partnership with parents of young children with autism initially through two developmental parent groups. The intervention was designed to help parents recognise, understand and manage their child’s RRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The development work was followed by a pilot feasibility and acceptability randomised controlled trial (RCT). The results of the feasibility and acceptability pilot indicated that the MRB intervention was both acceptable to parents and feasible to deliver through routine clinical services. If effective, this intervention has the potential to extend the range of early interventions available to meet the needs of young children with autism and their families, ensuring best use of therapeutic resources and reducing the risk that challenging RRB persist with significant long-term consequences for the child and family. However, before recommending that this parent group intervention is included within local community early intervention services, a fully powered clinical- and cost-effectiveness RCT is required to rule out harmful effects of the intervention and quantify any benefit. This study is a phase 3 superiority trial, with a parallel group design in which each family is randomised 1:1 to one of the two parent group interventions.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par39">This study is a UK three-site, two-group RCT. After consent families will be randomised at each site to receive either the 8-week MRB parent group intervention or the 8-week Learning About Autism (LAA) parent group equivalent to best current practice and will act as an attentional control for time and attention. Assessments are administered on entry (baseline) to the trial, at the end of the eight parent group sessions (10 weeks), at 24 weeks primary endpoint and at the 52 weeks follow-up.</p>

                <title>Study aims</title>
                <p id="Par40">The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Managing Repetitive Behaviours (MRB) parent group intervention for young children with autism compared with a parent autism psychoeducation group, at 10, 24 and 52 weeks follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The clinical effectiveness of this intervention will be assessed by measuring whether children show an overall improvement in global functioning (primary outcome) at 24 weeks (primary endpoint) after the MRB intervention compared to the children whose parents had attended the LAA group. There are a number of secondary outcomes (measured at the end of the intervention and at 24-week follow-up), these include whether (i) parents increase their knowledge and skills in understanding and managing their child’s challenging RRB; (ii) children show a reduction in challenging RRB, and change in participation in everyday activities, parent stress and impact on family life; (iii) the intervention provides value for money for the NHS; and (iv) these improvements are maintained at 1 year from baseline.</p>
                <p id="Par42">We have carefully selected end of group and follow-up (24 and 52 weeks) outcome measures to capture both independent (blinded researcher), teacher and parent-reported changes. These include blinded ratings of improvement in child’s overall functioning (assessed using Clinical Global Impressions–Improvement (CGI-I)) and change in challenging RRB. Parent questionnaires will also provide information on child RRB, child participation and daily living skills, parent stress, self-efficacy and impact on family life. Parents will be aware of group status but teachers and the primary outcome assessor will be blind to group allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par43">We will evaluate maintenance of effect at the 52-week follow-up appointment which will also allow us to investigate any potential longer-term (downstream) impact on child and family functioning (e.g. social participation).</p>

                <p id="Par44">The MRB and the LAA parent groups will all take place in community settings in different geographical locations across the three UK sites: in Tyne and Wear, The Lothians and Teesside. This is in line with the UK National CAMHS Review (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which indicated young people and families want accessible services in convenient places.</p>

                <title>Managing Repetitive Behaviour (MRB) intervention</title>
                <p id="Par45">MRB is a manualised intervention designed to help parents of young children with ASD to recognise, understand and learn how to manage their child’s challenging RRB. It is an 8-week manualised intervention designed to be delivered by community-based professionals with knowledge and experience of working with young children with ASD and their families who have been trained to deliver the MRB intervention. Each weekly session lasts for approximately 2 h (total duration of group intervention is ~ 16 h).</p>
                <p id="Par46">Each parent will be provided with a manual, related weekly materials and individualised support to identify strategies to address challenging RRBs. ‘At home’ activities will be set each week for parents and children to complete between sessions. The opportunity to identify and practice new ideas outside of the clinic setting is important for investigating how best to generalise the approach into different settings for each child and family.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Parents have the opportunities for individual support and group learning. In weeks 2 and 7, they meet the group leaders individually to select a target challenging RRB to focus on during the group and to practise the new skills they are learning, thus ensuring that strategies are individually tailored for each child and are developmentally appropriate.</p>

                <title>Learning About Autism (LAA) parent group</title>
                <p id="Par48">LAA is an 8-week manualised parent psychoeducation group that will act as an attentional control. LAA is designed for parents of young children with autism and focuses on understanding what autism is, and provides support for parents of young children with autism. It is designed to be run in the community with professionals who have experience of working with young children with autism and their families, and have been trained by a UK-based autism charity, the National Autistic Society, to deliver the intervention. Each weekly session lasts for approximately 2 h (total duration of group intervention is ~ 16 h).</p>
                <p id="Par49">The groups will offer parents and carers psychoeducation on understanding autism and what that means for their individual child such as helping them understand their child’s social communication difficulties and behaviour in different environments. It will also provide advice and guidance on strategies and approaches for dealing with behaviour problems in young children with ASD. There will be opportunities for mutual support and sharing of ideas with other parents. Thus increasing parents’ and carers’ understanding, confidence and responsiveness to their child’s patterns of communication and interaction. This is equivalent to current best practice. It will not include any specific information about the role and functions of RRB, functional analysis and tailored strategies to manage challenging RRB.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and eligibility criteria</title>
                <p id="Par50">Families will be identified via local community National Health Service (NHS) clinical services. Clinicians are asked to introduce the study to families fitting the inclusion criteria, discuss the study with them and if interested give them study packs. For some clinical services where children may not be seen as frequently, postal study packs will be sent to identified families. Interested parents are asked to complete and return to the research team an expression of interest form. The research team will then contact parents they are interested in hearing more about the study to arrange a face-to-face meeting to discuss the study, what participation involves, answer any questions they may have, and obtain written informed consent.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Parents are eligible for study entry if their child meets the following criteria: (1) aged 3–9 years 11 months at the time of consent with a clinical diagnosis of autism or autism spectrum disorder; (2) experience challenging RRB. Parents themselves will have (1) sufficient spoken and written English to provide written informed consent, complete assessments, and participate in the intervention; (2) are willing to be randomised and attend all group sessions for the allocated arm of the study; and (3) agree to maintain their child’s current medication regime until the primary 24-week end point (clinician changes to medication are permitted). Parents are not eligible for study entry if their child meets the following criteria: (1) no clinical diagnosis of autism or ASD; (2) no challenging RRB (3) is currently taking part in another parent group based intervention trial; or (4) has a sibling already taking part in this study. Furthermore, children of parents who have significant mental health difficulties will not be eligible to participate. There will be no special criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions.</p>

                <title>Training and fidelity</title>
                <p id="Par52">All parent group sessions in both arms of the trial will be recorded, both to facilitate opportunities for supervision of the group leaders and to provide access to a random sample of recorded sessions across all sites for the independent evaluation of (i) the fidelity to the delivery of the intervention and (ii) the therapeutic competence of the individual group leaders’ delivery of this manualised intervention. Fidelity will be formally assessed by independent raters watching 10% of randomly selected tapes and utilising the MRB Fidelity Rating Scale as developed during the pilot feasibility and acceptability study with adaptations for the content of the LAA parent groups.</p>
                <p id="Par53">At the start of the research, the group leaders and site clinical leads will attend a 1 day MRB training course learning how to use the training manual and the materials for each 2 h weekly session and planning for homework tasks. Each group leader will learn about group processes and gain skills to deliver the manualised intervention in a participatory style, in combination with strategies to personalise the programme for each parent. The senior trainer (LD) alongside the chief investigator (VG) will deliver the introductory training course. LD will also visit each site as each new group is started. Furthermore, to ensure the intervention is being delivered to the families as intended with high fidelity to the manual, the senior trainer will alongside the local site clinical lead, will undertake weekly supervision of group leaders at each site. Group Leaders delivering the LAA parent group will attend a 1-day training course specifically designed for this study to ensure they are trained in the skills needed to deliver the programme. This course has been designed by the National Autistic Society and will be delivered by DG.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Parent attendance at group sessions will be recorded and monitored. Parents who miss a parent group session will be contacted by a group leader to provide a brief catch up of session and handouts for that session will be posted out. Therapy compliance and receipt of other interventions outside of the protocol will be monitored.</p>

                <title>Avoidance of contamination</title>
                <p id="Par55">There will be separate clinical and research leads at each site and separate training and supervision structures. Researchers will be located separately from staff involved in delivery of the MRB and LAA intervention. Research interviews and assessments will be conducted mostly at home visits, with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) being undertaken at University sites. All parents will be reminded prior to every contact with research staff not to talk about group allocation. Furthermore, we will also consider issues around potential contamination of the active attentional control LAA group, by ensuring the LAA families are not on the case load of the MRB intervention group leaders. The clinical and research leads in the trial are experienced in studies of this type and therefore able to take steps to discern any potential risk of contamination bias and avoid it.</p>

The same model will be applied to the data at week 52, which will be analysed as longitudinal data incorporating data at baseline and 24 weeks. All binary or categorical secondary outcomes will be analysed using generalised estimating equations.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par102">The design will take a rigorous scientific approach by utilising a three-site, two-group randomised controlled design comparing two active parent group interventions. This study will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Managing Repetitive Behaviours (MRB) parent group intervention compared with the Learning About Autism psychoeducation parent group. The Learning About Autism (LAA) parent group, delivered by staff trained by The National Autistic Society, and equivalent to best current practice, allows us to control for the non-specific social group benefit of mutual sharing of experience and support between parents.</p>
              <p id="Par103">Parent group based interventions provide opportunities for mutual learning and sharing of ideas, allowing parents to discuss how best to support their child’s development. This fosters opportunities for parents to learn from and support each other, in turn building parents’ knowledge and confidence to support their child’s needs. However, in our MRB parent group intervention, we have included targeted support on challenging restricted and repetitive behaviours that are interfering in a deleterious way for the child. There is some information on restricted and repetitive behaviours in the LAA parent group but MRB focuses more on assisting parents to understand the role that RRB may have in their autistic child’s life. In this way, we anticipate that MRB will have a greater beneficial effect on reducing identified challenging RRB and improving child overall wellbeing.</p>
              <p id="Par104">Moreover, we will evaluate whether providing parents with the skills to effectively understand their child’s challenging RRB has a greater effect on parental wellbeing, sense of competence, reducing stress and improving family cohesion than a general autism psychoeducation parent group. In this way, the results from this RCT have the potential to help autism researchers explore the active ingredients of clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="Par105">We have carefully considered in collaboration with parents and professionals the utility of the outcome measures chosen to assess the effects of the intervention on challenging RRB, overall child functioning and parent and family wellbeing. We have taken a rigorous approach to outcome assessment with independent objective measures, where possible. We are aware of limitations in autism research from over reliance on unblinded parental report measures and have therefore included other outcome measures such as teacher-rated outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par106">If found to be effective and efficient in the proposed evaluation study, this early parent group based intervention targeting challenging RRB has the potential to fill an identified but unmet need and thus improve the wellbeing of autistic children and their families, reduce parental stress, greatly enhance community participation, increase learning opportunities and improve longer-term outcomes.</p>

                <title>COVID-19 addendum</title>
                <p id="Par107">Following the announcement from the government on 23rd March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a strict UK lockdown was imposed, with implications for all clinical services and research trials across the UK. For our Managing Repetitive Behaviours (MRB) randomised controlled trial (RCT) this has meant a great deal of innovative creative thinking to design a revised research protocol for the conduct of all aspects of the research and the delivery of the two parent group based interventions. The aim was to ensure that recruited families and all the clinical and research staff were safe and that all our procedures were compliant with national government guidance documents and the required health and safety recommendations and procedures from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the Department of Health. With support from the research sponsor and funder an agreed plan to do assessments remotely, and run parent groups online was made.</p>
                <p id="Par108">A key priority for our clinical research team was to continue to keep the study open, to maintain as best as we could the integrity of the study and retain recruited families to the end of the trial despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are aware that families of autistic children are facing additional challenges in light of COVID-19 with reduced access to support and services. This was an added reason to remain in contact with families recruited to our study. We heard from parents that many children are finding changes to their usual routines very challenging and that there was a disproportionate impact on families caring for autistic children. This is important information that may impact on the conduct and results of this RCT. For all these reasons we were very keen to keep in touch with our recruited families for the duration of these challenging times. However, we also needed to take proactive precautions to protect the health of all the families in the trial and our staff in line with recommendations from the government, NHS and NIHR and comply with local site restrictions, which varied between sites. The trial team have worked with all sites, sponsor and funder to ensure the most appropriate actions have been taken.</p>
                <p id="Par109">The Trial Management Group with sponsor support on 26th March 2020, agreed all study activities would be performed remotely by sites wherever possible. Following this, we implemented non-substantial amendment 08 (NS08) on 3rd April 2020 as sponsor category C to reflect remote working changes with protocol version 06.</p>

              <p>We are extremely grateful to all the parents of autistic children, who have over the past 10 years actively collaborated with us to improve the intervention and research design. We also gratefully acknowledge the valued contribution of all the participating families in the study, and referring clinicians who have helped us with recruitment. It really has been a team effort, and without everyone’s support, we would not have been able to undertake this large fully powered multi-site research trial.</p>

              <p>All data in the trial will be anonymised. A central master file will be held by the trial manager at the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit. This will contain the key linking anonymised trial name to personal details. This eCRF pack will be backed up securely within the web-based data entry service of Newcastle University CTU. All data will be entered into the Newcastle CTU web-based secure MACRO database which has a full audit trail and appropriate quality control will be carried out during the trial and before the database lock. Primary analysis of the data will take place in Durham University, by the trial statistician. The datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request and COREC informed.</p>
