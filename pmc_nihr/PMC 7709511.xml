                  <p>Smoking reduction can lead to increased success in quitting. This study aims to determine if a client-focused motivational support package for smoking reduction (and quitting) and increasing (or otherwise using) physical activity (PA) can help smokers who do not wish to quit immediately to reduce the amount they smoke, and ultimately quit. This paper reports the study design and methods.</p>

                  <p>A pragmatic, multicentred, parallel, two group, randomised controlled superiority clinical trial, with embedded process evaluation and economics evaluation. Participants who wished to reduce smoking with no immediate plans to quit were randomised 1:1 to receive either (1) tailored individual health trainer face-to-face and/or telephone support to reduce smoking and increase PA as an aid to smoking reduction (intervention) or (2) brief written/electronic advice to reduce or quit smoking (control). Participants in both arms of the trial were also signposted to usual local support for smoking reduction and quitting. The primary outcome measure is 6-month carbon monoxide-confirmed floating prolonged abstinence following participant self-reported quitting on a mailed questionnaire at 3 and 9 months post-baseline. Participants confirmed as abstinent at 9 months will be followed up at 15 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Smoking remains the main cause of preventable morbidity and premature death in high-income nations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The annual cost of smoking in England is estimated to be £11 billion to society, of which £2.5 billion is to the National Health Service (NHS) in England.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Tobacco control policies and individually targeted interventions have helped to reduce the UK population smoking prevalence rate to 14.7%,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but prevalence varies considerably by socioeconomic and mental health status, contributing to growing health inequalities.</p>
              <p>The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Public Health No. 10 guidelines<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> for smoking cessation focus on identifying a quit date and abrupt cessation, with a recognition of the importance of motivational support to supplement pharmacological support. For those not intending to quit immediately, smoking reduction may lead to more quit attempts and subsequent successful abstinence, though there are limitations in the evidence<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> with a wide range of approaches to reduction (eg, pharmacological, behavioural support and self-initiated approaches). Motivational support appears to have the potential to support reduction in smoking, and the greater the reduction the greater the likelihood of successful quitting.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>The English Smoking Toolkit Study (2011–2014) suggests there is interest in smoking reduction, rather than immediately quitting, among 50% of smokers, and approximately 30% of UK smokers report using e-cigarettes to do so.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Other evidence-based approaches to self-regulate smoking are needed as there remains uncertainty over the safety of e-cigarettes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There is considerable interest in encouraging smokers to acutely and chronically use physical activity (PA) to manage smoking<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> though a recent systematic review revealed only 1 of 24 randomised controlled trials provided evidence that an exercise programme can aid abstinence for at least 6 months<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> among those attempting to quit. That said, most studies were of low quality and focused on proof of concept, rather than being pragmatic and offering an acceptable and feasible intervention for smokers more generally.</p>
              <p>A unique randomised pilot study provided promising support for short-term effects of a behavioural support intervention offered by a health trainer for increasing PA and smoking reduction on cigarettes smoked and abstinence.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Previous studies<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> have reported that a self-determination-based intervention to support autonomy and perceived competence for smokers can facilitate long-term smoking abstinence, and this approach was embedded in the pilot intervention. Intervention participants had an average 4.2 sessions by phone or face-to-face with the health trainer, with a range of 0–8 sessions. Compared with the control group, they were significantly more likely to achieve at least a 50% reduction in number of cigarettes smoked (39% vs 20%), to attempt to quit (22% vs 6%), and be abstinent up to 8 weeks after quit day (14% vs 4%) and at 16 weeks (10% vs 4%). A higher proportion of the intervention group also reported using PA for controlling smoking: 55% vs 22% and 37% vs 16%, at 8 and 16 weeks, respectively.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The intervention costs were approximately £192 per participant and exploratory cost-effectiveness modelling indicates that the intervention may be cost-effective.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>PA is likely to influence smoking behaviour through both implicit and explicit processes.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A smoker could focus on becoming physically active which in turn has emotional benefits which may implicitly reduce cognitive and emotional triggers for smoking. Exercise may also be explicitly used to acutely manage cigarette cravings and withdrawal symptoms,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> and chronically manage weight gain associated with smoking reduction or help in a shift towards a healthier identity.</p>
              <p>In prospective population surveys and trials, weight gain and fear of weight gain is associated with reluctance to quit smoking and remain abstinent, especially among women and initially heavier smokers,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> with a meta-analysis study reporting an average of 4.67 kg (95% CI: 3.96 to 5.38) gained after 12 months of abstinence.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There is evidence that PA is effective for preventing long-term weight gain after smoking cessation,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> not only by increased energy expenditure and metabolic rate, but also through self-regulation of energy intake, particularly emotional snacking.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Finally, as a result of increasing PA, a smoker may begin to establish a different identity (eg, investing in personal fitness and generally becoming a ‘healthy person’), which in turn may trigger a desire to reduce harm from smoking through reduction and ultimately quitting.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>Following a successful pilot study<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there is a need to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural support for increasing PA and reducing smoking on longer term abstinence among smokers not immediately ready to quit.</p>

              <p>The overarching aim of the trial is to determine if an individually tailored behavioural intervention for smokers wishing to reduce but not immediately quit provides an effective and cost-effective approach to supporting increases in PA and smoking reduction, resulting in increased rates of quit attempts and subsequent 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence.</p>

                <p>Potential participants were approached from primary and secondary care establishments and also from the community. Participants were adult smokers (≥18 years) who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day (for at least 1 year), wished to reduce smoking but not quit immediately. We accepted smokers who were also using other nicotine-containing or other cigarette management products. Smokers were ineligible if they were unable to engage in at least 15 min of moderate intensity PA, had any illness or injury that might be exacerbated by exercise, were unable to engage in the study and/or the intervention due to language or for other reasons (eg, provide an unacceptable level of risk to the health trainer or researcher). All ineligible smokers were referred for smoking cessation advice in line with local usual practice.</p>

                  <p>A broad range of participant identification and approach methods were employed in an attempt to reach many different demographic groups and make the study as inclusive as possible. The most common approach method was through a search of a primary care practice patient database, with invitations sent to patients who were listed as smokers offering them the chance to get in touch with the trial team. In the early phase of recruitment, a study within a trial was conducted at general practitioner (GP) practices at one research site, to compare the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of three different invitation methods (full information pack, single-page invite, text message).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Other approaches were via secondary healthcare and stop-smoking services (for those who had failed to quit), and by social media, pharmacies, dental practices, community organisations and local businesses using posters and leaflets.</p>
                  <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> (participant flow chart), smokers expressing interest in the trial were screened for eligibility by researchers at each site.

                  <p>Participants were individually randomised to either the intervention or control group (1:1 ratio) following completion of baseline assessments, to ensure concealment was preserved. Randomisation was achieved by means of a 24-hour web-based system created by the UKCRC-registered Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) in conjunction with a statistician independent from the trial team, and used random permuted blocks, with stratification for recruitment site and a dichotomised low/high score derived from the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The HSI score is calculated from summing responses to two questions:</p>
                  <list list-type="order">
                    <list-item>
                      <p>When the first cigarette is smoked after waking, scored as &gt;60 min (score 0); 31–60 min (1); 6–30 min (2) and within 5 min (3).</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item>
                      <p>How many cigarettes are smoked in a typical day, scored as ≤10 cigarettes (0); 11–20 cigarettes (1); 21–30 cigarettes (2); &gt;30 cigarettes (3).</p>
                    </list-item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Total HSI scores of 0–4 were categorised as low, and 5–6 were considered high for the purposes of stratification.</p>
                  <p>Following randomisation, all participants were sent a letter from the coordinating CTU confirming which trial arm they had been assigned to, and a guidance sheet on usual support locally for smoking reduction and cessation. The participant’s GP was also sent a letter notifying them that one of their patients is participating in the study.</p>

                  <title>Blinding</title>
                  <p>It was not possible to blind participants to their allocated group. Every effort was made to ensure that the trial team remained blind to the allocation of each participant when collecting follow-up data (including researchers collecting carbon monoxide (CO) measurements), but this was not always possible. Health trainers delivering the intervention were obviously aware of the participant’s allocation to trial arm, but were discouraged from communicating with site researchers about this. Questionnaire booklets and accelerometers were mailed out from and returned to the CTU without knowledge of trial arm allocation.</p>

                  <title>Follow-up</title>
                  <p>At 3 and 9 months post-baseline all participants are posted a questionnaire booklet and a freepost envelope to return the completed booklet to the CTU. A £20 shopping voucher is mailed to participants on CTU receipt of the completed booklets at both 3 and 9 months. To increase response rates, motivational postcards are mailed to participants before the follow-up questionnaires are sent out. Up to two reminder letters are issued (and a further three telephone calls as required) to remind participants to return the questionnaire booklets, and the option of the participant telephoning a member of the research team to aid completion of the booklets is offered. Participants are given the option to just complete the key questions about smoking behaviour if the questionnaire booklet is not returned to the CTU within 2 weeks and to submit these responses by email, phone or text if preferred to maximise follow-up data on key outcomes. If participants do not complete the key questions (regardless of method) within a 4-week window, they are categorised as not completing follow-up at that time point.</p>
                  <p>All participants who report having made a quit attempt in the questionnaire booklet and not smoked since that date at 3 and 9 months are contacted for biochemical verification of abstinence.</p>
                  <p>At 3 months post-baseline, approximately 20% of participants were sent wrist-worn waterproof accelerometer (GeneActive Original accelerometer, Activinsights, Kimbolton, UK, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneactiv.org/">http://www.geneactiv.org/</ext-link>) with instructions to wear constantly for 1 whole week (day and night), and a freepost return envelope to be sent to the CTU. To maximise data completeness, participants scheduled to receive an accelerometer were sent a standardised letter from the CTU, 2 weeks before receiving the accelerometer, advising them that they would shortly be receiving the device, and asking them to inform the CTU if they were unable to wear it. A letter was sent to participants who did not object to wearing the device, 3 days into the 10-day recording period prompting participants to start wearing the device if they had not already done so. Up to two reminder letters and a follow-up phone call were made to participants if they did not return the accelerometer.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>The TARS intervention was based on the intervention developed for the EARS pilot trial, with further refinement based on feedback from the EARS process evaluation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Throughout the development of the intervention for the EARS and TARS studies, we engaged with smokers from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds to ensure an acceptable person-centred approach was embedded.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the pilot trial and before commencing the definitive trial, we conducted individual and focus group discussions with smoking-cessation practitioners, researchers, public health consultants, community workers (including volunteers) and people who currently or previously smoked. We reviewed literature on using exercise as an aid to quitting, and consulted with academic experts on behaviour change for physical activity, smoking reduction and smoking cessation. These activities informed the intervention principles and theoretical basis, structure and delivery.</p>
                  <p>The intervention aimed to be empowering and put the client at the centre of the decision-making process. All aspects were designed to promote self-determined behaviour, focused on elements of self-determination theory which emphasises people’s sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref> This was in part achieved by adopting motivational interviewing principles<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> as the guiding delivery style for the practitioners which have been proposed to enhance and promote self-determined behaviour.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>
                  <p>An intervention delivery model, or ‘roadmap’, was developed between the pilot and definitive trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) to aid in the conceptualising of the intervention process and support the manualisation of the intervention and training of the practitioners. This was supported by the development of a set of ‘core competencies’ (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) developed from the pilot trial which outlined key processes, components and behaviour change techniques that the health trainers were expected to deliver and form the basis of fidelity assessment.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> A comprehensive training manual was developed, outlining all the skills, behaviour change techniques and strategies to support behaviour change intended for use in the TARS Study. This was used as the basis for a 3-day training course, which was delivered by TPT, AT, CG and LC. Health trainers then engaged with a wide range of ‘practice participants’ to complete their training. The health trainers attended regular (bi-weekly for the first 3 months and monthly thereafter) 2-hour formative feedback supervision teleconferences throughout the study period to help to embed skills and to benefit from each other’s shared experiences. Individual supervision for the health trainers was available as needed, provided by the intervention lead (TPT).</p>

                  <p>Participants allocated to the intervention arm were offered individually tailored behavioural support from a health trainer. The health trainer delivered the processes outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, with the option of up to eight weekly sessions, and a further six sessions if the participant wanted support after quitting, and aimed to empower participants to decide what support was offered, and where, when and for how long. Signposting to local smoking cessation support services was also offered to those wishing to quit. If a smoker wished to reduce smoking using e-cigarettes or licensed nicotine-containing products (LNCP), they were also offered any local available support for this.</p>
                  <p>Health trainers were appointed on the basis of having good communication skills, including empathy, and at least some training and experience in supporting health behaviour change. All health trainers had at least a first degree in a related field although this was not a prerequisite for the role. The health trainer was trained to support change in both smoking and PA and help individuals to make the connections between the two. As described in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, the core intervention processes that the health trainer was trained to deliver were: (1) building rapport and supporting autonomous behaviour change; (2) building motivation; (3) supporting self-monitoring and goal setting; (4) problem solving; (5) integrating smoking and PA behaviour; (6) supporting a health identity shift; (7) supporting the management of social influence on behaviours.</p>
                  <p>The support offered was broadly structured (based on delivering the processes outlined in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) but health trainers were trained to be flexible in their approach, to tailor it for individual needs and preferences. They were trained to do this using a person-centred approach and principles from motivational interviewing such as showing empathy and reflective listening.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> They were also trained to assess (and be aware of) participants’ needs in relation to the core psychological needs posited by Self-Determination Theory,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which we referred to in the training as ‘the three Cs’: Control (having choice/autonomy in decision-making around behaviour change); Competence (developing self-efficacy/building confidence in the ability to change) and Connectedness (social acceptance of the new behaviour/support from important others for making changes).</p>

Participants who were not abstinent at 3 months but have biochemically confirmed abstinence at 9 months will be contacted at 15 months to confirm floating prolonged abstinence of 6 months between 9 and 15 months. As a contingency measure for verification of abstinence during the COVID-19 outbreak, abstinence will be confirmed by saliva cotinine level &lt;12 ng/mL<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> using a mailed self-collection kit and assay provided by ABS Laboratories (York, UK, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.acmgloballab.com">www.acmgloballab.com</ext-link>). This contingency measure will apply to follow-up for secondary outcomes for a minority of participants. While the intervention is expected to primarily influence quitting in the first 3 months of the study, it is possible that a sustained quit attempt occurs after the 3-month assessment as a result of the health trainer building behaviour change skills which are used subsequently to reduce and then quit smoking.</p>

                <p>The economic analysis will be undertaken against a predefined health economics analysis plan, which is available on request.

In this analysis, EQ-5D-5L data will be used to estimate QALYS, deriving health state values at each time point, using the published tariff values for England (presently recommendations are for values to be derived using methods reported by van Hout <italic>et al)</italic>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and using the area under the curve approach.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Analyses will be based on an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, using a complete case analysis, and will assess uncertainty and include detailed sensitivity analyses.</p>

                <p>The recording and reporting of non-serious adverse events (AEs) in this low-risk study is not required. Serious AEs (SAEs) will be documented from the time of participant consent until a maximum of 8 weeks after the follow-up assessment at 9 months. A protocol for identifying, reporting and managing SAEs has been established by the CTU, in conjunction with the PMG, DMC and TSC, and conforms to the requirements of the trial sponsor and NHS REC.</p>

              <p>We appreciate the support of the study sponsor, University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. The study was led by researchers and managed by the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit (PenCTU) at the University of Plymouth. We are indebted to Dr Helen Hancocks for her contribution to the TARS Study as PenCTU Clinical Trial Manager; sadly Helen passed away suddenly on 24th January 2019. We thank Doug Webb (PenCTU Assistant Trial Manager) for helping to develop the protocol, and acknowledge Jonny Wilks (PenCTU Data Manager) for TARS data management. Our thanks go to all organisations involved in recruitment, and especially those working in primary and secondary care and in local stop-smoking services. We thank James Davies and Will Moyle for preparing the search code for identifying potential participants within primary care. We acknowledge the contribution of the health trainers in delivering the intervention: Alix Covenant, Stephanie Erivo, Gemma Fox, Alex Gude, Sarah Kennedy, Amanda Perry, Lucy Porter and Charlotte Wahlich. We gratefully acknowledge the members of our Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for their valuable support and guidance. TSC members: Professor Marcus Munafo (Chair), Dr Stephanie MacNeill, Professor Amanda Amos and Dr Michael Callaghan (PPI representative). Sadly, Michael died having made a valuable contribution to the study. DMC members: Dr Rebecca Playle (Chair), Dr Charlie Foster and Dr Jamie Brown. Our sincerest thanks go to all the participants involved in the trial.</p>
