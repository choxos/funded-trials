                <p><bold>Objectives.</bold> Evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of joint protection and hand exercises for the management of hand OA is not well established. The primary aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) of these management options. In addition, given the absence of consensus regarding the conduct of economic evaluation alongside factorial trials, we compare different analytical methodologies.</p>
                <p><bold>Methods.</bold> A trial-based economic evaluation to assess the cost-utility of joint protection only, hand exercises only and joint protection plus hand exercises compared with leaflet and advice was undertaken over a 12 month period from a UK National Health Service perspective. Patient-level mean costs and mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for each trial arm. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed. The base case analysis used a within-the-table analysis methodology. Two further methods were explored: the at-the-margins approach and a regression-based approach with or without an interaction term.</p>
                <p><bold>Results.</bold> Mean costs (QALYs) were Â£58.46 (<sc>s.d.</sc> 0.662) for leaflet and advice, Â£92.12 (<sc>s.d.</sc> 0.659) for joint protection, Â£64.51 (<sc>s.d.</sc> 0.681) for hand exercises and Â£112.38 (<sc>s.d.</sc> 0.658) for joint protection plus hand exercises. In the base case, hand exercises were the cost-effective option, with an ICER of Â£318 per QALY gained. Hand exercises remained the most cost-effective management strategy when adopting alternative methodological approaches.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> This is the first trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of occupational therapy-supported approaches to self-management for hand OA. Our findings showed that hand exercises were the most cost-effective option.</p>

              <p>Hand OA is a common condition that affects a large proportion of the population aged 45 years and over [<xref rid="keu389-B1" ref-type="bibr">1â3</xref>]. OA places a strain on scarce resources; for example, in a recent study, the total annual direct cost of OA in the USA was estimated to be double that of similar patients who did not have OA [<xref rid="keu389-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the UK, the total health care cost of OA is estimated at more than Â£1 billion (2010 prices) [<xref rid="keu389-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Symptoms of hand OA include pain, stiffness and limited hand function [<xref rid="keu389-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and common management approaches include exercises, joint protection and topical agents for pain relief [<xref rid="keu389-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="keu389-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines recommend that joint protection and hand exercises should be offered in the management of hand OA [<xref rid="keu389-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, until recently there has been limited evidence to support the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these management options [<xref rid="keu389-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>A 2 Ã 2 multicentre factorial trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of joint protection and hand exercises for the management of hand OA. This trial design allowed for a simultaneous investigation of joint protection <italic>vs</italic> no joint protection and hand exercises <italic>vs</italic> no hand exercises [<xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In determining the cost-effectiveness of interventions, there is no consensus regarding how economic evaluations should be carried out alongside factorial trials. Recent research [<xref rid="keu389-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] has reported that economic evaluations alongside factorial trials have been carried out using a variety of methods, including within-the-table analysis, the at-the-margins approach and a regression-based approach [<xref rid="keu389-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study evaluates the cost-utility of joint protection and hand exercises for the management of hand OA and compares alternative methodological approaches for conducting economic evaluation alongside factorial trials.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The health economic evaluation was carried out alongside a multicentre 2 Ã 2 factorial randomized trial in older adults with hand OA. Details of the trial methodology have been published elsewhere [<xref rid="keu389-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adults aged 50 years and over who consented and who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups: leaflet and advice, joint protection only, hand exercises only and joint protection plus hand exercises. The primary clinical outcome of the trial was response to treatment [Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI)/OMERACT responder criteria] at 6 months [<xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The trial on which the present study is based was approved by the North West 7 Research Ethics Committee UK (rec reference: 07/H1008/235) and was monitored by an independent trial steering committee and a data monitoring committee (trial registration number ISRCTN 33870549).</p>
              <p>The economic evaluation reported here took the form of a cost-utility analysis from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the measure of health benefit. QALYs take into account the survival and quality of life of an individualâthe focus here was on the potential for quality of life gains from a reduction in hand pain and improvement in hand functioning due to the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Resource use and costs</title>
                  <p>Health care resource use data were obtained from participant responses to self-report questionnaires administered at 6 and 12 months. Resource use data concentrated on visits to health care professionals in primary and secondary care, medical investigations/interventions and prescribed medications. Resource use obtained from participant responses to the questionnaires were aggregated to generate overall resource use over the 12-month follow-up period. For the trial interventions, information was collected on the number and grades of staff involved and the equipment used to deliver each intervention, as well as the number of sessions each participant attended.</p>
                  <p>In order to value health care resource use, unit costs were obtained from a number of sources, including the British National Formulary, Unit Costs of Health and Social Care and NHS reference costs [<xref rid="keu389-B12" ref-type="bibr">12â14</xref>] and were applied to resource use items. To estimate the cost of each intervention, unit costs associated with equipment used for each intervention were obtained. For the purpose of costing staff time associated with each intervention, we used the average time of a session: 60 min for joint protection only and hand exercises only and 90 min for joint protection plus hand exercises [<xref rid="keu389-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

                  <p>Quality of life was measured at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months using the EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), a generic questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life. The UK value set [<xref rid="keu389-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was used to obtain EQ-5D index scores from participant responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire at each time point. These index scores were then used to calculate total QALYs over the 12-month period for every individual, using the analytical method described below.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The cost-utility analysis was carried out on an intention-to-treat basis, with the aim to estimate the difference in costs and QALYs between the four trial interventions; the exact nature of treatment comparisons is dependent on the methodological approach (discussed later in this section). Missing EQ-5D scores and costs at one or more of the time points were imputed using multiple imputation [<xref rid="keu389-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For each participant included in the study, a QALY score over the 12 month period was estimated using the area under the curve approach [<xref rid="keu389-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Total NHS costs over the 12 month period were calculated by multiplying the resource items used by the respective unit cost and summing over all items. Differences in mean costs and QALYs between trial arms were estimated, where appropriate (i.e. depending on the adopted methodology). Incremental QALY estimates were adjusted to control for imbalances in baseline utility between the interventions of interest [<xref rid="keu389-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated by dividing the difference in mean cost between two treatments by the difference in mean QALYs. Non-parametric bootstrapping was used to illustrate and quantify uncertainty. Five thousand paired estimates of mean differential costs and QALYs were estimated and presented graphically on a cost-effectiveness plane. To determine the probability of a treatment being deemed cost effective compared with an alternative treatment, a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) was constructed [<xref rid="keu389-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This shows the probability that an intervention is cost effective, relative to the chosen comparator, across a range of values that represent a decision makerâs willingness to pay for an additional QALY. All the analyses were carried out in STATA version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) [<xref rid="keu389-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Alternative analytical approaches</title>
                <p>Three methods were explored. Each method has been used for the analysis of clinical outcomes in factorial trials and recent evidence suggests that the methods can also be applied in economic evaluation [<xref rid="keu389-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Within-the-table analysis</title>
                  <p>A within-the-table analysis assumes that the interventions are mutually exclusive, i.e. the costs and effects of joint protection are influenced by the inclusion of hand exercises and vice versa, therefore each trial arm is treated separately with this approach. This approach formed the base case analysis and involved considering each treatment option individually. Interventions were ordered in terms of increasing cost, and cost and outcomes for each arm were compared incrementally. The most cost-effective option was selected based on the principles of dominance [where an intervention is less costly and more effective than the appropriate comparator(s)] and extended (weak) dominance (where an intervention is ruled out if the ICER is greater than that of a more effective intervention) [<xref rid="keu389-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>At-the-margins approach</title>
                  <p>This approach assumes that interventions are independent, i.e. the cost and outcomes of joint protection are not affected by whether hand exercises are included or not and vice versa. The approach also assumes that the effects of the treatments when used together are additive, i.e. there is no interaction between treatments [<xref rid="keu389-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and this approach considers the factorial trial as two separate two-arm trials [<xref rid="keu389-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For this analysis, cost and outcomes associated with participants who received hand exercises (alone or in combination with joint protection) were compared with those who did not receive hand exercises. Similarly cost and outcomes associated with participants who received joint protection (alone or in combination with hand exercises) were compared with those who did not receive joint protection.</p>

                  <title>Regression approach</title>
                  <p>Two separate analyses were carried out for the regression approach. First, it was assumed that there was no interaction between the treatments (joint protection and hand exercises), therefore an interaction term was not included in the regression model. The second analysis involved accounting for interactions between joint protection and hand exercises by including an interaction term in the regression model. In both cases the estimates of incremental cost and QALYs associated with hand exercises and joint protection were obtained from the regression output.</p>

                  <p>With this approach, joint protection was more costly and less effective than no joint protection, and therefore strongly dominated. Hand exercises were slightly more expensive than no hand exercises (difference in cost of Â£13.55) but were more effective. The resulting ICER was Â£1506/QALY gained, indicating that hand exercises is a cost-effective intervention (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keu389/-/DC1">supplementary Table S1</ext-link>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online). There was a 70% chance of hand exercises being cost effective at a Â£20 000 threshold (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keu389/-/DC1">supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online).</p>

                  <p>When interactions were ignored, hand exercises were cost effective, with an ICER of Â£1452/QALY gained, with a 70% chance of hand exercises being cost effective at a threshold of Â£20 000/QALY gained (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keu389/-/DC1">supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online). Joint protection was strongly dominated by no joint protection. When an interaction term was included in the regression model, this resulted in an ICER of Â£318/QALY gained when hand exercises were compared with no hand exercises, with an 80% chance of hand exercises being cost effective at the Â£20 000/QALY threshold (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keu389/-/DC1">supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online). Joint protection was again more costly and less effective than no joint protection and therefore strongly dominated (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/rheumatology/keu389/-/DC1">supplementary Table S2</ext-link>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> Online).</p>

              <p>We evaluated the cost-utility of joint protection and hand exercises for the management of hand OA and compared alternative methodological approaches for conducting economic evaluation alongside factorial trials. The results showed that hand exercises appear to be the most cost-effective option for the management of hand OA and remain cost effective regardless of the approach adopted for the economic analysis. However, the strength of evidence in favour of hand exercises varied with the analysis method adopted. All analytical approaches showed hand exercises to be the most cost-effective option, with ICERs ranging from Â£318 to Â£1506/QALY gained. The identical results obtained from the within-the-table approach and regression with an interaction term were expected since the inclusion of an interaction term in the regression model allows the estimation of main effects of joint protection and hand exercises while controlling for the interactions between them. Comparable results obtained from the at-the-margins approach and the regression without an interaction term have also been shown in a previous study [<xref rid="keu389-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p>
              <p>In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence uses a cost-effectiveness threshold of between Â£20 000 and Â£30 000/QALY gained to determine whether an intervention is cost effective [<xref rid="keu389-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which indicates that hand exercises are cost effective regardless of the analytical approach adopted.</p>
              <p>This is the first study to provide evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions for hand OA. In addition, the analysis considers a 12 month period, which allows for the identification of any longer-term impacts on quality of life and health care resource use, and although imputation was employed in the analysis, the rate of complete response to the health care resource use questions and EQ-5D questionnaire was reasonably high. Furthermore, the advantage of the factorial nature of the trial allowed us to compare four different management options within the same analysis. However, conducting an economic analysis alongside a factorial trial leads to a much reduced sample size for the base case health economic analysis, with four treatment options to compare. The majority of economic analyses alongside two-arm trials are underpowered due to the sample size being powered by differences in the primary clinical outcome rather than economic data. Therefore economic analyses alongside factorial trials are likely to have an even greater degree of uncertainty in the cost and outcome data.</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, no other study has assessed the cost-effectiveness of joint protection and hand exercises in hand OA. The clinical results of the trial on which the current analysis was based demonstrated that joint protection was the most clinically effective management strategy [<xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] at 6 months, although the between-group differences were not sustained at 12 months. It is important to note that the primary outcome measures differed between the clinical and cost-effectiveness studies, as did the time period assessed, i.e. incremental cost per QALY (with QALYs estimated using the EQ-5D) was the primary outcome measure for the economic analysis over 12 months, whereas the OARSI/OMERACT responder criterion over 6 months was the primary outcome measure for the clinical evaluation. Recent research has highlighted issues related to contradictory economic and clinical results [<xref rid="keu389-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Few studies have compared methods for the economic analysis of factorial trials, although results from recent work have shown that methods used for the economic analysis of factorial trials do matter and could change the results of a study [<xref rid="keu389-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The analyses reported in this article have demonstrated that the results were not altered by adopting different approaches, but it is important to point out that the results obtained in this study may not be generalizable to another disease area or context.</p>
              <p>Although the results showed that there was very little difference in QALYs between the treatment arms, the agreed approach in health economics is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, focussing on the joint estimation of costs and outcomes [<xref rid="keu389-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] rather than choosing the intervention of least cost. Therefore the results here favour hand exercises as the most cost-effective approach. This study raises the issue of the use of generic utility-based quality of life measures such as the EQ-5D. Even though generic measures are important in economic evaluation [<xref rid="keu389-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], they have also been shown to be insensitive in certain disease areas, such as patients with hearing impairment [<xref rid="keu389-B27" ref-type="bibr">27â30</xref>]. Previous studies have also shown that the EQ-5D is not very sensitive to subtle changes in OA in other joint sites [<xref rid="keu389-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The EuroQol group has now developed a five-level EQ-5D [<xref rid="keu389-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which may be more sensitive to changes in this disease area.</p>
              <p>As previously stated, there is still no consensus with regard to methods for conducting economic evaluation alongside factorial trials. In the clinical literature it has been suggested that the at-the-margins approach should only be used when interactions between treatments are not significant [<xref rid="keu389-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For this study, interactions between treatments were not significant, suggesting that the at-the-margins approach would be appropriate. However, it is possible that the study is not sufficiently powered to detect interactions between treatments. Problems associated with detecting interactions in factorial trials have been discussed elsewhere [<xref rid="keu389-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and there is a need for further research into methods for the economic analysis of factorial trials.</p>
              <p>Clinical guidelines, largely based on clinician expert consensus, recommend joint protection and hand exercises for people with hand OA [<xref rid="keu389-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The clinical results of the trial have demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of joint protection compared with no joint protection at 6 months [<xref rid="keu389-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The economic analysis further adds to the evidence base by demonstrating that hand exercises are a cost-effective option for the management of hand OA over a 12-month period. These findings therefore offer a choice for the patient and health professional in deciding the best approach for the management of hand OA.</p>
