                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">People with disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to visit the dentist for planned care, even though they have disproportionately poorer oral health. They are correspondingly more likely to experience dental problems and use urgent dental care, general practices and Accident and Emergency departments, which not only makes meeting their needs expensive, but, since these services often rely on prescriptions rather than addressing the clinical cause, can contribute to antimicrobial resistance.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The RETURN intervention has been developed with substantial community co-production, to be delivered opportunistically in urgent dental care settings. This brief intervention is delivered by dental nurses and involves material relevant to the ‘in-group’ targeted. The material includes booklets relating to barriers to planned dental visiting with corresponding short video clips featuring local people and including a modelling element. Dental nurses are trained to have supportive and non-judgemental conversations, assisting patients to set personal goals and action plans, which are reinforced in a follow-up text within a few weeks. A randomised controlled trial will be undertaken in 3 types of sites: dental practices delivering urgent care (a) within working hours, (b) out of hours, and (c) in a Dental Hospital. The trial will recruit 1180 adult urgent dental care users over 12 months, who have not visited a dentist for a planned care appointment for 2 years or more and do not have a dentist who they visit for routine care. It aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention and to explore whether the intervention has different effects across the socio-economic gradient. Participants will be followed up at 6, 12 and 18 months after randomisation. Co-primary outcomes are attendance at a dental practice for planned care within 12 months and self-reported oral health-related quality of life at 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is a pragmatic trial, evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention under the usual condition in which it might be applied. Since dental practices work as independent contractors to the NHS, this brings implementation and fidelity challenges which will be explored and described in embedded qualitative work.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par29">Dental diseases are both very common and expensive to treat, with costs amounting to an estimated $356.80 billion in treatment expenditures and $187.61 billion in productivity losses worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, an inverse care law exists whereby those who have the highest dental needs are the least likely to receive good quality care—a pattern which is both considerable and globally consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A social patterning of dental attendance exists where those from more deprived socio-economic backgrounds are less likely to visit a dentist for planned visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], even though poorer oral health disproportionately affects those at the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Several studies have shown that socio-economic inequalities in oral health are, at least some extent, mediated by dental attendance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A large body of evidence, including longitudinal studies, show that dental attendance is linked to better oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients who are regular dental attenders are also more likely to report fewer negative impacts of poor oral health on their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">As many as a third of the UK population report that they only attend a dentist when they have a problem, or never do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. While early studies tend to adopt a dichotomous distinction between regular and irregular attenders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], often based on dental attendance over the preceding 12 months, more recent studies have started to look at patterns in dental attendance in terms of the lifecourse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These studies show that only a minority of patients maintain dental attendance patterns consistently throughout their lives, and a small minority never visit a dentist. Consistent planned dental visits over the long term have been shown to be associated with better oral health, compared to patients who do not visit a dentist at present, but used to do so, or patients who have never regularly attended dental care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">Planned care refers to services for pre-arranged appointments as opposed to urgent care appointments. Planned care appointments are arranged relating to either an examination or check-up or a course of treatment (where further care is identified as needed following an examination). Regular check-ups are recommended so that an early diagnosis of oral disease can be made (dental caries, periodontal disease, oral cancer). These check-ups also allow for the detection of the oral manifestations of systemic disease and appropriate referral and establishing a therapeutic alliance (relationship) between the provider and patient which helps support patients’ adherence to preventive recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As well as monitoring patients’ oral health and allowing secondary prevention (limiting progression and effect of oral diseases at an early a stage, by, for example applying fluoride varnish to early demineralised lesions), check-up visits often incorporate a third role in primary prevention—influencing patient behaviour with a view to preventing oral diseases before they occur, where members of the dental team give advice to help patients improve their tooth-brushing and dietary behaviours and stop smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par32">What constitutes ‘regular’ visits in terms of the optimal frequency for visiting a dentist for a check-up has been the topic of considerable debate, with recommendations varying from 6-monthly examinations (recall visits) to longer periods tailored to the level of patients’ risk of developing problems (usually up to 2 years for people with low risk of disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since there is general agreement that planned dental visits at least every 2 years are beneficial for monitoring purposes with prevention and treatment as needed; we define planned dental visiting behaviour as having visited a dentist in the past 24 months for a non-urgent appointment.</p>
                <p id="Par33">People with irregular attendance patterns often tend to be those who wait until there is a problem such as toothache and swelling which impacts their quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. More than 25% of UK adults report they had dental pain over the last 12 months, and this is disproportionally affects people with manual backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Patients attending for a dental emergency have often been in pain for over 2 weeks, and a significant proportion of those attending dental emergency services, do so repeatedly for the same condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Some people, even when in pain, avoid using dental services and visit other services such as General Practice (GP) or Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) departments instead, which increases the costs of meeting their dental needs and puts an added burden on these often stretched services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">Since General Practitioners (GPs) prescribe antibiotics for over half of patients who attend their services with dental problems, this, together with the high level of antibiotics prescribed in dental practice for people attending with urgent problems, contributes to the problem of antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, there are potentially serious consequences if dental infections remain untreated, such as sepsis, which may require hospitalisation, resulting in high costs to the National Health Service (NHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In short, a lack of planned dental visiting can result in dental visits for acute dental problems which is expensive and of limited effectiveness—geared towards giving only short-term relief of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">A brief psychological intervention (the RETURN intervention) has been developed to be delivered to adults attending dental services for urgent care which aims to promote planned dental visiting. The intervention has been developed using extensive qualitative work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and with patient and public involvement to identify salient barriers to planned dental care. This work also helped to develop appropriate imagery and narrative for the intervention material, including video stories from local people which accord with the ‘in group’ identity of the population targeted. This is in recognition of identity-based motivation theory which explains that people are most likely to be motivated and act towards goals if they see that the action is in congruence with their perceived self-identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">In order to promote planned dental visiting, and through this to improve oral health, and reduce impacts of oral disease such as toothache and use of antibiotics for dental problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the intervention uses multiple behaviour change techniques. The intervention is delivered by dental nurses who have been trained to discuss the intervention material with patients using active listening techniques such as relevant open questions, non-judgemental language, non-directive talk and acknowledging patient’s priorities, beliefs and challenges. The intervention is aimed at helping patients overcome their barriers to dental attendance for planned care and includes a ‘goal setting and action plan’ element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Goal setting (a distal goal, e.g. attending for planned dental care) and creating an action plan to achieve it may help patients overcome significant barriers preventing behaviour change. Action planning involves proximal goals; in this case, these smaller achievable short-term goals would be designed to overcome a patient’s specific barrier(s). These techniques are simple to administer and are known to assist people with achieving health-related behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The delivery of the RETURN intervention has been previously tested in a feasibility study. There are no known risks of the intervention, to either the trial participants, or the trial research teams, although there is a possibility that participants experience a heightened dental anxiety after thinking in detail about visiting a dentist. Possible benefits of the intervention are improved oral health and quality of life after taking up planned dental care, with avoidance of dental emergencies and its impact on the cost to the NHS.</p>

                  <p id="Par69">Participants randomised to the RETURN intervention will receive a booklet pack providing educational resources to help overcome six common dental visiting barriers (‘I don’t have time’, ‘I don’t think to go when I’m not in pain,’ ‘I don’t have trust in dentists’, Cost, Embarrassment, Anxiety). The booklet pack contains a set of resources to help participants prepare for and support their attendance for a planned dental appointment, such as information on the cost of treatment and how to claim for free care if in an exempt from charges group; relaxation exercises which they might use when waiting for their dental appointment, and a credit card sized information card, which the participant can give to their employer advising that further dental care appointments are recommended. The pack contains some persuasive communication material, such as information about the consequences and costs of delaying care until they have toothache. A leaflet describing how dental services operate during the COVID pandemic will also be included, including for example having to wait outside the practice until just before their dental appointment time.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">A trained dental nurse or research dental nurse (trained dental nurses employed by the research team) will help the participant identify a barrier which is most important to them using behaviour change conversational techniques such as empathic listening, non-judgement and non-directive talk. The participant will then view an online video clip involving a story from someone who has experienced this barrier, which is overlaid with an animation to make it especially engaging, and relevant to the ‘in-group’ targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The intervention contains elements of ‘modelling’. Both video stories and quotes in the written material are generated from qualitative and public involvement work which underpinned the development of the intervention, with many of the video stories featuring members of a community advisory group.</p>
                  <p id="Par71">While in the dental setting, using the booklet material, participants will make a goal regarding attending for a planned dental appointment, and an action plan that will help them overcome their chosen barrier to dental visiting. These will be photographed by the dental nurse on the Tablet PC and uploaded to the trial database to facilitate a follow-up text which will be sent within 2 weeks of the participant receiving the intervention. For participants who discuss more than one barrier within a delivery session, encouragement will be provided by the trained dental nurse to look at relevant intervention materials at home. Participants will receive a follow-up text with an online link to the material and videos which will be accessed via a restricted access web portal, and with a supportive message around the participant’s goal and action plan(s) recorded.</p>

                  <p id="Par73">A key component of the intervention is the conversation between the person delivering the intervention and the patient, which is to be conducted in a non-judgemental and supportive manner. All staff delivering the intervention will be trained according to a written intervention delivery manual. Training of staff will include both didactic teaching and role play, followed by a period of shadowing of intervention delivery (the member of staff first observes the intervention being delivered in situ, and then delivers it themselves while being observed by a member of the research team). An observation checklist containing essential elements of the intervention to be included is completed. This covers five essential domains: (i) empathetic listening with non-directive and non-judgement talk; (ii) elicitation and discussion of barriers to planned dental visiting leading to introduction of the booklet pack; (iii) being shown a video clip with patients’ reflection on how this relates to their own circumstance; (iv) highlighting relevant aspects of the booklet pack relevant to the patient’s circumstances, emphasising benefits of planned dental visits, hope for the future and assurance about the patients’ capability of overcoming relevant barriers; and (v) setting of a planned dental visiting goal and action plan relating to at least one barrier which is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and anchored within a time frame (SMART). When the member of staff is observed to deliver at least 80% of these elements contained under each domain of the intervention in situ, they are deemed to be competent to deliver the intervention independently. In order to ensure consistency between raters of intervention delivery competency, a calibration exercise will take place using audio recordings of delivery sessions undertaken by RETURN research nurses, independent observation checklist scoring, comparison and group discussion. The exercise will be repeated until all discrepancies in scoring are resolved. A sign off guidance document will be produced to facilitate consistent sign off decisions.</p>
                  <p id="Par74">In order to monitor fidelity of intervention delivery, all intervention delivery sessions will be audiotaped, with consent from both the patient and dental nurse. Recordings will be collected from research sites on a monthly basis throughout the recruitment period. Each month, 20% of the recordings from each dental nurse will be randomly selected and independently rated by two members of the research team using the observation checklist outlined above. Eighty percent of the necessary components will need to be present in each recording for the intervention delivery session to be deemed as reaching an acceptable fidelity threshold. If there is disagreement between the two raters, this will be resolved through discussion until agreement is reached. Where necessary, a third rater will be introduced to resolve disputes in scoring. In each instance where a recording is found to not have reached the fidelity threshold of 80%, feedback will be provided to the dental nurse in question using supervision sessions. Thereafter, a necessary refresher training and further shadowing will be undertaken if any member of staff delivering the intervention is found not to be delivering the key intervention ingredients consistently.</p>

                  <p id="Par121">The Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) is based on a premise that there are two alternative responses to threats (such as dental pain) which are either protective or adaptive coping strategies, or maladaptive responses such as avoidance or procrastination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. PMT predicts that the primary determinant of adaptive coping strategies such as planned dental visiting is whether or not an individual has formed a protection motivation with regard to the focal behaviour: for example, an intention to act to manage a health threat (e.g. dental pain). This is in turn informed by parallel appraisal processes: threat appraisal and coping appraisal. Threat appraisal variable predictors comprise perceived severity (seriousness) of the health threat, perceived susceptibility (vulnerability) and fear of the health threat. Applied to dental attendance, patients will be asked to consider the severity of their dental pain and their susceptibility for experiencing dental pain. In order to minimise participant burden; MDAS scores will be used as an indicator of fear of the health threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Coping appraisal variables comprise self-efficacy (i.e. confidence in performing the focal behaviour) and response efficacy. Applied to dental attendance, patients report their confidence they can attend dental appointments and that such attendance would be an effective way to reduce the threat of dental pain</p>

A binary variable will be created for each time point to represent if there are indicators of dental infection based on the answers to the halitosis and bad breath questions (1=Any indicator of dental infection, 0=No indicators or dental infection).

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par135">Twenty six percent of patients attending urgent dental care access centres report they feel attending a dentist regularly is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and other work shows that only 20% of users of such services have their own dentist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Since unpublished data from an NHS evaluation in the North West of England found that an average of 16% of users of urgent dental care services delivered in dental practices returned to a practice for planned dental care over the subsequent 22 weeks, we estimated that over the longer period of 12 months, we might expect 30% of urgent dental care users to return for a planned dental care appointment. The calculation is based on a minimum clinically important difference of 10 percentage points (i.e. an improvement to 40% of patients attending a dentist) in the first of the joint primary outcomes. We estimate there is a possibility of some contamination between patients within practices. Rather than use a cluster randomised design, we have reduced the difference we want to detect to 9 percentage points to allow for potential contamination. Based on this, a sample size of 559 per group would give 80% power at <italic>α</italic> = 0.025 (to allow for joint primary outcomes) to detect this improvement in the intervention group. Allowing for 5% loss to follow-up gives a total target sample size of 590 per group.</p>
                <p id="Par136">For the second primary outcome, OHIP-14, we estimate a standard deviation of 11 points at 1-year follow-up. We also assume a higher rate of loss to follow-up of 20% for this outcome, as it will require successful telephone follow-up. Based on this, our total sample size of 1180 will give 80% power to detect a minimum clinically important difference of 2.25 points, with <italic>α</italic> = 0.025.</p>

To maximise matching of participant descriptors with routinely held NHS BSA follow-up data, participant postcodes will be checked at each follow-up point in case this has changed since baseline. For participants receiving dental care in the Dental Hospital (DH) following their baseline data, details will be retrieved from clinical records held in the Dental Hospital identified by their unique RQ number. This follow-up data will be collected using a CRF proforma and conducted as an audit of participant DH records.

                  <p id="Par149">An extract of the NHS BSA data will be obtained after 12 months (52 weeks) of recruitment. This will aid in the preparation of analysis code before receiving the 18-month (78 weeks) data. Final analysis of the first primary outcome will be conducted on the 18-month data. Analysis of the first primary outcome will involve the number and percentage of participants found to have a planned dental appointment within 12 months which will be reported for each treatment group separately. The denominator will be the number of randomised participants in each treatment group. A comparison between groups will be done using logistic regression, adjusted for the stratification factor site as a random effect (random intercept only). The derived binary variable for attendance for a planned appointment within 12 months will be the dependent variable. The odds ratio and corresponding 97.5% confidence interval will be reported and <italic>p</italic>-value. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted removing all participants from the above primary analysis who were recruited in dental practices (i.e. not randomised at the Dental Hospital) and who do not have a matched NHS BSA record at baseline. This is to assess the impact of including the participants who were not successfully matched in the NHS BSA data at baseline which may indicate that it was possible to get NHS BSA data at later timepoints.</p>
                  <p id="Par150">Analysis of the second primary outcome will involve summaries of OHIP-14 scores presented at baseline and 12 months separated by treatment group, for all participants included in this analysis. The OHIP-14 scores at 12 months will be analysed using linear regression, adjusting for the baseline value of OHIP-14 and the stratification factor site as a random effect (random intercept only). The estimated treatment effect and corresponding 97.5% CI will be reported along with the <italic>p</italic>-value. This will be a complete case analysis, only participants with valid baseline and 12-month questionnaires will be included in the analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par151">A second analysis will also adjust for other pre-specified baseline variables, including dental anxiety and socio-economic status.</p>
                  <p id="Par152">Analyses will include all randomised participants. The principle of intention-to-treat, as far as practically possible, will be the main strategy of the analysis adopted for primary outcomes and all the secondary outcomes. To allow for joint primary outcomes, the type I error rate will be controlled by setting <italic>α</italic> = 0.025 and therefore confidence intervals (CI) will be presented at 97.5% for both the primary outcomes. No other adjustments will be made for multiplicity. Other secondary outcomes will be reported at the 95% confidence level. <italic>p</italic>-values will be reported to 3 decimal places or 1 significant figure if <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. Percentages will be reported to 1 decimal place throughout; continuous baseline characteristics will be presented to 1 decimal place or 1 significant figure and all other values will be present to 2 decimal places or 1 significant figure. All analyses will be performed with standard statistical software (SAS version 9.4 or later). For the purpose of measuring timepoints, 6 months = 26 weeks, 12 months = 52 weeks and 18 months = 78 weeks. A full statistical analysis plan is available from the research team.</p>

                  <p id="Par167">An adverse event (AE) is classified as one occurring between randomisation and the final follow-up contact at 18 months and is any untoward occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the RETURN intervention. Serious adverse events (SAE) are AE which results in death, is life threatening, or is life changing. A related AE is that which is deemed to be a result from administration of research procedures. Due to the type of intervention, SAEs and related adverse events are not expected. However, it is possible that administration of the intervention may lead to increased dental anxiety. Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] scores are collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. MDAS items are summed together to produce a total score ranging from 5 to 25 with higher scores relating to higher levels of dental anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. If there is a shift from an MDAS quintile of 0-5/6 (low dental anxiety) at baseline to 19-25 (very high) at 6, 12 or 18 months, this will be reported as an AE. At each site there will be a designated investigator named on the ‘signature list and delegation of responsibilities log’ who is responsible for reporting SAEs and making decisions as to whether this constitutes a SAE and whether this is related or unrelated to trial conduct or intervention, and whether unexpected or not.</p>

              <p id="Par172">This trial is at the pragmatic end of the spectrum of clinical trial design, with its purpose focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention under the usual condition in which it might be applied, whilst maintaining internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This presents particular challenges to its implementation since dental practice activity sits within an independent contractor model with dental staff remunerated according to Units of Dental Activity undertaken. Dental practitioners are known to perceive financial rewards for being involved in research as relatively unattractive, while also feeling they have relatively little knowledge and skills in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Integration of trial processes within routine workloads is a key lesson from previous trials situated in dental practice, and hence a flexibility was built into the study flow diagram so that trial processes and delivery of the intervention could be undertaken at any time during the urgent dental care appointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par173">Previous trials in dental practice have found significant differences in intervention effects between dental practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and so it will be important to examine differences by site type (dental practice [delivering in-hours urgent care and out of hours care], Dental Hospital), as well as incorporating measures to ensure and monitor fidelity of intervention delivery. The RETURN trial will be supported by embedded qualitative work to support understanding the contextual issues influencing the implementation of the intervention, and the trial itself.</p>
