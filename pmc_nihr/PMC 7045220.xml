                  <p>Findings broadly supported non-diagnostic selection criterion. Of 48 participants recruited, 32 completed post-intervention measures at mean 42 weeks later. Participant retention exceeded a priori rate (HFP-M=18; Usual care=14; 66.7%, 95% CI 51.6% to 79.6%). HFP-M was acceptable, with delivery longer than planned. Usual care had lower alliance rating. Child and parenting outcome effects detected across trial arms with potential HFP-M advantage (effect size range: 0.0 to 1.3).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>HFP-M is an acceptable and potentially effective specialist parenting intervention. A definitive trial is feasible, subject to consideration of recruitment and retention methods, intervention efficiency and comparator condition. Caution is required in interpretation of results due to reduced sample size. No serious adverse events reported.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Mental ill health is the largest cause of disability, with three-quarters of lifetime disorders starting during childhood.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Children of parents affected by severe personality difficulties are at particular risk due to the impact of parents’ symptoms and associated impairment on parenting capacity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> Lack of evidence-based treatments, underdeveloped care pathways and stigma result in poorer immediate and longer-term child outcomes, increase intergenerational transmission of mental health difficulties and perpetuate social disadvantage.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref>
</p>
              <p>Severe personality difficulties, including personality disorders, affect over 4% of UK adults and 40% of mental health service users, at least one-quarter of whom are parents.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Per annum UK treatment costs exceed £70 million, with wider societal costs estimated at £8 billion per year.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Characterised by problematic interpersonal relationships, emotional dysregulation and poor impulse control, severe personality difficulties are associated with insensitive and intrusive interactions with offspring, family hostility, inconsistent and unpredictable family routines that undermine affectionate, stable and responsive parenting required for healthy child development.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> Affected parents are likely to suffer higher parenting stress and lower satisfaction, exacerbating underlying mental health difficulties.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref>
</p>
              <p>One in 10 UK children suffer mental health disorders, with children of parents with severe personality difficulties at substantially higher risk of intergenerational transmission, most commonly behavioural disorders.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> These childhood disorders are associated with academic failure, school exclusion, maltreatment, self-harm and gang affiliation, with increased life-time risk of comorbid mental and physical health conditions, drug misuse, offending and worklessness.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 12 13</xref> Annual UK public service costs for severe behavioural problems are estimated at £5000 per child including £1400 health costs. Lifetime estimated costs range from £85 000 (moderate case) to £260 000 (severe case).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref>
</p>
              <p>Concerted preventative and early intervention during pregnancy, infancy and childhood is warranted.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Effective care models for co-occurring child and parental mental health problems are significant health policy and research priorities.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref> Nevertheless, routine care is highly variable, generally focussed on the needs of <italic>either</italic> the adult <italic>or</italic> the child,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> resulting in under-identification, poor understanding of the interrelationship between child and parent difficulties and misattribution of parenting difficulties to adult mental health symptoms per se.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Affected parents can be reluctant to engage due to stigma, treatment scepticism and the interpersonal difficulties and adverse life circumstances associated with personality difficulties.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p>
              <p>Parenting and parent factors are central to much effective child mental health treatment and problem remediation. Parenting programmes are the recommended cost-effective treatment for child behaviour problems.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> However, non-specialised parenting programmes, not specifically designed for parents affected by mental health difficulties, often result in poorer engagement, acceptability and outcomes.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Specialist interventions for some parental mental health conditions, such as depression, substance misuse and eating disorders, have demonstrated improved outcomes and reduced intergenerational transmission, by up to 40%.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> Specialist programmes for parents affected by personality difficulties are at an earlier stage of evidence production.</p>
              <p>Helping Families Programme-Modified (HFP-M) was developed as a specialist, intensive parenting intervention to address this need and service gap. It aims to improve immediate child and parenting outcomes with longer-term potential to reduce intergenerational transmission and psychosocial adversity within affected families.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Guided by recommended frameworks, HFP-M development synthesised two existing evidence-based interventions, incorporating relevant clinical practice recommendations and service user consultation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 28–33</xref> Consistent with other promising programmes aiming to improve parenting and child outcomes in high risk groups, HFP-M is based on a transtheoretical model of parenting drawing on attachment, social learning and cognitive-affective theories and methods.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> HFP-M does not target personality difficulties per se but aims to improve the ways that these characteristics affect parenting behaviour, emotional regulation, parent-child relationships and lead to adverse child outcomes.</p>
              <p>HFP-M has three structured components:<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> (i) Core Therapeutic Process: including partnership and goal-based methods to promote collaborative relational engagement, shared formulation, empathic parent validation and crisis management;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> (ii) Parent Groundwork: including emotion-focussed, cognitive, behavioural and interpersonal strategies to manage parental emotional dysregulation and hostility while relating to their children and undertaking parenting tasks and (iii) Parenting Strategies: including consistent use of positive parenting skills, such as, praise, consequences and limit setting, and relational and affective parenting methods such as emotionally responsive, warm care-giving and reflective function.</p>
              <p>Definitive trials require successful recruitment, retention and intervention acceptability.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 37–41</xref> Participant retention underpins trial validity. Lower rates reduce power, undermine interpretation of findings and increase costs. HFP-M retention, and initial recruitment was expected to be affected by: (i) participants’ core clinical features, (ii) greater exposure to family stress, negative life events, lower levels of social support and comorbid mental health conditions and (iii) under-identification of need within routine care, negative referrer expectancies, lower service engagement and attendance. These factors are reflected in evidence derived from 45 personality disorder treatments trials reported in two systematic reviews indicating a median participant non-completion rate of 35%.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 42</xref> Pre-feasibility trial case series findings, consultation with service user, clinicians and research ethics indicated that initial plans for trial recruitment based on personality disorder research diagnosis was unlikely to be viable for practical, participant acceptability and ethical reasons.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p>
              <p>To be useful and effective in practice, interventions need to demonstrate both clinical efficacy and user acceptability. Acceptability refers to service user judgements across four inter-related domains of intervention satisfaction: (i) relevance, (ii) content and procedures, (iii) clinician/provider characteristics and (iv) outcome suitability.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref>
</p>
              <p>This study reports quantitative findings from a randomised feasibility trial of HFP-M, based on a published protocol.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The trial aimed to assess research and clinical feasibility of HFP-M for a target population with coexisting parent personality difficulties and child mental health difficulties with findings being used to inform the design of a full-scale trial.</p>
              <p>The primary feasibility outcome was a participant retention rate of at least 65% post-intervention. Secondary feasibility outcomes were rates of: (i) participant identification and recruitment, (ii) data collection and (iii) intervention use, uptake and acceptability. Primary clinical outcome was child behaviour. Secondary clinical outcomes included parental child concerns, child internalising difficulties, parenting behaviour, satisfaction and psychological well-being. The trial sought to produce effect sizes and variance estimates for child and parent outcomes necessary to power a full-scale trial.</p>
              <p>The findings of a parallel qualitative process evaluation investigating the influence of contextual factors on trial and intervention implementation and outcome generation are published elsewhere, as are the full findings of preliminary intervention costs and estimates of cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Statistical analysis was mainly descriptive using means and SD for continuous data, or medians and range where data were skewed. Frequencies and proportions were used to describe categorical variables. Feasibility of trial retention was assessed using the proportion of a predetermined parameter and estimated 95% CIs. Clinical outcomes were analysed using analysis of covariance models to estimate likely range of intervention effect, by assessing 95% CI, at post-treatment, with pre-randomisation values as a covariate.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Follow-up data were not included in these analyses due to a smaller sample than planned. Standardised effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d. Given the complexity of coexistent parent and child mental health difficulties, the smallest change in outcome identified as clinically important is equivalent to a small effect size. Population variances for future power calculations were determined using the upper 80<sup>th</sup> percentile of CIs around the estimated population variance.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>

                <p>Recruitment took 4 months longer than planned due to delays in Site 2, resulting in a revised sample size of 48. Obtaining keyworker information on service users approached about trial participation proved impractical.</p>
                <p>All referred service users (n=89, 100.0%) consented to research contact (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Adult mental health services (AMHS) referred 30 (33.7%) parents, child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) 29 (32.6%) and children’s social care (CSS) 30 (33.7%). Site 1 referred 65 (73.0%) parents. Researchers made contact with 87 (97.7%) parents, requiring 1 to 13 communications per participant.</p>

                <p>Sixty (69.7%) parents met initial criteria and completed screening. The most common reason for ineligibility was parents declining trial participation (n=12, 13.5%). Six parents were excluded due to child-related reasons, most commonly presence of child developmental disorder.</p>
                <p>Forty-eight consenting participants met parent and child screening criteria, all of whom completed baseline measures, representing 80.0% of screened parents, 53.9% of referred parents and 68.8% of the planned sample. Five (8.3%) met neither parent nor child screening criteria, four (6.7%) did not meet SAPAS criterion and three (5.0%) did not meet Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) criterion.</p>
                <p>Thirty-six (75.0%) participants were from Site 1, exceeding the site recruitment target. Site 2 recruitment (n=12) was 34.3% of that planned, due to delayed recruitment and lower service engagement. Eighteen (37.5%) participants were referred by AMHS, 16 (33.3%) CAMHS and 14 (29.2%) CSS.</p>
                <p>There was a significant difference in trial condition uptake (HFP-M: n=21, 87.5%; Usual care n=15, 62.5%; χ2=4.0, df=1 (48), p&lt;0.05). Modal duration between randomisation and starting HFP-M was 2 weeks (range 1 to 23 weeks). Parents declined HFP-M because one gave birth, another was in couple conflict about participation and a third did not respond to persistent contact (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The modal duration before Usual care parenting session receipt was 5.5 weeks (range 1 to 17 weeks). The most common reason for declining the additional Usual care parenting session was that participants hoped to be allocated to HFP-M.</p>
                <p>Thirty-two (66.7%, 95% CI 51.6% to 79.6%) participants completed post-intervention measures. The majority of participants who did not take up the intervention offered, mainly in the Usual care condition, did not complete post-intervention measures.</p>
                <p>Twenty-one (65.6%) parents completing post-intervention measures were also assessed at follow-up, representing 43.8% of all participants. Post-intervention measures were completed a mean of 42.0 weeks (SD 14.6) after baseline, due to HFP-M delivery being lengthier in duration than planned. Follow-up measures were completed a mean of 20 weeks (SD 8.9) later. Researchers required one to eight participant contacts to arrange post-intervention and follow-up data collection. Main reasons for non-completion included unable to contact participant, participant declining completion and participant health and life circumstances.</p>
                <p>There were less than 0.1% missing data items across clinical measures at each time point.</p>

Six (28.6%, 95% CI 11.3% to 52.2%) withdrew before completion due to acute adult mental health crisis and complex family circumstances unrelated to HFP-M receipt. Recruitment delay and longer than anticipated intervention duration resulted in two (9.5%, 95% CI. 1.2% to 30.4%) participants not fully completing HFP-M before trial conclusion. The mean number of HFP-M appointments offered was 15.8 (SD 7.7) and mean number attended was 11.2 (SD 6.3). HFP-M appointment attendance was 70.2%. Mean duration of HFP-M delivery was 28.4 (SD 21.7) weeks.</p>

                <p>Estimated effect sizes showed a general post-intervention advantage for HFP-M on a range of outcomes. Medium effects for child behavioural problem severity (ECBI Intensity, effect size (ES) 0.4, CI −0.3 to 1.1), and parenting satisfaction (KPSS, ES 0.4, CI −0.3 to 1.1) were detected and a large effect for parent-reported reductions in concerns about their child (CAMC Problem 1, ES 1.2, CI 0.4 to 2.0, CAMC Problem 2, ES 1.3, CI 0.5 to 2.1).

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study assessed feasibility, potential challenges and decision-making for a definitive HFP-M trial.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–30 39</xref> Participant identification methods were successful across a wide range of mental health and CSS teams, over 90% of referred parents met dual child and parent screening criteria. Non-diagnostic eligibility criteria were acceptable and effective in recruiting an appropriate, multimorbid sample.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60 61</xref> Negative life events and disrupted family functioning, characteristic of the sample population, commonly delayed screening, data collection and intervention delivery.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, participant retention exceeded the a priori primary feasibility criterion of 65%. Participants declining intervention conditions were less likely to be retained at follow-up. Participant recruitment was slower than planned, mainly due to operational difficulties in one site.</p>
              <p>Participants’ multimorbid characteristics are commonly associated with poorer treatment engagement and outcomes.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62 63</xref> Intervention uptake differed substantially between trial conditions. HFP-M was largely acceptable to participants but delivery was less efficient than planned, often due to parents’ life circumstances. The augmented Usual care condition appeared to be less acceptable, and potentially affected participant retention. Lower Usual care retention and acceptability rates may reflect common dissatisfaction associated with control condition allocation.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64 65</xref>
</p>
              <p>Clinical effects were detected across trial conditions, with potential advantage for child behaviour, parental child concerns and parenting satisfaction for HFP-M. These are welcome given the population’s complex parenting impairments and negative treatment expectancies.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 63</xref> The final sample size limited trial power and consequently affected interpretation of results. A definitive trial could potentially narrow child selection criteria to include only behaviour problems as parenting programmes have a stronger evidence base for this condition. Alternatively, HFP-M content may require strengthening specifically in relation to child internalising difficulties. Economic findings indicated potential cost advantages for HFP-M over usual care.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, CSRI completion rates were not high and a simpler version may be required in a larger trial.</p>
              <p>Trial conditions may have differed in duration, location and therapeutic intensity, potentially accounting for outcome and acceptability differences. Data collection relied on parent self-report, which is conventional given poor reliability of child-report across the age group and costs associated with independent ratings. Trial therapists provided self-report intervention fidelity data and supervision examined therapist HFP-M skills and implementation. Independent methods could strengthen validity of fidelity monitoring in a definitive trial, including observational and video methods.</p>
              <p>A definitive trial is potentially feasible and should be based on the assumption of a medium effect size for the primary outcome of child behaviour. Site engagement, resource allocation and keyworker training in participant identification and recruitment will be crucial to enrolment of the larger sample required in a future trial. Embedded researchers assisting in caseload identification and direct parent recruitment, not possible in this feasibility study, may promote enrolment. Participant retention, particularly parents allocated to a usual care condition, will continue to be challenging for a full trial. The population’s complex personality difficulties and, typically, heightened sensitivity to rejection, underline the importance of managing sensitively and effectively trial consent procedures, the emotional and practical consequences of random allocation and proactively maintaining communication and validating relationships with participants throughout trial duration, particularly for those allocated to usual care. Though not routinely available, the usual care condition could be augmented with an ongoing parent support group to potentially increase equipoise, face validity and uptake, which may also benefit trial retention.</p>
              <p>HFP-M clinical and trial efficiency may be improved with more explicit, validating discussion with participants about the potential impact of life and personal circumstances on attendance, use of pre-emptive cancellation plans and inclusion of inter-session contact using digital technology.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 63 66</xref>
