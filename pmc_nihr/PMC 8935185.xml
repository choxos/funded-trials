                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The use of routine remote follow-up of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing exponentially. It has been suggested that online electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) could be used in parallel, to facilitate real-time symptom monitoring aimed at improving outcomes. We tested the feasibility of this approach in a pilot trial of ePROM symptom monitoring versus usual care in patients with advanced CKD not on dialysis.</p>

                  <title>Setting and participants</title>
                  <p>Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK. Adult patients with advanced CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥6 and ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, or a projected risk of progression to kidney failure within 2 years ≥20%).</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Monthly online ePROM symptom reporting, including automated feedback of tailored self-management advice and triggered clinical notifications in the advent of severe symptoms. Real-time ePROM data were made available to the clinical team via the electronic medical record.</p>

                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>Feasibility (recruitment and retention rates, and acceptability/adherence to the ePROM intervention). Health-related quality of life, clinical data (eg, measures of kidney function, kidney failure, hospitalisation, death) and healthcare utilisation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>52 patients were randomised (31% of approached). Case report form returns were high (99.5%), as was retention (96%). Overall, 73% of expected ePROM questionnaires were received. Intervention adherence was high beyond 90 days (74%) and 180 days (65%); but dropped beyond 270 days (46%). Qualitative interviews supported proof of concept and intervention acceptability, but highlighted necessary changes aimed at enhancing overall functionality/scalability of the ePROM system.</p>

                  <p>This pilot trial demonstrates that patients are willing to be randomised to a trial assessing ePROM symptom monitoring. The intervention was considered acceptable; though measures to improve longer-term engagement are needed. A full-scale RCT is considered feasible.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly have a high symptom burden; increasingly so as they progress towards kidney failure.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Uncontrolled symptomology can be a particular source of anxiety and can have a detrimental impact on patient’s health-related quality of life and outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref></p>
              <p>Timely detection of symptomatic deterioration is a key component of effective disease management during this period.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It can be challenging, however, to identify an unexpected decline in kidney function between scheduled clinic appointments, unless a patient self-refers. Unfortunately, some patients self-refer too late because they have difficulty identifying the point at which they may require assistance. Without prompt recognition of advanced symptoms, such patients are at high risk of severe illness, emergency hospitalisation, progression to unplanned kidney replacement therapy and significantly poorer long-term outcomes, including increased mortality.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref></p>
              <p>Routine systematic capture of symptom data using electronic patient-reported outcome measure (ePROM) measures has been suggested as a low-cost method of supporting symptom monitoring and control.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> ePROM platforms provide patients with access to short online questionnaires that allow them to share self-reported symptom data with their clinical team, often in real time, to help guide care.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Systems may be configured to provide patients with tailored self-management advice and to trigger clinical notifications in the advent of sudden deterioration and/or severe symptomology.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref></p>
              <p>In studies involving patients with cancer, ePROM symptom monitoring is associated with enhanced patient–clinician communication; improved patient education and self-efficacy; better symptom control; earlier detection of adverse events; improved patient quality of life; reduced use of accident and emergency services; fewer inpatient hospital episodes; and improved survival; even for ‘computer-inexperienced’ patients.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–17</xref></p>
              <p>The efficacy of ePROM symptom monitoring for patients with advanced CKD, has not been investigated within a randomised controlled trial (RCT); nor has the feasibility of undertaking such a trial been established. This single-centre pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility of undertaking a RCT investigating the use of monthly ePROM reporting compared with usual care in patients with advanced CKD not on dialysis.</p>

                <p>Members of the kidney research team at QEHB screened for potentially eligible study participants using the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those considered eligible were provided with a patient information sheet and given the opportunity to consider participation. For patients wishing to take part in the pilot trial (and optional qualitative substudy), consent, enrolment and baseline data collection was conducted face to face in clinic. Randomisation was provided via a web-based system developed by BCTU. Participants were randomised at the level of the individual in a 1:1 ratio to usual care (control arm) or usual care supplemented with monthly online symptom reporting using the ePROM system (experimental arm). Minimisation was used to achieve balance between: 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure (&lt;40%, vs ≥40%, based on the four-variable Tangri renal risk equation<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); self-reported computer experience (regular use of a computer, tablet or smartphone at least weekly, vs less than weekly); and patient-reported ethnicity (‘white’ vs ‘non-white’).</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants allocated to the ePROM intervention arm were asked to complete and submit monthly symptom questionnaires using an online system and received an automated reminder to do so. In addition, patients were allowed to submit any number of additional ‘ad hoc’ questionnaires at any time outside of the scheduled monthly reporting dates. Development and functionality of the ePROM system has been described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In summary, on questionnaire submission, automated self-management advice was provided to patients based on their responses; questionnaire data was integrated into the QEHB electronic medical record and made available to HCPs in real time; and a system algorithm triggered an automated notification which was sent to both the patient and the clinical team in the event of a severe and current symptom report. Participants allocated to the control arm received usual care. It was not possible to blind clinicians or participants due to the nature of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>As this was a pilot trial there was no single primary outcome measure. The primary aims of the study were to pilot the trial protocol and assess the feasibility of undertaking a full-scale RCT exploring the use of ePROMs in the management of advanced CKD. The feasibility outcomes included the following: the proportion of eligible participants approached to take part in the trial; the proportion of eligible participants who took part in the trial; recruitment rate: the proportion of participants randomised/screened; the proportion of participants randomised/approached; the proportion of participants who completed the trial (retention); and the proportion of participants who adhered to the ePROM intervention.</p>
                <p>This pilot trial was not powered to detect differences in outcome measures, but provided an opportunity to ensure that there were no issues with completion of the outcome data and proposed outcome measures for the main RCT. The following outcome data were collected:</p>

For continuous outcomes, the means and 95% CIs are reported. Estimates of differences between groups are presented as differences in means adjusted for minimisation variables and, for longitudinal outcomes, the corresponding baseline values. All estimates of differences are presented with 95% CIs. No p values are reported as no hypothesis testing was performed. Analysis was conducted using SPSS software, V.26 (IBM) and SAS software, V.9.4 (SAS Institute).

                <p>Recruitment was conducted at QEHB over 12 months from October 2019. The last follow-up was conducted in April 2020, which was truncated for 14 participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 721 patients were screened, of which 452 (63%, 95% CI 59% to 66%) were eligible, and 166 were approached to take part in the trial (37% of eligible, 95% CI 32% to 41%). Fifty-two patients were randomised (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) (consent rate (of approached)=31%, 95% CI 24% to 39%; consent rate (of eligible)=12%, 95% CI 9% to 15%), representing 79% of the recruitment target sample size (recruitment rate (of approached)=31%, 95% CI 24% to 39%; recruitment rate (of screened)=7%, 95% CI 5% to 9%; average monthly recruitment rate=4.3). The minimisation algorithm provided appropriate balance over 2-year risk of progression to kidney failure, however an error in the algorithm led to an imbalance in patient-reported ethnicity between groups.

                <p>Average follow-up was 8.0 months (SD 3.8). In total, n=2 patients withdrew from the trial during follow-up after moving geographical region (both withdrew from the intervention and one from all follow-up) (retention=96%, 95% CI 87% to 100%). During the study, n=17 patients met the trial definition of kidney failure (the study protocol mandated exit at this point) and there was n=1 death. No patients were excluded from the analysis. Case report form return rates were excellent throughout (99.5% of all expected forms received) (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>The main reason for non-approach of screened and eligible individuals was that patients had not registered to use the existing hospital patient portal ‘MyHealth’ (90% of those not approached). For patients that were approached, but who were not willing to take part, reported reasons included: ‘no internet access/computer inexperienced’ (45%); ‘not interested in research’ (22%); ‘too burdensome (completing ePROMs)’ (11%); ‘too burdensome (general)’ (11%); ‘issues with myHealth patient portal sign-up’ (9%); ‘unwell/health-related reasons’ (2%); ‘too burdensome (travel/trial visits)’ (2%).</p>
                <p>The average age of participants was 57 years (range 25–86), 29% were female, 37% reported ‘non-white’ ethnicity, 96% reported secondary level education or greater and 100% reported regular use of a computer, tablet or smartphone at least weekly. Mean baseline eGFR was 15.2, the average 2-year Tangri risk of progression to kidney failure was 43%, and the average EQ-5D index was 0.74 (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>

However, only 31% (95% CI 25% to 37%) were received within our a priori agreed compliance window (72-hours either side of the scheduled reminder date). Patients submitted 98 ‘ad hoc’ questionnaires outside of this compliance window: an average of four per participant. Compliance over time was good, with a high proportion of participants submitting at least one scheduled questionnaire beyond 90 days postrandomisation (74%, 95% CI 52% to 90%) and after 180 days (65%, 95% CI 41% to 85%) but this proportion dropped beyond 270 days (46%, 95% CI 19% to 75%).</p>

Most symptoms reported were mild (60%). There were 16 severe and current symptom reports (across 13 questionnaires), generated by 5 patients, representing 3% of the total number of symptoms reported across the trial (for full details around system notifications see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S2-S4</xref>). The symptoms driving these notifications were itchy/dry skin (37% of notifications), fatigue (25%), shortness of breath (13%), pain (13%), difficulty sleeping (6%) and ankle swelling (6%). The median time taken by staff to resolve patient notifications was 10 min (IQR 6.5–22.5) and actions included: ‘telephone counselling about symptom management’ (78%); and ‘brought clinic appointment forwards’ (22%); ‘imaging/test orders’ (22%); ‘medication initiation/change’ (11%); ‘other’ (11%), more than one type of action could be recorded for each notification (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S4</xref>).</p>

                <p>Healthcare utilisation data appears in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>. In summary, patients in the intervention arm reported 97 fewer episodes of healthcare utilisation than those in the usual care arm (mean number of episodes per patient: intervention arm=10.3, usual care arm=12.3; intervention arm 0.11 fewer mean episodes per month on trial), which included 54 fewer CKD-related specialist kidney clinic visits (mean per patient: intervention arm=5.4, usual care arm=6.5; intervention arm 0.07 fewer episodes per month on trial). Hospital inpatient stay was similar in both arms. Again, this exploratory data should be treated with caution owing to the small sample size.</p>

                <p>The main system shortfalls, identified across the whole sample, included: failures of the reminder process meaning some patients did not receive reminder emails; a lack of clarity for some patients around which questionnaire they should complete at which time point and confusion around how to view self-management advice; difficulty navigating/scrolling through sections; occasional problems for some patients when submitting the questionnaire. Interviewees suggested a range of changes aimed at addressing these shortfalls and enhancing the overall functionality of the system.</p>
                <p>We experienced HCP recruitment challenges owing to healthcare pressures secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this single-centre open-label randomised study, we examined the feasibility of randomising patients with advanced CKD to monthly ePROM reporting with real-time feedback of data or to usual care. We found that the majority of study indicators supported the feasibility of a full-scale RCT: patient eligibility rate (proportion of screened patients eligible) 63%; recruitment rate (of patients approached) 31%; case report form returns 99.5%; and retention 96%. In total, 52 patients were randomised (monthly recruitment rate=4.3), representing 79% of the recruitment target sample size (N=66). This level of recruitment would position the study in the top quartile of performance based on a review of recruitment and retention across 151 RCTs funded by the UK Health Technology Assessment Programme.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Moreover, overall adherence to the intervention was good, with patients returning 73% of expected ePROM questionnaires, although not always in the specified time windows. We have, therefore, demonstrated that it is possible to randomise and follow-up patients with high levels of data completion through to 12 months, and that an RCT is feasible.</p>
              <p>Within our study, we found the observed pattern of ePROM reporting did not correspond with our <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> expectations. Relatively few patients submitted their questionnaires within our prespecified compliance window (72 hours either side of the scheduled submission date). Triangulation with qualitative data suggested that it was unlikely that this observation was related to issues around acceptability of the intervention: all participants indicated positive engagement with the system. Moreover, overall questionnaire return rates were high. A number of patients reported a failure to receive email reminders, or that emails were sent to junk folders, which may have contributed to out-of-window submissions: where patients relied on memory, rather than external prompts. Several patients suggested adding a mobile text reminder option, which they felt would be more reliable. It was our initial intention to include such an option, unfortunately, this was not possible within the existing patient portal framework. This feature will be made available as a priority within the next iteration of the system.</p>
              <p>Our overall findings around feasibility align with similar research conducted in oncology. The feasibility of trial-based exploration of ePROM efficacy in this area has been well established and a number of trials successfully completed internationally, in the USA,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> France<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and in the UK.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Within kidney research, while the feasibility of routine collection of ePROMs in clinical practice has been supported,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> there has been relatively little research around trial feasibility until recently. The ‘symptom monitoring with feedback trial’, is a registry-based pilot cluster RCT among Australian and New Zealand adults with end-stage kidney disease managed on haemodialysis; due for completion in 2020/2021.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Early findings from the pilot study suggest feasibility and acceptability when implementing ePROMs with feedback to clinicians in Australian haemodialysis centres, supporting progress to a follow-on multicentre RCT.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
              <p>Previous ePROM trials have commonly included a primary outcome based around health-related quality of life, for example, measured using the EQ-5D.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Based on our study population data, it would require a total of 348 participants to detect a clinically meaningful 0.07 reduction in EQ-5D-5L index<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> (SD=0.18, p=0.05, 90% power, adjusting for 20% attrition). This sample size appears achievable based on the successful implementation of previous UK-led kidney trials with similar (or greater) sample size requirements.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref></p>
              <p>While the study intervention was well received by patients and demonstrated proof of concept, there were a number of suggested improvements that may enhance longer-term engagement with the system, for example: simplification the interface and, in particular, improvements to the reminder functionality; incorporation of automated dietary advice; and the inclusion of additional questionnaire items around the psychological impacts associated with CKD. In addition, it was suggested that use of the intervention within a multicentre trial may necessitate system-level modifications to ensure compatibility with different IT infrastructures at other hospitals. Work conducted within a UK oncology setting has shown that it is possible to integrate a single ePROM system across multiple NHS trusts, each with unique IT platforms, but that repeated integration at each separate site often takes considerable time and resources.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our own experience of linking an ePROM to an existing hospital-based patient portal was mixed. Positives included the in-built security aspects, which some patients particularly valued, and also the ability to share data within the electronic medical record relatively easily. Negatives included functionality issues around the interface and the lack of some important features, for example, text reminders and smartphone compatibility. In addition, issues with sign-up to the patient portal for some patients meant that study staff could not approach them to take part in the trial without first arranging access to the patient portal, which created a substantial barrier to recruitment.</p>
              <p>Looking ahead to the roll-out of an ePROM system within a multicentre trial, and also considering future potential implementation in clinical practice, the use of a single hospital patient portal as the foundation platform may hinder effective scale-up. Any ePROM system would ideally require full integration with the electronic healthcare record at each site, and also a unified interface, to maximise the likelihood of success and utility. In a recent renal stakeholder summit aimed at developing a UK ePROM roadmap—involving patients, HCPs, academics and funders/renal organisations (including the Renal Association, British Renal Society, Kidney Care UK, National Kidney Federation, Kidney Research UK)— the development of a single online ePROM gateway/dashboard was identified as a key priority.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Such a dashboard would provide patients with a simple and consistent point of entry and allow them the flexibility to configure the platform to their liking, for example, around how reminders were configured/delivered, how their data and clinical advice were presented, or which primary/secondary care providers would have permissions to access their symptom information. Back-end development of application programming interfaces would then allow permitted healthcare providers to securely ‘pull’ appropriate data into their electronic medical record, regardless of their underlying system architecture.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This is the first UK study conducted in a CKD population that has explored the feasibility of ePROM capture/feedback with real-time integration within the electronic medical record. Our findings will help guide the design of a future RCT aimed at exploring efficacy and cost effectiveness. As this was a pilot study, no inferences can be made about the intervention’s therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, clinical data around eGFR, risk of progression to kidney failure and healthcare utilisation show trends towards improvement in the intervention arm, suggesting further research is warranted.</p>
                <p>The attrition rate for this study was larger than expected, owing to a higher proportion of patients progressing to kidney failure than anticipated (38% of patients randomised, vs 20% predicted). While this demonstrated the effectiveness of our recruitment strategy, which targeted patients with advanced CKD at risk of progression, the sample size for a future trial may need to be adjusted accordingly to account for this observation depending on the exact nature of the primary outcome.</p>
                <p>During the qualitative process analysis, it was not possible to conduct dual-coding or triangulation, this should be taken into account when interpreting the findings.</p>
                <p>The prespecified data analysis plan for this pilot study did not stipulate capture of the reason for starting dialysis, only the start date and type of dialysis was recorded.</p>
                <p>Finally, a sizeable proportion of patients who were approached during study recruitment declined participation owing to concerns around internet access/computer inexperience. While, anecdotally, reports suggest that patients have become much more comfortable with the use of digital healthcare necessitated during the COVID-19 pandemic, any future RCT should focus on broadening study accessibility and reducing the possibility of digital exclusion by: (1) ensuring the use of a simple user-friendly platform, with adequate training/support in place at the outset and (2) potentially providing an offline, for example, paper-based, PRO option.</p>
