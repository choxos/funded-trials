                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Heavy menstrual bleeding affects 25% of women in the UK, many of whom require surgery to treat it. Hysterectomy is effective but has more complications than endometrial ablation, which is less invasive but ultimately leads to hysterectomy in 20% of women. We compared laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy with endometrial ablation in women seeking surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this parallel-group, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial in 31 hospitals in the UK, women younger than 50 years who were referred to a gynaecologist for surgical treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and who were eligible for endometrial ablation were randomly allocated (1:1) to either laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy or second generation endometrial ablation. Women were randomly assigned by either an interactive voice response telephone system or an internet-based application with a minimisation algorithm based on centre and age group (&lt;40 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥40 years). Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy involves laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery to remove the upper part of the uterus (the body) containing the endometrium. Endometrial ablation aims to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by destroying the endometrium, which is responsible for heavy periods. The co-primary clinical outcomes were patient satisfaction and condition-specific quality of life, measured with the menorrhagia multi-attribute quality of life scale (MMAS), assessed at 15 months after randomisation. Our analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN49013893.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between May 21, 2014, and March 28, 2017, we enrolled and randomly assigned 660 women (330 in each group). 616 (93%) of 660 women were operated on within the study period, 588 (95%) of whom received the allocated procedure and 28 (5%) of whom had an alternative surgery. At 15 months after randomisation, more women allocated to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were satisfied with their operation compared with those in the endometrial ablation group (270 [97%] of 278 women <italic>vs</italic> 244 [87%] of 280 women; adjusted percentage difference 9·8, 95% CI 5·1–14·5; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·53, 95% CI 1·83–3·48; p&lt;0·0001). Women randomly assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy were also more likely to have the best possible MMAS score of 100 than women assigned to endometrial ablation (180 [69%] of 262 women <italic>vs</italic> 146 [54%] of 268 women; adjusted percentage difference 13·3, 95% CI 3·8–22·8; adjusted OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·31–2·67; p=0·00058). 14 (5%) of 309 women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group and 11 (4%) of 307 women in the endometrial ablation group had at least one serious adverse event (adjusted OR 1·30, 95% CI 0·56–3·02; p=0·54).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is superior to endometrial ablation in terms of clinical effectiveness and has a similar proportion of complications, but takes longer to perform and is associated with a longer recovery.</p>

                  <p id="para40">Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common problem that affects around 1·5 million women in England and Wales and has a substantial negative effect on their quality of life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends endometrial ablation or hysterectomy as surgical options for women with heavy menstrual bleeding that is resistant to medical treatment. We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library in 2013 and updated the search on Dec 27, 2018, with the search terms “heavy menstrual bleeding”, “hysterectomy”, “endometrial ablation”, “randomised trial”, and “systematic review”, with no language restrictions. An individual participant data meta-analysis published in 2014 showed that fewer women are dissatisfied with conventional hysterectomy than with endometrial ablation, but the former option is more invasive, involves a longer hospital stay, and prolonged recovery time. A health economic model based on these data showed that hysterectomy was more cost-effective. A Health Technology Assessment monograph from the same research group indicated that 25% of all women undergo subsequent gynaecological surgery following endometrial ablation, with just under a fifth requiring hysterectomy. These findings are consistent with those of a relevant Cochrane review, which concluded that the optimal surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding unresponsive to medical treatment might be hysterectomy, but the effectiveness of this treatment needs to be balanced against its invasiveness and increased short-term and long-term morbidity.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">This trial showed that a less invasive alternative to conventional hysterectomy—laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy—was more effective than endometrial ablation without increasing surgical risk. Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was clinically superior to endometrial ablation in terms of satisfaction (270 [97%] of 278 patients <italic>vs</italic> 244 [87%] of 280 patients; adjusted percentage difference 9·8, 95% CI 5·1–14·5; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·53, 95% CI 1·83–3·48; p&lt;0·0001) and quality of life as assessed by the menorrhagia multi-attribute quality-of-life scale (adjusted OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·31–2·67; p=0·00058). Serious adverse event numbers were low and similar for both procedures.</p>

                  <p id="para80">This study shows that a less invasive form of hysterectomy can result in high satisfaction associated with removal of the uterus and low morbidity, which is similar to less invasive surgery, such as endometrial ablation.</p>

              <p id="para90">The two most common surgical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding are endometrial ablation, where the endometrium is thermally destroyed but the uterus is preserved, and hysterectomy, where the uterus is removed.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Endometrial ablation does not require surgical incisions and newer (second generation) techniques are simple to learn, quick to perform, and associated with rapid recovery and early return to work.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Various energy sources can be used for endometrial ablation, but the most common are radiofrequency energy (Novasure; Hologic, Marlborough, MA, USA) or heated, fluid filled balloons.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para100">Hysterectomy can be done in several different ways, but total hysterectomy (ie, removal of the uterus and cervix) by open surgery remains the most widely used technique in the UK.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Total laparoscopic hysterectomy avoids large abdominal incisions, requires a shorter hospital stay, and facilitates quicker recovery. However, this procedure takes longer, requires advanced laparoscopic skills, and has more complications compared with conventional open surgery.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy only requires removal of the uterine body, which is the main source of heavy menstrual bleeding.

The trial protocol has been published previously.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Participants were women younger than 50 years with no desire for (further) children who were referred to a gynaecologist for surgical treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. Inclusion criteria were eligibility for endometrial ablation (fibroids &lt;3 cm, uterine cavity size &lt;11 cm, and absence of endometrial pathology on biopsy) and normal cervical cytology. Women were excluded if they had undergone a previous endometrial ablation, if laparoscopic surgery was contraindicated, or if they were unable to give informed consent or complete trial paperwork.</p>

                <p id="para140">Women were randomly assigned (1:1) to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy or second generation endometrial ablation by either an Interactive Voice Response telephone system or an internet-based application with a minimisation algorithm based on centre and age group (&lt;40 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥40 years). Participants were enrolled by dedicated research nurses who used a remote web-based randomisation application at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT; University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK) for group allocation. The research nurses were not involved in the collection of primary outcome data. Surgeons and participants could not be masked to the allocated procedure because of the nature of the interventions.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">After randomisation, participants were placed on the NHS surgical waiting list for the appropriate treatment. As per Scottish and UK Government guidelines, it was anticipated that treatment would occur within 12–18 weeks of random assignment.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Principal investigators from all 31 participating hospitals were members of the British Society of Gynaecological Endoscopy. Each responsible surgeon was certified competent for both procedures as per usual NHS and good clinical practice requirements, but the technique used was not modified for the purposes of the trial. All other aspects of care were left to the discretion of the responsible surgeon.</p>
                <p id="para160">Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy involves laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery to remove the upper part of the uterus (the body) containing the endometrium. As the cervix is not removed, complex dissection, which potentially increases the risk of injury to surrounding structures like the bladder, ureters, and blood vessels, can be avoided.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Cervical cancer screening is still required and, although most women will cease to have periods after the procedure, light menstrual bleeding or cyclical spotting can occur in 5–20% of women.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
                <p id="para170">The body of the uterus is detached from the cervix usually with a monopolar or bipolar wire loop after sealing the uterine vessels. The body is removed through a 10–12-mm port sited either within the umbilicus or suprapubically with a power morcellator that converts the specimen into strips of tissue. This process can be done inside a bag to prevent spread of fragmented tissue within the peritoneal cavity. Alternatively, the complete unmorcellated specimen can be removed through an internal incision at the top of the vagina (culdotomy).</p>
                <p id="para180">Endometrial ablation aims to treat heavy menstrual bleeding by destroying the endometrium, which is responsible for heavy periods. First generation endometrial ablation techniques involve an operating hysteroscope and a loop, ball, or laser energy and, although effective, are difficult to learn and highly operator dependent. The more commonly used second generation endometrial ablation techniques involve devices that are inserted into the uterine cavity that, when activated, will destroy the endometrium and superficial myometrium, containing endometrial glands, up to 6 mm. Other than the actual insertion of the device into the uterine cavity, these techniques tend not to be operator dependent.</p>
                <p id="para190">Second generation procedures used in the UK and recommended by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> include thermal balloon endometrial ablation and radiofrequency energy (Novasure). Thermal balloon endometrial ablation is achieved by means of a silicone balloon that is introduced through the cervix into the uterine cavity. The balloon fills and expands to conform to the inside of the uterine cavity, compressing the endometrium. Hot fluid circulating within the balloon ensures endometrial destruction and the temperature and duration of treatment is carefully controlled electronically by means of a computer attached to the device. Novasure uses radiofrequency energy delivered through an intrauterine mesh electrode that expands after insertion through the cervix to fit the shape of the uterine cavity. The energy required is calculated by the device and treatment times are under 90 s. These treatments substantially reduce menstrual bleeding and result in complete cessation of bleeding in up to 50% of women.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Second generation endometrial ablation can be done as a day case procedure, either under general or local anaesthetic. Although suitable for use in the outpatient setting, most endometrial ablations (94%) are done in operating theatres in the UK.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para200">The local research team at each centre collected intra-operative and post-operative data at the time of the randomly assigned procedure and completed a short case report form for any related hospital readmissions during the follow-up period. Participant-reported outcomes were assessed by self-completed questionnaires at baseline (before surgery), 6 weeks, and 6 months after surgery, and 15 months after randomisation. A self-completed 14-day diary was also collected. We sent non-responders up to two reminders by either post, email, telephone, or text message depending on the woman's preferred method of communication. Pathology results for all endometrial biopsies and uterine specimens were also obtained.</p>
                <p id="para210">We had a 15-month follow-up period after randomisation to accommodate the 12–18 week waiting time for treatment. Our intention was that participants would complete their primary outcome questionnaire (triggered 15 months after randomisation) approximately 12 months after surgery to facilitate comparisons with outcomes from other similar trials in the literature.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para250">We powered the HEALTH study to detect a difference in satisfaction of 8% (assuming 95% overall satisfaction after total hysterectomy and 87% overall satisfaction after endometrial ablation).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We required outcome data on 292 participants for 90% power, assuming a two-sided significance level of 5%, inflated to 324 participants to allow for 10% attrition in the primary outcome. To retain a significance level of 5% for the primary outcome analysis, we specified a hierarchy for testing the primary outcomes—MMAS was only examined if the result for patient satisfaction was statistically significant (p&lt;0·05). This trial also had more than 90% power to detect a ten-point difference in MMAS, assuming an SD of 33 units.</p>
                <p id="para260">We used appropriate descriptive statistics to summarise data at all timepoints, with mean (SD) or median (IQR) for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. Our analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle—participants were analysed by randomised group and not by the treatment received.</p>
                <p id="para270">We used ordinal logistic regression to analyse both co-primary outcomes. This decision was made after discussion with the independent data monitoring committee, which met on Oct 17, 2017, after they raised concerns about the appropriateness of the methods in our original analysis plan given the distribution of outcome data in an interim report (without considering any emerging treatment effect). For full details of the rationale for this change and the implications for power in the revised analysis plan see the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 1–24)</xref>. Analysis of patient satisfaction used the following four categories: totally satisfied, generally satisfied, fairly satisfied, and fairly, generally, or totally dissatisfied. MMAS was coded as an ordinal variable with the following four categories: ≤50, 51–75, 76–99, and 100 (maximum score), because of the extreme skewness of this outcome at follow-up. We checked the proportional odds assumption was appropriate by examining the odds ratios (ORs) from binary logistic regression for the three binary splits of the data (for satisfaction: totally satisfied <italic>vs</italic> other, totally or generally satisfied <italic>vs</italic> other, and satisfied <italic>vs</italic> dissatisfied; for MMAS: 0–99 <italic>vs</italic> 100, 0–75 <italic>vs</italic> 76–100, and 0–50 <italic>vs</italic> 51–100) and by Brant test with a significance threshold of p&lt;0·001. We analysed secondary outcomes with generalised linear models with appropriate link functions for the distribution of the outcome. We used repeated measures regression for the pain score recorded in the patient diary in the first two weeks after surgery. Details of categories used in ordinal logistic regression models for skewed continuous variables are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 41–42)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para280">We did not make any adjustments for multiple testing. Analyses of all primary and secondary outcomes were adjusted for the minimisation variables age group and centre (treated as a random effect) and for a relevant baseline score if available. We did several sensitivity and subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes. These included an unadjusted ordinal logistic regression analysis, binary logistic regression analyses for each split of the data, analyses using multiple imputation, a per protocol analysis, an analysis restricted to operations done by a consultant, and a linear regression analysis for MMAS (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 25–26, 30–32</xref>). 95% CIs are provided for all measures of effect.</p>
                <p id="para290">For the co-primary outcomes, we also did exploratory subgroup analyses for the following prespecified variables: uterine cavity length (≤8 cm <italic>vs</italic> &gt;8 cm), menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) at baseline (severe or crippling pain <italic>vs</italic> other categories), patient age (&lt;40 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥40 years), and presence or absence of fibroids. These tests were done by including a treatment by subgroup interaction term in the corresponding ordinal logistic regression model.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para420">This large randomised trial compared the two most commonly recommended surgical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (endometrial ablation and hysterectomy) in terms of patient-centred outcomes. At 15 months after randomisation, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy resulted in significantly higher satisfaction and better quality of life compared with endometrial ablation. Despite being a longer procedure with a slower recovery time, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy led to a greater improvement in menstrual blood loss, cyclical period-like pain, and dyspareunia, without incurring a higher risk of postoperative complications or precipitating bladder-related symptoms. The pragmatic multicentre nature of this trial is likely to enhance the generalisability of our findings.</p>
              <p id="para430">Loss to follow-up in our trial was higher than anticipated. Although this is a limitation, we were able to achieve a response rate of more than 80% for the co-primary outcomes, and the overall results were unaffected in our sensitivity analyses. We were also unable to enforce a standard interval between randomisation and surgery. The NHS waiting list target of 3 months for routine operations prompted us to collect primary outcome data at 15 months after randomisation. Our expectation was that this strategy would allow a minimum of 12 months of follow-up but a tenth of women (balanced across the two study groups) faced delays in receiving treatment because of waiting list pressures or inability to attend hospital for surgery due to illness. In 14 (2%) of 616 participants, this delay resulted in an overlap between the 6-month post-surgery and 15-month post-randomisation questionnaires.</p>
              <p id="para440">More subserosal and intramural fibroids were reported in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group. This finding was not entirely unexpected, as this strategy allows visual detection of small subserosal fibroids that can be missed at a baseline ultrasound scan. Although randomisation might have resulted in similar numbers of fibroids (both detected and undetected) in both groups, outcomes were better in those randomly assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.</p>
              <p id="para450">Our results show a clear clinical benefit associated with both surgical techniques but measures of satisfaction, quality-of-life scores, and outcomes such as amenorrhoea, residual menstrual bleeding, and pelvic pain were more positive for laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy compared with endometrial ablation. Specifically, only 3% of women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group reported dissatisfaction compared with 13% of women in the endometrial ablation group. 69% of women assigned to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy achieved a maximum condition-specific quality-of-life MMAS score of 100, compared with 55% of those assigned to endometrial ablation. Although both procedures were associated with a reduction in symptoms of dyspareunia, improvement was more marked in women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group, possibly because the uterus was removed. Thus, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy appears to be a more effective surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding than endometrial ablation.</p>
              <p id="para460">At recruitment, the physical and mental components of the SF-12 generic quality-of-life questionnaire in all participants with heavy menstrual bleeding were lower than normative values for healthy women of an equivalent age,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> with mental health scores being particularly low. By 15 months after randomisation, the physical component in both trial groups and the mental component in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group had returned to normative values.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Although those allocated to endometrial ablation reported higher generic quality of life values at 6 weeks, possibly representing quicker recovery, by 15 months the visual analogue scale of EQ-5D and the mental component of SF-12 favoured those allocated to laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.</p>
              <p id="para470">A previous individual participant data meta-analysis found total hysterectomy to be more effective than endometrial ablation, with dissatisfaction rates of 5% versus 15%,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> although total abdominal hysterectomy was noted to be more invasive than endometrial ablation, with higher morbidity and prolonged recovery times.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The HEALTH trial has shown that outcomes after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy are similar to those achieved after total hysterectomy but with lower morbidity (&lt;5%), which is similar to endometrial ablation. These relative benefits of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy should be offset against the longer total theatre time (almost 2 h compared with 45 min for endometrial ablation), early post-operative pain, greater duration of hospital stay (one in three women staying more than 24 h after the procedure compared with one in five for endometrial ablation), and prolonged recovery times (mean return to social or sporting activities of 42 days compared with 14 days).</p>
              <p id="para480">The results of our predetermined subgroup analyses showed that the presence of fibroids was associated with poorer outcomes after endometrial ablation compared with laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy. However, because of the small patient numbers and the differential detection of fibroids between the two groups, this result should be interpreted with caution. Age (&lt;40 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥40 years), symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, or cavity length (≤8 cm <italic>vs</italic> &gt;8 cm) did not have a significant effect upon clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="para490">Both endometrial ablation and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy improved menstrual symptoms. 81% of patients having amenorrhoea after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy corresponds with longer-term published data,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> but amenorrhoea in women after endometrial ablation was higher in our trial than the 40–50% reported in the literature.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Our results correspond with those reported in a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis of trials comparing total hysterectomy with endometrial ablation,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> despite the fact that laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy preserves the cervix and does not guarantee amenorrhoea. Two smaller randomised trials compared endometrial ablation with laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and support our findings, although the time to discharge after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was longer in our trial. This difference could reflect the culture within a public health-care system and traditional post-surgical expectations of patients, relatives, and clinical staff. The introduction of specific enhanced recovery programmes,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> which were not a statutory part of postoperative care for laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy in our trial, might reduce the length of hospital stay in the future. Despite a median pain score of 1 2 weeks after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy, return to normal activities was almost 6 weeks. This difference might reflect historical advice for allowed and expected convalescence after hysterectomy given by family doctors and nurses in the UK, and should be addressed through education and information packages to account for different approaches to undertaking this common operation.</p>
              <p id="para500">This trial supports the previously reported reduced risk of complications with laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy, which was comparable to endometrial ablation and much lower than for total hysterectomy. We found no evidence of bladder symptoms (urinary urgency, stress, or mixed incontinence) being negatively affected after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.</p>
              <p id="para510">The main disadvantage of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy compared with total hysterectomy is ongoing cyclical bleeding from the retained cervical stump. A Cochrane review of total versus subtotal hysterectomy suggested a cyclical bleeding rate of 5–10% after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> although a higher rate of 23% has been reported by Lieng and colleagues.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Despite routine electrosurgical cauterisation of the cervical canal after removal of the body of the uterus, in our trial 19% of women in the laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy group continued to have light cyclical bleeding or spotting.</p>
              <p id="para520">The higher number of reoperations in the endometrial ablation group is supported by the literature, which suggests that almost 20% of women undergoing endometrial ablation will have a hysterectomy within 5 years.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The number of subsequent surgeries after laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is not well known, although figures around 7% have been reported by 3 years.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The proportions of reoperations required will have an effect on cost-effectiveness and could influence patient preference for one treatment over the other.</p>
              <p id="para530">Our trial reflects contemporary practice in the UK, where NICE defines heavy menstrual bleeding as excessive menstrual bleeding that affects a woman's quality of life and recommends the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system or an alternative medical treatment as the first step in women with no identified pathology or fibroids less than 3 cm in diameter.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> When this strategy is unsuccessful, symptoms are severe, or pharmacological treatment is declined, women are referred to specialist care where the options include surgery (endometrial ablation or hysterectomy). As our eligible population comprised women with heavy menstrual bleeding referred by their general practitioners to gynaecology clinics, we expect our results to be generalisable to women who have been previously offered medical treatment. In this population, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was found to be more effective than endometrial ablation for treating heavy menstrual bleeding without the risk of complications associated with total hysterectomy.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Thus, for gynaecologists with intermediate laparoscopic skills, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy provides an effective, minimally invasive surgical option that has the potential to reduce the number of open hysterectomies and their attendant complications and slow recovery times.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para540">As in this trial, most second-generation endometrial ablations are still done under general anaesthetic in an operating theatre, but the procedure can be done under local anaesthetic in an outpatient setting.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Newer, portable, small-diameter ablative devices with quick treatment times should encourage movement of endometrial ablation out of the traditional operating theatre. Our trial results could help inform greater choice for women with heavy menstrual bleeding seeking surgical treatment. Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy could be offered to women who want a general anaesthetic for their procedure and who are accepting of a longer recovery time. By contrast, endometrial ablation could be offered as a convenient outpatient procedure in women who are content to have local anaesthetic and who prioritise a less invasive procedure with quicker recovery over potentially reduced effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="para550">Concerns have been raised about the potential risk of disseminating cells from undiagnosed uterine malignancy associated with the use of morcellators during laparoscopic hysterectomy in women with fibroids.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Risk factors highlighted by an updated estimate of leiomyosarcoma incidence at hysterectomy include age older than 50 years and the presence of larger fibroids,<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> both of which were exclusion criteria for the HEALTH trial. We were reassured by the absence of any histological abnormalities in this trial, including women with known fibroids of less than 3 cm in diameter. However, a high level of vigilance is required for hysterectomy where fibroids are present, and morcellation should be avoided if there are concerns of malignant changes within a fibroid. In the absence of accurate biomarkers, this decision would need to be based on morphological features or evidence of rapid growth. Morcellation within containment bags or removal of the uterus via a culdotomy are options for preventing tissue fragment dissemination. The risk of overlooking latent malignancy within a presumed fibroid is also relevant in all women undergoing endometrial ablation or any other conservative treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding where the uterus is preserved.</p>
              <p id="para560">Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was introduced because of its simplicity and potential to reduce surgical morbidity. However, further advances in instrumentation, improved training, and greater familiarity with laparoscopic surgery, combined with a greater appreciation of interventions to enhance surgical recovery might reduce these relative benefits of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy over total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Future trials comparing the two laparoscopic approaches to hysterectomy could help elucidate their relative advantages and disadvantages. Given the greater effectiveness of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy, albeit with longer operating times, hospital stay, and recovery time, a comprehensive heath economic evaluation of the two procedures over a medium-term to long-term time horizon is indicated. Such a study is currently being done by our group. Additionally, we intend to undertake longer-term follow-up of clinical and quality-of-life outcomes and further interventions for both study groups.</p>
              <p id="para570">In conclusion, laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy is more effective than endometrial ablation, without any additional risk of complications, but this treatment takes longer and is associated with increased time to full recovery. With an increasing number of options available for women with heavy menstrual bleeding it is important to explore how these techniques and the attributes associated with them—for example, care delivery systems, wish for amenorrhoea, and willingness to have treatment in a formal operating theatre or hospital setting—can influence patient choice. Methods of reducing recovery times and associated costs after surgery, including enhanced recovery interventions and packages of care, need further evaluation. Additionally, although endometrial ablation has been shown to be safe and acceptable under local anaesthetic, the reasons why most procedures are still undertaken in traditional theatre settings needs further investigation.</p>
