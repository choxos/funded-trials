                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Optimum physiotherapy management for people with a conservatively managed primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation is not known. The purpose of the ARTISAN trial is to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a course of usual care physiotherapy with a single session of physiotherapy and self-management, the ARTISAN intervention. ARTISAN is a UK multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>The intervention was developed following the Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions and will be reported in line with the template for intervention description and replication checklist (TIDieR) and the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template (CERT). It was informed by published research, national clinical guidelines, current clinical practice and patient and public involvement.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The ARTISAN intervention comprises education (Phase 1), progressive exercise (Phase 2 and Phase 3) and an optional return to sport component (Phase 4). Behaviour change strategies are embedded throughout intervention. The single session of physiotherapy is delivered by a chartered physiotherapist, within the first six weeks of injury, in an NHS outpatient setting. At the end of the initial session, paper-based booklets and/or a patient website with the same content are provided to participants to aid self-management and progression though the four phases of the trial intervention.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>The ARTISAN intervention was successfully implemented throughout the internal pilot and is suitable for testing in the subsequent definitive RCT ARTISAN trial.  </p>

Incidence is reported to be 8.2–23.9 per 100,000 people per year, 97% of these are anterior dislocations <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Traumatic Anterior Shoulder Dislocation (TASD) occurs when the humeral head is displaced out of the glenoid fossa because of an excessive force. A UK cohort study found that men aged 16–20 years and women aged 61–70 years have the highest incidences of TASD <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This bimodal distribution is similarly reported for US, Canada and Denmark <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0025">After a primary TASD people experience pain, functional limitation and are at high risk of future dislocations <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A course of physiotherapy aims to restore a painless and functional shoulder by using exercises to retrain muscles to maintain stability, restore joint movement and reduce the risk of re-dislocation <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A Cochrane review found no evidence that physiotherapy achieved these aims <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; Dutch national guidelines explicitly state not to refer to physiotherapy after a TASD <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and UK guidelines cite referral <italic>‘may be helpful’</italic>

              <p id="par0030">‘<italic>The Acute Rehabilitation following Traumatic anterior shoulder dISlocAtioN’</italic> (ARTISAN) trial was funded by the National Institute of Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (NIHR HTA 16/167/56) in response to the lack of high-quality evidence and clinical consensus for TASD management.

              <title>ARTISAN trial overview</title>
              <p id="par0035">ARTISAN is a UK multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial with 1:1 treatment allocation. The purpose of the study is to find out if a course of usual physiotherapy is clinically and cost effective when compared to a single session of physiotherapy with self-management materials <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0040">Study recruitment is ongoing across UK NHS services and will continue until 478 participants are randomised. People aged 18 years or over and have a primary TASD confirmed radiologically are eligible for the study. All baseline data are collected prior to randomisation including any new or pre-existing injuries in addition to the TASD.</p>
              <p id="par0045">People with bilateral shoulder dislocations, having first line surgical treatment, unable to receive physiotherapy within six weeks, or have significant neurovascular complication are excluded from the study.</p>
              <p id="par0050">All participants receive an initial physiotherapy appointment with a chartered physiotherapist, in an UK outpatient setting. After participants have received the initial session, the ARTISAN trial intervention, they are then randomised to either 1) the initial ARTISAN trial intervention session only with self-management materials or 2) the offer of further physiotherapy delivered according to participating sites’ usual practice.</p>

              <title>Developing the ARTISAN trial intervention</title>
              <p id="par0055">The ARTISAN trial intervention was developed following the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Using an iterative process based on research evidence, clinical guidelines, current practice, clinicians’ and patients’ opinions (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), the authors developed a rehabilitation intervention following a TASD injury. The intervention had four phases: 1) education, 2) range of movement exercises 3) strengthening exercises 4) returning to sports. The authors developed an intervention manual for physiotherapists and patient materials consisting of paper booklets and web-based materials.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>ARTISAN intervention development summary flowchart.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="par0060">Our aim was to ensure that the single session Artisan intervention was scientifically grounded, acceptable to patients and clinicians, and deliverable in the UK NHS setting.</p>
              <sec id="sec0020">
                <title>Clinical guidelines</title>
                <p id="par0065">In the UK, the British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS) and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) published joint guidelines, advocating conservative management for TASD for those aged 25 years and over, alongside early referral to physiotherapy <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. They did not make any recommendations regarding the content of rehabilitation. Outside of the UK, only one further set of national guidelines were identified. Dutch Orthopaedic Association guidelines stated that physiotherapy is not recommended after a TASD <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec0025">
                <title>Literature review</title>
                <p id="par0070">The authors searched the literature for further studies published after the updated the Cochrane review entitled ‘<italic>Conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder’</italic>
<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Using the same search strategies, the authors found no further published RCTs. Since starting ARTISAN an updated Cochrane review was published 2019, which has still found no further RCTs beyond immobilisation methods. The authors performed a second search by not limiting to RCTs, but excluding case studies, which resulted in two case series describing rehabilitation protocols <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="par0075">In parallel to this, the authors obtained full papers included in a second Cochrane review entitled ‘<italic>Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute anterior shoulder dislocation</italic>’ <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The aim was to collate and summarise rehabilitation protocols following conservatively managed TASD from these RCTs. However, rehabilitation protocols were either absent from the research papers or not sufficiently detailed to replicate.</p>
                <p id="par0080">Within the limited literature identified, there was a consensus on a phased approach to rehabilitation based on the underlying mechanism of injury and recovery time scales; beginning with simple range of movement exercises and progressing to strengthening exercises that are manipulated to be easier or more challenging by altering load, frequency and repetitions.</p>

                <title>Consultation and national survey of practice</title>
                <p id="par0085">A synthesis of clinical guidelines and current evidence was used as a basis for consultation exercises at five physiotherapy departments. The findings from these were used to inform a national survey, administered to 43 NHS sites, who had expressed an interest in taking part in the ARTISAN RCT, to establish a) what protocols are in use across the UK and b) current care pathways. Of the 43 responses received prior to piloting the intervention, seven used locally developed physiotherapy protocols. Sites were consistent with an educational component and phased exercise approach for rehabilitation.</p>

                <p id="par0090">The authors presented the intervention to a PPI focus group who framed the intervention around their experiences and expectations of physiotherapy after TASD. The PPI group discussed that although the content was relevant it lacked information to help them understand their injury more fully and aid with adherence to the programme, which the group all agreed was difficult, at times.</p>
                <p id="par0095">Subsequently the intervention was further refined to include behavioural components to facilitate self-management and aid with adherence. This included additional information to improve understanding of the injury and expected length of recovery, goal setting and an exercise log. Following these refinements, the intervention was presented back to both PPI and clinicians for final feedback prior to clinical implementation.</p>

                <p id="par0115">At each NHS site a physiotherapy member of the research team provides training to the physiotherapists participating at site initiation visits for the delivery of the ARTISAN intervention. The training, lasting up to two hours, includes study overview, trial processes, how to deliver each phase of the ARTISAN intervention and how to use patient materials to support behavioural techniques to improve self-management and adherence.</p>
                <p id="par0120">All aspects of the study intervention are summarised in a physiotherapy manual provided to all sites. The ‘train the trainer’ model is utilised whereby physiotherapists who attend the training sessions cascade the study information to physiotherapists who are unable to attend the training session or start delivering the study intervention at a later time. This is supported by the research team where required.</p>

                <title>Phase 2: range of movement exercises</title>
                <p id="par0175">All participants then receive a single session of physiotherapy that lasts up to one hour and is administered by an ARTISAN trained physiotherapist. Following routine assessment, the physiotherapist delivers the core set of intervention components as described in Phase 1 in addition to:<list list-type="simple" id="lis0010"><list-item id="lsti0060"><label>•</label><p id="par0180">Points of contact if complications occur or expected recovery times are not achieved.</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0065"><label>•</label><p id="par0185">A core set of progressive Phase 2 range of movement exercises and what they aim to achieve.</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0070"><label>•</label><p id="par0190">Enhancing self-management behaviours through the addition of goal setting, exercise planning and diaries.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="par0195">Phase 2 comprises of three shoulder range of motion exercises: active shoulder flexion, active shoulder scaption (lifting the arms from the sides in a slightly forward alignment) and active external rotation. If participants are unable to achieve active shoulder movement there is an option to regress the exercises to active assisted movement using the un-injured arm. The aim of this phase is to introduce gentle shoulder movements to the injured shoulder, improving range and decreasing fear of movement. The authors encourage early movement of the shoulder, in line with UK guidelines <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="par0200">The treating physiotherapists can tailor the starting point of the exercises based on the presentation of the participants during the initial session. For example, if a participant presents with full, pain free, shoulder range of movement in all directions during assessment then they can start their rehabilitation programme in Phase 3.</p>
                <p id="par0205">At the end of the session the physiotherapist provides details of web-based materials, which include all the delivered components in written and video format. Participants are also directed towards web-based materials to support future Phase 3 progressive strengthening exercises, what they aim to achieve and later stage Phase 4 progression to aid return to sports. Participants are offered paper-based alternatives.</p>

                <title>Phase 3: shoulder strengthening exercises</title>
                <p id="par0210">Following the initial physiotherapy session, participants can progress to Phase 3 as pain allows. The main aim of phase three is to progress from range of movement exercises to a progressive set of shoulder strengthening exercises, particularly the rotator cuff as one of the main stabilisers of the shoulder. The authors recommended a repetition range and the frequency to be performed per week but encourage participants to set their own personal goals related to what is achievable to them. For example, the authors suggest performing each exercise in sets of ten repetitions, three times daily, but to amend according to their pain and what is achievable. To monitor progress, participants are provided with an exercise log to record progression over time.</p>
                <p id="par0215">The first series of exercises are isometric shoulder flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation and internal rotation. The second series of exercises are isotonic active flexion, abduction and external rotation using a light weight. Pain inhibits the activation of the rotator cuff muscles which are the main stabilisers of the shoulder joint <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, isometric exercises could be effective in engaging the rotator cuff muscles without increasing pain due to movement during the early stage of rehabilitation. In addition, the authors have chosen simple isotonic shoulder exercises (i.e.: shoulder flexion/abduction in standing using weights) as our progression for shoulder strength as they are simple to adopt by participants and are functional movements <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

                <p id="par0220">This phase is optional for participants who intend to go back to sports. As part of the ARTISAN intervention no specific exercises are advised in this phase. Phase 4 consists of later stage information on how to return to sports, applicable to all levels. Advice includes phasing back into sports via gradual introduction to more contact and overhead activities, through to full training sessions and finally a phased return to a competitive environment (i.e. doing only part of a match to begin with). Participants are also provided with the typical time frame for returning to sports (within six months).</p>
