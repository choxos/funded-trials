                  <p>The CRASH-2 trial showed that TXA administration reduces the risk of death in
bleeding trauma patients with a small but statistically significant increase
in non-intensive care stay. A Markov model was used to assess the cost
effectiveness of TXA in Tanzania, India and the United Kingdom (UK). The
health outcome was the number of life years gained (LYs). Two costs were
considered: the cost of administering TXA and the cost of additional days in
hospital. Cost data were obtained from hospitals, World Health Organization
(WHO) database and UK reference costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in
international dollars ($) per LY. Both deterministic and
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of
the results to model assumptions.</p>

Tanzania, India and the UK respectively. The cost of giving TXA to 1,000
patients was $17,483 in Tanzania, $19,550 in India and
$30,830 in the UK. The incremental cost of giving TXA versus not
giving TXA was $18,025 in Tanzania, $20,670 in India and
$48,002 in the UK. The estimated incremental cost per LY gained of
administering TXA is $48, $66 and $64 in Tanzania,

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The CRASH-2 trial showed that giving TXA to bleeding trauma patients results in a
statistically significant and clinically important reduction in all-cause mortality
(RR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97), with no apparent
increased risk of vascular occlusive events <xref rid="pone.0018987-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The trial inclusion criteria
were clinical and did not depend on the results of laboratory tests. Patients were
enrolled if they were judged by the doctor to have on-going significant haemorrhage,
as evidenced by low blood pressure and a fast pulse, or if they were considered to
be at risk of significant haemorrhage, for example, patients with compensated
haemorrhage and stable vital signs, or those in whom bleeding might have stopped but
who might start bleeding again following resuscitation. Further analyses have shown
that the beneficial effects of TXA depend on the promptness with which TXA treatment
is initiated. Early treatment, within about three hours of injury, appears to be
more effective than later treatment. If administered within three hours TXA reduces
the risk of death by 13% (RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81
to 0.95), while if TXA is administered after three hours it is not effective and can
even been harmful <xref rid="pone.0018987-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
              <p>On the basis of the CRASH-2 trial results, it has been estimated that the widespread
use of TXA could save between 70,000 and 100,000 lives per year around the world.
Because over 90% of trauma deaths are in low and middle income countries the
potential for TXA to save lives is particularly high in these settings <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Nevertheless,
TXA is unavailable in many low and middle income countries. Indeed, some hospitals
in Africa that took part in the CRASH-2 trial, have reported that TXA is unavailable
for routine clinical use. In high income countries, due to the low cost of the
intervention, TXA is likely to be highly cost effective.</p>
              <p>Although TXA is relatively inexpensive, evidence on the cost effectiveness of TXA in
trauma is an important factor in the decision to include TXA on the WHO list of
essential medicines. Economic evaluations of TXA in elective surgery show that TXA
is a cost-saving intervention <xref rid="pone.0018987-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-Guerriero1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A recent study of the cost effectiveness of TXA in four
Sub-Saharan countries shows that in countries where there is either a shortage of
blood, or where blood is not properly screened, TXA can reduce mortality. In
countries where blood is available, TXA can reduce blood borne infections <xref rid="pone.0018987-Guerriero1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The objective of the present study is to assess the cost effectiveness of giving TXA
to bleeding trauma patients. The cost of TXA and its effectiveness will vary between
countries. In Low Income Countries (LICs), TXA is likely to cost less than in High
Income Countries (HICs) because both administration cost and cost per day in a
general ward are lower. However, in both LICs and Middle Income Countries (MICs)
life expectancies are shorter and there will be a lower number of life years gained
per patient. Using World Bank country classification criteria, the cost
effectiveness of TXA was evaluated in three countries: Tanzania (LIC with Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per capita $509); India (MIC with GDP per capita
$1,134); and the UK (HIC with GDP per capita $35,165) <xref rid="pone.0018987-World1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Tanzania was
chosen in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of TXA when income per capita and
life expectancy are low <xref rid="pone.0018987-World2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-World3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. India was selected because it is one of the MICs where
TXA can avert the highest number of trauma deaths <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The UK was selected because
within HICs it has an average GDP per capita and life expectancy.</p>

              <p>An economic evaluation was carried out to investigate the cost-effectiveness of
administering TXA for the treatment of significant haemorrhage following trauma.
Cost-effectiveness was measured by the incremental cost per life-year gained. The
life-years gained are estimated from a simple Markov model where patients are either
alive or dead, and by comparing the life-years experienced by a cohort who are given
TXA with one that does not receive TXA. The model has an annual cycle and a lifetime
horizon. Transitions between alive and dead in the first year are estimated from the
CRASH-2 data, and in subsequent years from life tables. Life-years gained were
discounted using an annual rate of 3.5%. The model was developed in Excel and
STATA 11 software was used for the statistical analysis.</p>
              <p>The cumulative risk of death during the first year in the placebo arm was estimated
using CRASH 2 data. After the first year, patients were assumed to experience the
same probability of death as the general population of a similar age, estimated
using country specific life tables from WHO <xref rid="pone.0018987-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Assuming that TXA is administered
within three hours (because after this time it is unlikely to be effective), the
risk of death in the first year after trauma in the intervention group was
calculated by multiplying the baseline cumulative hazard of the placebo group by the
relative risk reduction of all cause mortality estimated in the CRASH-2 trial
(RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95) <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Beyond twelve months the risk
of death in the intervention arm was assumed to be equal to the one estimated for
the placebo arm.</p>
              <p>Since the CRASH-2 trial recorded data up to 28 days or death, a parametric survival
function was fitted to extrapolate mortality experience over the twelve months
following injury. Different parametric survival functions (Weibull, Gompertz,
log-logistic, log-normal and generalised gamma) were compared using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC), and Cox-Snell residuals were plotted as a confirmatory
test <xref rid="pone.0018987-Cleves1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The
Gompertz model provided the best fit to the data. The Gompertz generic survival
function is <xref rid="pone.0018987-Cleves1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0018987.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>Where <italic>t</italic>
is the time-frame over which the cumulative probability of survival is estimated,
<italic>γ</italic> is an ancillary parameter that determines whether the
hazard of death increases over time (if <italic>γ</italic> is positive) or
decreases (if <italic>γ</italic> is negative). When covariates are considered in
the analysis <italic>λ</italic> is given by the following equation <xref rid="pone.0018987-Cleves1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0018987.e002.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>If data from the CRASH-2
trial are used the formula reported above becomes:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0018987.e003.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>γ (−0.20,
95% CI −0.21 to −0.18) is negative meaning that after trauma the
hazard rate decreases over time. Age, gender and GDP group were explored as
covariates in the Gompertz model. A GDP per capita was assigned to each country in
the trial according to the latest World Bank estimates and two binary variables,
X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>3</sub> were constructed to estimate whether the
likelihood of death changes according to the GDP <xref rid="pone.0018987-World2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. X<sub>2</sub> took the value 1
for LICs and 0 otherwise. Similarly X<sub>3</sub> took the value of 1 for MICs and 0
otherwise. As expected the baseline probability of death increases with age (age
coefficient = 0.020, 95% CI 0.016 to 0.024) while gender
was not found to be statistically significant (−0.06, 95% CI-0.22 to
0.11). Both GDP coefficients were found to be highly significant
(β<sub>2</sub> = −0.31;
β<sub>3</sub> = −0.61).</p>
              <p>Thus, the function for <italic>λ is</italic>:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0018987.e004.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula>Since the number of
life-years saved will depend in part on the age of the patient, the aggregate effect
across all trauma victims was estimated by first running the model for different age
groups, and then calculating the average result. Five age groups were identified
each representing a similar proportion of the total trial participants: 16 to 20
years; 21 to 25 years; 26 to 34; 35 to 50; and more than 50 years. Patients in each
group were assigned a starting age equal to the mean observed for that age group in
the trial. The cumulative hazard rate, the probability of death in the first year
after trauma, was estimated for each of these five mean ages. The overall number of
life years saved in each country was then calculated as a weighted average of the
results for the five age groups using the age distribution for trial participants in
countries of the relevant income group.</p>
              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0018987-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the extrapolated
hazard rate function during the first fifty days after trauma modelled from the
observed 28 day data for the placebo group in the trial. The modelled hazard rate
decreases to almost zero in the first 28 days after hospital admission and then
remains constant. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that
the majority of trauma-related deaths occur within a few weeks after injury. The
figure also validates the model assumption that after one year the baseline risk of
death is the same observed in the general population <xref rid="pone.0018987-Tien1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>

              <p>The incremental cost of TXA versus no TXA was calculated from a health service
perspective <xref rid="pone.0018987-National1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Two cost items were considered in the present study: the
cost of administering TXA to bleeding trauma patients and the incremental cost of
non-intensive care hospital stay. Given that costs associated with TXA
administration occur within one year post trauma, costs were not discounted. Costs
have been converted from national currencies into international dollars ($)
using Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) <xref rid="pone.0018987-Penn1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In the main analysis, the cost of TXA ($5.70 per g) was taken from the British
National Formulary and converted into international dollars <xref rid="pone.0018987-OECD1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-British1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The same price was assumed
for Tanzania and India in the absence of recent studies reporting the cost of TXA.
The influence of different drug prices on the cost effectiveness of TXA was explored
in one way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. A dose of 2 g (1 g loading dose
and 1 g maintenance dose) has been assumed as per the CRASH-2 trial protocol <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The CRASH-2
trial investigators estimate that the nursing time required to administer TXA ranges
between 10–60 minutes. In Tanzania, a nurse's salary depends on both rank
and on the location of the hospital. It can range between $800 per month, for
a principal nursing officer, to $300 per month, for a newly started nurse
(2008-9 prices) <xref rid="pone.0018987-Private1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. For the analysis, an average salary of $450 per
month, which is the salary of a nursing officer, is assumed <xref rid="pone.0018987-Private1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Using this estimate the
average cost per hour was estimated to be $2.40
(range:$1.60–$4.20) <xref rid="pone.0018987-Private1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-CIA1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The average salary for a nurse in
India varies by type of employer. Nurses working in public hospitals earn on average
30,000Rs ($2,044) per month while nurses employed in the private sector have
a salary ranging between 7,000 and 10,500Rs per month
($480–$720) <xref rid="pone.0018987-Bahalla1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-GMC1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-Private2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Assuming that a nurse works an average of 37.5 hours per
week, the average cost per hour of a nurse in India was assumed to be $8.08
(range: $2.83–$14.06). In the UK, the average cost per hour of a
nurse is $38 <xref rid="pone.0018987-OECD1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-Curtis1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The disposables used for TXA administration are two 10
ml syringes, two green needles, two bags of saline (100 ml and 500 ml for loading
and maintenance doses respectively) and an IV administration set <xref rid="pone.0018987-Trials1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The cost of a
syringe and needle was obtained from the study by Dziekan <italic>et al</italic>.
<xref rid="pone.0018987-Dziekan1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> who
estimated the average unit cost of syringes and needles in different regions of the
world. The cost of saline and an IV administration set was obtained from the British
National Formulary and converted into international dollars <xref rid="pone.0018987-British1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Storage and distribution
costs per intervention are negligible. The overall cost of administering TXA per
patient is estimated to be: $17.48; $19.55; and $30.83 in
Tanzania, India and the UK respectively.</p>
              <p>The improvement in survival following administration of TXA in the CRASH-2 trial was
associated with a slight increase in the number of days spent in non-ICU hospital
facilities (mean difference = 0.04, 95% CI 0.007 to
0.08, p = 0.0095). Since the incremental cost of non-ICU days
associated with TXA will vary between countries, the mean length of stay of CRASH-2
patients in the placebo arm was calculated for low, middle and high income
countries. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018987-t001">Table

                <p>One way sensitivity analysis was undertaken in order to assess the impact of
uncertainty regarding the input parameters. The incremental cost per life year

analysis was also conducted on the increase in non-ICU hospital stay following
TXA administration (95% CI 0.007 to 0.08).</p>
                <p>Due to the low cost of labour in both Tanzania and India, the drug cost
constitutes almost 70% of the overall intervention cost. A
cost-effectiveness analysis conducted by Casati <italic>et al</italic>. (1999)
estimated that TXA would cost $2.57 per g, while a study conducted
recently in India reported that TXA administration would cost $6.60 per g
<xref rid="pone.0018987-Casati1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,
<xref rid="pone.0018987-Rajkumar1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In
order to account for price variability between countries the cost effectiveness
of TXA was estimated assuming a price ranging between $2.57, from the
Casati <italic>et al.</italic> study, and $45.67 estimated by Eaton et
al. <xref rid="pone.0018987-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.
Finally one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate how the TXA cost
effectiveness changes according to different estimates of the cost of a non-ICU
day. The lowest estimates, for both Tanzania and India , were the cost per day
in a primary health centre ($9.84 and $18.75 respectively) while
the highest estimates ($18.69 and $35.41) were obtained from
tertiary hospitals <xref rid="pone.0018987-WHOCHOICE1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0018987-WHOCHOICE2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the UK, the minimum and the maximum non-ICU ward

                <p>Monte Carlo simulations were used to explore further the robustness of the
estimated cost-effectiveness. Uncertainty in the data was captured by fitting
probability distributions to each parameter. The Beta distribution was selected
for binomial data. All cost parameters, were assumed to follow a Gamma
distribution while a Log normal distribution was chosen for relative risk
parameters. Lastly, to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated survival
parameters, a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix was used to ensure
that the parameters of Gompertz parametric model, γ and λ, were
appropriately correlated on a log scale <xref rid="pone.0018987-Briggs1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. One thousand random
samples were taken from all distributions and 1,000 estimates of the incremental
cost, incremental life years saved and net monetary benefit were simulated. The
probability that TXA was a cost-effective intervention was estimated by counting
the proportion of simulations which produced positive net monetary benefits.
Results were displayed with a cost effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) that
shows the probability that the intervention is cost effective for different
willingness-to-pay values for a life year saved.</p>

                <p>Giving TXA increases costs because of the TXA administration cost and the longer
non-ICU hospital stay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018987-t002">Table
2</xref>). The incremental cost of TXA per 1,000 patients is $18,025,
$20,670 and $48,002 in Tanzania, India and the UK respectively
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018987-t002">Table 2</xref>). The
incremental cost of giving TXA is lower in Tanzania because both the personnel
cost for administering the drug and the unit cost of non-ICU day are lower. As
expected, the incremental cost of TXA is higher in the UK, where administering
the drug to 1000 trauma victims would cost $30,830.</p>

                <p>Life years saved were estimated taking into account the age distribution of the
trauma patients. The number of life years saved depends on both the baseline
risk of death after trauma and on the life expectancy. TXA would save 372 LYs
per 1,000 patients in Tanzania (which has lower life expectancy but a higher
baseline risk of death). While in India TXA would save 315 LYs per 1,000 trauma
patients. In the UK, where life expectancy is high, TXA can potentially save 755
LYs per 1000 patients. The incremental cost per life year saved is $48,
$66 and $64 for Tanzania, India and the UK respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018987-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>Results of one way sensitivity analysis are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0018987-t003">Table 3</xref>. In all three countries, the price of
TXA has a high impact on the cost effectiveness of the intervention. If the
price of 2 g of TXA is $2.57 the cost-effectiveness of TXA would be
$8 per LY (Tanzania), $12 per LY (India) and $26 per LY
(UK). While, if TXA unit cost is $45.6 per patient, as suggested in the
study conducted by Eaton et al. <xref rid="pone.0018987-Eaton1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, TXA incremental cost per LY saved would be
$124, $148, $86 in Tanzania, India and the UK respectively.
Another important determinant of TXA cost effectiveness is the RR reduction
associated with drug administration. If TXA was associated with a 19%
reduction in the probability of death (lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval) the incremental cost of TXA would be $33 in Tanzania,
$45 in India and $43 in the UK. Neither the cost per day spent in
a general ward, nor an increase in time spent in a general ward affect the cost
effectiveness of TXA in Tanzania and India. In the UK, where the cost of a
general ward is higher an increase in the mean length of non-ICU hospital stay
would have a greater effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.</p>

                <p>The selection of the parametric distribution with which to extrapolate survival
beyond study follow up can influence significantly the results of a cost
effectiveness analysis <xref rid="pone.0018987-Gerdtham1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The AICs and the Cox-Snell residual plots indicated
that the Gompertz model was the best-fitting model (e.g. the AICs were 10087
(Weibull), 9997 (lognormal), 10064 (log-logistic) and 9459 (Gompertz)). Using
different parametric distributions produced higher cumulative baseline hazards
at one year and consequently lower cost per life year saved. For instance, the
incremental cost per life year saved is $31, $37 and $34 in
Tanzania, India and the UK respectively if a Weibull parametric function were to
be adopted. The modelled gain in life years with the Gompertz model owes very
little to the extrapolation beyond 28 days, the cost per life year saved
increases from $48.4 to $48.6 (Tanzania), from $65.6 to
$65.8 (India) and from $63.5 to $63.8 (UK).</p>

the probability that TXA will be cost effective for a range of
willingness-to-pay values. Because of the cost of administering the drug and the
incremental non-ICU stay, the routine administration of TXA is never a cost
saving intervention. For any given willingness to pay between $25 and
$250 there is a greater chance of TXA being cost-effective in Tanzania
than in India or the UK. Overall, TXA is likely to be a cost effective
intervention even if the willingness to pay for an additional life year saved is
as low as $100.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study evaluated for the first time the cost effectiveness of giving TXA to
bleeding trauma patients in the UK, India and Tanzania, using primary data from the
CRASH-2 trial which provides the best source of scientific evidence that TXA reduces
the probability of death after trauma worldwide. This evaluation suggests that TXA
is not only life saving, as shown by the CRASH-2 trial, but also that it is a highly
cost effective intervention if administered routinely to bleeding trauma patients in
high, middle and low income countries <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Early administration (within
three hours) of TXA would cost $48, $66 and $64 per LY saved in
Tanzania, India and the UK respectively. According to the WHO Commission on
Macroeconomics, healthcare interventions costing less than GDP per capita per
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted should be considered “very cost
effective” <xref rid="pone.0018987-Commission1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. DALYs are a measure of the years of life lost from
disease and years lived with a disability. According to the World Bank
classification, GDP per capita in low income countries ranges from $380 to
$975, in lower middle income countries between $976 and $3855,
upper middle income between $3,856 and $11,905 and high income
countries GDP above $11,906 <xref rid="pone.0018987-World4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, if the life years saved by TXA are spent in
perfect health (one LY saved is equal to one DALY averted) TXA is a highly cost
effective intervention in all the countries considered. The sensitivity analyses
presented reinforce this conclusion.</p>
              <p>However, a number of limitations should be considered when interpreting these
results. It was necessary to model survival over 12 months using data for the first
28 days following the trauma and different statistical models will produce different
estimates of benefit. However, different models were explored and the one selected
as well as providing the best fit to the data also produced more realistic estimates
of the impact on long term survival. In this evaluation those predicted to survive
the first year following the trauma are assumed then to have the same life
expectancy as members of the general population of similar age and gender.</p>
              <p>A related limitation is that the measure of incremental cost-effectiveness is cost
per life year gained rather than cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (a year
in perfect health is considered equal to one QALY) gained or DALY averted. Depending
on the extent to which these patients do not enjoy perfect health, the cost per QALY
gained or the cost per DALY averted will be higher than the cost per life year
saved.</p>
              <p>A further potential limitation is that the analysis does not allow for future health
service savings. CRASH-2 showed that after 28 days the proportion of patients
reporting no symptoms at discharge was significantly higher in the TXA group
(14.7%) versus placebo (13.3%) (RR = 1.11,
95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, p = 0·0023) <xref rid="pone.0018987-CRASH21" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. If TXA patients
are more likely to survive without disability this study under-values the potential
cost saving arising from the administration of TXA since healthier people will have
lower future utilization of health care services.</p>
              <p>Identifying cost effective interventions to decrease the number of injury related
deaths is a major public health challenge. According to the Disease Control Priority
Project in 2001 unintentional injuries alone account for 6% of all deaths
worldwide <xref rid="pone.0018987-Norton1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.
The majority of unintentional injuries-related deaths, more than 90%, occur
every year in low and middle income countries posing a further financial burden on
these countries' economies and underfinanced health care systems <xref rid="pone.0018987-Norton1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p>This study suggests that TXA is a highly cost effective intervention in three very
different settings. Given that TXA is effective and it is of relatively low cost it
is not surprising that it is cost-effective in high income settings. However, it was
important to demonstrate that it was likely to be cost-effective in countries with
much more limited health care budgets, such as in Tanzania and India where due to
the high numbers of trauma victims this simple intervention can avert thousands of
deaths every year. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of TXA on the
quality of life of trauma patients.</p>
