                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Robotic radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a first-line curative treatment option for localized prostate cancer. Postoperative erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are common associated adverse side effects that can negatively impact patients’ quality of life. Preserving the lateral neurovascular bundles (NS) during RARP improves functional outcomes. However, selecting men for NS may be difficult when there is concern about incurring in positive surgical margin (PSM) which in turn risks adverse oncological outcomes. The NeuroSAFE technique (intra-operative frozen section examination of the neurovascular structure adjacent prostate margin) can provide real-time pathological consult to promote optimal NS whilst avoiding PSM.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">NeuroSAFE PROOF is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which men are randomly allocated 1:1 to either NeuroSAFE RARP or standard RARP. Men electing for RARP as primary treatment, who are continent and have good baseline erectile function (EF), defined by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score &gt; 21, are eligible. NS in the intervention arm is guided by the NeuroSAFE technique. NS in the standard arm is based on standard of care, i.e. a pre-operative image-based planning meeting, patient-specific clinical information, and digital rectal examination. The primary outcome is assessment of EF at 12 months. The primary endpoint is the proportion of men who achieve IIEF-5 score ≥ 21. A sample size of 404 was calculated to give a power of 90% to detect a difference of 14% between groups based on a feasibility study. Oncological outcomes are continuously monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Key secondary outcomes include urinary continence at 3 months assessed by the international consultation on incontinence questionnaire, rate of biochemical recurrence, EF recovery at 24 months, and difference in quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">NeuroSAFE PROOF is the first RCT of intra-operative frozen section during radical prostatectomy in the world. It is properly powered to evaluate a difference in the recovery of EF for men undergoing RARP assessed by patient-reported outcome measures. It will provide evidence to guide the use of the NeuroSAFE technique around the world.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par48">Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common non-skin cancer among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the United Kingdom (UK), it accounts for nearly 45,000 new diagnoses and 12,000 deaths each year, and incidence is rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a first-line curative treatment option for treatment of localized disease. Unfortunately, erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are common adverse side effects following RARP that can negatively impact quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These functional results may improve when the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) are preserved during a nerve-sparing (NS) RARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">However, during NS RARP, the dissection planes are closer to the prostate than during non-NS, which poses a risk of positive surgical margins (PSM) and potentially leaving tumour tissue behind. This entails the subsequent need of secondary treatments, increasing patient burden and risk of associated side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par50">Therefore, selecting men for NS RARP without jeopardizing the chance of cure by incurring in PSM requires careful planning. Current available planning techniques such as digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and predictive nomograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] are limited by low accuracy and operator dependent variability.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The NeuroSAFE technique is the intra-operative histological frozen section (IFS) analysis of the prostatic postero-lateral prostate margins. It was originally described by the Martini-Klinik in Hamburg, Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A recent systematic review performed by our group on IFS during RARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] identified three retrospective observational studies suggesting NeuroSAFE may safely increase NS during RARP without increasing PSM or cancer recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These studies, and a more recent retrospective cohort study by Fossa et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], suggest potential for improving EF preservation using the NeuroSAFE technique. However, all of these studies were at moderate or serious risk of bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This manuscript describes the protocol for the first multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the NeuroSAFE technique on erectile function (EF) of men with PC.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par52">The primary objective of the NeuroSAFE PROOF RCT is to assess whether NeuroSAFE RARP is superior to RARP without NeuroSAFE technique (standard RARP) in preserving EF. Key secondary objectives include to evaluate short term urinary continence recovery, oncological control, quality of life parameters, and health economics between both approaches.</p>

                <p id="Par53">NeuroSAFE PROOF is a superiority, multi-centre, single-blinded RCT in which men are allocated in a 1:1 ratio to NeuroSAFE RARP or standard RARP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> CONSORT flow diagram). This is the first properly powered trial to randomise men between RP conducted with the NeuroSAFE technique and RP conducted without the NeuroSAFE technique. We have previously published an earlier version of the protocol of the NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility trial, which demonstrated feasibility to proceed to this definitively powered RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In relation to the IDEAL recommendations for the development and evaluation of complex interventions, the NeuroSAFE PROOF RCT most closely aligns with stage 3 (Assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>NeuroSAFE PROOF CONSORT patient flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6421_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par56">An ethics committee approved patient information sheet (PIS) is provided to potentially eligible participants. Prospective participants are given time to read and understand the PIS before being re-approached to consider enrolment. Written informed consent is obtained from each patient prior to trial entry and the collection of baseline trial assessments (see Supplementary Material S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> for informed consent form (ICF)). The investigator, or their designee, must ensure adequate explanations of the trial whilst reinforcing that participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time without prejudice to his subsequent treatment. Members of staff who are trained to take consent, as indicated by the principal investigator (PI) on the delegation log for that site, take written informed consent in a face-to-face visit. After COVID-19 related disruption, a protocol amendment allowed the use of an electronic remote consent platform that has enabled to continue recruitment complying with recommended governmental advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par57">The NeuroSAFE PROOF team works closely with other PC research teams, including the Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics Group at UCL. As such, we invite participants in the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial to consent to the use of their prostatic tissue for further translational cancer biology research. Details of the proposed tissue sampling are described in the approved PIS and are included as an additional ‘opt-in’ on the ICF. A prospective participant may prefer not to consent to tissue sampling for molecular diagnostics and therapeutics and may still consent to being involved in the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par58">The National Prostate Cancer Audit report 2020 shows that 89% of UK radical prostatectomy is now performed by RARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. RARP is associated with a lower operative blood loss, blood transfusion rate than laparoscopic surgery and a shorter hospital stay than open surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. RARP results in oncological outcomes which are non-inferior to open or laparoscopic surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Current UK NS practice during RARP involves the operating surgeon deciding which nerves he feels he can spare based on the clinical examination, mpMRI, and biopsy findings. This standard of care was selected as our control arm. Prediction of extra-prostatic extension (EPE) of prostate cancer to avoid PSM is paramount. Various techniques have been proposed to predict EPE, but all have their limitations. Transrectal ultrasonography and digital rectal examination (DRE), even in combination, are hampered by insufficient sensitivity (71.1%) and specificity (41.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The use of pre-operative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for prediction of EPE has variable reported diagnostic accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Lastly, EPE prediction nomograms have been widely developed; however, a systematic review and external validation study by Rocco et al. demonstrates their performance is not reliable when applied in centres away from where they originate, and such tools fail to define the side, location, or volume suspicious for EPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par59">A systematic review has been performed by our group on IFS evaluation of the prostate margin during radical prostatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Ten non-randomized comparative studies (including 16, 897 patients) were retrieved. According to risk of bias assessment, seven studies suffer from serious risk of bias, whereas three studies suffer from moderate risk of bias. Performance of IFS greatly differed technically between studies. Eight studies report a reduction in rates of PSM (− 1.4 to − 14.5%) with the use of IFS and two studies report higher PSM rates (+ 0.4% to + 10%) in the IFS group. Four studies that perform IFS systematically at the posterolateral margin of the prostate (the NeuroSAFE technique) all report either improved NVB preservation or improved EF recovery. Our groups’ conclusions included that, no RCTs were identified, and most of the included studies were at high risk of bias. Furthermore, only very few of the studies included results on either long term oncological or functional outcomes. Therefore, we decided to evaluate NeuroSAFE as our intervention in a randomized prospective study.</p>

Further information about the steps of the NeuroSAFE RARP can be viewed in the video prepared by the TMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Briefly, unless it is technically impossible or deemed to be unsafe because of intra-operative findings, the surgeon starts with a bilateral NS RARP, after which the prostate is removed from the body through an enlarged umbilical incision as soon as it has been detached from surrounding structures. Upon removal from the patient, the safety of the NS is checked by performing IFS analysis of neurovascular structure adjacent margin (the NeuroSAFE technique). Whilst the NeuroSAFE technique is being performed, pneumoperitoneum is re-established with the Alexis Laparoscopic System (Applied Medical Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) and the final steps of the RARP, such as the urethrovesical anastomosis and pelvic lymphadenectomy (where appropriate) may be performed. Directly following RARP, the operating surgeon is asked to grade the quality of NS performed on each side as above. Based on analysis of the results of the NeuroSAFE PROOF Feasibility Study, the trial team estimated the additional cost of the NeuroSAFE technique during RARP, including additional time spent in the operating room (OR), to be £625.10 (Supplementary Material S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for further detail).</p>

The whole prostate is then transported to the histopathology department where the entire inked margin is cleaved by a straight blade. This inked postero-lateral portion of the prostate is further divided by perpendicular cuts at intervals of 4–5 mm from apex to base. Depending on the size of the prostate, a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 pieces are obtained. Each piece of prostate tissue is then embedded into optimal cutting temperature compound on a cryostamp and frozen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). The frozen prostate tissue is then transferred to the cryostat for sectioning at a tissue thickness of 5 μm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C) before staining with haematoxylin and eosin. Slides are examined by a consultant genito-urinary histopathologist and the results are conveyed to the console surgeon in the OR.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Images showing the performance of intra-operative frozen section as per the NeuroSAFE technique. <bold>A</bold> Ink stains the left (yellow) and right (green) neurovascular structure adjacent prostate margin, respectively. <bold>B</bold> After cleaving the right side and slicing perpendicularly a 5-mm piece of prostate tissue sits on the cryostat before freezing. <bold>C</bold> Once embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and frozen, 5-μm sections are prepared on the microtome before staining</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6421_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

When the margin is positive, further information is collected to inform the intra-operative secondary resection (SR) decision including grade and length of cancer seen at the margin. Once the reporting pathologist has given a frozen section margin assessment (Supplementary Material S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> for model reporting proforma), each piece of prostate tissue is defrosted in warm water and placed individually in formalin for paraffin embedding and subsequent concordance assessment.

Following feedback received by the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial team during a PPI workshop in September 2018, participants are informed of the NS status following surgery by the clinical team.

In case a participant misses a trial related visit, trial personnel reach out to the patient by post or phone.

During the feasibility study, feedback received changed the frequency of follow-up from 4 visits during the first 12 months after surgery to 3 and informed the study design on blinding of patients (see Blinding section). More recently, in September 2020, the investigators convened an online PPI session attended by &gt; 40 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The audience were consulted in depth using teleconference polling techniques about the definition of EF preservation to select a primary endpoint that would be most meaningful to patients such as those enrolled in NeuroSAFE PROOF. Men who attended this event encouraged the NeuroSAFE PROOF researchers to elect for an IIEF-5 threshold of at least 20 for the definition of EF preservation. Furthermore, PPI representatives are on the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) and the IDMC for NeuroSAFE PROOF and will have oversight of the management of the research analysis.</p>

              <p id="Par153">The NeuroSAFE PROOF Feasibility Study opened recruitment in October 2017 and finished recruiting in December 2018. The definitive NeuroSAFE PROOF study opened to recruitment in January 2019 using the same trial identifier following a substantial amendment to the trial protocol. The trial team decided to transition to the full study through a substantial amendment (i.e. using the same trial identifiers) because it was felt, at the time, that this would be the most expeditious route and would facilitate ongoing conduct of and recruitment to the study at a time when there was considerable momentum. This decision was supported by the trial funder. In this manuscript, we report version 5.0 (May 2021) of the trial protocol. Earlier versions (including the feasibility study protocol) can be accessed on the NeuroSAFE PROOF ClinicalTrials.gov page via complete list of historical versions. All amendments were reviewed and approved by Sponsor, Health Research Authority and the Research Ethics Committee (REC) prior to any research activity permitted within said amendment. Permission for the full NeuroSAFE PROOF to continue to its definitive sample size, including patients recruited under versions 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, was granted on 16 June 2021 under version 5.0. COVID-19 travel restrictions have prompted the trial teams to conduct follow-up by telephone and collect PROMs by post, telephone, or electronically. At the time of writing, 230 patients have been recruited and randomised to the NeuroSAFE PROOF RCT. Estimated date for recruitment completion is December 2022.</p>
              <p id="Par154">NeuroSAFE PROOF will continue to recruit until the 404th patient is consented, randomised, and undergoes planned intervention. NeuroSAFE PROOF will therefore close when the last participant to undergo treatment completes the 5-year follow-up as per protocol.</p>
