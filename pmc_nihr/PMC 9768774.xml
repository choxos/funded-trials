                  <title>Background
</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age, and it is estimated that up to a third of women will experience it at some point in their lives. BV produces an offensive vaginal odour and it is associated with serious sequelae. The most frequently prescribed treatment for BV in the UK is 7-day oral metronidazole but recurrences are common following it. Dequalinium chloride (FluomizinÂ©) is an anti-infective, antiseptic agent administered as a vaginal tablet. Small studies have shown this to be an effective alternative to antibiotics as a BV treatment. This trial aims to investigate whether dequalinium is as effective as current antibiotic treatments for the treatment of BV 1Â month after treatment start.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">DEVA is a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, parallel group, non-inferiority trial of dequalinium chloride versus usual care antibiotics for the treatment of BV. Recruitment will take place in 15 GUM clinics in the UK with Leeds Sexual Health also managing remote recruitment via the trial website. Women will be randomised 1:1 to receive dequalinium or usual care antibiotics. The primary outcome is to determine if the proportion of women reporting resolution of BV symptoms 4Â weeks after treatment (without the need for additional treatment) is not worse in women treated with dequalinium chloride compared to usual care antibiotics. Questionnaire follow-up will take place 4 and 12Â weeks after starting treatment, and remotely recruited patients will also provide a week 4 BV vaginal smear. The sample size is 904.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This trial will provide high-quality evidence on the use of dequalinium chloride as a BV treatment, which could result in patients reducing the number of antibiotics they take.</p>

It is associated with miscarriage, preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and pelvic inflammatory disease which causes infertility. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</p>
                  <p id="Par24">The most frequently used treatment for BV in the UK is 7-day oral metronidazole. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] This has microbiological resolution rates of 61â94% 1Â month after treatment. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Recurrences are common, occurring in 23%, 43% and 52% of women at 1, 3 and 6Â months post-treatment with metronidazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are other antibiotic treatment regimens recommended in national guidelines using intravaginal metronidazole, intravaginal or oral clindamycin or oral tinidazole but the failure rates are similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Recurrent BV has a severe impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and vulvovaginal candidiasis often occurs following antibiotic treatment for BV. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p>
                  <p id="Par25">Dequalinium chloride (currently available under the brand name FluomizinÂ®) is an anti-infective and antiseptic agent belonging to the class of quaternary ammonium compounds. It is a surface-active substance and the primary mechanism of action is an increase in bacterial cell permeability leading to loss of enzyme activity, resulting in cell death. Dequalinium chloride exhibits rapid bactericidal activity and in the form of vaginal tablets exerts its action locally within the vagina. It is administered as a 10-mg vaginal tablet daily for 6Â days. Advantages of dequalinium chloride in comparison to oral antibiotics used to treat bacterial vaginosis include broad antimicrobial spectrum, lower risk of development of resistance, achieving a high concentration of the substance at the infection site and minimal systemic exposure. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Dequalinium chloride was licensed for use in the UK in June 2015 and is currently the only antiseptic licensed for the treatment of BV in the UK. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</p>
                  <p id="Par26">There is only one published randomised control trial (RCT) to date comparing dequalinium chloride with a guideline-recommended treatment, vaginal clindamycin cream. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] This was a single-blinded, randomised trial in 15 sites and included 321 women. Women were randomised to either vaginal dequalinium chloride tablets or vaginal clindamycin cream. Follow-up visits were 1Â week and 1Â month after treatment. The trial showed a dequalinium chloride clinical cure rate, based on Amselâs criteria, of 79.5% at 30Â days but it did not include patient-centred outcomes and there was no longer-term follow-up to assess recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In an additional RCT comparing dequalinium chloride to povidone-iodine (which is not licensed for BV treatment and is not a guideline-recommended BV treatment), 78.3% of women treated with dequalinium chloride had BV resolution at 30Â days. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] However, no previous RCT has compared dequalinium chloride to the most commonly used antibiotics prescribed to treat BV.</p>

                  <title>Trial rationale</title>
                  <p id="Par27">Alternative treatments for BV are clearly needed. In a qualitative study of women who had experienced BV, most were dissatisfied with current treatments. Although antibiotic treatment is effective at the time of treatment, many women felt frustrated and distressed at having BV recur, often quite quickly after treatment. Most women disliked taking antibiotics, especially on a regular basis, and felt frustrated at the lack of alternative effective treatments. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] Identifying novel and effective treatments will improve the care and wellbeing of women experiencing BV and reduce their complications from it. Fewer return visits, and reduced complications, due to less frequently recurrent BV, also have the potential to reduce health service costs.</p>

                  <title>Justification for participant population</title>
                  <p id="Par28">The target population is women with symptoms of BV with confirmation of BV on microscopy examination of a sample of vaginal discharge with the presence of vaginal odour and including those with either first or recurrent episodes. The trial is inclusive with primarily safety issues (e.g. allergies to dequalinium chloride or usual care antibiotics) or a clinical requirement for antibiotic therapy and/or the use of other intravaginal therapies, being exclusion criteria. The UK guideline for the management of bacterial vaginosis recommends that symptomatic pregnant women should be treated in the same way to non-pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, pregnant women with an ongoing pregnancy who are not planning to seek a termination of pregnancy are eligible for inclusion within the trial. Also, unlike many other BV treatment trials, women living with HIV are eligible for inclusion.</p>

Women will be recruited either face-to-face or remotely from a minimum of 15 sexual health clinics in the UK or following initial self-referral and completion of an expression of interest (EOI) form via the DEVA trial website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.devastudy.ac.uk">www.devastudy.ac.uk</ext-link>). The participant information sheet and animations to support the trial documentation can be found on the trial website. An embedded Study Within a Trial (SWAT) investigating the timing of reminder communications has been built into the trial design. Details of the SWAT can be found on the SWAT repository 118 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and will be reported separately.</p>

                <p id="Par31">The trial allows for patients to be identified and recruited into the trial by recruiting sexual health clinics or via the trial website, through one of three recruitment pathways. Recruitment was adapted from the original design to take into consideration changes that have been made to clinical services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p id="Par33">Patients with suspected BV will be identified locally and will have a remote consultation with a member of the clinical team where the trial will be discussed. The participant information sheet (PIS) will be provided and informed consent form (ICF) completed by the patient and investigator remotely. Each consented patient will be posted a vaginal swab kit to take two swabsâa BV smear swab to assess eligibility and a swab for STI screening (<italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> testing using nucleic acid amplification tests). Patient-taken swab samples will be posted to the team at Leeds Sexual Health (LSH) for BV microscopy (using Nugentâs scoring) to confirm eligibility. LSH will report these results back to the recruiting site. The recruiting site will conduct a second remote consultation with the patient and those with BV on microscopy who want to participate will complete a final eligibility assessment and be randomised during the consultation. Trial medication will be dispensed and posted immediately by the site following randomisation, and the team at LSH will post out a week 4 vaginal BV smear sample kit.</p>

Patients who pass the EOI webform pre-screen will be contacted by a member of the DEVA research team at LSH, who will manage the care of all patients identified via the website. During the initial call, the team will assess whether the patient is eligible and interested in participating in the trial; those who are will be sent the PIS and informed consent form (ICF) electronically. Each consented patient will be posted a vaginal swab kit to take two swabs, a BV smear for eligibility and a swab for STI screening. Patient-taken swab samples will be returned to the team at LSH to confirm BV status and eligibility for the trial. Those with BV on microscopy who want to participate will complete final eligibility assessments and be randomised during a second consultation.

                <p id="Par91">The primary approach to the primary comparative analysis will be to analyse as randomised without imputation of missing data unless the proportion of missing data is greater than anticipated (i.e. greater than 20%) with due emphasis being placed on the confidence intervals for the between-arm comparisons. It is expected that adherence with trial treatment will be high. However, if it is lower than expected, a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will be performed to check the stability of the conclusions. Compliers will be those reporting the use of at least 75% of the treatment. The SAP will provide details of circumstances where a CACE analysis should be performed.</p>
                <p id="Par92">Continuous variables will be summarised, dependent on distribution, in terms of the mean, standard deviation, median, lower and upper quartiles, minimum, maximum and number of observations. Categorical variables will be summarised in terms of frequency counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics of demographic and clinical measures will be used to assess balance between the randomised arms at baseline, but no formal statistical comparisons will be made.</p>
                <p id="Par93">The evaluation of the primary outcome will be performed using a mixed effects model for the binary outcome that includes factors used in the minimisation (first/isolated episode or recurrent BV, female sexual partner in the previous year, method of contraception, pathway; the inclusion of site will be dependent on model convergence). If this model does not converge, a generalised estimation model with site as a panel variable may be used instead. The primary effectiveness parameter comparing dequalinium chloride with the usual care arm will be the risk difference in the proportion of participants who report resolution of symptoms 4Â weeks after treatment for BV with no additional treatment, along with the 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Dequalinium chloride will be regarded as non-inferior to usual care antibiotics if the lower bound of this 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the risk difference (dequalinium chloride minus usual care antibiotics) isâââ10% or greater (e.g. a lower bound of 9% would infer non-inferiority), i.e. dequalinium chloride is not likely to be worse than usual care antibiotics by more than 10%. Secondary outcomes with the exception of side effect data will be analysed using appropriate regression models including minimisation variables and baseline values of that outcome if measured. The analyses of secondary outcomes will be considered supportive to the primary and estimates and <italic>p</italic>-values (where presented) should be interpreted in this light.</p>
                <p id="Par94">Side effect data will be summarised using descriptive statistics according to the treatment the participant actually received, irrespective of randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par95">The economic analysis will compare the costs associated with dequalinium chloride with usual care antibiotics. The economic evaluation will use only data collected within the trial and so estimates of costs and outcomes will therefore relate only to the initial period and assessment at week 4 and week 12. The primary analysis will be based on cost per patient with resolved symptoms at week 4 (as per the trial primary outcome), with a secondary analysis of cost per patient without recurrence of symptoms at week 12.</p>

Adherence level will be measured using simple categories asking how much of the trial medication the participant used/took (highâ&gt;â75% used/taken, more than half (50â75% used/taken), less than half (1â49% used/taken), from both treatment arms.</p>

To address this, we implemented the two remote recruitment pathways. The introduction of a website recruitment pathway will improve the generalisability of the results for the trial as it opens up the trial to all women in the UK creating a much larger, more diverse group of potential participants, compared to those attending a local sexual health clinic. We hope that it will encourage women who may not feel comfortable visiting their GP or local sexual health clinic with their BV symptoms to participate as there is no in-person contact and all trial samples can be taken privately at home.</p>
              <p id="Par110">To support the identification and recruitment of patients, we have designed and launched an advertising campaign for the trial on social media and search engines. Our social media adverts are targeted to specific demographics using a range of different images of women who represent our target age groups and a diverse range of ethnicities. We will monitor the engagement of each of the adverts to see which are the most successful and whether this is impacting the demographic of the participants that we are recruiting.</p>
              <p id="Par111">A limitation to the trial design is the reliance of pathway 3 recruitment on the advertising campaign and overall success of publicising the trial. As women will not be introduced to the trial in the traditional format, during a consultation, it is important that we have full oversight and understanding of the advert engagement statistics and continue to develop campaigns in collaboration with our patient and public involvement reps to ensure the adverts remain relevant and appealing. Additionally, whilst we have implemented a number of different methods to keep participants engaged following recruitment, we are unsure whether the recruitment approach (in-clinic or remote) will impact the overall adherence to treatment and trial retention but we will monitor this closely.</p>
              <p id="Par112">The results from this trial will provide important information on the effectiveness of dequalinium chloride and usual care antibiotics on treating BV symptoms and provide us with valuable information on how to best manage BV patients and could potentially reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed to treat this condition.</p>
