                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Interim analysis was undertaken from an ongoing five-year open-label treatment phase after all patients completed three years in the open-label treatment phase or discontinued the study. Adult patients with episodic migraine enrolled in the open-label treatment phase initially received 70 mg erenumab monthly. A protocol amendment increased the dosage to 140 mg monthly to assess long-term safety of the higher dose. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events, electrocardiograms, laboratory assessments, and vital signs.</p>

                  <p>Of 383 patients enrolled in the open-label treatment phase, at data cutoff 235 (61.3%) remained in the study, all received 140 mg for ≥1 year. Median (Q1, Q3) exposure (70 or 140 mg) for all patients enrolled was 3.2 (1.3, 3.4) years. The most frequent adverse events (≥4.0/100 patient-years) were reported as viral upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, influenza, and back pain. Exposure-adjusted serious adverse event rates were 4.2/100 patient-years. There was no increase in cardiovascular events over time.</p>

              <p>Migraine is a long-lasting disorder whose attack frequency fluctuates in the individual patient (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Some patients need to be on preventive therapy for many years, requiring that treatments have favorable long-term risk benefit profiles (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Multiple studies have provided clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of investigational monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor (<xref rid="bibr3-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr7-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or the ligand itself (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="bibr9-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr10-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but to date there have been no studies assessing long-term tolerability and safety of these treatments beyond one year.</p>
              <p>Erenumab (in the US, erenumab-aooe) is a fully human anti-CGRP receptor monoclonal antibody approved in the US and EU for migraine prevention (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Across four registrational studies, the safety of erenumab has been evaluated in 2537 patients with migraine, representing 2310 patient-years of exposure (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). One study has an ongoing five-year open-label extension (6). Among these studies, the most common adverse events (incidence ≥ 3% for either 70 mg or 140 mg and more often than placebo) were injection site reactions and constipation (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Here, we present extended interim safety data after over 3 years of a 5-year open-label erenumab treatment of patients with episodic migraine who completed a 12-week double blind treatment phase. Efficacy and safety results from the double-blind treatment phase (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and a preplanned 1-year open-label interim analysis (<xref rid="bibr12-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have been previously published.

                <p>The 12-week double-blind treatment phase (DBTP) for this study (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) included patients with episodic migraine (EM) who received placebo or erenumab at 7 mg, 21 mg, or 70 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) monthly. Patients who entered the open-label treatment phase (OLTP) initially received erenumab at 70 mg SC monthly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102419854082">Figure 1</xref>). A protocol amendment increased the dosage to 140 mg monthly to assess long-term safety of the higher dose. This was a preplanned safety analysis of data from all patients who completed at least three years in the OLTP or discontinued the study during the OLTP before the data cutoff date. No new efficacy data are reported here because efficacy endpoints were not assessed during years 2 and 3 of OLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102419854082">Figure 1</xref>).

                <title>Study outcomes</title>
                <p>Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms, laboratory assessments, and blood pressure/heart rate and other vital signs. AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 20.0, and severity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. Dose level was classified based on the dose at which the AE occurred. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events were identified based on a search strategy composed of events from a Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) for ischemic central nervous system vascular conditions and ischemic heart disease, and an internal validated search strategy for peripheral arterial disease.</p>
                <p>We compared incidence rates to those observed during the DBTP and to those expected in the patient population based on an analysis of secondary data from the MarketScan® Research Databases in migraine patients with an age and sex distribution comparable to this study to estimate incidence rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This retrospective cohort study (n = 741,007) included adult patients with migraine, ages 18–65 years, identified from January 2010 through December 2011 using a combination of ICD-9 diagnosis codes (34i6.xx) and prescription claims for acute migraine medications (e.g. triptans or ergots) and followed through September 30, 2015 for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in view of the fact that CGRP can mediate vasodilation and given that the background rates of vascular disease are increased in individuals with migraine (<xref rid="bibr15-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr17-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Patients were required to have at least 12 months of continuous enrollment in MarketScan® to be included, and no cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events in the one year prior to the start of follow-up; the one-year cutoff was selected to be consistent with the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the erenumab double-blind clinical trials (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr7-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Cardiovascular events were defined as diagnoses of myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, Prinzmetal angina, coronary revascularization, and other and unspecified angina pectoris; cerebrovascular events were defined as ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), other acute cerebrovascular events, and other ischemic cerebrovascular events. Patient incidence rates (per 100 person-years) of new cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (along with 95% confidence intervals, CI) were estimated based on person counts within a particular event category and corresponding person-time. A patient with multiple cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events was only counted once within the category.</p>

                <p>All patients who received at least one dose of erenumab in the OLTP were included in the analysis. AEs are summarized as exposure-adjusted patient incidence rates, defined as the total number of patients who reported that event in a given time period of follow-up divided by total patient-years of exposure in that period. Total patient-years of exposure was defined as the sum of the duration of exposure from first erenumab dose to the earliest of end-of-study date, data cutoff date, or first report of event across all patients during the OLTP. Change from baseline values for safety endpoints were calculated based on OLTP baseline. OLTP baseline was defined as the last non-missing measurement for the endpoint of interest taken before the first dose of OLTP treatment.</p>

                <p>The open-label treatment phase (OLTP) enrolled 383 patients. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics of these patients are presented in <xref rid="table1-0333102419854082" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. After a median of 2.0 years exposure to 70 mg monthly in the OLTP, all remaining 250 patients increased the dose to 140 mg monthly following a protocol amendment.

Median (Q1, Q3) erenumab exposure (70 or 140 mg) for all patients enrolled was 3.2 (1.3, 3.4) years and median exposure to 140 mg was 1.2 (1.1, 1.3) years. One hundred and thirty-two patients discontinued erenumab treatment prior to the dose increase and 14 discontinued erenumab treatment while receiving 140 mg after the dose increase (<xref rid="table2-0333102419854082" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Very few discontinuations were due to adverse events or lack of efficacy and most were driven by patient request (<xref rid="table2-0333102419854082" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); however, further detail on reasons for patient request were not captured, such that additional information cannot be provided for these patients.

This event was adjudicated by an independent clinical endpoint committee as not being an event of myocardial infarction or hospitalization for unstable angina. Given the lack of a placebo arm, a large claims database of migraine patients was analyzed to establish background rates for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This three-year interim safety update of a five-year long-term open label study confirms the favorable tolerability and safety profile of erenumab seen in short-term and one-year OLE trials (3,4,6,7,12). This publication represents the longest-term data for a CGRP pathway-targeted therapy to date and allows for an assessment of the risk-benefit profile of erenumab treatment over 3 years of treatment. The safety profile of erenumab remained in line with that observed during the DBTP, with no increase in the rate of AEs over time or following the dose increase, and no evidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk.</p>
              <p>Safety and tolerability profiles during the OLTP (total exposure 961 patient-years) were similar to those observed for erenumab 70 mg in the double-blind parent study (total exposure 23.9 patient-years) and overall were similar to placebo (34.1 patient-years) in the parent study. Although constipation was identified as a common AE in the pooled analysis of the double-blind studies (<xref rid="bibr11-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), patient incidence rates for constipation were low in this OLTP (1.8 per 100 patient-years) and there were no cases of treatment discontinuation due to constipation. During the placebo-controlled studies, constipation events were mild and tended to dissipate over time, so it is unsurprising that it is not observed over longer treatment.</p>
              <p>Retention rates in long-term clinical trials provide an indication of the long-term efficacy and tolerability of therapies, and hence are of particular importance in chronic conditions. Of 383 patients who entered into the OLTP, patient retention rates at year 3 were relatively high (62%), highlighting the favorable long-term tolerability profile of erenumab and patient satisfaction with treatment, in contrast to those observed in long-term studies with other migraine preventatives (<xref rid="bibr18-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the 8-month open-label extension of the pivotal topiramate trials, 29% of participants withdrew and of those withdrawing 42% withdrew due to an adverse event (<xref rid="bibr18-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The observed discontinuation rate due to reported lack of efficacy or adverse events with erenumab in this analysis was low (&lt;5%). This is in contrast to the high discontinuation rates for commonly used migraine prophylactics (<xref rid="bibr18-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr20-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p>In short-term phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials of erenumab (including the double-blind treatment period of the study reported here), there was a low incidence of binding and neutralizing anti-erenumab antibodies. The incidence of anti-erenumab antibodies remained low throughout the OLTP, and only two patients developed positive non-neutralizing binding antibodies since the 52-week interim analysis of the OLTP, indicating that late development of anti-erenumab antibodies occurs infrequently. The development of anti-erenumab antibodies has not been associated with any clinical finding or safety events.</p>
              <p>Long-term safety assessments are often complicated by lack of placebo comparison, which makes it difficult to distinguish spontaneously occurring AEs or laboratory abnormalities from those due to treatment. In the absence of a placebo comparison, context can be added to events observed during open-label treatment by comparing with background rates observed in real-world settings. Given that CGRP can mediate vasodilation, at least in theory inhibition of CGRP's effects might pose a vascular risk, though this has not been observed in short-term placebo-controlled erenumab studies (<xref rid="bibr3-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr7-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Previously published epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with migraine compared to those without migraine, particularly among patients who experience migraine with aura (<xref rid="bibr15-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="bibr16-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr17-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Overall, migraine is significantly associated with myocardial infarction (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.7–2.8) and stroke (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.2–2.1) (<xref rid="bibr21-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the Nurses' Health Study II, adjusted for CV risk factors, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for women with migraine were 1.50 (1.33–1.69) for major CV events, 1.39 (1.18–1.64) for MI, 1.62 (1.37–1.92) for stroke, and 1.37 (1.02–1.83) for CV mortality when compared to study participants without migraine (<xref rid="bibr22-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In women, migraine with aura was the second strongest single contributor to major cardiovascular disease risk with an incidence rate of 7.9 per 1000 women per year (<xref rid="bibr17-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, in order to contextualize cardiovascular/cerebrovascular patient incidence rates in our study, a cohort of patients with migraine from the MarketScan® claims database of 741,007 persons over a similar follow-up period as this interim analysis was analyzed to establish background patient incidence rates. The cardiovascular background rates (0.42/100 person-years) were higher than those observed in the OLTP of this study (0.2/100 patient-years), consistent with the preclinical (<xref rid="bibr23-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and clinical observations (<xref rid="bibr24-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to date that erenumab does not increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events.</p>
              <p>The frequency of elevated ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN during the OLTP with 3 years of exposure was low given the long duration of follow-up. For each of these cases, elevation was &lt; 5 × ULN. For context, the frequency of ALT or AST elevation &gt; 3 × ULN over 12 weeks in the pooled placebo groups of four completed studies (<xref rid="bibr3-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0333102419854082" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) was 0.5%. Given the much longer period of observation in the OLTP, the low level ( &gt; 3 × but &lt; 5 × ) of AST or ALT elevation in few patients supports that long-term treatment with erenumab does not increase liver function tests. More importantly there were no cases of Hy's law, which predicts the potential for severe liver toxicity.</p>
              <p>In this three-plus years, long-term study of an antibody targeting the CGRP receptor, erenumab was found to be safe and well-tolerated with a spectrum and rate of AEs consistent with shorter-term placebo-controlled studies. The favorable tolerability and safety profile, and the low discontinuation rates, suggest that adherence is favorable with erenumab and may result in positive long-term outcomes.</p>
