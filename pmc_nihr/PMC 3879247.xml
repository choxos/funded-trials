                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Thirty older women aged 70–85 years of age who were offered preventive medication for osteoporosis and agreed to undertake two interviews at 6 and 24 months post-first prescription.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There were no overall predictors of adherence which varied markedly over time. Participants' perceptions and motivations to persist with medication were influenced by six core themes: understanding adherence and non-adherence, motivations and self-care, appraising and prioritising risk, anticipating and managing side effects, problems of understanding, and decision making around medication. Those engaged with supportive professionals could better tolerate and overcome barriers such as side-effects.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Many issues are raised following screening in a cohort of women who have not previously sought advice about their bone health. Adherence to preventive medication for osteoporosis is complex and multifaceted. Individual participant understanding, choice, risk and perceived need all interact to produce unpredictable patterns of usage and acceptability. There are clear implications for practice and health professionals should not assume adherence in any older women prescribed medication for the prevention of osteoporosis. The beliefs and motivations of participants and their healthcare providers regarding the need to establish acceptable medication regimes is key to promoting and sustaining adherence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is significant morbidity and mortality caused by the complications of osteoporosis, for which ageing is the greatest epidemiological risk factor. While other risks such as immobility, persistent low body weight, early menopause and corticosteroid use may lead to early onset of osteoporosis, around 40% of women aged 70 will have osteoporosis, and as many as 90% will have a significantly increased risk of fracturing a bone in a fall or accident <xref rid="pone.0083552-Kanis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This has led to a major research focus on the prevention of osteoporosis which has established that osteoporotic fractures can be significantly reduced by a combination of pharmacological (bisphosphonates with calcium and vitamin D supplements) and behavioural interventions (dietary intake, smoking cessation, and weight bearing exercise).</p>
              <p>More recent initiatives include the development of treatment algorithms and encouragement for primary care practitioners to identify patients who may be at ‘risk’ of fracturing and may benefit from preventive options <xref rid="pone.0083552-Verdijk1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0083552-SIGN1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) acknowledge, <italic>“identifying who will benefit from preventative treatment is imprecise”</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0083552-NICE1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. No population screening programme currently exists for osteoporosis risk, and individuals are identified clinically on a case by case basis. Predictive risk of fracture compared to the norm for age and sex can now be calculated using clinical risk factors in conjunction with bone mineral density (BMD) measurements using Dual energy X-ray Absorbtiometry (DXA) scans <xref rid="pone.0083552-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Kanis2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, creating new opportunities to identify individuals yet to sustain a fracture.</p>
              <p>For screening to be effective, participants identified as high risk must be receptive to the intervention. Achieving long-term adherence to prescribed medications is more complex than just providing sufficient information or an acceptable medication regimen. The literature suggests adherence is highly variable in osteoporosis prevention with age and co-morbidity explaining relatively little of the variability <xref rid="pone.0083552-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Solomon1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Attempts to reduce complexity in dosing regimens do not necessarily improve adherence <xref rid="pone.0083552-Recker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Rossini1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Patients are recommended to take their bisphosphonates first thing in the morning before eating or drinking and with a glass of water. There is a requirement for them to remain upright for 30 minutes to avoid irritation to the oesophagus. Calcium supplements are frequently provided in the form of chewy tablets. Patients may understand the potential for osteoporosis to have a negative effect on their lives, and express strong motivation to protect their health, but this does not always align with taking medications <xref rid="pone.0083552-IOF1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Pound1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This therefore makes the motivations and decision making of older women around uptake of preventive medication of primary importance to the public health impact of any potential screening programme as well as to the individual patient.</p>
              <p>It is also known that patterns of adherence to osteoporosis medications vary over time <xref rid="pone.0083552-Brookhart1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Pickney1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, a survey of patients and physicians showed that poor adherence reflected patient scepticism about the risks and values of treatment, rather than a lack of factual knowledge. A qualitative synthesis of studies on lay experience of medicine taking found widespread caution about taking medication with many participants ‘testing’ prescribed medicines for efficacy and adverse side effects <xref rid="pone.0083552-Brookhart1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Our pilot study found as many as 50% of women at ‘high risk’ of fracture in the 70–85 age group were not receiving treatment four months later <xref rid="pone.0083552-L1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We therefore undertook this study to explore the factors that influence older women's adherence to prescribed prophylactic medication when assessed to have higher than average risk of fracture following screening. This paper describes the perceptions and motivations to which participants attributed their willingness and ability to adhere to osteoporosis prevention regimes, and considers implications for practice.</p>

                <p>The Adherence To Osteoporosis Medication (ATOM Study) was established as a longitudinal qualitative study embedded within the Medical Research Council funded UK multi-centre randomised control trial on Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Women for the Prevention of Fractures (SCOOP). SCOOP <xref rid="pone.0083552-Shepstone1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> aims to explore the effectiveness of screening women aged 70–85 for the prevention of fractures using a risk-prediction algorithm.

                <title>Ethics Statement</title>
                <p>We secured approval from North West National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 07/H1010/70). Written informed consent was obtained from participants. Two participants with mild cognitive impairment were supported in the consenting and interview process by their husbands.</p>
                <p>The research comprised a longitudinal design with two in-depth interviews conducted 18 months apart, the first at around 6 months post-randomisation. The sample was drawn from those found to be at ‘higher than average’ risk of a subsequent fracture and whose prescribing data showed they had started medications for the prevention of osteoporosis. Participants were purposively sampled from demographic and adherence data already collected by the SCOOP trial (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0083552-t001">Table 1</xref>). As the focus of our study was to explore why older women were adherent, we constructed our sample to include more women self-reporting they were adherent when contacted by phone than reporting they were non-adherent to their osteoporosis medication.</p>

                <p>Interviews took place at participants' homes and lasted an average of 74 minutes. They were based on a topic guide developed to explore women's understanding of osteoporosis, responses to screening results, current usage of preventive medicine, motivators and detractors from taking medication and follow up with healthcare professionals. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Familiarisation, data management, coding and categorisation were carried out by the interdisciplinary research team including CS, LM and AH. Iteration between both data sets and the research literature helped inform the analysis at the explanatory level. The principles of Framework Analysis <xref rid="pone.0083552-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> were used to order, chart and search the data both manually and supported by relevant software (NVivo 9 Software, MSWord and Framework).

                <p>Of the 25 participants who took part in Phase 2 Interviews, thirteen had remained adherent to bisphosphonate medication and one previously non-adherent participant reported she had started taking her medication as prescribed. Eleven were non-adherent including three women that had given up their bisphosphonate medicine between interviews. Thus, a significant proportion of our sample were taking <italic>no medication</italic> for the prevention of fracture and osteoporosis at 18 months (44%). Even within the ‘adherent’ group, many women admitted deficits in their adherence; sometimes this was deliberate, to avoid inconvenience, sometimes it was because they forgot one day, but took it the next.</p>
                <p>We found no obvious pattern or factors linking with adherence. Responses to screening, acceptance of risk status, existing medical history, previous experience of falls, fractures and family history did not appear to predict womens' adherence status.</p>
                <p>Some participants complained about the complexity of the regimen, many had experienced side effects, some said their general practitioner had stopped the medication, and some had misunderstood the reasons for taking them long-term. However, many adherent women reported similar issues. Few cited ‘forgetting’ as a key cause of non-adherence. Almost all respondents declared a willingness to ‘in principle’ do what their general practitioner advised, but some non-adherent women cited medical permission or support for their choice to stop:</p>

                <p>Personal scepticism about the value of the treatments did not seem to link clearly with non-adherence. For example, the following participant was adherent to her medications, but demonstrated very little belief that she needed them at her age:</p>

                  <p>I thought well yes I am 80, so I probably have anyway (thinning bones) and I also thought it is a bit <italic>late</italic> to start treating me now I honestly did. That was my sort of attitude but the letter said ‘go and see your doctor’, so I went and saw my doctor and he gave me those. (Participant 24, age 80 - Adherent to both Bisphosphonates &amp; Calcium Phase 1, subsequently withdrew)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>By contrast Participant 22 was non-adherent. She felt anyone could break a bone in the next 10 years and would have expected to fracture by now if she was really at risk. She described how her own mother had fallen and broken her hip yet appeared to remain personally unconcerned:</p>

                <p>Phase 1 interviews specifically asked participants about their reaction to their recent risk assessment. Risk perceptions at this phase were mostly expressed in ‘sense making’ comments regarding the context of ageing. There was added complexity for participants who had been given a risk status of ‘higher than average’ but had no visible signs or experience of symptoms:</p>

                  <p>Oh yeah it's made me <italic>more</italic> careful since I had that density scan and had the letter to say that um (pause) you know on average, if I fell over I would more easily break a bone than you know than normal.

                <p>We explored the data for links between positive self-caring attitudes (as exemplified by women in the first interviews giving examples of longstanding commitment to weight bearing exercise and good nutrition) and active embracing of pharmacological options for preventing fractures. We also looked for an interrelationship between women's ‘accepting’ versus ‘questioning’ of their risk assessment and adherence to prescribed medication, including their reported participation in the decision making process and recourse to other support and information. Neither state appeared to be linked with long-term adherence with equal numbers of women remaining adherent to their medication who were ‘questioning’ (n = 7) as ‘accepting’ (n = 7). Furthermore, there was no link to adherence from either an initial strong emotive reaction or passive acceptance. For example, the following initially adherent participant had moved from a state of shock to positive acceptance, and yet gave up on her medication within a year:</p>

                <p>While severe side effects were linked to non-adherence, there was no simple relationship between side effects and persisting with medication, some trying up to 3 different medications. In fact, the anticipation of side effects seemed to be enough to put off some participants, with three in particular reporting that they were put off by the possible side effects described in the medicines information leaflet. Even the name ‘alendronic acid’ was cause for concern for some:</p>

Although there was fear and concern about developing osteoporosis, there was also a perception that falling and fracturing were normal in old age. Others debated the magnitude of risk, especially when compared to problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Some women questioned why the Dual energy X-ray Absorbtiometry screening had not been repeated to monitor the effectiveness of the medication.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The data overall show a group of resilient older women doing their best to make sense of a particular set of health opportunities in their lives, and keen to manage the impacts of ageing and minimise increasing frailty and dependence. There was evidence that those who had engaged with professionals to establish and maintain regimens could tolerate and overcome barriers to adherence which had defeated others. The variation of adherence over time suggests that health professionals should not assume adherence in any older women who has relevant medication on their repeat medication list, and that the uncertainty of risk and desire not to worry participants must not confuse messages that these drugs can have a real positive health gain.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, no previous studies have undertaken longitudinal in depth interviews to identify factors which influence adherence to osteoporosis regimens in women who have been identified at high risk of fracture. Thus, the strength of this study is the repeat in depth interviews with older women that enabled follow up and discussion of change overtime. The limitations include potential sample bias: women who are keen to help research are potentially more motivated to self-care and take an active part in their own health.</p>
              <p>However the context of this work is multifaceted and reflects the issues that arise following screening in a cohort of women who have not previously sought advice about their bone health. Overtime many medications that are routinely prescribed become objects embedded within everyday life and invested with particular meanings, values and identities <xref rid="pone.0083552-Hodgetts1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, our findings underline the fact that medications are complex social phenomena that may take time to embed and become routinized and acceptable to patients and healthcare professionals alike <xref rid="pone.0083552-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Medications, particularly medication prescribed prophylactically, have many levels of meaning <xref rid="pone.0083552-Shoemaker1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Bisphosphonate medication for the prevention of osteoporosis and fracture is currently framed by a more complex social context where understanding, choice, risk and perceived need all interact to produce unpredictable patterns of usage and acceptability <xref rid="pone.0083552-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
              <p>This study did not record consultation data or the perspective of general practitioners on their interactions around decision making on bisphosphonates. In depth sociolinguistic research has highlighted that patients talk and deploy different discourses and narratives depending on both the context and on the interactional resources available to them <xref rid="pone.0083552-Murdoch1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Salter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Britten1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Murdoch2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Although most patients and their health care providers are likely to be keen to ensure that they utilise the outputs of modern medical advances, this is in the context of the increasing biomedicalisation of life, especially as people in developed countries are living longer <xref rid="pone.0083552-Salter2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Whether this is framed as a sophisticated commercial exploitation of societal fears of frailty and death, or as an unpredicted consequence of applying multiple disease related guidelines without considering the overall impact, there are consequences for individuals in making choices about their health-related practices each day. For example, recent authors have pointed out the likelihood of older people routinely being in receipt of multiple medications, even if they have not yet developed any specific disease <xref rid="pone.0083552-Moynihan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Moynihan2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The cumulative costs of screenings, follow-ups, treatments and personal sequelae in terms of time, side effects, and perceived vulnerability or risk all need to be set against the potential benefits. The impacts of knowing that they are deemed to be at risk can move people from a narrative of their self as a healthy empowered person to one who is frail and in need of help, which can also have unexpected consequences <xref rid="pone.0083552-Salter2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Within this complex context, each patient and their doctor or nurse has to make individual decisions as to whether a risk factor should be prioritised or treated once detected. General practitioners are probably the medical professionals who are most aware of the extent to which the uptake of any new test or treatment is dependent on the beliefs, understanding, needs and expectations of the individual in front of them. It is a tenet of their discipline and training that any new health issue needs to be debated in the context of the person's whole life context, while maximising health gain and minimising adverse consequences of any intervention. It is the skill of a general practitioner to enable patients to make considered judgements in the face of these multiple choices. However, both the literature and our interviews suggest that preventive health measures often pose a challenge in time limited appointments, which may have influenced the decision made in some clinical encounters <xref rid="pone.0083552-Mirand1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083552-Poole1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, the fact that this was a research study may also have influenced overall uptake and follow-up in clinical practice. More research is needed on the effectiveness and efficacy of secondary prevention and the role of healthcare providers in this field.</p>
