                  <p>Neutrophil serine proteases are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and increased serine protease activity has been reported in severe and fatal infection. We investigated whether brensocatib, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-1 (DPP-1; an enzyme responsible for the activation of neutrophil serine proteases), would improve outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial, across 14 hospitals in the UK, patients aged 16 years and older who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had at least one risk factor for severe disease were randomly assigned 1:1, within 96 h of hospital admission, to once-daily brensocatib 25 mg or placebo orally for 28 days. Patients were randomly assigned via a central web-based randomisation system (TruST). Randomisation was stratified by site and age (65 years or ≥65 years), and within each stratum, blocks were of random sizes of two, four, or six patients. Participants in both groups continued to receive other therapies required to manage their condition. Participants, study staff, and investigators were masked to the study assignment. The primary outcome was the 7-point WHO ordinal scale for clinical status at day 29 after random assignment. The intention-to-treat population included all patients who were randomly assigned and met the enrolment criteria. The safety population included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication. This study was registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN30564012.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between June 5, 2020, and Jan 25, 2021, 406 patients were randomly assigned to brensocatib or placebo; 192 (47·3%) to the brensocatib group and 214 (52·7%) to the placebo group. Two participants were excluded after being randomly assigned in the brensocatib group (214 patients included in the placebo group and 190 included in the brensocatib group in the intention-to-treat population). Primary outcome data was unavailable for six patients (three in the brensocatib group and three in the placebo group). Patients in the brensocatib group had worse clinical status at day 29 after being randomly assigned than those in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 0·72 [95% CI 0·57–0·92]). Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome supported the primary results. 185 participants reported at least one adverse event; 99 (46%) in the placebo group and 86 (45%) in the brensocatib group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders and infections. One death in the placebo group was judged as possibly related to study drug.</p>

              <p id="para10">COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. In severe cases, patients develop pneumonia that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in people with severe COVID-19.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para20">Severe COVID-19 is reportedly associated with a dysregulated immune response and hyperinflammation. This response is characterised by the antiviral interferon response, increased concentration of systemic cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-6), and an influx of inflammatory cells into the lungs. However, the extent of inflammatory response, in terms of the concentration of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines, is reported to be less than in non-COVID-19 ARDS and sepsis.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Neutrophils have been less well studied than other immune cell types involved in COVID-19, but as the understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 has evolved, evidence supports an important role for neutrophils in severe disease.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Increased neutrophil counts are associated with disease severity, and neutrophils have been implicated in amplifying inflammation, coagulopathy, organ damage, and immunothrombosis in people with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Increased concentrations of neutrophil serine proteases have been identified in the blood and lungs of people with COVID-19, and are associated with disease severity and mortality.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Although anti-inflammatory treatments (eg, dexamethasone and anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies) have been shown to reduce the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, there is an urgent need for additional therapies.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed from Dec 1, 2019, until March 31, 2022, for articles related to COVID-19 and neutrophils, using the search terms COVID and Neutrophil. We did not restrict searches by language and we filtered findings for relevance based on abstract alone. We identified 1238 publications. Extensive evidence implicated neutrophils, neutrophil proteases, and neutrophil extracellular traps in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Markers of neutrophilic inflammation, such as neutrophil elastase have increased concentration or activity in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with COVID-19, and these markers predict poor outcome in patients who are hospitalised. No therapies directly targeting neutrophilic inflammation have been investigated in large-scale clinical trials. Brensocatib is an investigational dipeptidyl peptidase-1 (DPP-1) inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in a phase 2 trial in bronchiectasis. We hypothesised that DPP-1 inhibition would improve outcomes in patients in hospital with COVID-19 by reducing neutrophil serine protease activity.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, this is the first trial to test the clinical efficacy and safety of DPP-1 inhibition with brensocatib in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 who had at least one risk factor for severe disease. Brensocatib treatment did not improve the primary outcome of clinical status at day 29 after being randomly assigned. Similarly, there was no difference between the brensocatib group and placebo group in time to clinical improvement and time to discharge from hospital. Mortality over 28 days was 11% in the placebo group and 15% in the brensocatib group. Prespecified subgroup analyses, based on age, sex, baseline severity, co-medications, and duration of symptoms supported the primary results. Adverse events were reported in 46% of patients given placebo and 45% of patients given brensocatib. Active blood neutrophil elastase levels were reduced over 29 days in the brensocatib group versus in the placebo group.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Although multiple studies suggest high amounts of neutrophilic inflammation are associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19, our study does not support targeting neutrophilic inflammation with DPP-1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The worse clinical status in the brensocatib group suggests the need for caution in targeting DPP-1 or DPP-1-dependent proteases in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

Neutrophil elastase activity was measured by cleavage of the specific fluorogenic substrate MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC (Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK; M9771). The stimulated elastase activity was calculated by subtracting the plasma elastase activity after incubation with buffer alone from the plasma elastase activity following incubation with zymosan stimulation.</p>

                <p id="para190">Safety assessments were: the cumulative incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the trial; discontinuation or temporary suspension of treatment; and adverse events of special interest (hyperkeratosis, infections, and dental complications). Adverse events were reported by the participant, site principal investigators, or delegated staff responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that met the definition of an adverse event. Participants discharged from hospital before the end of the trial were given a diary to record adverse events up to day 28. Site principal investigators were responsible for assigning seriousness and causality of adverse events.

The sample size calculation assumed the following proportions of patients in each WHO class at day 29: not hospitalised and no limitations on activities (42%), not hospitalised and limitations on activities (38%), hospitalised and not requiring supplemental oxygen (8%), hospitalised and requiring supplemental oxygen (7%), hospitalised and on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices (2%), hospitalised and on mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1%), and death (2%). A prespecified blinded sample size re-evaluation by an independent statistician after 100 participants had completed 28 days treatment resulted in an increase in the sample size to 400 patients for 85% power for an OR of 1·75. Efficacy analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomly assigned patients. The primary efficacy endpoint of the WHO 7-point ordinal scale at day 29 was analysed using ordinal logistic regression, assuming proportional odds, adjusted for the stratifying factors of age as a fixed effect and site, using robust SEs to account for clustering. Results are presented as OR (95% CI), in which an OR greater than 1 indicates better clinical status at day 29 in the brensocatib group. Secondary outcomes based on time-to-event (time to clinical improvement, time to hospital discharge, and 28-day mortality) were analysed by Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for age and site (using robust SE). Proportional hazards were assessed visually with log (–log[(survival]) versus log (analysis time) plots. There was some evidence of proportional hazard assumption violation early in follow-up in the mortality analysis and, therefore, we also used a post-hoc analysis of restricted mean survival time to analyse 28 day mortality. We analysed number of days free from oxygen, new oxygen use, days free from ventilation, and new ventilation using negative binomial regression. The EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment tool was analysed using linear regression adjusted for age and site (using robust SEs). We analysed neutrophil elastase activity in blood during the treatment period using mixed model repeated measures approach. The model included a fixed effect for treatment group and nominal time (1, 8, 15, and 29 days after random assignment), and treatment-by-time interaction. Patient was included in the model as a random intercept and an unstructured covariance structure assumed. We analysed adverse events between brensocatib and placebo groups using negative binomial regression, ordinal regression, or Fisher's exact test.</p>

There were two post-randomisation exclusions due to ineligibility in the brensocatib group (one patient was admitted to hospital as an inpatient more than 96 h before randomisation and another was receiving a prohibited medication). One patient was randomly assigned but did not receive placebo as they withdrew from study treatment before the first dose. We included these excluded patients in the safety analysis. 404 participants (190 patients in the brensocatib group and 214 in the placebo group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>*One patient was randomly assigned but did not receive placebo as they withdrew from study treatment before the first dose.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>

There was no significant difference in neutrophil elastase activity between the two groups at baseline (134 units per mL [95% CI 108 to 160] in the brensocatib group and 132 units per mL [113 to 152] in the placebo group). Neutrophil elastase activity data were available for patients who were still in hospital at day 8 (n=57) and day 15 (n=29) after random assignment and participants returned for follow-up visits for neutrophil elastase measurement at day 29 (n=98; 50 in the brensocatib group and 48 in the placebo group). Neutrophil elastase activity was reduced from the first measurement at day 8 to day 29 after random assignment in participants given brensocatib.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para370">Among patients hospitalised with COVID-19, treatment with brensocatib for 28 days was associated with a worse clinical status on the WHO 7-point ordinal scale at the end of treatment than was placebo. The number of deaths was higher in the brensocatib group than in the placebo group. Participants randomly assigned to brensocatib also had significantly fewer oxygen-free days and an increased duration of new ventilator use, which indicated worse respiratory function during the study period. Several other study outcomes, including time to hospital discharge, time to clinical improvement, and duration of hospitalisation were not significantly different between the groups. Results were consistent among subgroups, and also in the per-protocol and post-hoc analyses, and no results showed a benefit associated with brensocatib treatment. Despite the worse clinical status at day 29 following randomisation according to the 7-point WHO ordinal scale, there were no large differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events and SAEs. In addition, no increase in infections was seen in the bresocatib treatment group, suggesting that treatment did not increase the risk of bacterial coinfection.</p>
              <p id="para380">The exploratory endpoint of neutrophil elastase release in the blood suggests that the treatment had the desired effect on inhibition of neutrophil serine proteases, which is consistent with the pharmacology research previously showing inhibition of neutrophil serine protease activity in the blood and the lungs of patients given this dose.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> As expected, reductions in neutrophil elastase were detected at the first timepoint (day 8) due to the release into the circulation of newly formed neutrophils from the bone marrow that were deficient in active neutrophil serine proteases, such as elastase. Therefore, the lack of efficacy observed in these patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 is unlikely to be explained by an absence of a pharmacological effect.</p>
              <p id="para390">A large number of observational studies have suggested that neutrophils are important in the pathobiology of severe COVID-19, and neutrophil-related proteins, including serine proteases, are linked with outcomes, including mortality.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It has been hypothesised that the release of neutrophil extracellular traps and the associated antimicrobial proteins and proteases induce lung damage and promote alveolar oedema, leading to worse outcomes.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Despite these findings, our results found that an effective serine protease inhibitor did not improve clinical outcomes at this stage of the disease.</p>
              <p id="para400">In this study, the difference in outcomes observed in patients given brensocatib compared with those given placebo, in terms of worse clinical status and increased requirement for new ventilation use and reduced oxygen-free days, suggests that inhibition of DPP-1 could have impaired recovery from COVID-19. However, our results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size of this study is small compared with much larger platform trials<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> that have tested other agents for COVID-19 treatment and because of the inconsistent results observed with other anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapies administered at different stages of the disease. For example, a small randomised open-label trial of the anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab in 129 patients with COVID-19 in Brazil was terminated early due to a large increase in mortality reported in the tocilizumab group (OR for mortality of 6·42 [95% CI 1·59–43·2]).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Subsequently, larger open-label trials had shown the effectiveness of tocilizumab in preventing mortality and requirement for mechanical ventilation in patients who have been hospitalised with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It is therefore possible that our results represent a chance finding. Dexamethasone was found to be effective in patients requiring supplementary oxygen or ventilatory support with a duration of illness greater than 7 days; however, it was ineffective in patients who did not require oxygen and had a duration of illness less than 7 days.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The concept that the inflammatory phase of COVID-19 occurs late informed the design of our study. We are unable to comment on whether protease inhibition earlier in the course of disease might have been more beneficial than in our study. We observed some baseline imbalances in the study, with a higher proportion of male patients, a higher proportion of patients with COPD, and a longer duration of symptoms in the brensocatib group and more patients in the placebo group. These differences were small and adjusting for baseline imbalances in a post-hoc analysis did not affect the primary conclusions.</p>
              <p id="para410">Additional research is required to understand the potential mechanisms underlying our results and to characterise the role of neutrophils in COVID-19. In-vitro and mouse models of respiratory viral infections suggest that neutrophils can have both a positive and negative role in host response.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Neutrophil recruitment and response involve a delicate balance between these protective and deleterious effects. Although capable of inducing tissue damage, neutrophils have been shown to suppress T-cell-mediated immune pathology in influenza infection, dependent on CD11b and CD18 (Mac1).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> There are sparse data available on potential beneficial effects of neutrophil serine proteases but neutrophil elastase has been reported to enhance the release of immunomodulatory prostaglandins and to cleave receptors on T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils to limit hyperinflammation.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Uptake of neutrophil extracellular traps by macrophages has been shown to promote type I interferon generation via neutrophil elastase-mediated pathways.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> T cell, macrophage, and type I interferon signalling are also central to the immune pathology in COVID-19.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Although these mechanisms are plausible explanations for our findings, in our study, we did not have direct measures of pulmonary inflammation or effects on pulmonary immunity.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Although our results might suggest a need for caution in testing inhibitors of neutrophil serine proteases in COVID-19, it is important to note that DPP-1 has functions beyond those in neutrophils. In DPP-1-deficient murine models, serine proteases are inactivated in a range of inflammatory and immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and mast cells, suggesting that the effects seen in our study are not solely the result of targeting neutrophils.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para420">The limitations of the study should be acknowledged. Patients could receive additional interventions, either as part of clinical care or through co-enrolment in the RECOVERY trial. Since the majority of patients who were co-enrolled in the RECOVERY trial were given azithromycin, aspirin, colchicine, or convalescent plasma, all of which were found to have no effect on outcomes and the probability of receiving these interventions was equal between the two groups, they are unlikely to have affected the results of the study. Although we measured neutrophil elastase activity in blood as an exploratory endpoint in the study, we were unable to measure neutrophil serine protease activity in bronchoalveolar lavage and so we cannot comment on the extent of any anti-inflammatory effects of brensocatib in the lungs.</p>
              <p id="para430">In summary, this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial done during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK showed no significant benefit of brensocatib compared with placebo in patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>
