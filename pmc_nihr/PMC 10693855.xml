                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Recurrent miscarriage is a common condition with a substantial associated morbidity. A hypothesised cause of recurrent miscarriage is chronic endometritis (CE). The aetiology of CE remains uncertain. An association between CE and recurrent miscarriage has been shown. This study will aim to determine if preconceptual administration of doxycycline, in women with recurrent miscarriages, and CE, reduces first trimester miscarriages, increasing live births.</p>

                  <p>Chronic Endometritis and Recurrent Miscarriage is a multicentre, double-blind adaptive trial with an embedded translational substudy. Women with a history of two or more consecutive first trimester losses with evidence of CE on endometrial biopsy (defined as ≥5 CD138 positive cells per 10 mm<sup>2</sup>) will be randomised to oral doxycycline or placebo for 14 days. A subset will be recruited to a mechanistic substudy in which microbial swabs and preintervention/postintervention endometrial samples will be collected. Up to 3062 women recruited from 29 National Health Service (NHS) hospital sites across the UK are expected to be screened with up to 1500 women randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Women with a negative endometrial biopsy (defined as &lt;5 CD138 positive cells per 10 mm<sup>2</sup>) will also be followed up to test validity of the tool. The primary outcome is live births plus pregnancies ≥24 + 0 weeks gestation at the end of the trial, in the first or subsequent pregnancy. Secondary clinical outcomes will also be assessed. Exploratory outcomes will assess the effect of doxycycline treatment on the endometrial microbiota, the differentiation capacity of the endometrium and the senescent profile of the endometrium with CE.</p>

              <p>Recurrent miscarriage is an important cause of reproductive associated morbidity. Defined as the loss of two or more pregnancies, it has a population prevalence of up to 3%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is research priority within reproductive health.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> A <italic toggle="yes">Lancet</italic> review series highlighted the ongoing uncertainty around the aetiology of recurrent miscarriage.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is hypothesised that chronic endometritis (CE) is a cause of recurrent miscarriage.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In CE, there is asymptomatic inflammation of the endometrium mediated by infiltration of the endometrial stroma by plasma cells.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> CE remains of uncertain aetiology being differentially attributed to dysbiosis of the endometrial microbiota and the presence of pathological species within the endometrium.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> There is not consensus around the diagnosis of CE.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Traditionally, CE has been diagnosed on histology through the identification of infiltrating endometrial plasma cells.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Recently, this has been augmented using CD138 immunohistochemistry.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> While this has resulted in improved sensitivity, the diagnostic thresholds remain variable and the impact on therapeutic outcome varies dependent on the CD138 threshold set.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Liu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> evaluated different diagnostic methodologies demonstrating a technique based on whole section density to have the lowest intraobserver and interobserver variability.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The study also identified a density threshold based on the 95% CI with a differential prevalence of 22.2% in those with reproductive failure in comparison to 5% in fertile controls (p&lt;0.01). McQueen <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> assessed the effect of antibiotic treatment in a cohort of women presenting with recurrent miscarriage or loss of a single fetus&gt;10 weeks gestation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Following treatment with antibiotics, a similar cumulative live birth rate (LBR) was seen in the CE group in comparison to controls (88% treated CE vs 74% without CE; p=0.215). A significant increase in per pregnancy LBR pre-treatment and post-treatment for CE was also seen (7% pre-treatment LBR vs 56% post-treatment LBR; p&lt;0.001). Similarly, a retrospective cohort study assessing for the presence of CE demonstrated a marked improvement in LBR in those with CE resolution following antibiotic therapy (78.4% LBR in resolved CE vs 17.5% LBR persistent CE; p&lt;0.001).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Doxycycline is the most commonly reported antibiotic therapy used in the treatment of CE. A single course has previously been reported to achieve histological resolution in 92% of cases.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These findings, however, remain limited by sample size and methodological concerns including lack of randomisation and lack of untreated controls. Despite this however, commercial testing is now available within the private sector.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Given the combined limitations in pathophysiological and clinical understanding of the condition, a novel translation approach is required. In view of this, the Chronic Endometritis and Recurrent Miscarriage (CERM) trial was developed as a novel translation approach to better determine the role of CE in recurrent miscarriage and the potential for therapeutic intervention.</p>

It is a multiphased trial with a preeligibility phase, screening phase, randomisation phase and two separate follow-up pathways dependent on-screen status. These are summarised in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. This is a trial of adaptive design with three prespecified interim stops to assess for futility at 100, 300 and 900 participants. Based on the unblinding results, the trial may stop after Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommendation, if there is low or negligible treatment efficacy. In addition, the use of ongoing pregnancy as a surrogate marker will also increase the trial flexibility while maintaining evidential rigour. The trial also has a parallel translational substudy assessing the endometrial and microbial effects of a diagnosis of CE and the impact of treatment on this. Using the clinical trial to develop a sample cohort will allow assessment of both the exploratory outcomes and allow further basic science assessment of the impact of CE with the aim of identifying the pathophysiological sequence of the condition alongside the potential mechanism of treatment effect.</p>

At the randomisation visit, information on concomitant medication, pregnancy status, use of contraception and adverse events (AEs) will be collected. After the anticipated date of treatment completion, data will be collected on treatment compliance, ongoing contraceptive use and any AEs. Follow-up will occur at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after randomisation to ascertain pregnancy status. For women who are pregnant, further follow-up will be timed to key pregnancy stages. Pregnancy dating will be confirmed at the booking ultrasound through crown-rump length, viability assessment, concomitant medication review, and any developed pregnancy complications will be noted. Similar information will be captured at ongoing pregnancy reviews. Post pregnancy, details of the pregnancy outcome, placental histology if available, cytogenetics of products of conception if applicable, pregnancy complications, congenital abnormalities, immediate postpartum maternal and infant infections and maternal infections up to 8 weeks post delivery, will be collected. All trial participants are free to withdraw from the trial at any time point. Unless a participant explicitly withdraws consent, they and their infant will be followed up where possible.

                <p>This trial uses an integrated adaptive approach. This allows facilitation of both assessing the core clinical outcomes but also the development of a concurrent sample and dataset for mechanistic evaluation should an effect be seen. It also allows better understanding of the aetiology of the condition including through the follow-up of those with a negative result. This integrated mechanistic clinical approach forms a model for a more economical approach to trial design in poorly understood conditions. Through more efficient use of resources, it allows the development of a holistic approach to disorder determination. A key hallmark of this design is the flexibility provided by the adaptive design and integration of sample banking. This ensures that a rigorous methodological approach is taken while still facilitating exploratory research. In fields such as this, which face the difficult challenges of a limited evidence base and disorder heterogeneity such approaches are likely to prove increasingly necessary.</p>

                <p>Initial establishment of the trial was on the basis of coprimary outcomes: ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks at the end of the trial and livebirth ≥24 + 0 weeks gestation at the end of the trial, in the first or subsequent pregnancy. Like other clinical trials, the timeframe for recruitment has meant the trial has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in under-recruitment, with a lower-than-expected trial enrolment size falling short of the targeted 3062 screened and 1500 randomised. In view of this, the TSC unanimously agreed on 22nd November 2022 that, given a likely smaller than anticipated participant population, reduction to a single primary outcome of livebirth ≥24 + 0 weeks gestation at the end of the trial, in the first or subsequent pregnancy, was necessary to ensure statistical robustness. A formal protocol and REC amendment was made, and the change was approved by both the TSC and chair of the DMC.</p>
                <p>Also because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision was made to allow consent to randomisation to be undertaken over the telephone (this previously required written consent). This was enacted to reduce hospital site visits and a REC amendment made.</p>

              <p>The trial will be conducted in full conformance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, International Council for Harmonisation GCP guidelines and the UK Statutory Instrument Number 1031 that implements the Medicine for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Directive 2004 and subsequent amendments. Ethical approval for the trial has been obtained from the NHS REC Northwest-Haydock (REC reference: 19/NW/0462, REC approval date: 20/08/2019). The key ethical consideration of the trial revolves around the paradox of asking women who are eager to achieve successful pregnancy to avoid pregnancy for 3 months while undergoing trial procedures. To mitigate this, trial procedures will be kept to as short a period as possible. It is hoped the potential for gain minimises this paradox. All participants will provide written informed consent including for the biobanking of samples at the point of the screening biopsy. Telephone consent will subsequently be taken at the point of randomisation. The consent form is included within the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>.</p>
