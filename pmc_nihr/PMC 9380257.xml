                  <p>This substudy was nested within a phase 3, double-blind, parallel design, randomised controlled trial of TCV in children from Ndirande Health Centre in Ndirande township, Blantyre, Malawi. To be eligible, participants had to be aged between 9 months and 12 years with no known immunosuppression or chronic health conditions, including HIV or severe malnutrition; eligible participants were enrolled into three strata of approximately 200 children (9–11 months, 1–5 years, and 6–12 years), randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TCV or control (meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine [MCV-A]) intramuscularly. Serum was collected before vaccination and at 28 days and 730–1035 days after vaccination to measure anti-Vi antibodies by ELISA. Because of COVID-19, day 730 visits were extended up to 1035 days. This nested substudy evaluated reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity by age stratum. Safety outcomes, analysed in the intention-to-treat population, included solicited adverse events within 7 days of vaccination (assessed on 3 separate days) and unsolicited adverse events within 28 days of vaccination.

                  <p>Between Feb 22 and Sept 6, 2018, 664 participants were screened, and 631 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned (320 to the TCV group and 311 to the MCV-A group). 305 participants in the TCV group and 297 participants in the MCV-A group were vaccinated. Among TCV recipients, anti-Vi IgG geometric mean titres increased more than 500 times from 4·2 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 4·0–4·4) at baseline to 2383·7 EU/mL (2087·2–2722·3) at day 28, then decreased to 48·0 EU/mL (39·9–57·8) at day 730–1035, remaining more than 11 times higher than baseline. Among MCV-A recipients, anti-Vi IgG titres remained unchanged: 4·3 EU/mL (4·0–4·5) at baseline, 4·4 EU/mL (4·0–4·7) on day 28, and 4·6 EU/mL (4·2–5·0) on day 730–1035. TCV and MCV-A recipients had similar solicited local (eight [3%] of 304, 95% CI 1·3–5·1 and three [1%] of 293, 0·4–3·0) and systemic (27 [9%] of 304, 6·2–12·6 and 27 [9%] of 293, 6·4–13·1) reactogenicity. Related unsolicited adverse events occurred similarly in TCV and MCV-A recipients in eight (3%) of 304 (1·3–5·1) and eight (3%) of 293 (1·4–5·3).</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">In 2017, WHO recommended typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) be introduced in typhoid-endemic countries and prioritised in countries with the highest disease burden or prevalence of antimicrobial resistant <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi. This recommendation was informed by immunogenicity data, including data on measles coadministration in Asian children and efficacy data from an adult human challenge study in the UK. At the time of the recommendation, there were no data from African populations on immunogenicity, or on coadministration of any TCV with routine vaccines given at 9 months of age.</p>
                  <p id="para60">We did a PubMed search using the terms “typhoid”, “conjugate”, and “vaccine” between Jan 1, 1980, and July 5, 2021, with no language restrictions, and looked for clinical trials among children from 6 months to 15 years. The first TCV evaluated in children (Vi-polysaccharide conjugated to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A) showed high efficacy and strong immunogenicity in Vietnamese children aged 2–5 years but did not advance in clinical development. Other TCVs assessed in children include Vi polysaccharide conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (Vi-DT), CRM<sub>197</sub> protein (Vi-CRM<sub>197</sub>), and tetanus toxoid (Vi-TT). The most advanced Vi-DT vaccine candidates are in phase 3 trials in children and adults in Indonesia and Nepal. Three Vi-TT vaccines and one Vi-CRM<sub>197</sub> vaccine have been licensed in India on the basis of immunogenicity and efficacy data in Indian children as young as 6 months. Before the start of this study (February, 2018), no immunogenicity, safety, or efficacy data were available from the African continent, for any TCV.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Individual response to vaccines can vary on the basis of demographic, environmental, and genetic factors. As a result, data from participants in various parts of the world are essential. This is the first study to assess immunogenicity of a TCV in African children as young as 9 months of age, including coadministration with measles–rubella vaccine given as part of routine immunisation. Our results show that Typbar TCV is safe and highly immunogenic in Malawian children 9 months to 12 years of age and does not interfere with measles–rubella vaccine when coadministered at 9 months. These immunogenicity data can be used to support TCV introduction in typhoid-endemic countries without data, which is important particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where young children carry a high burden of typhoid fever.</p>

Ndirande is a densely populated peri-urban and urban township in Malawi's commercial centre with approximately 200 000 inhabitants. Community engagement ensured acceptance of local leaders and parent–teacher groups. Recruitment strategies were broad and varied, and included study advertisement via radio, television, and print media. The main trial (target n=28 000) recruited 28 130 participants. Substudy participants (target n=600 with 200 in each stratum) were recruited from three age strata as follows: 9–11 months (n=200), 1–5 years (n=200), and 6–12 years (n=200). For the 9–11-month stratum, we recruited children who had not yet received a measles–rubella-containing vaccine. For this substudy, children who were HIV exposed but uninfected, children with HIV, children with other immune-suppressed states, including tuberculosis, children with severe malnutrition, and children with chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological diseases were excluded (full eligibility criteria are listed in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). Written informed consent was sought from parents or guardians. Written assent was obtained from children aged 8 years and older.

                <p id="para170">The study vaccine, Typbar TCV (Bharat Biotech International, Hyderabad, India) consists of 25 μg of Vi-antigen polysaccharide conjugated to a non-toxic inactivated tetanus toxoid-protein carrier. TCV was administered intramuscularly (day 0) as a 0·5 mL dose. The control vaccine, MCV-A (Serum Institute of India PVT; Hyderabad, India), is a lyophilised vaccine that consists of meningococcal group A polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid protein in aluminium phosphate adjuvant. We administered 5 μg/0·5 mL to participants 9–11 months and 10 μg/0·5 mL to those aged 1 year or older as an intramuscular dose on day 0. Study or control vaccine was administered in the left thigh in infants and left arm in older children. For children aged 9–11 months, we coadministered measles–rubella vaccine in the right thigh in accordance with the Malawi Expanded Programme on Immunisation. Participants were observed, in accordance with the protocol, by study clinicians for 30 min after vaccination for any adverse events. Participants were followed up in person, through home or clinic visits, for safety assessments on days 0, 3, 7, 28, 180, and 730–1035 (because of COVID-19, day 730 visits were extended up to 1035 days) after vaccination. Immunogenicity blood samples were collected on day 0 (before vaccination), on day 28, and 730–1035 days after vaccination. In-person follow-up was paused from March 25, 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions. This occurred after all day 0 to day 180 visits and 76 day 730 visits were completed. In-person follow-up resumed on Oct 7, 2020, and as a result, the duration of follow-up for the substudy was increased from 730 days (2 years) after vaccination to up to 1035 days (3 years) after vaccination. The protocol amendment to extend this follow-up window was approved by the Malawi National Health and Science Review Committee, the University of Liverpool Ethical Review Board, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board.</p>

Safety outcomes were measured by comparing the proportions of participants who had predefined safety events among children who received TCV and those who received MCV-A at each visit. We followed up and assessed solicited and unsolicited local and systemic reactions on the evening of vaccination, and on day 3 and day 7 after vaccination. We documented all non-serious unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after vaccination and serious adverse events (SAEs) for 6 months after vaccination. Immediate reactions (within 30 min of vaccination) and SAEs were reported with the main trial efficacy results for the entire trial cohort (n=28 130).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrences in participants to whom TCV or MCV-A had been administered, including occurrences that were not necessarily caused by or related to the vaccine.

                <p id="para210">Safety outcomes were analysed on the basis of an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis that included all children who underwent randomisation and received a dose of a vaccine. All vaccinated participants with any safety data after vaccination were included in the safety analyses. To assess safety, we calculated the number of participants, and proportion in each vaccine group, with solicited local and systemic reactions for each visit and unsolicited adverse events. Immunogenicity outcomes were analysed both in the per-protocol population, which included only participants whose samples were collected within the allowable window for their scheduled visit, and the ITT population. Log<sub>10</sub>-transformed Vi antigen, measles, and rubella titres were compared between vaccine groups using a two-sample t test. The distribution of each antibody measure of interest at each time point in each vaccine group was examined graphically and described in terms of sample size, geometric mean, and corresponding 95% CIs. When computing geometric means, zeros or those values that were lower than the limit of detection were replaced by one half the limit of detection (ie, 3·7 EU/mL for Vi antigen, 0·85 mIU/mL for measles, and 0·05 IU/mL for rubella). Proportions of seroconversion for Vi antigen, and of seroprotection for measles and rubella, were compared using Wilson CIs. Seroconversion was defined as a four-fold rise or more in antibody titre from day 0 to day 28 and from day 0 to day 730–1035 after vaccination. Seroprotection was defined in accordance with the WHO standard reference values of GMT of 120 mIU/mL for measles or higher and 10 IU/mL or higher for rubella.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Study results were analysed using SAS software, version 9.4.</p>

A common unstructured covariance was used to model the within-subject errors and there was no convergence issue. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. The model-based estimated marginal mean IgG (log<sub>10</sub> scale) and the corresponding 95% CIs were then estimated for each combination of vaccine group and age stratum at each measurement time and compared between vaccine groups and age strata with Scheffe's adjustment for multiple comparison.

              <p id="para260">Baseline anti-Vi IgG antibody concentrations were similar between the TCV and MCV-A groups. At day 28 after vaccination, anti-Vi IgG GMT rose by more than 500 times the baseline value in the TCV group and remained unchanged in the MCV-A group. On average, anti-Vi IgG (log<sub>10</sub> transformed) did not decrease between day 730 and day 1035 in both the TCV and MCV-A groups, and therefore, we elected to analyse the days 730–1035 data together. At days 730–1035 after vaccination, anti-Vi IgG GMT values decreased to 48·0 EU/mL (95% CI 39·9–57·8) among TCV recipients, 10 times higher than MCV-A recipient amounts (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para320">In this nested substudy of a randomised, controlled trial, TCV was safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in Malawian children aged 9 months to 12 years. Furthermore, in children younger than 1 year of age, TCV showed strong immunogenicity and no interference or safety concerns when coadministered with measles–rubella vaccine.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our findings in Malawian children are consistent with results from four other clinical trials of Typbar TCV in Africa and Asia. The first paediatric immunogenicity data generated in Indian participants showed a 98% seroconversion rate in children aged 6–11 months, 99% in children aged 2–4 years, and 99% in children aged 5–15 years, 42 days after vaccination, and a 59% seroconversion rate in children aged 6–11 months, 77% in children aged 2–4 years, and 75% in children aged 5–15 years, 720 days after vaccination.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC) trials of Typbar TCV in Nepalese and Bangladeshi children aged 9 months to 15 years each showed a 99% seroconversion rate at 28 days after vaccination,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which is similar to the 98% seroconversion rate at day 28 in this study. More recently, Typbar TCV was shown to be immunogenic in Burkinabe infants aged 9–11 months (88%) 28 days after vaccination.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> A similar TCV, produced by another manufacturer, which is also conjugated to tetanus toxoid and licensed for use in India, showed a 100% seroconversion in Indian children from 6 months to 12 years of age 42 days after vaccination, and an 84% seroconversion rate 12 months after vaccination.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In the five aforementioned trials,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> TCVs were well tolerated with mild reactogenicity, most commonly fever and pain at injection site.</p>
              <p id="para340">The WHO recommendation, for programmatic use of TCV to control typhoid fever, encourages reliance on local data when making decisions on the age of administration, target population, and delivery strategy for routine and catch-up campaigns.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> In typhoid-endemic regions, WHO suggests TCV administration at 9 months of age, or within the first 2 years of life, as part of routine childhood immunisation, to provide early protection.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Additionally, if children are vaccinated at a young age, when programmatically feasible, the duration of protection is even more important because exposure will persist for many more years.</p>
              <p id="para350">In this substudy, most infants who received TCV with routine measles–rubella vaccine successfully achieved anti-Vi seroconversion at day 28 after vaccination (99%) and 68% were seroconverted 2–3 years after vaccination. By contrast, 89% of children in the 6–12-year age stratum were seroconverted at 730–1035 days, although variation in collection times could have influenced this result in either group. As no correlate of protection exists for TCV, it is unclear whether decreased seroconversion indicates diminished protection, a need for a TCV booster, or both. Ongoing and planned studies of booster vaccination will help to answer this question.</p>
              <p id="para360">Infants who received TCV also successfully achieved seroprotective amounts of anti-measles and anti-rubella antibodies. The 84% measles seroprotection rate in this study is similar to the 85% rate previously reported in Malawian infants unexposed to HIV 90 days after vaccination who received measles vaccine at 9 months of age.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Overall, measles seroprotection in our trial after the first dose of measles–rubella vaccine supports the WHO recommendation for a two-dose vaccine schedule, which was introduced in 2015 in the routine vaccination schedule in Malawi.</p>
              <p id="para370">In addition to routine vaccination with TCV, WHO recommends catch-up campaigns for older children, when feasible, to accelerate vaccine impact and potentially increase indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals. Vaccinating school-age children through schools is a delivery strategy that can lead to high coverage.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Our data confirm that school-age children achieve and maintain elevated anti-Vi immunogenicity. The feasibility and effect of TCV vaccination of children in a community setting was shown in 2019 when Zimbabwe became the first African country to use TCV outside a study setting.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para380">These results also show that TCV has a favourable tolerability and reactogenicity profile that is similar to our control vaccine, MCV-A, a vaccine used routinely in many African countries. Consequently, administration of TCV at regular child health visits facilitates community acceptance and requires fewer health-care resources. For these reasons, incorporating TCV into routine vaccination schedules is advantageous.</p>
              <p id="para390">One strength of this trial is that it is nested within an ongoing efficacy study that will yield essential information on TCV performance, particularly in young children. This is especially important because an immunological correlate of protection has not yet been established for typhoid fever. A four-fold rise in GMT at 1 month after vaccination has been used to define seroconversion for previous TCV trials and has been associated with field efficacy at the population level. Published data from the Malawi trial showed an ITT efficacy of 80·7% against blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever after 18–24 months of follow-up among 28 130 Malawian children. Similarly, in Bangladesh, TCV effectiveness was 85% among children aged 9 months to 15 years and vaccine protection was consistent in different age strata, including children younger than 2 years of age.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para400">As the children in this study remain in the main efficacy trial, our study has not yet assessed the effect of a booster dose on longevity of seroprotection from TCV. Based on previous TCV studies, seroprotection likely persists for at least 5 years.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> A limitation of this study is that is provides safety and immunogenicity data only in children unexposed to HIV and does not include children exposed to HIV who remain uninfected, an important population in sub-Saharan Africa. Additional studies of safety and immunogenicity in African children are ongoing and will further characterise the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of two doses of TCV, and the longer-term safety and immunogenicity of single-dose TCV in different populations, including infants exposed to HIV who are uninfected. These follow-up studies will further inform programmatic decisions for TCV implementation, including the need for two-dose or booster-dose schedules.</p>
              <p id="para410">This clinical trial presents evidence of TCV safety and immunogenicity in African children across a wide age range at 730 days and beyond, and includes coadministration data with the measles–rubella vaccine. Results are especially valuable to African countries considering TCV introduction into routine childhood immunisation, with or without catch-up campaigns, and for outbreak response.</p>

              <p>NN-N, MBL, CM, PDP, PP, FM, TM, RSH, MAG, and KMN conceived the study, developed the protocol and standard operating procedures, and managed ethical submissions. NN-N, OMN, LK, VM, and MM recruited participants and did the participant follow-up procedures. JKT, CM, and HM designed and managed the study database. MM, MFP, and IJ-M collected and processed clinical specimens for immunogenicity and generated anti-Vi antigen, anti-measles, and anti-rubella titres. JMN, NN-N, OMN, LK, VM, JMN, RSH, and MAG managed study vaccines, did the randomisation, and supervised injections. YL developed the statistical analysis plan and did the analyses. SD did the analyses and created the figures and tables. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p>
