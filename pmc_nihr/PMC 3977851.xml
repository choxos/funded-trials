                <p>We describe our semi-automatic segmentation of whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WBDWI) using a Markov random field (MRF) model to derive tumor total diffusion volume (tDV) and associated global apparent diffusion coefficient (gADC); and demonstrate the feasibility of using these indices for assessing tumor burden and response to treatment in patients with bone metastases.</p>
                <p>WBDWI was performed on eleven patients diagnosed with bone metastases from breast and prostate cancers before and after anti-cancer therapies. Semi-automatic segmentation incorporating a MRF model was performed in all patients below the C4 vertebra by an experienced radiologist with over eight years of clinical experience in body DWI. Changes in tDV and gADC distributions were compared with overall response determined by all imaging, tumor markers and clinical findings at serial follow up. The segmentation technique was possible in all patients although erroneous volumes of interest were generated in one patient because of poor fat suppression in the pelvis, requiring manual correction. Responding patients showed a larger increase in gADC (median change = +0.18, range = −0.07 to +0.78×10<sup>−3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s) after treatment compared to non-responding patients (median change = −0.02, range = −0.10 to +0.05×10<sup>−3</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/s, p = 0.05, Mann-Whitney test), whereas non-responding patients showed a significantly larger increase in tDV (median change = +26%, range = +3 to +284%) compared to responding patients (median change = −50%, range = −85 to +27%, p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney test). Semi-automatic segmentation of WBDWI is feasible for metastatic bone disease in this pilot cohort of 11 patients, and could be used to quantify tumor total diffusion volume and median global ADC for assessing response to treatment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The confident detection of metastatic bone disease and the assessment of treatment response of bone disease remains one of the major unfulfilled needs in oncology. However, recent studies using whole body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WBDWI) have shown high diagnostic accuracy in detecting metastatic bone disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma and breast cancers <xref rid="pone.0091779-Gutzeit1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091779-Nakanishi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. There is also compelling evidence that the apparent diffusion coefficient derived from WBDWI provides a potential quantitative response biomarker that reflects tissue cellularity and has been shown to increase in responders to a range of anti-tumor treatments <xref rid="pone.0091779-Thoeny1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091779-Reischauer1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>
              <p>WBDWI is a relatively recent imaging technique developed independently by Ballon and Takahara <xref rid="pone.0091779-Ballon1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091779-Takahara1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It employs axial fat-suppressed diffusion-weighted MRI acquired at multiple anatomical stations using high diffusion sensitizing gradients (b-values). Due to the combination of the relatively low diffusion rates and high T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time of water in tumor tissues, metastases typically appear hyper-intense compared with normal background tissue, thus providing excellent contrast for disease visualization. At high b-values (e.g. b = 800–1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>), the sensitivity of WBDWI for detecting bone disease has been shown to be equivalent or better than skeletal scintigraphy (SS), but with superior spatial resolution to both SS and 18FDG-PET <xref rid="pone.0091779-Heusner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0091779-Komori1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Further suppression of signal from healthy tissues may be achieved by applying the ‘computed Diffusion-Weighted MRI’ (cDWI) technique <xref rid="pone.0091779-Blackledge1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which extrapolates images of higher b-value (assuming a monoexponential relationship between signal intensity and b-value). The resulting high lesion-to-background ratio facilitates segmentation of lesions to provide estimates of total tumor diffusion volumes (tDV) and the associated global median Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (gADC). By performing a similar segmentation after treatment, changes in tDV and gADC may be used to assess the treatment response of metastatic bone disease, thus providing two quantitative metrics from a single radiologic investigation.</p>
              <p>Commercial software that enables radiologists to manually define or region-grow individual Volumes Of Interest (VOI) is beginning to emerge. However, in patients with metastatic bone disease, the number of metastases can be large, making it impractical to use such software to evaluate multiple lesions. Our approach employs a recently developed region-growing technique <xref rid="pone.0091779-Vezhnevets1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to remove unwanted signal from background using cDWI and then applies an advanced thresholding algorithm (using a Markov random field model) to extract VOIs from multiple lesions across the body.</p>
              <p>In this manuscript, we describe our semi-automatic segmentation of WBDWI to derive tumor diffusion volumes (tDV) and the associated global median ADC (gADC); and demonstrate the feasibility of using these indices for assessing tumor response to treatment in patients with bone metastases.</p>

                <p>Imaging from eleven consecutive patients with metastatic bone disease who underwent clinical WBDWI before and after chemotherapy was evaluated: four female patients with metastatic breast cancer (mean age = 51 years, range = 43–63 years) and seven male patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mean age = 64 years, range = 40–78 years). Further details of these patients including treatment type are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0091779-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. The inclusion criteria were: (1) Patients with predominant metastatic bone disease demonstrated on CT, MRI, SS and/or <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET. (2) Patients who were treatment naïve or showed recent disease progression, and were about to commence anti-tumor treatment. Patients with claustrophobia or contraindications to MRI examinations were not included in the study.</p>

                <p>As there is no acknowledged gold standard for assessing treatment response of bone metastases, we adopted a reference standard based on all available imaging, clinical assessment and laboratory results available for each patient for at least 12 months <xref rid="pone.0091779-Rutjes1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 2 were used for patients with prostate cancer <xref rid="pone.0091779-Scher1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. This assessment was made by two independent radiologists (NT and AP), not involved with the image analysis, in the setting of a tumor board, where the cases were discussed in detail in the presence of expert medical oncologists and radiation oncologists, and all clinical and radiological information were reviewed in detail. A patient was deemed to be a responder if the serial radiological tests showed improvement or absence of deterioration, supported by improvement in clinical symptoms (e.g. pain score) and/or improvement in laboratory markers (e.g. serum PSA, CA15-3 or circulating tumor cells). A patient was deemed a non-responder if there was radiological deterioration (including new adverse skeletal events and new bone lesions), increasing pain symptoms and/or worsening laboratory markers.</p>

                <title>MRI technique</title>
                <p>WBDWI studies were performed on1.5T MR imaging systems (Avanto and Aera systems, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Axial images were acquired using free breathing echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging from the skull base to the mid-thigh level, sequentially across three to six imaging stations, each consisting of 50-30 slices respectively. At each imaging station, images were acquired using the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 9000–14800 ms, echo time (TE) = 67–75 ms, matrix size = 128×128–150×150, slice thickness = 5–6 mm, receiver bandwidth = 1628–1961 Hz/pixel, 4–6 signal averages, STIR fat suppression with an inversion time (TI) of 180 ms, imaging field of view = 400±30 mm<sup>2</sup> depending on patient size. Images were acquired using low/high b-value pairs of b = 50 and 900 s/mm<sup>2</sup> for all 22 studies (11 pre and 11 post-treatment scans). Imaging protocols have been optimized independently for each scanner using the techniques discussed in <xref rid="pone.0091779-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> to reduce the magnitude of geometric distortions inherent to DWI, whilst maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and voxel resolution and obtaining global fat suppression. The current imaging protocol has been informed by a previous study where an SNR of approximately 22 (b = 50 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) and 15 (b = 900 s/mm<sup>2</sup>) were obtained using a similar imaging protocol on the same scanner within regions of prostate cancer metastases in lumbar vertebrae (unpublished data). In addition to WBDWI, anatomical imaging were also acquired using breath-hold axial T1-weighted fast low-angle shot gradient-echo (FLASH) imaging and/or coronal DIXON T1-weighted volume interpolated breath-hold gradient-echo (VIBE) imaging.</p>

A post-processing algorithm is applied to the data to correct for spatial and intensity misregistrations between imaging stations <xref rid="pone.0091779-Blackledge2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The algorithm linearly scales the signal intensity of each imaging station so that the intensity profiles of images on either side of the station boundary have matched cumulative histograms. A shift along the phase-encoding direction is then applied to each station so that images on either side of the boundary are registered according to the minimum of the mean-square-difference of image intensities. This algorithm is applied in turn for each station.</p>
                <p><bold>Step 2</bold>. The corrected data are processed using the cDWI technique to visually maximize the contrast between diseased and normal tissues by manually tuning the computed b-value using a sliding scale provided to the user during data visualization. A threshold is then manually selected, which maximizes visual suppression of signal from normal/benign tissue without suppressing signal from diseased areas. Residual signal from normal structures or artifacts is then removed using a three dimensional GrowCut algorithm developed by Vezhnevets and Konouchine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091779-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), which uses cellular automaton as an image model to capture regions sharing similar statistical properties to the regions that are roughly initially identified by a user <xref rid="pone.0091779-Vezhnevets1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. A Markov random field (MRF) model is applied to probabilistically smooth the classification results (details given in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0091779.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). A comparison of segmentation results achieved with and without the application of a MRF model is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091779-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>. Applying the MRF model results in a smoothing operation, which reduces the number of voxels misclassified as disease in the presence of noise and incomplete fat suppression, compared with segmentation by simple thresholding of the WBDWI signal intensity.</p>

                    <p>It is clear that background noise and residual fat signal can be included in data that are only thresholded and that the MRF model can help to remove these spurious regions (red arrows).

                <p><bold>Step 3</bold>.The segmentation process generates multiple regions of interests (ROIs) that are summed to produce volumes of interest (VOIs) of disease across the body. These can be viewed by maximum intensity projection (MIP) or multi-planar reformat (MPR). To avoid the inclusion of the brain, normal cervical nodes and salivary glands, data above the level of C4 were excluded from analysis. The expert radiologist further fine-tunes the segmentation by reviewing and manually excluding VOIs that are deemed erroneous (see next section) and the results are saved.</p>
                <p><bold>Step 4</bold>. The generated VOIs are used to calculate an estimate for the total body tumor burden of MR visible disease (in milliliters). These VOIs are transferred onto the corresponding ADC maps to derive gADC values. The distribution of ADC values across all lesions is visualized by histogram analysis.</p>
                <p>The total processing time for a typical WBDWI data set consisting of 150×150×200 voxels is of the order of 30 minutes.</p>

                <p>We performed a Mann-Whitney test to compare the percentage changes in tDV and changes in gADC histogram parameters between responding and non-responding groups of patients. For median gADC estimates, a one-tailed test was used due to the standard assumption that only increased ADC values are expected following successful treatment <xref rid="pone.0091779-Thoeny1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For all other calculated parameters, no such prior knowledge is available and two-tailed tests were used. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

              <p>The semi-automatic segmentation process was applied in all 11 patients, before and after treatment. However, in one patient, chemical shift and ghosting artifacts in the pelvis resulted in a substantial number of erroneous VOIs, which had to be manually removed following review by the radiologist.</p>
              <p>Boxplots of changes in gADC distribution parameters and percentage changes in tDV are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091779-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>. Patients classified as not responding to treatment showed a significantly larger percentage increase in tDV after treatment compared with responders (p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney test), whereas those patients classified as responding showed a significantly larger increase in median gADC (p = 0.05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Of the other gADC histogram parameters calculated, a larger increase in gADC variance was observed for responding patients compared to non-responders (p = 0.01) whereas kurtosis was shown to decrease for responding patients and increase in non-responding patients (p = 0.01). Example tumor total volume images and full ADC distributions for Patients 1 (non-responder) and 2 (responder) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091779-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091779-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref> respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this technical development report we describe a novel semi-automatic technique using Markov random fields for the segmentation of bone metastases from whole body diffusion-weighted MRI data. We have shown the feasibility of using this technique on a small pilot cohort of eleven patients with bone metastases arising from a range of primary malignancies; and derived estimates of tumor total diffusion volume (tDV) and tumor global ADC (gADC) before and after chemotherapy treatment. We found significant differences in the changes in tDV and gADC after treatment between the two groups of patients classified as responders or non-responders to treatment. Non-responding patients showed a significantly greater increase in tDV after treatment (p = 0.02) compared with the responding group. Responding patients showed a significantly larger increase in median gADC after treatment (p = 0.05). Furthermore, derivation of gADC histograms provides other statistical parameters such as the variance, skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. Although the utility of these metrics for characterizing disease and defining treatment response is still evolving, it is conceivable that these metrics may provide methods for quantifying heterogeneous response. Thus, our method shows substantial promise for evaluating metastatic bone disease, and may have a significant impact in drug development and clinical practice, where no standardized or reliable method of quantifying total burden or of evaluating the response of bony metastases to treatment has been established.</p>
              <p>A number of potential limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, the segmentation technique is sensitive to the quality of the acquired DWI data, indicating the need for meticulous technique at image acquisition to minimize ghosting and other artifacts, which would result in erroneous VOIs due to the artifacts. The reviewing radiologist could manually remove these but this can be time consuming. Second, in all analyses, segmentation results above the level of the C4 vertebra were removed in order to eliminate potential spurious segmentation from normal soft tissues in the head and neck, such as the brain, salivary glands and lymph nodes. Whilst this may exclude some areas of disease, these do not have a major impact on the assessment of body burden of metastatic bone disease. Furthermore, except for a few select cases, disease was not observed in this region and it is more likely that false positives may arise here. Third, The utility of ADC and tumor burden estimates was tested only on a small cohort of eleven patients. Thus, it was not possible to obtain reliable estimates of the true diagnostic performance for tDV and gADC and the true potential of the technique is yet to be determined. Furthermore, the lack of a gold standard for measuring response of bone metastases makes interpretation of the true accuracy of the described technique difficult to define. In this pilot study, we have used all available clinical information for each patient to classify patients as either responding to treatment or not, using independent observers for this categorization to avoid bias. Fourth, we did not evaluate the interobserver variability of the technique in this initial analysis. However, the interobserver variability of this approach is currently being evaluated and if found to be reliable, will add weight to its utility in future trials. Last but not least the study was carried out on a small and heterogeneous patient population with differences in timings between pre- and post-treatment scans, which may impact on the sensitivity of technique for detecting post-treatment changes. In future trials with larger, more homogeneous patient populations it will be necessary to evaluate sensitivity of technique in relation to timing of the imaging and investigate the impact of our methods in specific tumor subtypes, corroborating these with a panel of clinical, laboratory and imaging tests. It will also be necessary to explore more robust segmentation strategies that provide a faster computation time, as current processing requires roughly 30 minutes, which may be regarded as being too long to be used clinically. One approach could involve segmentation of the entire skeleton followed by classification of disease based on ADC value, which could improve repeatability and require less user input.</p>
