                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The question of whether to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) early or wait until symptoms appear remains high on the research agenda for neonatal medicine. Around 7000 extremely preterm babies under 29 weeks’ gestation are born in the UK every year. In 40% of cases the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by 4 months of age. Untreated PDA can be associated with several serious and life-threatening short and long-term complications. Reliable data to support clinical decisions about PDA treatment are needed to prevent serious complications in high risk babies, while minimising undue exposure of infants. With the availability of routine bedside echocardiography, babies with a large PDA can be diagnosed before they become symptomatic.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre, masked, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to determine if early-targeted treatment of a large PDA with parenteral ibuprofen in extremely preterm babies (23<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) improves short and long-term health and economic outcomes. With parental informed consent, extremely preterm babies (born between 23<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) admitted to tertiary neonatal units are screened using echocardiography. Babies with a large PDA on echocardiography, defined by diameter of at least 1.5 mm and unrestricted pulsatile PDA flow pattern, are randomly allocated to either ibuprofen or placebo within 72 h of birth. The primary endpoint is the composite outcome of death by 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Prophylactic pharmacological treatment of all preterm babies unnecessarily exposes them to potentially serious side effects of drug treatment, when their PDA may have closed spontaneously. However, delaying treatment until babies become symptomatic could result in loss of treatment benefit as irreversible damage may have already been done.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Targeted, early pharmacological treatment of PDA in asymptomatic babies has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of both prophylactic (overtreatment) and symptomatic approaches (potentially too late). This could result in improvements in the clinically important short-term clinical (mortality and moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age) and long-term health outcomes (moderate or severe neurodevelopment disability and respiratory morbidity) measured at 2 years corrected age.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par44">The Ductus Arteriosus (DA) is a vessel that allows blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetal lungs to the placenta. In term babies it closes spontaneously after birth when breathing is established and is structurally closed after a few days. However, in a large number of preterm babies, the vessel does not close spontaneously resulting in a condition known as Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). Around 7000 extremely preterm babies (&lt; 29 weeks’ gestation) are born in the UK every year. In 40% the PDA will fail to close spontaneously, even by 4 months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">PDA is associated with a number of serious and life-threatening short and long-term complications. Complications of prematurity such as low blood pressure (hypotension), bleeding in the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) and brain (intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)) present soon after birth. Other systemic complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) present before discharge, and long-term health problems such as neurodevelopmental disability and chronic respiratory problems can be associated with PDA. The persistence of PDA has also been reported to be associated with an 8-fold increase in neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Additionally, it places a significant financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
              <p id="Par46">Historically, clinicians who have been concerned about the symptomatic PDA or complications of prematurity have attempted to close PDA utilising medical (pharmacological) or surgical treatment. Traditionally, medical treatment is instituted as prophylactic treatment (within 24 h of birth); early symptomatic treatment (usually 3–7 days after birth) and late symptomatic treatment (after one week of age). Prophylactic pharmacological treatment of all preterm babies unnecessarily exposes a large proportion of them to the potentially serious side effects of drug treatment, when their PDA would have closed spontaneously. Symptomatic treatment on the contrary delays treatment while waiting for symptoms to appear and could result in a loss of treatment benefit as damage may have already been done.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Moreover, the practice of a conservative approach of not treating, seems to originate from uncertainty regarding the management of PDA rather than evidence favouring no intervention. This is because most studies conducted to date have involved more mature preterm babies (over 1000 g or 28 weeks’ gestation) whose PDA is more likely to close spontaneously. In addition, the studies were largely designed to assess PDA closure rates rather than assessing clinically important outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par48">It is now suggested that large PDA on echocardiography in first 72 h (those with a diameter of ≥1.5 mm) through which blood flow is pulsatile and unrestricted are less likely to close spontaneously. Targeted early treatment of a large PDA whilst asymptomatic has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of both the prophylactic and symptomatic approaches. Although clinical detection of PDA whilst asymptomatic is challenging, it can be assessed using bedside echocardiography.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially indomethacin and ibuprofen have been widely used for the treatment of PDA. Short term efficacy of indomethacin and ibuprofen are equivalent in the treatment of PDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ibuprofen however appears to reduce the risk of NEC and is associated with fewer clinical gastrointestinal and renal side effects compared to indomethacin; hence it is the drug of choice for this trial. Paracetamol has also been recently reported in case studies for closure of symptomatic PDA but further research needs to be done to establish its safety &amp; effectiveness for early treatment of PDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">The current literature falls short of providing substantive evidence on the management of PDA among extreme preterm babies leading to uncertainty and heterogeneity in clinical practices.</p>
              <p id="Par51">A recent cohort study reported the presence of a large PDA (defined as a PDA dimension of ≥1.5 mm) on day 3 in babies born before 28 weeks’ gestation was associated with a threefold increase in odds of death or severe morbidity compared with neonates without PDA (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.1 to 11.0). Neonates with a large PDA were also reported to have increased odds of IVH (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 14.0) and BPD (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.0 to 14.0) compared with neonates with no PDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure is reported to improve alveolarisation and minimise the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of “new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An early selective treatment approach for closure of a PDA is suggested to trial its effect on BPD and mortality, which is the hypothesis of this trial.</p>
              <p id="Par52">We aim to determine if the selective treatment of echocardiographically confirmed large PDA in extremely preterm babies with ibuprofen within 72 h of birth reduces the incidence of death by 36 weeks postmenstrual age, or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.</p>

                <title>Aim &amp; Design</title>
                <p id="Par53">This is a multicentre, masked, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to determine if the selective treatment of a large PDA with ibuprofen within 72 h of birth in extremely preterm babies (23<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) reduces the incidence of death by 36 weeks postmenstrual age or moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. In addition, it assesses other secondary outcomes and health outcomes at 2 years corrected age including survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability and survival without respiratory morbidity.</p>
                <p id="Par54">An economic evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of the health service. It will take the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis presented in terms of cost per major outcome averted. The incremental cost estimate for statistically significant differences in the pre-specified outcomes in primary and subgroup analyses would be computed.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Data are collected from hospital records and recorded on trial-specific case report forms (CRFs).</p>
                <p id="Par56">The main trial was preceded by an internal pilot phase which was used to assess the suitability of trial procedures and likelihood of recruitment targets being achieved. The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) reviewed pilot data and made recommendations regarding continuation. Data collected from the internal pilot phase of the trial will be included in the final analysis. The entire trial aims to recruit a total of 730 extremely preterm babies.</p>
                <p id="Par57">All enrolled babies are followed up at 2 years of age corrected for prematurity. Further longer-term follow-up at primary school age may be considered but will require separate funding. This may be undertaken as an amendment to this trial or as a separate application depending on the circumstances at the time.</p>

                <p id="Par78">The need for oxygen is subjective and hence oxygen dependency is confirmed using an ‘oxygen reduction test’. This is based on the threshold at which the baby is able to maintain oxygen saturations ≥91% whilst breathing in air or at a given minimum FiO<sub>2</sub>. Babies unable to achieve this are considered to be oxygen dependent. This test only applies to those babies whose oxygen requirements are &lt; 0.3, or low flow oxygen &lt; 1.1 L/min, and who have not received any additional respiratory support in the previous 24 h. Babies outside of this are not tested, but data on their oxygen requirements will be collected.</p>

If there are problems with accessing the system outside of normal working hours a 24 h emergency call service is available. The randomisation program uses a minimisation algorithm to ensure balance between the groups. These are allocated with respect to the size of the PDA, gestational age at birth, age at randomisation, sex, trial site, multiple births, mode of respiratory support at randomisation (1) invasive ventilation (by an endotracheal tube); or (2) non-invasive respiratory support through nasal CPAP, nasal ventilation, humidified high flow nasal cannula therapy, or low flow oxygen ≥1.1 L/min; or (3) receiving no mechanical ventilation, or pressure support (in room air, or low flow oxygen &lt; 1.1 L/min, or ambient oxygen) and whether baby is receiving inotropes at the time of randomisation.

                <p id="Par132">An initial loading dose of 10 mg/kg (2 ml/kg) of ibuprofen is administered, followed by two 5 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) doses at 24 and 48 h after the initial dose. Doses are calculated on the birth weight of the baby and preferably administered undiluted. If required, the IMP can be diluted to appropriate volume with 5% glucose or 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Each dose should be given as a short intravenous infusion over 15 min. All 3 doses should be given unless there are adverse effects necessitating stoppage. Placebo is supplied as a clear sterile solution of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for injection. Cartons are identical to those for ibuprofen. Volume of placebo withdrawn from the ampoule is calculated following the calculations for ibuprofen dosing.</p>
                <p id="Par133">Following randomisation, first dose should be administered soon after randomisation, after 6 h of age and within 72 h of birth. Detailed accountability records are maintained to document which pack of medication is allocated to which baby.</p>

The TSC has ultimate responsibility for deciding whether the trial should be stopped on safety grounds.</p>
                <p id="Par137">Relationship of each adverse event to the trial medication is determined by a medically qualified individual. Causality of adverse events reported in the preterm newborn is difficult to assess since they may be related to the haemodynamic consequences of the patent ductus arteriosus as well as to direct effects of ibuprofen. In addition to this, high incidences of adverse events are foreseeable due to the nature of the patient population and the routine care/treatment. Consequently, only those adverse events identified as serious and not foreseeable will be recorded under trial safety reporting procedures. Safety reporting for each participant is monitored from first dose until 7 days after trial medication. Unforeseeable SAEs are reported to the NPEU CTU within 24 h of staff at site becoming aware of the event. SUSARs are reported to the MHRA and the approving Research Ethics Committee (REC) within 7 days, if the event results in death or is life-threatening, and within 15 days for all other SUSARs. In addition, a copy of the SAE form corresponding to the event is forwarded to the Chair of the DMC.</p>

                  <title>Sample size and power calculation</title>
                  <p id="Par145">Evidence from the TIPP trial suggests that the risk of death or BPD in extremely low birth weight babies at 36 weeks postmenstrual age allocated placebo is 52% (95% CI 48 to 56%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, this trial investigated the effect of prophylactic treatment and included all babies weighing 500 − 999 g. More recent information using data derived from the latest report of Neonatal Survey Database from the Trent region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] provides an approximate rate of death by or BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age of 53% for all babies admitted to the neonatal unit. These babies would have been treated according to clinical judgement and therefore a proportion of them would have been treated with ibuprofen. Given that the risk of death or BPD in babies with an echocardiographically confirmed large PDA is inherently higher, it is estimated that the risk in this group is 60%.</p>
                  <p id="Par146">Su et al. (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] compared ibuprofen to indomethacin in babies ≤28 weeks’ gestation having a PDA who were less than 24 h old. The combined outcome of death within 30 days or BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age was observed to be 42% (95% CI 29 to 55%).</p>
                  <p id="Par147">It is therefore expected, given that babies will be enrolled up to 72 h after birth, that the treatment group incidence of death/BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age will be approximately 48% in the intervention arm. This would imply an absolute risk reduction of 12% (60 to 48%) in the primary outcome of the trial for babies randomised to treatment compared to placebo, which is considered a clinically important difference.</p>
                  <p id="Par148">Some babies will require open-label treatment (OLT) in either the treatment or placebo arm. As open-label treatment should be limited to symptomatic babies meeting only defined criteria, it is considered to have minimal or no effect on the primary outcome. Thus, adjustment of the sample size for open-label treatment is not considered necessary. A full list of OLT criteria are specified in the full Protocol available to all sites.</p>
                  <p id="Par149">Regarding outcomes at 2 years corrected age, assuming the risk of a child dying before two years of age is 10%, questionnaires will be sent out to around 660 parents of surviving children. Assuming an attrition rate of 20% reduces the sample size to around 530. The proportion of infants surviving to 2 years without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability in the control group is expected to be 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. With outcome data available on a total sample size of around 600 (including deaths) the trial will have an 80% power to detect an increase in survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability of 11% from 55 to 66% and 90% to detect an increase of 13% from 55 to 68%.</p>
