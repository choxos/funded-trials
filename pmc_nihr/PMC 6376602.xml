                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cardiac rehabilitation improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduces hospitalizations in patients with heart failure, but international uptake of cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure remains low.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Design and methods</title>
                  <p>The aim of this multicentre randomized trial was to compare the REACH-HF (Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronicHeart Failure) intervention, a facilitated self-care and home-based cardiac rehabilitation programme to usual care for adults with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The study primary hypothesis was that the addition of the REACH-HF intervention to usual care would improve disease-specific HRQoL (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ)) at 12 months compared with usual care alone.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The study recruited 216 participants, predominantly men (78%), with an average age of 70 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 34%. Overall, 185 (86%) participants provided data for the primary outcome. At 12 months, there was a significant and clinically meaningful between-group difference in the MLHFQ score of –5.7 points (95% confidence interval –10.6 to –0.7) in favour of the REACH-HF intervention group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.025). With the exception of patient self-care (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) there was no significant difference in other secondary outcomes, including clinical events (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) at follow-up compared with usual care.

              <p>Home-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes can widen access and have been shown to be as effective as group- or hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization, and with similar costs.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The high cost of treating people with heart failure is well documented,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but little evidence (five randomized trials) is available on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation in heart failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, none of the home-based interventions have involved caregivers or have been co-developed with patients, caregivers or clinicians. We therefore developed a novel home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention derived from health behaviour change theory – the Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) intervention – for people with heart failure and their caregivers, which is facilitated by a healthcare professional.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> We hypothesized that addition of the REACH-HF intervention to usual care would improve disease-specific HRQoL for patients with HFrEF at 12 months' follow-up compared with usual care alone.</p>

                <title>Study population and design</title>
                <p>The REACH-HF trial was a multicentre, two parallel group, randomized, superiority trial in men and women aged ≥ 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of HFrEF on echocardiography or angiography (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%) within the preceding five years. Participants who had undertaken cardiac rehabilitation within 12 months prior to enrolment were excluded, as were those with a contraindication to exercise testing or exercise training. The published protocol provides a full list of patient inclusion and exclusion criteria.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Participants were randomized to the REACH-HF intervention plus usual care (REACH-HF group) or usual care alone (control group).</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited from primary and secondary care settings in four centres in the United Kingdom (Birmingham, Cornwall, Gwent and York). Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by investigator site and baseline plasma N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide levels ( ≤ 2000 <italic>vs</italic>. &gt; 2000 pg/ml), using minimization to facilitate balance between the groups. Randomization numbers were computer generated and assigned in strict sequence at the point of randomization. To maintain concealment, the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit used a password-protected, Web-based randomization system to allocate participants after consent was obtained and baseline assessment data entered. Treatment allocation was open label given the nature of the intervention, but outcome assessors were masked to participants' allocations. We kept a record of instances when outcome assessors were inadvertently unmasked by participants during assessment visits. The trial statistician and all investigators were blinded to the outcome data and group allocation until after prespecified statistical analyses were completed and interpretation of results was agreed. Between January 2015 and February 2016, 216 participants were randomized.</p>
                <p>The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and the trial was approved by the North West Lancaster Research Ethics Committee (14/NW/1351). All participants provided written informed consent.</p>

Most patients with heart failure do not undertake cardiac rehabilitation.</p>
                <p>The REACH-HF intervention is an evidence-informed, patient-centred, theory-based, self-care support programme uniquely co-developed with key stakeholders – patients, caregivers and clinicians.

                <p>Outcome data were collected from participants during three clinic visits at baseline and four and 12 months and by postal questionnaire at six months. At the baseline clinic visit, after obtaining written consent, we collected sociodemographic data and information on past medical history from the participants' hospital and primary care records, including key comorbidities, New York Heart Association classification,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> concomitant cardiac drugs and presence of implantable cardiac devices.</p>

Baseline sociodemographic and health-related variables are reported descriptively by treatment arm. The primary analyses for all participant outcomes were based on a between-group, intention-to-treat basis in participants with complete outcome data at 12 months. Outcomes were analysed using linear regression methods, adjusting for stratification variables and baseline score of the outcome variable, where applicable. Secondary analyses were undertaken on participant outcomes as repeated-measures analysis using all follow-up assessment points (four, six and 12 months). In addition, we did a per-protocol analysis and estimated complier average causal effects analysis of the primary outcome using 12-month follow-up data. We used our definition of adherence to the REACH-HF intervention (see above under ‘Study intervention’) to specify the per-protocol population.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized, multicentre trial, participants with HFrEF who received the novel REACH-HF home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention for 12 weeks in addition to usual care had superiority in disease-specific HRQoL and self-management at 12 months compared with usual care alone. The magnitude of improvement in total MLHFQ (mean between group difference –5.7 (95% CI –10.6 to –0.7) points) was not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful (i.e. a reduction ≥ 5 points).<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The MLHFQ score is a key outcome indicator for patient well-being that has been shown to be independently related to survival.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The cost of the REACH-HF intervention (£418.39 per participant) falls within the National Health Service tariff for cardiac rehabilitation in England of £477 per patient.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The REACH-HF intervention was also associated with better patient ratings of self-care maintenance assessed using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, indicating enhanced engagement in activities such as monitoring their weight and increased exercise, looking for signs of fluid retention and using a system to help remember daily drugs.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The results of our trial are consistent with existing evidence on the impact of cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure. The 2014 Cochrane meta-analysis of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation included 33 trials and reported a mean benefit in MLHFQ score of –5.8 (95% CI –9.2 to –2.4) points (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007) compared with control.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, it is important to note that most of this evidence came from trials of hospital- and centre-based models of cardiac rehabilitation, as only six of the included trials (413 participants) assessed cardiac rehabilitation undertaken exclusively in a home-based setting.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, our findings are in keeping with recent studies that support the use of home-based interventions as an alternative to centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Mobile and internet modes of delivery may offer the opportunity to improve cardiac rehabilitation uptake in the elderly.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We believe that this study is the first randomized trial of a home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention for heart failure derived from health behaviour change theory and that was co-developed with patients, caregivers and clinicians. We recently published the findings of a single centre pilot trial which supported the feasibility and acceptability of the REACH-HF intervention in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and indicates that it would be possible to recruit and retain participants in a full randomized trial of our intervention in patients with HFpEF.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This multicentre trial in patients with HFrEF recruited to target, had excellent intervention adherence (90%) and had a relatively low level of attrition ( &lt; 15% loss) over the 12 months of participant follow-up. There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of a significant between-group difference in other outcomes. First, participants may have insufficiently engaged with the REACH-HF intervention to stimulate an improvement in outcomes. For example, failure to adequately engage in the exercise training programme would explain the lack of between-group difference in exercise capacity and physical activity. Second, the trial was not formally powered to detect differences in secondary outcomes, in particular clinical events. Third, REACH-HF is a comprehensive, multifactorial intervention, with individual patients likely to have experienced different pathways to improved HRQoL, which may include reduced stress or anxiety; improved pacing of physical activity, exercise capacity, or sleep quality; and better medication management. In addition, the baseline characteristics of our study population indicated high levels of comorbidity. The lack of impact on exercise capacity and physical activity may therefore be attributed to the ‘heavy burden of comorbid disease’ that can affect outcomes in older patients with heart failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> For example, substantive numbers of patients had atrial fibrillation/flutter (50%) and osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (37%), which could have limited the participants’ intensity and frequency of exercise and physical activity. Finally, there is a growing evidence base demonstrating the limited sensitivity of the EQ-5D in mild-to-moderate heart failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="bibr34-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr35-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Consistent with our study, the HF-ACTION study found no difference in the EQ-5D utility score after exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared with control at 12 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In contrast, the EQ-5D has been shown to be a valid and sensitive measure in patients with advanced heart failure.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>This study had potential limitations. First is the lack of blinding – given the nature of the intervention and control, we could not mask participants to treatments, so our results may reflect patient expectation bias. However, we used self-reported outcome measures and outcome assessor blinding procedures to reduce researcher assessment bias. Second, around 15% of data were missing for the primary outcome measure at follow-up. However, our sensitivity analyses show that the between-group inferences in our trial were robust to data imputation. To take account of the observed baseline between-group imbalance, we adjusted all analyses for baseline outcome scores and the presence of cardiac morbidity (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter). Third, the assessment of adherence is notoriously challenging in home-based interventions (given the self-direct nature of the intervention, we were not a able to capture consistent patient-level data on their level of intervention adherence, such as their exercise training programme).<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2047487318806358" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
