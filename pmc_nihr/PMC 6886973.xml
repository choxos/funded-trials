                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers exhibit higher than nationally representative rates of obesity, and obesity-related comorbidities, in comparison to other occupational groups. Their working environments are not conducive to a healthy lifestyle, yet there has been limited attention to health promotion efforts. We have developed a Structured Health Intervention For Truckers (the SHIFT programme), a multicomponent, theory-driven, health-behaviour intervention targeting physical activity, diet and sitting in HGV drivers. This paper describes the protocol of a cluster randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SHIFT programme.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>HGV drivers will be recruited from a logistics company in the UK. Following baseline measurements, depots (clusters) will be randomised to either the SHIFT intervention or usual-care control arm (12 clusters in each, average cluster size 14 drivers). The 6-month SHIFT intervention includes a group-based interactive 6-hour education session, worksite champion support and equipment provision (including a Fitbit and resistance bands/balls to facilitate a ‘cab workout’). Objectively measured total daily physical activity (steps/day) will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include: objectively measured light-intensity physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sitting time, sleep quality, markers of adiposity, blood pressure and capillary blood markers (glycated haemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Self-report questionnaires will examine fruit and vegetable intake, psychosocial and work outcomes and mental health. Quality of life and resources used (eg, general practitioner visits) will also be assessed. Measures will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months and analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle. A full process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted.</p>

                  <p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Loughborough University Ethics Approvals Sub-Committee (reference: R17-P063). Study findings will be disseminated through publications in research and professional journals, through conference presentations and to relevant regional and national stakeholders via online media and at dissemination events.</p>

              <p>Long-distance heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers are exposed to a multitude of health-related risk factors associated with their occupation; as a result, lorry driving has been identified as one of the most hazardous working professions.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Drivers’ working environment provides limited opportunities for a healthy lifestyle and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, such as a lack of physical activity, prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour (sitting), poor diet, a high prevalence of smoking, high volumes of alcohol consumption and irregular sleeping patterns are widespread among this occupational group.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> Furthermore, long and variable working hours, including shift work, and tight delivery schedules within the logistics and transport industry contribute to psychological stress and sleep deprivation,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which can lead to metabolic disturbances and further promote the uptake of unhealthy behavioural choices.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5–8</xref>
</p>
              <p>Long-distance drivers exhibit higher than nationally representative rates of obesity, with observational data from a sample of HGV drivers from the UK demonstrating that 84% were overweight or obese, compared with 75% of males aged 45–54 years reported to be overweight/obese nationally.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Similar data have been reported from US HGV drivers.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 10</xref> The high rates of overweight and obesity in HGV drivers elevates their risk of numerous chronic diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea and musculoskeletal disorders.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 10–13</xref>
</p>
              <p>To compound the high-risk health profile observed in long-distance drivers nationally and internationally,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 10–12</xref> the driver population in the UK (n=~300 000) has been identified as an ageing workforce (mean age: 48 years).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A recent parliamentary report has highlighted the ‘demographic time bomb’ the UK logistics industry is currently facing and the health impact of an ageing, at-risk, workforce ‘driving a vehicle often referred to as ‘a 40-tonne missile’’.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The UK logistics sector is also experiencing a short-fall in HGV drivers, with barriers to recruitment including the lack of roadside facilities, medical concerns and long hours of work.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Recommendations on how to address this shortfall and attract younger employees to the sector include increasing awareness within the industry of the need to address driver health risks and health behaviours.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p>A systematic review<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> of health promotion interventions in truck drivers, including only eight studies, observed that the interventions generally led to improvements in health and health behaviours. However, it was concluded that the strength of the evidence was limited due to poor study designs, with no control groups, small samples and no or limited follow-up periods.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Since the publication of the systematic review, recent studies have examined the impacts of a weight loss intervention in US HGV drivers<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and a smartphone application on physical activity and diet in Australian HGV drivers.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> While positive findings were observed, the studies were limited by relatively small samples and no comparison groups.</p>
              <p>We have developed a Structured Health Intervention For Truckers (the SHIFT programme), a multicomponent, theory-driven, health behaviour intervention designed to promote positive lifestyle changes in relation to physical activity, diet and sitting in HGV drivers. This intervention has been informed by extensive stakeholder engagement, including a qualitative study exploring the perceived barriers to healthy lifestyle behaviours in HGV drivers,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> an observational study exploring lifestyle health-related behaviours in HGV drivers and markers of health<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and a pre-post pilot intervention<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> with full process evaluation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Initial pre-post testing of the intervention revealed the SHIFT programme lead to favourable changes in physical activity and some markers of health.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This protocol paper describes a study which will build on our earlier work and generate new knowledge on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SHIFT programme, evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design with immediate and extended follow-up. Specifically, we will examine the impact of the SHIFT programme on physical activity, sedentary behaviour, fruit and vegetable intake, adiposity, sleep duration and quality, risk factors for cardiometabolic disease, psychosocial outcomes and mental health in a sample of HGV drivers.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>This research will take place within the worksite setting of a major international logistics and transport company. The logistics and posts sector is worth approximately £55 billion to the UK economy and currently employs approximately 1.7 million people. Driving is a fundamental occupation within this industry, and drivers and warehouse workers make up the majority of the workforce within the industry.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

                <title>Depot recruitment and exclusion criteria</title>
                <p>Depots will be included in the study if they contain at least 20 long-distance HGV drivers (see ‘Sample size’ section). Depots containing HGV drivers who make many delivery stops, for example, drivers who deliver consumer goods to domestic customers throughout the day will be excluded. For logistical reasons, depots located within the Midlands region of the UK will be recruited. Our partner company has approximately 40 sites, containing approximately 1700 HGV drivers within this region. These sites are a similar size, and have a similar variation in size, to the company’s national-level data. During recruitment, depots will be informed that they will have a 50% chance of being randomised to a current practice control condition.</p>

                <title>Participant recruitment and exclusion criteria</title>
                <p>All HGV drivers within participating depots will be eligible to participate, unless they meet the following exclusion criteria: suffering from clinically diagnosed cardiovascular disease, or mobility limitations that prevent them from increasing their daily activity levels, haemophilia or have any blood-borne viruses. Posters advertising the study will be placed in participating depots for up to 4 weeks prior to the scheduling of baseline measurements. In addition, all drivers within participating depots will receive a letter and participant information sheet informing them of the study. Following the distribution of the study marketing material, researchers will visit participating depots for 1–2 days to enable interested drivers to ask any questions about the study before signing up. On completion of these visits, the researchers will provide a list of drivers’ names who have agreed to participate to their Transport Managers who will then schedule time for participating drivers to attend the baseline (and follow-up) measurements.</p>
                <p>Within the UK logistics industry, 1% of HGV drivers are women,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the proportion of female HGV drivers employed by our partner company reflects this national average. While females will be included in the study, due to the small proportion of the workforce they represent, the included sample of females may not enable statistically meaningful comparisons to examine any influences of sex on the intervention. However, the sample recruited will likely reflect the gender disparities seen in the logistics and transport industry nationally and internationally.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Our earlier exploratory pre-post study revealed that on average HGV drivers achieve 8786 steps/day across both workdays and non-workdays with a SD of 2919 steps.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> We have powered this study to look for a difference in step counts (the primary outcome) of 1500 steps/day (equivalent to approximately 15 min of moderately paced walking) between the intervention group and control group. Evidence demonstrates a linear association between step counts and a range of morbidity and mortality outcomes, as well as with markers of health status including inflammation and adiposity, insulin sensitivity and HDL-C in adults.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> The linear association between step counts and health outcomes indicate that regardless of an individual’s baseline value, even modest increases in daily step counts can yield clinically meaningful health benefits. For example, a difference in daily steps of 1500 steps/day has been associated with around a 5%–10% lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population and in those with a high risk of type two diabetes, respectively.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> The proposed level of change has been chosen based on findings from our exploratory pre-post intervention,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> while also being clinically meaningful.</p>
                <p>Based on a cluster size of 10, a conservative ICC of 0.05 (as there is no previous data to inform this, we have been informed by recommendations of Campbell <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), an alpha of 0.05, power of 80% and a coefficient of variation to allow for variation in cluster size of 0.51 (based on partner company data), we will require 110 participants from 11 clusters per arm. From experience in conducting such studies, it is estimated that retention and compliance rates will be approximately 70% at 12 months follow-up; therefore, the sample size will be inflated by 30% to ensure we have adequate power in our final analysis. We will also inflate the number of clusters by two to allow for whole cluster drop out. We will therefore recruit 24 clusters with an average of 14 participants per cluster.</p>

                <title>Intervention—the SHIFT programme</title>
                <p>The SHIFT programme is a multicomponent lifestyle-behaviour intervention designed to target behaviour changes in physical activity, diet and sitting in HGV drivers. This 6-month intervention, grounded within the Social Cognitive Theory for behaviour change<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> consists of a group-based (four to six participants) 6-hour structured education session tailored for HGV drivers, delivered by two trained educators. It includes information about physical activity, diet and sitting and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The educational component is founded on the approach used in the award winning suite of Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed programme (DESMOND) programmes, including the Prediabetes Risk Education and Physical Activity Recommendation and Encouragement programme (PREPARE)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and Let’s Prevent Diabetes programmes,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> created by researchers at the Leicester Diabetes Centre and used throughout the National Health Service (NHS),<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> while being tailored to meet the needs of HGV drivers.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Within the education session participants will not be ‘taught’ in a formal way, but supported to work out knowledge through group discussions and to develop individual goals and plans, based on detailed individual feedback received during their health assessments (see ‘Measurements’ section) to achieve over the 6-month intervention period. The education session is supported by specially developed resources for HGV drivers and participant support materials. The session will include the discussion of feasible strategies for participants to increase their physical activity, improve their diet and reduce their sitting time (when not driving) during working and non-working hours. The content of the educational session is summarised in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>During the education session, participants will be provided with a Fitbit Charge 2 activity tracker and encouraged to use this to set goals (agreed at the session) to gradually increase their physical activity predominately through walking-based activity. The Fitbit activity tracker will provide participants with information on their daily step counts and will be used as a tool for self-monitoring and self-regulation. Physical activity tracking using step counters (traditionally pedometers) has been associated with significant reductions in BMI and blood pressure, with interventions incorporating goal setting being the most effective.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>

                <p>The education session will adopt the promotion of the ‘small changes’ philosophy using the Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely (SMART) principle<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> to encourage participants to gradually build-up their daily activity levels, within the confines of their occupation, to meet the current UK Physical Activity guidelines.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> For example, participants will be encouraged to establish their own personalised action plan, which may also include making dietary improvements in addition to increases in physical activity, with SMART goals throughout the 6-month intervention. ‘Step count challenges’ (1 week competitions within intervention depots) will run every 6 weeks throughout the 6-month intervention which will be facilitated by local worksite champions. A ‘cab workout’ will be introduced and practised at the education session and participants will be provided with resistance bands and balls, and grip strength dynamometers to take away. Participants will be encouraged to undertake the cab workout during breaks when not permitted to leave their vehicle. Participants will be able to keep the intervention tools beyond the 6-month intervention period, however the company will choose whether to sustain the worksite champion support and step count challenges beyond the 6-month intervention period.

Participants in the control depots will receive an educational leaflet at the outset detailing the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviours (ie, undertaking regular physical activity, breaking up periods of prolonged sitting and consuming a healthy diet) for the promotion of health and well-being. Control participants will be requested to complete the same study measurements as those in the intervention worksites, at the same time points. On completion of the study, control depots will be provided with all of the educational material provided to the intervention participants as part of the SHIFT programme.

A second set of identical measurements will take place 6 months postrandomisation (ie, just after the completion of the 6-month intervention), and a final set will be taken at 12 months postrandomisation to assess the sustainability of the intervention (ie, 6 months after completion of the formal intervention period, as recommended by the National Obesity Observatory).<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> At the baseline assessment, the study will be explained to the participant and written informed consent will be obtained. The measurements will be undertaken in suitable rooms within participating depots by trained researchers and will last between 1.5 and 2 hours per participant. Participants will complete a range of self-report questionnaires and have a series of physiological health assessments taken. All participants will receive detailed feedback on their physiological health assessment measures during each measurement session. In the event that a potential health issue is evident during the health assessments, such as undiagnosed hypertension or high cholesterol levels, participants will be advised to visit their GP for further checks. We will provide participants with a letter to give to their GP which summarises the findings from our point-of-care (blood markers) and automated (blood pressure) measures. Participants will be requested to inform the researchers about the use of any prescribed medications that they commence throughout the study duration which may impact the proposed outcome measures. Participants will be issued with objective monitoring devices to assess their free-living physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep, which they will be instructed to wear for 8 days following each measurement visit. After 8 days, participants will be requested to return these monitors to their depot where they will be collected by a member of the research team.</p>

Physical activity will be objectively measured using the activPAL microaccelerometer, worn continuously on the anterior aspect of the thigh, for 24 hours/day over 8 days during each assessment period. The activPAL provides a valid measure of walking and posture (ie, sitting and standing) in adults,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–41</xref> and provides a more accurate measure of physical activity and sitting in occupational drivers in comparison to waist-worn accelerometers.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> As the physical activity component of the intervention predominantly includes the promotion of walking-based activity, and as participants will be provided with a Fitbit providing information on daily step counts to set goals to increase their physical activity, steps/day was chosen as the primary physical activity-related outcome.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>This trial is the result of an earlier 3-year partnership between the research team and a large transport and logistics company (different to our partner in the present study) in the East Midlands, UK. The preparatory work which informed this study<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 7 16 17</xref> was instigated by the company who requested help in improving the lifestyle behaviours and health of their long-distance drivers who were proving difficult to engage. The SHIFT programme was developed in collaboration with long-distance HGV drivers and health and safety personnel working within the logistics sector. Following pilot testing, the intervention and outcome measures described within this protocol have been refined following further input from drivers and associated stakeholders. A driver and manager working within the logistics sector will sit on our independent Trial Steering Committee and will provide invaluable insight into the design, set-up, conduct and dissemination of this research. Throughout the trial, we will conduct regular patient and public involvement events with relevant stakeholders to gain feedback on the trial’s progress. The research team will also continue to work with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport to facilitate research dissemination (articles, conferences, workshops) across the logistics and transport sector nationally and internationally.</p>

                  <p>Average daily steps at 12 months will be compared by group using generalised estimating equation models adjusted for baseline values and waking wear time with an exchangeable correlation structure, which adjusts for clustering. For the primary analysis missing data will not be replaced (complete case analysis) but participants will be included in the intervention group in which their depots were randomised irrespective of the intervention actually received (modified intention-to-treat analysis). We have inflated our sample size by 30% to account for potential loss to follow-up and non-compliance with the primary outcome measure. We will compare the baseline characteristics of those who have complete primary outcome data and those who do not. A sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation will be performed to assess the impact of missing outcome data on the results found and to account for uncertainty associated with imputing data (full intention-to-treat analysis). The imputation will be carried out using the command MI in Stata. MI replaces missing values with multiple sets of simulated values to complete the data, performs standard analysis on each completed dataset and adjusts the obtained parameter estimates for missing data uncertainty using Rubin’s rules to combine estimates. The effect size will also be assessed by attendance excluding those who did not attend the full intervention (per-protocol analysis). Secondary outcomes and 6month data will be analysed using similar methodology.</p>

For both analyses, costs in both arms will be estimated from a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective (consistent with that used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) as well as a wider public sector perspective. In each analysis, the cost of the SHIFT arm will include an estimate of the cost of the intervention (including the cost of training the educators), generated through a staff questionnaire completed at the end of each education session.</p>

                    <p>Within the trial, resource use estimates will be collected from participant questionnaires and will include health-related resource use as well as absence from employment. The health-related resource use will be based on a variant of the Client Service Receipt Inventory and will include services that this population are likely to use such as GPs and practice nurse appointments, occupational health visitors and counsellors. Costs of resources will be calculated by applying published national unit cost estimates (eg, NHS reference costs or Personal Social Services Research Unit costs of health and social care),<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70 71</xref> where available, to estimates of relevant resource use.</p>

We will also present the results in terms of the differences between the groups in time absent from work. Two analyses will be conducted, one including these productivity losses, the other excluding them. This will allow decision makers to assess the importance of inclusion of these costs in the adoption decision.</p>

                    <title>Long-term analysis</title>
                    <p>It is acknowledged that although there may be short-term health benefits from the intervention, the long-term effects of, for example, increased physical activity on diabetic status and number of cardiovascular events may be more important. We will therefore conduct a brief literature review to identify existing models that link short-term end points (including physical activity) measured in the trial and long-term quality of life. We have identified and used existing models<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> linking physical activity to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) previously. These models will be used to extrapolate costs and effects of the intervention beyond the trial period to a more appropriate time horizon. If appropriate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the extrapolated period will be reported using the QALY. As with the within-trial analysis, we will conduct analyses where productivity losses are included/excluded to assess the impact on decision making. Costs and effects will be discounted at the prevailing recommended rate (currently 1.5% per annum on both costs and effects), but will be the subject of sensitivity analysis to reflect the ongoing uncertainty around appropriate discount rates for public health interventions. To reflect the levels of uncertainty in parameter inputs we will conduct probabilistic sensitivity analyses; this will allow a characterisation of the uncertainty around the adoption decision which we will depict using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to determine the robustness of the results to altering certain assumptions such as the discount rate or inclusion/exclusion of productivity losses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>HGV drivers’ working environments are not conducive to a healthy lifestyle, despite this they are currently an underserved occupational group in terms of health promotion efforts and exhibit higher than nationally representative rates of obesity and related comorbidities.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 17</xref> The health and well-being of professional drivers is of public concern given their health impacts the safety of all road users.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 17</xref> Of concern, obese HGV drivers are approximately 50% more likely to have an accident than normal weight drivers,<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> with accident rates increasing further in HGV drivers suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea, a prevalent condition in this occupational group.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The present study will target health-related behaviours of this at-risk and underserved occupational group, with the goal of making a positive long-term impact on long-distance HGV drivers’ health. Given the current absence of resources available to tackle health inequalities within the transport sector, it is anticipated that if effective, the SHIFT programme could be scalable as a Continued Professional Competence resource for HGV drivers nationally and internationally. This resource will likely be modifiable for use across other driving-related occupations. This could have a long-term impact on professional drivers’ health, lead to cost savings within the logistics and transport sector and ultimately impact road safety for all road users.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to examine the impact of a multicomponent intervention targeting individual and environmental barriers faced by HGV drivers to lead a healthy lifestyle. Strengths of the study include the robust RCT design, with randomisation at the depot/cluster level to reduce contamination. The large fully powered sample, objectively derived outcome measures and 6month follow-up assessment after completion of the SHIFT programme are further strengths, along with the extensive process and economic evaluations.</p>
