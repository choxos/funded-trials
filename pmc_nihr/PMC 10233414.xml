                  <p>This cohort study was conducted using data from a large, randomized clinical trial, the Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study. Analytical approaches included multivariable Tobit regression, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable regressions conducted from August to October 2022.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of the 4260 participants included (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [12.4] years; 2485 women [58.3%]; 3044 White individuals [71.5%]), 2359 (55.4%) had a history of mental illness. The mean (SD) baseline Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score was 4.25 (3.68) (median [IQR], 3 [1-6]) for anxiety and 2.44 (2.91) (median [IQR], 1 [0-4]) for depression. After adjustment for demographics and baseline variables, smoking cessation was associated with a decrease in scores for both anxiety (−0.40 point; 95% CI, −0.58 to −0.22 point) and depression (−0.47 point; 95% CI, −0.61 to −0.33 point) compared with continuing smoking. Similarly, propensity score–adjusted models indicated that smoking cessation was associated with reduced scores for anxiety (β = −0.32; 95% CI, −0.53 to −0.11) and depression (β = −0.42; 95% CI, −0.60 to −0.24). Instrumental variable analysis was underpowered, and estimates were imprecise. Findings were robust to planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses, with larger effect sizes in people with a history of mental illness.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions and Relevance</title>
                  <p>In this cohort study of people with and without psychiatric disorders, smoking cessation, sustained for at least 15 weeks, was associated with improved mental health outcomes in observational analyses, but the instrumental variable analysis provided inconclusive evidence. Findings like these may reassure people who smoke and their clinicians that smoking cessation likely will not worsen and may improve mental health.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Many people who smoke state that they want to quit,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but many continue because they report that smoking helps relieve stress and offers other mental health benefits.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These apparent benefits may be spurious. Feelings of low mood, irritability, and anxiety can manifest shortly after finishing a cigarette when blood levels of nicotine drop,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and these feelings are relieved by smoking another cigarette.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Therefore, individuals may perceive that smoking relieves their psychological distress; however, this distress may have been caused by smoking withdrawal. The belief that cigarettes are calming is widespread, and some health professionals may deter people with mental health disorders from trying to stop smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A recent Cochrane systematic review<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> of observational data found that smoking cessation was associated with improved mental health symptoms compared with continuing to smoke for anxiety symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD], −0.28; 95% CI, −0.43 to −0.13), depression symptoms (SMD, −0.30; 95% CI, −0.39 to −0.21), and mixed anxiety and depression symptoms (SMD, −0.31; 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.22). The magnitude of association was similar in people with or without psychiatric disorders.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Observational studies have found that people who stop smoking are less likely to be prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, observational data are at risk of confounding; therefore, the associations reported between smoking cessation and improved mental health outcomes should be taken with caution.</p>
              <p>Randomly assigning people to continue or quit smoking is not feasible; therefore, observational methods are the only way to study the association between smoking cessation and mental health. However, traditional observational epidemiology has a primary issue: determining whether associations are causal. One concern is reverse causality (ie, improved mental health may make successful quitting more likely). A systematic review<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> found evidence that people with psychiatric disorders were less likely to achieve abstinence in any given quit attempt. A second concern is confounding; many studies contributing to the aforementioned meta-analysis<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> were not adjusted for potential confounding. Poor mental health is associated with factors such as socioeconomic status, which is associated with a lower likelihood of smoking cessation. Thus, existing studies have limitations that decrease the confidence that the association is causal. Given that the rate of smoking in people with diagnosed psychiatric disorders is not decreasing as quickly as in the general population,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> it is essential to assess whether cessation affects mental health, particularly in people with psychiatric disorders.</p>
              <p>This study used 3 confirmatory coprimary analyses—multivariable regression models, propensity score–adjusted models, and instrumental variable (IV) regressions—to evaluate the association between smoking cessation and mental health outcomes. The multivariable regression model will have the least control for confounding, propensity score–adjusted modeling will have less susceptibility,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and confounding factors are unlikely to impact IV analysis. Comparing these analyses facilitates stronger confidence in answering questions regarding the validity of associations if all 3 statistical approaches point to the same conclusion.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Therefore, we attempted to overcome the weaknesses of traditional observational epidemiology and use these methods to evaluate the association of smoking cessation with mental health outcomes.</p>

                <title>Main Findings</title>
                <p>In this cohort study, people who stopped smoking showed lower depression and anxiety scores 6 months after stopping smoking than people who continued smoking after adjustment for a range of possible confounding variables or with PSM. Scores were 0.40 point lower for anxiety and 0.47 point lower for depression on the HADS scale. Sensitivity analysis removing people randomly assigned to bupropion left the results unchanged. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation showed that effect estimates were in a similar direction of association, but point estimates were somewhat larger than in the complete case analyses. The association between smoking cessation and improvements in mental health was larger when we restricted it to those with a history of mental illness. Our IV analysis was inconclusive but lacked the power to detect an effect of smoking cessation on mental health.</p>

                <title>Interpretation</title>
                <p>Our analyses suggest that smoking cessation is associated with improved mental health. However, our IV analysis was unable to confirm this.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> The disparity between smoking cessation rates in people with and without psychiatric disorders is concerning, given that smoking may account for up to two-thirds of the difference in life expectancy between people with a history of psychiatric disorders who smoke vs people who have never smoked.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Smoking cessation is associated with decreased morbidity risk and improved quality of life at any age,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> with our analysis adding to evidence that it improves mental well-being too. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world,<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> with 1 in every 2 people who continue smoking through life dying from a smoking-related disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> In many countries, such as the United Kingdom, the prevalence of smoking in the general population has decreased from approximately 46% in the 1970s to 13.3% in 2021.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> The decrease in prevalence has not been as large among people with mental health conditions, with the prevalence remaining at approximately 40% from 1993 to 2013.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> The EAGLES trial showed that cessation medication was not associated with adverse neuropsychiatric effects.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Although the instrument of the randomized treatment group is theoretically sound, the instrument was not robust in this data set. Given the low likelihood of detecting an association of the size we observed in the observational data with the IV analysis with our sample size, future work would need a larger sample size. Our results, therefore, do not exclude a causal relationship between smoking cessation and improved mental health for people with and without psychiatric disorders.</p>
                <p>This study had substantial loss to follow-up, which is common in smoking cessation trials. Evidence suggests that those who fail to attend follow-up are more likely to continue smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Assuming scores were missing at random with multiple imputation, the association of cessation with decreased anxiety and depression was larger than that seen in the complete case analysis. It seems likely that imputing these missing HADS scores as typical of those who continue smoking would also increase not decrease the apparent difference between groups. However, the true reasons for missing data at follow-up cannot be known from secondary data analysis. Data on participant socioeconomic status were not collected, so it was not possible to adjust for socioeconomic status. However, socioeconomic status is a time-invariant variable and is unlikely to confound changes in mental health.</p>
                <p>The EAGLES trial<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> was conducted in 16 countries; however, the data sharing agreement allowed us access only to data from trial sites in the US. This may limit generalizability, but if the association between cessation and mood change is related to neurobiological changes consequent on ceasing regular nicotine use, then these data are likely to generalize to other countries and populations.</p>
                <p>Like many other smoking cessation studies, this study classified people who did not meet the strict definition of abstinence as continuing smoking. Those people who had achieved abstinence but not had 15 weeks of abstinence may have experienced changes in their mental health similar to those who met the 15-week abstinence, as the evidence suggests that the association is of similar strength in people with only 6 weeks of abstinence after several years.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In our study, such participants would have been counted as continuing smoking, which may dilute our observed association size.</p>
                <p>Although participants with and without a psychiatric history showed reduced HADS scores, these were less than the minimally clinically important differences suggested by populations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and CVD.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The reduction was larger for those with a psychiatric history, perhaps because they had higher baseline scores, allowing for a larger decrease to be manifest. Participants were included only if they were not currently experiencing a mental illness, so the results may not generalize to those with current illness. Nonetheless, the neurobiological changes associated with quitting smoking are likely to apply to all individuals, regardless of any underlying condition. People with a high risk of suicide were not included in the trial, but it is unlikely that those individuals would attempt to stop smoking. Although the trial excluded people at high risk of suicide because it was a concern with varenicline prescription, the EAGLES trial<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> showed no increased risk of adverse psychiatric events with varenicline, and other studies show either inconclusive evidence<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> or no evidence of increased risk of suicide associated with varenicline.<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230490r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The EAGLES trial<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> was the largest trial of smoking cessation medication that we know, and yet our IV analysis lacked power to detect an effect of smoking cessation on mental health outcomes. As such, it is unlikely that this type of analysis will be possible in the future without pooling data. That said, most of the trials included in a recent systematic review<sup><xref rid="zoi230490r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> on the association between cessation and mental health tested interventions that do not improve cessation and thus cannot be valid instruments. As such, it may be impossible to prove causality using an IV approach at present.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this cohort study of people with and without psychiatric disorders, we found that smoking cessation was associated with improved mental health outcomes. These findings might motivate policy makers and stakeholders to support smoking cessation in people with mental health disorders.</p>
