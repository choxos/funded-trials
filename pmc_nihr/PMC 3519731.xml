                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Heart failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. As mortality rates are high, it is important that patients seen by general practitioners with symptoms suggestive of heart failure are identified quickly and treated appropriately. Identifying patients with heart failure or deciding which patients need further tests is a challenge. All patients with suspected heart failure should be diagnosed using objective tests such as echocardiography, but it is expensive, often delayed, and limited by the significant skill shortage of trained echocardiographers. Alternative approaches for diagnosing heart failure are currently limited. Clinical decision tools that combine clinical signs, symptoms or patient characteristics are designed to be used to support clinical decision-making and validated according to strict methodological procedures. The REFER Study aims to determine the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of our previously derived novel, simple clinical decision rule, a natriuretic peptide assay, or their combination, in the triage for referral for echocardiography of symptomatic adult patients who present in general practice with symptoms suggestive of heart failure.</p>

                  <p>This is a prospective, Phase II observational, diagnostic validation study of a clinical decision rule, natriuretic peptides or their combination, for diagnosing heart failure in primary care. Consecutive adult primary care patients 55 years of age or over presenting to their general practitioner with a chief complaint of recent new onset shortness of breath, lethargy or peripheral ankle oedema of over 48 hours duration, with no obvious recurrent, acute or self-limiting cause will be enrolled. Our reference standard is based upon a three step expert specialist consensus using echocardiography and clinical variables and tests.</p>

                  <p>Our clinical decision rule offers a potential solution to the diagnostic challenge of providing a timely and accurate diagnosis of heart failure in primary care. Study results will provide an evidence-base from which to develop heart failure care pathway recommendations and may be useful in standardising care. If demonstrated to be effective, the clinical decision rule will be of interest to researchers, policy makers and general practitioners worldwide.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Heart failure (HF) is a life-threatening, costly condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It affects at least 2.3% of adults over 45, rising to 4% in over 75 year olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HF markedly reduces quality and length of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and treatment costs are high, second only to stroke and mainly due to high admission rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; estimated to consume almost 2% (£751 million) of total NHS expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HF is a diagnostic challenge, as symptoms are non-specific and physical signs can be subtle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Because outcomes in HF are linked to stage of disease and evidence-based treatments alter natural history as well as improve symptoms and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], accurate early diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. As most patients with suspected HF are seen initially by GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the need for early and accurate diagnosis in primary care is essential to ensure optimum management and appropriate treatment is initiated rapidly.</p>
              <p>Specialist review of symptoms and signs plus objective investigations, including echocardiography (Echo), is the established ‘gold standard’ for diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and increasingly suspected HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Diagnosing HF requires objective estimation of cardiac function (i.e. Echo) since determining the aetiology and stage of HF leads to different management choices such as initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], ß-blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and aldosterone antagonists in most patients with LVSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], cardiac resynchronization therapy for those with LVSD and broad QRS complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], or surgery where significant valve disease exists. These therapies improve symptoms, prognosis and quality of life, and can reduce healthcare utilisation and NHS costs. However, a difficulty is that performing Echo on all suspected HF patients would be costly as many patients are found not to have HF.</p>
              <p>Diagnostic strategies can vary between GPs if a case of HF is suspected, but the most appropriate strategy is unclear. These include an initial clinical assessment of patient signs and symptoms using physical examination, and investigations such as lab blood tests or chest x-ray. Additionally, screening tests, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and natriuretic peptide (NP) tests, where available, have been recommended by NICE as potential ‘rule out’ tests for HF to limit unnecessary referrals to echocardiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Routine clinical assessment takes place over multiple consultations, due mainly to diagnostic uncertainty and delays that occur in the referral pathway.</p>
              <p>Diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice, difficulties diagnosing HF and local organisational factors such as limited availability of diagnostic services, or delays inherent in the current referral system, create barriers to the early and accurate diagnosis of HF. Access to Echo is variable, often delayed, and limited by the significant skill shortage of trained Echocardiographers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As a consequence, many GPs rely solely on, often inaccurate, unstructured clinical assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, diagnosing HF on clinical grounds alone can be unreliable due to difficulty in interpreting signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and differences between doctors in obtaining symptoms and signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Many GPs order a chest x-ray, or arrange an ECG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, although a normal ECG will exclude LVSD in most cases, changes may be subtle and lack of GP interpretation skills may still require referral for specialist opinion. A normal chest x-ray does not exclude HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A key dilemma facing GPs is deciding which patients to refer for Echo and when; and lack of a systematic method for guiding the diagnosis of HF presents a further obstacle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], adding to cost and delay. Diagnostic uncertainty or inaccurate diagnosis can result in diagnosis being delayed until HF symptoms are more obvious and therefore more severe, multiple GP consultations and hospital admissions, or people are treated incorrectly.</p>
              <p>A growing body of evidence suggests the potential utility of B-type natriuretic peptides (NPs), namely BNP or NT-proBNP, both released from myocardium in response to wall stretch, as diagnostic cardiac biomarkers of HF. These NP tests provide an exciting opportunity to support the clinical assessment of symptomatic primary care patients, as normal levels can rule out HF given the high sensitivity of these tests (98%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], but confirmatory Echo is needed in patients with elevated peptides to confirm the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is uncertainty about the best cut-off levels of NPs in primary care and the cost-effectiveness/benefit has not been established. NP testing is under-used because reliable data on BNP and NT-proBNP performance in the diagnosis of HF are limited mainly to epidemiological sub-studies or to prospective validation in emergency department settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], with limited data on test performance within symptomatic patients routinely presenting in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Best assay cut-offs have therefore been largely imputed and assay performance against or with ECG and symptom score unclear. Moreover, obesity and certain HF medications can lower peptide levels and elevated levels can be associated with unrelated conditions and other factors such as increased age, gender and renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These factors therefore impair the utility of NPs as a diagnostic marker of HF if used alone. The addition of a B-type NP test to the current diagnostic pathway, with specialist referral if test results are abnormal, is a suggested alternative approach that may be superior and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the cost-effectiveness of NPs versus standard diagnostic triage is not established.</p>
              <p>Current consensus suggests a superior approach would be to combine NP testing with standard clinical assessment. In a recent prospective, randomised controlled trial of 305 elderly patients with symptoms of recent onset breathlessness or oedema GP diagnoses were more accurate with NT-proBNP test results in addition to routine clinical assessment than without, mainly due to the ability to correctly rule out HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the use of NPs could help reduce the demand for Echo and cardiology referrals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, determining the optimal manner in which to combine clinical features from clinical assessment and diagnostic tests, including NP tests, remains extraordinarily challenging.</p>
              <p>Clinical decision rules (CDRs) are evidence-based clinical tools designed to be used to help clinician decision-making in a standardised and cost-effective manner, and are developed according to strict methodological procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These clinical tools are based on a parsimonious set of variables that can quantify the contribution from history, physical examination and diagnostic tests. They are developed and evaluated in three distinct stages prior to implementation into a clinical setting: 1) creation of the rule, establishing the independent and combined effect of explanatory variables such as symptoms, signs or diagnostic tests; 2) validation of the rule, establishing the accuracy and reliability of the tool in a separate population; and 3) impact analysis of the rule, establishing impact of applying the rule on patient outcome or health professional behaviour.</p>
              <p>A number of CDRs have been developed to diagnose HF, using combinations of signs, symptoms and tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However, a major problem with all the studies is spectrum and referral bias since most were based on observational screening studies rather than symptomatic presenting patients and some were hospital rather than community based. Additionally, the tools are impractical outside a research or emergency department setting as they are based on a substantial number of variables; others rely on clinical signs where there is considerable inter-observer variation, even amongst specialists; and others rely on chest x-ray parameters, which would be difficult to apply in general practice.</p>
              <p>Our recent NIHR HTA funded systematic review and independent patient data and meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] addressed this issue. We found individual symptoms (such as breathlessness and fluid retention) and signs (such as resting tachycardia and raised jugular venous pressure) are generally weak predictors of HF. Both ECG and BNP have high sensitivity for HF and are good tests at ruling out the diagnosis but BNP is more accurate than ECG. We found BNP and NT-proBNP to be of similar accuracy.</p>
              <p>Our systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] identified one unpublished study which had developed a decision tool based on simple clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In our individual patient data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] we further developed this tool and validated it on other primary care data sets. We found that a simplified model, based upon simple clinical features (Male gender, history of myocardial Infarction, basal Crepitations, oEdema: ‘MICE’) and BNP derived from one data set, was found to have good validity when applied to other data sets, with the area under the curve between 0.84 and 0.96, and reasonable calibration. A model substituting ECG for BNP was less predictive. Our systematic review concluded that BNP could substitute for ECG for determining referral to Echo and some patients could be referred with no prior tests on the basis of clinical features alone.</p>
              <p>We shall establish the clinical utility of B-type NP tests in informing the diagnosis of diastolic HF as well as LVSD and valve disease. Additionally, we shall determine the probability thresholds of the CDR above which Echo would be the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy, taking into account patient quality of life and survival. The results will contribute to scientific progress by solving the problem wherein GPs have clinical uncertainty about whether an Echo should be done or not for a patient whom they suspect may have HF. There is now an opportunity to provide these data and to potentially demonstrate that the CDR can improve patient management concerning diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making and cost-effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Our study will build upon the current evidence and address the weaknesses in previous work. We have validated the CDR on primary care data sets but further validation in a symptomatic population in the real-life clinical setting is now indicated. Further exploration of the optimal NP cut-offs and further modelling of cost-effectiveness is also needed. We aim to prospectively validate the CDR in this study but GPs will not apply the CDR (applying the rule would be appropriate in an implementation study); GPs will refer all patients suspected of having HF and not previously diagnosed with Echo and we shall collect data on how well the CDR predicts the diagnosis of HF. The CDR’s impact potential will be demonstrated by evaluating whether its sensitivity and specificity is superior to that of GPs’ (unaided) decisions. Given the risk of delayed diagnosis of HF, GPs do not have clear guidance on whom to refer for further evaluation. Improving the ability of GPs to appropriately identify patients suspected of having HF is crucial not only to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and reduce patient burden, but also to improve the quality of care for patients presenting to primary care with suspected HF.</p>
              <p>We propose the following objectives:</p>
              <p>1. To prospectively validate the performance of the CDR and compare it to using a natriuretic peptide assay alone on the diagnostic accuracy of HF in primary care</p>
              <p>2. To determine if the CDR, or natriuretic peptide assay can be used in routine clinical practice to establish referral on for echocardiography in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HF</p>
              <p>3. To quantify the most reliable cut-off levels of the natriuretic peptide assay in a group of symptomatic presenting patients</p>
              <p>4. To model the cost-effectiveness of using the CDR in primary care</p>

If a patient changes their mind between agreeing to participate at the GP consultation and before attending their appointment at the research clinic, they are advised that they can cancel by telephoning either the research team or their GP. The patient can then re-consult with their GP, if necessary. Patients who decline to take part in the study will be managed as usual practice by GPs. When eligible patients decline to participate in the study or patients do not meet entry criteria for the study, GPs will complete a weekly electronic notification form of these details.

They will then complete the two clinical judgment sections of the online web-based Case Report Form: 1) details of symptoms, history and patient information, including the predictive clinical features of the CDR; 2) whether they would have made a clinical diagnosis of HF or not and what they would have done routinely with this patient (i.e. investigate, initiate referral, treat, follow-up). Following diagnostic assessment at the research assessment clinic, the NP results will be fed back to GPs and based on those results, GPs will be asked what they would do (refer or not refer to Echo) and if they would amend their original diagnosis.</p>

                <p>The GP will have arranged for all patients to receive a chest x-ray when verbally consenting patients for referral (as is usual practice). Within seven days of referral, the research assessment clinic team will obtain written informed consent, collect baseline demographics, administer quality of life questionnaires (EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and SF12 questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]), clinically assess patients, perform an ECG and echocardiogram, and take blood for NT-proBNP, along with creatinine for a renal dysfunction test, calculating an eGFR (serum profile). These clinical assessments will be made by a research nurse or clinical research fellow trained in these assessments, including phlebotomy, auscultation and chest examination. The heart sounds and chest sounds for each patient will be recorded digitally and a random sample validated by a Senior Cardiologist blinded to the assessment clinic findings. If the research team believes an early decision on management needs to be taken on the basis of the patient’s symptoms or signs at the research assessment clinic, or the results of any of the investigations, an urgent specialist referral will be organised via the patient’s GP. After we have received the GPs’ clinical judgment in the Case Report Form on what they would do (refer or not refer to Echo), all test results will be made available to GPs.</p>

In order to reach an accurate diagnosis the consensus panel need all clinical and test information but this could introduce incorporation bias. To minimise this but provide fuller information for the consensus panel they will receive information in <underline>3 steps</underline>. In Step 1, echocardiography results will be provided along with all other clinical information except the NT-proBNP test results and clinical variables included in the CDR, namely, history of myocardial infarction, gender, basal lung crepitations and ankle oedema. The consensus panel will reach a decision on whether or not heart failure is present initially without these data. In Step 2, CDR clinical variables will then be made available to the expert panel and comparison made with the initial assessment. In Step 3, NT-proBNP test results will be provided and the consensus panel asked whether this changes their opinion. The primary reference standard for the study is therefore Step 3 where all clinical and test information is available to the consensus panel. However, we will also be able to accurately estimate any incorporation bias that may have related to this reference standard based upon Steps 1 and 2.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Thirty urban and rural general practices in the West Midlands will be asked to participate to recruit 500 symptomatic patients. A search of routine practice morbidity data suggest that in a practice of 6,000 patients, around 60 patients over age 55 per year will present with new onset breathlessness. Breathlessness is the commonest of the three most likely symptoms of heart failure (others are lethargy or ankle swelling) and therefore these estimates on the rate that symptoms present will be the minimum rates. Assuming a 60% response rate then it would take at least nine months to recruit at least 25 such patients per practice. All practices will stop active patient recruitment at the end of 18 months. Calculations are based on sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 48% obtained from application of the CDR in our HTA funded individual patient data meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the prevalence of heart failure in a symptomatic population of 30%. A sample size of 500 patients with HF symptoms will therefore be sufficient to estimate the sensitivity of the CDR to within 4% and specificity to within 6% at the 95% confidence level.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Data will be analysed using SAS and STATA software. Patients with symptoms of HF that are referred to Echo via the CDR will be classed as Test disease present and the remaining patients classed as Test disease absent. The Observed disease present or absent will be determined by the expert panel following Echo and other clinical assessments. Crosstabulation of Test versus Observed disease status will enable calculation of sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), positive predictive value (PPV: proportion with a positive test result who actually have the target condition), negative predictive value (NPV: proportion with a negative test result who do not have the target condition), and likelihood ratios for testing the performance of the CDR. 95% confidence intervals for these performance statistics will be calculated using the binomial exact method.</p>
                <p>To confirm whether the NT-proBNP cut-offs in the CDR are optimal in the real life clinical setting, an additional ROC curve analysis of NT-proBNP to predict HF will be performed. Analysis will compare the CDR performance against the step 1 reference test alone; against the step 1 reference test plus clinical features of the CDR (step 2); and against the step 1 reference test plus the CDR and the NT-proBNP result (the reference standard, step 3). Step 3 is the primary reference standard for analysis. This will allow us to: 1) quantify the effects of any incorporation bias; 2) explore the impact that availability of NT-proBNP test result would have on the reference standard diagnosis of HF. Comparison of the GPs’ and researcher’s clinical findings (lung crepitations, ankle oedema, decision to refer to Echo) will be assessed by the kappa statistic. Logistic regression will be used to identify which diastolic parameters of echocardiography are independently associated with the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</p>

The prevalence of heart failure in patients presenting to primary care will be determined both from the study cohort and from a review of the epidemiological literature. The probability that patients with and without heart failure will be referred for echocardiography will be determined based on the test characteristics of both the CDR and of existing practice. The decision tree may be further refined depending on the power of the available data from the study; for example, distinguishing between patients with HF of different levels of severity (such as LVSD and HFpEF patients).</p>
                <p>Cost and quality of life implications for patients at different branches of the decision tree will be extrapolated based both on data collected during the study and from the literature. Prospectively collected data on quality of life, clinical events and health care resource use will be used to estimate outcomes associated with using the CDR, NT-proBNP, their combination, or continuing with current practice. Since the study does not capture the full details of every acute event in the cohort, the cost and quality of life implications of such events will be imputed from the literature and standard UK sources of health economic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p>
                <p>Outcomes associated with current practice will be estimated by using GP reported clinical judgment to predict their intentions for patients in the absence of using the CDR. In addition, the model will allow exploration of the effect on cost effectiveness of hypothetical scenarios involving altering the threshold peptide value for referral to echocardiography. Decreasing the threshold will cause more people to be referred for echocardiography, hence increasing costs but also improving outcomes. By using a suitable threshold cost per QALY cut-off (such as the threshold of £20,000 - £30,000 used by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], the optimal threshold peptide value for referral can be estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p>
                <p>Costs will be evaluated from a health care provider perspective, with a lifetime time horizon. The effect of uncertainty in parameter values will be quantified by both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and will be summarised using appropriate methods (cost-effectiveness plots and/or cost-effectiveness acceptability curves) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p>

                <p>The study has full approval from South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee, reference number 09/H1207/121. We shall ensure that participation in the study does not lead to inferior medical care by performing the diagnostic assessments within seven days of GP referral and by informing the patient’s GP of the clinical assessment results and any clinical abnormalities uncovered within seven days. Therefore, study patients will receive a higher standard of care than would be likely in routine practice. Post-study medical care will be provided by patients’ GPs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The REFER Study is a multicentre, Phase II study designed to prospectively validate a CDR to improve the diagnosis of heart failure in primary care. HF is a diagnostic dilemma for the general practitioner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In the absence of an accurate method of identifying patients with HF, triage of patients for echocardiography in primary care is variable. As a result HF diagnosis is often delayed, misdiagnosed, or treated incorrectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The main characteristic of the REFER study is that it examines a symptomatic adult population presenting in general practice.</p>
              <p>A major problem with all the studies we uncovered in our review of the diagnostic test systematic reviews is spectrum and referral bias since most were based on observational screening studies rather than symptomatic presenting patients, and some were hospital rather than community based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Only a prospective study design with consecutively recruited symptomatic patients can avoid or minimise these potential biases. Another major strength of the REFER study is that the study has been designed according to strict methodological standards to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the CDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Moreover, the study’s design will provide data on the impact of the availability of the NT-proBNP result on the reference standard diagnosis of heart failure. These data are of clinical significance, given that the current NICE algorithm for heart failure diagnosis envisages NT-proBNP being used principally as a triage test to determine which patients should have echocardiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, in diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, it may be that a raised natriuretic peptide level is of diagnostic value in its own right. Further, the results will provide data on optimum natriuretic peptide cut-offs which, as far as we are aware, are not yet available. Additionally, the planned modelling will indicate whether further research is not necessary if the strategy dominates or the technology fails. An intermediate result would enable accurate powering for any future Phase III trial.</p>
              <sec>
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has potential limitations that apply to validating CDRs. Reference standard misclassification is an inherent problem of diagnostic accuracy studies that may introduce bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The prospective study design will allow us to ensure that all symptomatic patients presenting with new onset symptoms suggestive of heart failure will receive identical standardised assessments.</p>
                <p>This will ensure that all patients are diagnosed in a consistent manner in order to avoid introducing variation into the reference standard. Our reference standard also incorporates multiple assessments, thereby minimising potential reference standard misclassification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Another possible limitation concerns incorporation bias. This occurs when knowledge of the result of the index test influences the reference standard test. The CDR incorporates variables from the history, examination and tests that would normally be included in a reference standard. To minimise the potential for bias our expert consensus panel will initially receive the clinical information and investigation results about the patient with the exception of the information that comprises the CDR (namely history of myocardial infarction; gender; basal lung crepitations and ankle oedema) and the NT-proBNP result. They will be asked to reach a decision on whether or not HF is present initially without these data. They will then be given the clinical features of the CDR score and asked if this influences their decision, and then the results of the NT-proBNP test. This stepped reference standard will allow us to quantify the effects of any incorporation bias.</p>
                <p>Selection bias is a key issue in diagnostic accuracy studies. This bias would occur if GPs enrolled only those patients they believed to have a high probability of heart failure. This would mean more symptomatic or more severe cases would dominate the study sample and result in an over-estimation of the test-accuracy of the CDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In our study, the consecutive inclusion of all symptomatic patients will minimise the risk of introducing this type of bias. GPs will be asked to refer all patients over 55 years of age presenting with the target symptoms regardless of whether or not heart failure is suspected by the doctor and excluding patients with pre-existing confirmed heart failure. Verification bias is also a potential limitation and may occur if patients with low pre-test probability of heart failure were to be excluded from undergoing reference standard diagnostic testing to verify the diagnosis of heart failure. This would result in an over-estimation of test sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Performing all diagnostic assessments on all patients included in the study will minimise this potential source of bias.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We aim to prospectively validate our previously derived (Phase I) novel, simple CDR in a new set of symptomatic patients in clinical practice. If shown to be cost-effective, the CDR will support GPs in prioritising which patients with symptoms suggestive of HF should be referred on for echocardiography. The CDR has the potential to improve patient care and GP clinical decision-making, reduce diagnostic uncertainty and variability in practice, increase the speed with which people with HF commence treatment, and lower NHS costs.</p>
