                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Vitiligo is a condition resulting in white patches on the skin. People with vitiligo can suffer from low self-esteem, psychological disturbance and diminished quality of life. Vitiligo is often poorly managed, partly due to lack of high-quality evidence to inform clinical care. We describe here a large, independent, randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the comparative effectiveness of potent topical corticosteroid, home-based hand-held narrowband ultraviolet B-light (NB-UVB) or combination of the two, for the management of vitiligo.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The HI-Light Vitiligo Trial is a multicentre, three-arm, parallel group, pragmatic, placebo-controlled RCT. 516 adults and children with actively spreading, but limited, vitiligo are randomised (1:1:1) to one of three groups: mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment plus dummy NB-UVB light, vehicle ointment plus NB-UVB light or mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment plus NB-UVB light. Treatment of up to three patches of vitiligo is continued for up to 9 months with clinic visits at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months and four post-treatment questionnaires.</p>
                  <p>The HI-Light Vitiligo Trial assesses outcomes included in the vitiligo core outcome set and places emphasis on participants’ views of treatment success. The primary outcome is proportion of participants achieving treatment success (patient-rated Vitiligo Noticeability Scale) for a target patch of vitiligo at 9 months with further independent blinded assessment using digital images of the target lesion before and after treatment. Secondary outcomes include time to onset of treatment response, treatment success by body region, percentage repigmentation, quality of life, time-burden of treatment, maintenance of response, safety and within-trial cost-effectiveness.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Vitiligo is a chronic progressive condition causing loss of skin pigmentation. It affects around 0.5%–1% of the world’s population, and can develop at any age, although onset between the age of 10 and 30 years is most common.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> Vitiligo can have a major impact on the quality of life of affected people,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> who often experience psychological problems such as shame, depression and anxiety, low self-esteem and social isolation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Current clinical guidelines for the management of vitiligo recommend narrowband ultraviolet-B light (NB-UVB), topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus and combination therapies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> However, the evidence base for treatments is currently limited.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref>
</p>
              <p>A Cochrane systematic review assessing interventions for vitiligo was updated in 2015.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This review identified 96 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitiligo treatments, involving 4512 participants. Despite this large number of trials, the quality of the included studies was generally poor, making it difficult to make firm recommendations for vitiligo treatment. The majority of the studies included fewer than 50 participants, were at high or unclear risk of bias and few involved children. Nevertheless, the Cochrane review identified some evidence in support of NB-UVB, and the combination of NB-UVB with other active interventions (eg, topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors) appeared to be more effective than monotherapy. A 2016 review of the use of NB-UVB for the treatment of vitiligo<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> also concluded that guidance on dosing and administration of NB-UVB requires further study.</p>
              <p>There is some evidence to suggest that starting vitiligo treatment when lesions first appear is likely to result in better treatment response, when vitiligo patches are actively changing and some melanin is still present.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, current practice is to reserve NB-UVB treatment for patients with widespread and established vitiligo,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> as the treatment requires thrice weekly visits to the hospital for full body light therapy. The recent availability of hand-held NB-UVB units for private purchase on the open market means that early intervention using treatment at home is now a possibility. Benefits of home-based treatment, if shown to be safe and effective, would be a reduction in time and financial burden for patients and hospital services, and reduced exposure of healthy skin to NB-UVB light as treatment can be targeted more effectively. Our small pilot RCT, involving 29 participants, compared hand-held NB-UVB with dummy devices for the management of vitiligo.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This pilot demonstrated that people with vitiligo were keen to use home-based light therapy, and that the devices were safe and well tolerated when used in a domestic setting.</p>
              <p>A James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership identified a ‘top 10’ list of priority areas for vitiligo research that are important to people with vitiligo and healthcare professionals responsible for their care.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Two of these prioritised areas relate to the use of light therapy for the management of vitiligo: ‘Which treatment is more effective for vitiligo: steroid creams/ointments or light therapy?’ and ‘How effective is UVB therapy when combined with creams or ointments in treating vitiligo?’ The prioritisation work was shared with the NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme who subsequently invited applications to address these two priority topics in open competition. The contract to conduct the commissioning brief was awarded to this team.</p>

                <p>The trial is a multicentre three-arm, parallel group, pragmatic, placebo-controlled RCT, recruiting adults and children with early and limited vitiligo. The trial treatments are home-based therapies (potent topical corticosteroid and hand-held NB-UVB), and their use is prescribed and overseen in a secondary care setting across 18 hospitals in the UK. A full list of recruiting centres can be found in the ’Acknowledgements' section. A mixed-methods process evaluation is being conducted alongside the HI-Light Vitiligo Trial.

                  <p>Participants are enrolled in the trial for a total of up to 21 months (9 months treatment phase, up to 12 months follow-up). During the treatment phase, participants attend a hospital clinic five times (two consecutive days at baseline for recruitment, medical photography, photosensitivity assessment (minimum erythema dose (MED) test) and training in use of the interventions), followed by assessment at 3, 6 and 9 months for compliance and outcome. The additional follow-up is by 3-monthly questionnaires, self-completed by post or email link. Due to trial timelines, participants recruited towards the end of the recruitment may be followed-up for a shorter period of time.</p>

Potential participants are initially screened by telephone in order to ensure that only people who are potentially eligible to take part are invited to attend a clinic appointment.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Participants are randomised to one of three treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1 as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Topical corticosteroid ointment plus dummy NB-UVB light (corticosteroid only);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Vehicle ointment plus NB-UVB light (light therapy only);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Topical corticosteroid ointment plus NB-UVB light (combination therapy).</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>Randomised allocation to treatment groups is minimised by recruiting centre, body region of target patch (face and neck, hands and feet or rest of the body) and age (5–16 years or &gt;16 years), weighted towards minimising the imbalance in trial arms with a probability of 0.8. After all eligibility criteria have been confirmed and medical photographs taken, participants are randomised by staff at the recruiting hospital via a secure web server created and maintained by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit.</p>
                <p>Participants are only randomised into the trial once they have completed the training in use of the trial interventions, the results of the MED test are known and the participant has attended medical photography for their baseline digital photograph.</p>
                <p>Participants, research nurses, principal investigators, members of trial management group and data analysts are blinded to treatment allocation. Only the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU) programmer, the medical physics staff, pharmacy staff and the NCTU Quality Assurance staff have access to the treatment allocation schedule for the sole use of preparing, blinding and checking of the trial treatments.</p>
                <p>While every effort is made to maintain blinding of the trial interventions, there is a risk that participants may be able to guess their treatment allocation as a result of side effects of the interventions (eg, redness and tanning of the skin). To minimise detection bias, outcomes will be assessed by blinded assessors (both independent clinicians and a panel of patients), using digital images taken at baseline and at 9 months. Participant information leaflets will emphasise that all participants will receive at least one active treatment for their vitiligo, thus reducing potential unblinding due to lack of treatment response. During our previous trial in which participants were randomised to active or dummy light therapy devices, 70% (19/27) of participants and 40% (16/27) of research nurses, guessed treatment allocation correctly. The main reasons for unblinding of the research nurses were redness of the skin (30% (3/10)) and improvement in vitiligo (60% (6/10)) in the active group, and lack of treatment response (100% (6/6)) in the placebo group.</p>

Possible adverse reactions to mometasone furoate 0.1% (as listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) include: infection, folliculitis, paraesthesia, burning sensation, contact dermatitis, skin hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, skin striae, acneiform dermatitis, skin atrophy, pruritus, application site pain and visual disturbance. Participants are advised to stop treatment with the ointment if they notice any side effects and to contact the local research team for review and advice on when to restart treatment.</p>

                  <p>To minimise the risk of adverse reactions, topical therapy is to be applied as a thin layer to the affected patches once daily on alternate weeks (1 week on, 1 week off), for a period of 9 months. Participants are instructed that topical therapy should be applied at least 2 hours after the hand-held light device is used in order to avoid interaction of the NB-UVB light and topical corticosteroid.</p>
                  <p>Participants are initially supplied with two x 90 g tubes of ointment after randomisation. Additional tubes are prescribed by the investigator as required.</p>

In a 2016 paper,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Madigan <italic>et al</italic> published a list of 12 key questions regarding the use of narrowband UVB for generalised vitiligo. How each of these questions has been addressed within the context of the HI-Light trial is presented in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. Prior to randomisation, all participants receive an MED test, to ensure eligibility for the trial. Results of the MED test are not used to determine starting dose of the light therapy, but instead to ensure that the participant does not have any undiagnosed photosensitivity disorder. All participants follow a predefined treatment schedule for the light treatment, with a starting dose of 0.05 J/cm<sup>2</sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>).</p>

One of these three patches is selected by the participants as being the patch that they would most like to see an improvement in.

Vitiligo is known to respond differently at different body sites, with the face and neck being more likely to respond to treatment than the hands and feet.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Training material provided to sites advised nurses to inform participants that patches on the hands and feet may be more difficult to treat so they may wish to choose a target patch from one of the other body regions.</p>
                  <p>If participants wish to treat additional patches of vitiligo they are free to do so, but the additional patches are not assessed as part of the trial. Participants are encouraged to consider the additional time burden of treating more than three patches, and to prioritise treatment of the study patches if the time burden becomes restrictive.</p>

                  <title>Data collection and management</title>
                  <p>Data collection and skin assessments are undertaken by trained staff at the recruiting hospitals. Participants who do not attend clinic visits at 3 or 6 months continue to be invited to subsequent follow-up visits unless they decline further participation in the trial. Every effort is made to ensure the 9-month follow-up visit takes place, and if a face-to-face visit cannot be arranged, data are collected via telephone or email if possible. Data captured at clinic visits are entered by site staff into the web-based trial database.</p>
                  <p>The year-long follow-up after treatment is by self-completed questionnaires, either via an email link to the trial online system or by post, sent with a stamped addressed envelope. Reminders are sent (via email or post) if the questionnaire remains uncompleted after 2 weeks, and again after 3 weeks. The trial coordinating centre also then chases up outstanding questionnaires after 3 weeks via telephone.</p>
                  <p>Detailed data management processes and central and on-site monitoring procedures are documented in a data management plan. All sites are monitored at least once after the first five randomisations from that site, and triggered monitoring visits are undertaken if any concerns about the site are raised. Database validation checks are conducted centrally including checks for missing data, out of range values, illogical entries and invalid responses. Data entered by sites into the trial database are subject to monitoring and review by coordinating centre staff, and data queries are raised as necessary. All receive at least one site monitoring visit during the trial.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>Our choice of minimum clinically important difference between the groups has been informed by a survey of the clinical membership of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network. Assuming that topical corticosteroid alone results in 15% treatment success at 9 months,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> clinicians were keen to see at least a 20% absolute difference between the groups if they were to justify the cost and complexity of introducing home-based NB-UVB as a potential new service in clinical practice (either on its own or in combination with topical corticosteroid).</p>
                  <p>The following sample size estimate formed the basis of the funding application and protocol at the start of the study: based on the assumption that 15% of participants allocated to receive topical corticosteroid alone achieve treatment success,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> 372 participants are required to detect an absolute difference of 20%, with 2.5% two-sided alpha and 90% power. Two comparisons are of coprimary interest, light therapy and light therapy plus topical corticosteroid each versus topical corticosteroid alone. Allowing for up to 15% non-collection of primary outcome data at 9 months, the target sample size was 440 participants.</p>
                  <p>As data were limited to inform the sample size calculation for this trial, a planned sample size review by the Data Monitoring Committee was scheduled after 18 months of recruitment. This review was conducted in December 2016 and resulted in a recommendation to increase the sample size by a further 76 participants in order to maintain 90% power to detect a risk difference of 20% between the topical corticosteroid arm and the other two arms. The final sample size estimate is therefore 516 participants. This recommendation was approved by the Trial Steering Committee and the funders.</p>

                  <title>Statistical methods</title>
                  <p>The primary approach to between-group comparisons will be to analyse participants according to the group to which they were allocated, regardless of treatment received, levels of adherence and with multiple imputation of missing outcome data.</p>
                  <p>Baseline data will be presented descriptively, and presented by intervention group.</p>
                  <p>For the primary outcome, number and percentage of participants achieving ‘treatment success’ will be reported for each treatment group at 9 months from randomisation. Randomised groups will be compared using a generalised linear model for binary outcome adjusted by centre, body site of vitiligo and age. The primary effectiveness parameter for the two coprimary comparisons of topical corticosteroid versus NB-UVB light, and topical corticosteroid versus NB-UVB light plus topical corticosteroid, will be the risk difference in the proportion of participants achieving treatment success at 9 months, along with 95% CI and exact P value. We will also report relative effects using risk ratios. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to (i) further adjust for any variables with marked imbalance at baseline, (ii)repeat primary analysis based on participants whose primary outcome is available at 9 months and (iii) investigate the effects of treatment adherence. Planned subgroup analyses are (i) children versus adults and (ii) by body region of the target vitiligo patch. Further secondary analyses will be defined in the statistical analysis plan prior to locking the trial database. These analyses will be conducted by inclusion of appropriate interaction terms in the regression model, and will be considered as exploratory.</p>
                  <p>Analyses investigating other follow-up times, treatment success of patches on other body sites and other secondary outcomes will be analysed by a similar approach, using appropriate regression modelling depending on outcome type.</p>
                  <p>All analyses will be specified in a statistical analysis plan to be finalised and approved by the Data Monitoring Committee and Trial Steering Committee prior to locking the database.</p>

                <p>An incremental cost analysis will be conducted from an NHS perspective capturing the intervention resource use and other health resource use throughout the treatment and follow-up period (21 months in total). In addition to an NHS perspective, but presented separately, an estimate of out-of-pocket and time costs of treatment for participants and parents/guardians will be recorded. Intervention and wider healthcare costs will be estimated during the trial through participant dairies and case report forms (CRFs).

Where appropriate (ie, in the absence of either intervention dominating), the incremental cost-effectiveness of NB-UVB alone compared with TCS alone and separately of NB-UVB plus TCS compared with TCS alone will be estimated by dividing the difference in costs by the difference in QALYs. Decision uncertainty will be presented via Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves based on non-parametric bootstrapping of cost and effect pairs.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> This will provide robust trial evidence to inform decision makers about the likely cost-effectiveness of interventions for vitiligo in particular about whether NB-UVB light is more cost-effective than topical corticosteroid alone and about whether combination treatment offers greater value for money than TCS treatment alone.</p>

              <p>The HI-Light Vitiligo Trial is an appropriately powered, pragmatic, RCT that addresses a topic that has been identified as important by people with vitiligo, healthcare professionals who treat them and by the NIHR. It is unique in that it includes both children and adults with early and limited vitiligo, places particular emphasis on patient-reported outcomes and has been delivered with the support of a professional Clinical Trials Unit.</p>
              <p>We support the development and use of core outcome sets in clinical trials and have included outcomes that are currently recommended as part of the core outcome set for vitiligo.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, outcomes research is rapidly evolving. Since starting the trial, further guidance has emerged<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> suggesting that 80%, rather than 75% repigmentation, should be used to represent a meaningful treatment response, and that maintenance of repigmentation should be evaluated 6 months after stopping treatment. We will consider this updated guidance when finalising our statistical analysis plan and final write-up, to ensure that data are presented in a way that will facilitate comparison with other trial datasets in the future.</p>
              <p>Alongside the trial, a mixed methods process evaluation study is being conducted to explore barriers and facilitators to use of the trial interventions in normal care. The views of trial participants, healthcare professions and commissioners on the use of the trial interventions will be sought. A process evaluation can help to explain trial findings, explore how intervention delivery within the trial may differ from ‘real-world’ delivery and identify issues important to the transferability of an effective intervention outside the trial.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This process evaluation is particularly relevant for a study such as HI-Light, where hand-held NB-UVB devices represent a new way of delivering care with complexity around training and treatment adherence.</p>
              <p>Several resources have been developed during the set-up of this trial that may be helpful for other researchers wishing to conduct trials of home light therapy, or for health providers wishing to implement the study findings. A training video demonstrating how to use home NB-UVB is freely available, along with training materials for conducting MED tests and copies of study documents and treatment diaries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.vitiligostudy.org.uk">www.vitiligostudy.org.uk</ext-link>). The trial is also contributing to a nested methodological study (START) looking at the value of interactive websites to facilitate recruitment and retention in trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/mrcstart">http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/mrcstart</ext-link>).
