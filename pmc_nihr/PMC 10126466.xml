                <p>The mental health of young people (YP) is a major public health concern that has
worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst engaging with culture and the arts
may have mental health benefits there is a dearth of experimental research
regarding the impact of online arts and culture on depression and anxiety in YP.
In particular online interventions, which may improve accessibility.</p>

                  <title>Objective:</title>
                  <p>We aimed to compare a co-produced online intervention encompassing the
diverse human stories behind art and artefacts, named Ways of Being (WoB),
with a typical museum website, the Ashmolean (Ash) on negative affect (NA),
positive affect (PA) and psychological distress (K10).</p>

                  <p>In this parallel group RCT, 463 YP aged 16-24 were randomly assigned, 231 to
WoB and 232 to Ash.</p>

                  <p>Over the intervention phase (an aggregate score including all post-allocation
timepoints to day-five) a group difference was apparent in favour of WoB for
NA (WoB-Ash n=448, NA -0.158, p=0.010) but no differences were detected for
PA or K10 and differences were not detected at week six. Group differences
in NA in favour of WoB were detected in specific subgroups, e.g. ethnic
minorities and males. Across participants (from both groups) mean K10 and NA
improved between baseline and six weeks despite increased COVID-19
restrictions. Trial recruitment was rapid, retention high and feedback
positive with broad geographical, occupational and ethnic diversity.</p>

              <p>Three-quarters of mental health problems emerge before the age of 25, yet people aged
16–24 years are the least likely age group to seek help (<xref rid="bibr5-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr44-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Olfson and Klerman, 1992</xref>). Mental health
problems in young people (YP) have long-term sequelae throughout the lifespan (<xref rid="bibr31-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Kieling et al., 2011</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr36-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Lewinsohn et al.,

have disproportionately impacted on the lives of YP with evidence of higher rates of
depression (<xref rid="bibr25-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al.,

et al., 2021</xref>). Some YP have been affected more than others, including
marginalised groups such as ethnic minorities (<xref rid="bibr1-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Abramovich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr8-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Bray et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bibr48-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Proto and Quintana-Domeque,

              <p>Only around 35% of YP with mental health problems seek professional help (<xref rid="bibr72-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Zachrisson et al., 2006</xref>),
the main barriers being lack of recognition, lack of awareness and stigma (<xref rid="bibr27-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Gulliver et al., 2010</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr49-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Radez et al., 2021a</xref>,

as ethnic minorities, are the least likely to seek help (<xref rid="bibr16-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Cauce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bibr27-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Gulliver et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Oksanen et al., 2017</xref>;

2014</xref>). Thus, there is a compelling need for evidence-based, accessible,
acceptable and engaging resources to support the mental health of YP during and
beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p>There is evidence that engagement with culture and the arts is good for mental health
and well-being (<xref rid="bibr14-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Callinan and

aesthetic engagement, social interaction, cognitive stimulation, sensory activation
and imagination (<xref rid="bibr14-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Callinan and

underrepresented in clinical research.</p>
              <p>We previously conducted a series of studies to identify the potential mental health
benefits of engaging with online arts and culture on mental health. Previous
research has used such broad definitions of online arts and culture that the mental
health impact has been unclear (<xref rid="bibr11-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Browne Gott, 2020</xref>). We define online arts and culture as online
resources from museums, theatres, art galleries, libraries, archives and natural
heritage organisations (<xref rid="bibr58-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed
Sheriff et al., 2021a</xref>) rather than broader definitions used by others
which have included gaming, streamed and social media (<xref rid="bibr41-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">NESTA, 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>We commenced a preregistered evidence synthesis (<xref rid="bibr60-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed Sheriff et al., 2020</xref>) of trials
evaluating community resources including engagement with arts and culture on anxiety
and depression. To date, we have screened 15,534 titles and abstracts and have found
no trials evaluating the effectiveness of online arts and culture for depression and
anxiety in YP.</p>
              <p>We conducted an online survey of the self-reported benefits of engaging with online
arts and culture which took place in the context of the first UK COVID-19 lockdown
(<xref rid="bibr58-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed Sheriff et al.,
2021a</xref>). In total, 1056 people completed the survey. A high proportion of
participants reported engaging with online arts culture as being helpful for their
mental health. Those under 25 years old were less likely to be regular users of
online culture or to have increased their use during lockdown.</p>
              <p>We then conducted a qualitative interview study, which is described in detail
elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr59-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed Sheriff et al.,
2022</xref>). In brief, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted
with 13 participants aged 16–24 who were socio-demographically diverse and varied in
their use of online arts and culture and mental health status. Participants were
asked about the potential benefits of online arts and culture for mental health.
Descriptions of themes and subthemes were returned to participants for comment.
Participants described that the features of online arts and culture most likely to
benefit mental health were diverse human stories and a variety of viewpoints, with
which they could connect on a human level, bringing a sense of perspective and
opportunities for reflection, learning, escapism, creativity, exploration and
discovery. Perceived impacts on mental health included disruption of negative
thought patterns, lifted mood and increased feelings of calm and proactivity.</p>

two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a co-produced online
cultural experience named Ways of Being (WoB), encompassing the diverse human
stories behind art and artefacts and a variety of alternative viewpoints, to a
typical museum website (Ashmolean) on negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA)

test impact over a short intervention phase for signal detection to determine
the utility of developing this approach further. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first experimental study of online cultural experiences for mental
health in YP and as such aimed to elucidate efficacy and potential mechanisms of
action.</p>

                <p>The design was a parallel-group RCT with a 1:1 allocation ratio, conducted
entirely online. The trial was submitted to the trial registry in its current
form prior to the first participant being recruited (official registration date
shortly after this, but no substantive change in the planned trial; this
reflects administration time at the trial registry and academic institution).
The Trial Steering Committee included three Public and Patient Involvement (PPI)

completion. The protocol and SPIRIT checklist for this trial are described in
detail elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr61-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed

                <p>We included people aged 16–24 years in the United Kingdom or 18–24 if based
overseas (due to local ethical guidance restricting the use of the term
‘competent youth’ to those aged 16–17 years located within the United Kingdom)
and with access to a desktop or laptop computer running a recent browser (Edge
or Chrome on Windows, and Safari or Chrome on a Mac). There were no exclusions
according to current mental health status. We recruited people of the target age

Participants were allocated by a researcher blinded to all study data except
gender during the entire randomisation and allocation procedure. The
allocation was emailed to the participant with joining instructions and
therefore the participants were aware of the name of the online cultural
intervention to which they had been allocated but did not know which was the
‘control’ condition. The interventions and all measures were online and
self-report and therefore blinding procedures for care providers and outcome
assessors were not relevant. Baseline and outcome data remained blinded for
all researchers and analysts throughout the intervention phase.</p>

                <p>Trial procedures were trialled on 11 volunteers and detailed feedback was taken
prior to the trial to ensure the integrity of all procedures. Baseline and
subsequent assessments were completed and stored securely in the Gorilla
platform during the study period. The Gorilla Experiment Builder (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.gorilla.sc" ext-link-type="uri">www.gorilla.sc</ext-link>) is a cloud-based research platform that allows
researchers to design and administer behavioural experiments online.</p>
                <p>Consenting participants entered an online questionnaire including items for
gender, ethnicity, isolation status, income, relationship status, use of online
culture, education, current employment, current and previous mental health and
COVID-19 status. Participants were then emailed a unique ID number and requested
to complete a baseline assessment on a computer, including self-report measures
and online tasks. They were then randomised to WoB or Ash.</p>
                <p>Participants had the option of consenting to text messages to remind them to
complete the twice-daily measures each day of the 3-day intervention phase.
There was also an email reminder (and text message reminder for all those who
consented) to all participants to complete the measures on exit of the

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Co-production of the intervention occurred over an intense 3-month period
(September–November 2020) in an iterative process involving small- and
large-scale production, co-production sprints and refinement with constant
feedback. Co-production was preceded by a stakeholder workshop with YP, service
users above the target age range and museum curators, youth engagement and
education officers. Throughout co-production, weekly meetings were attended with
Imagineear (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.imagineear.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.imagineear.com</ext-link>), a production company experienced in content
creation and platform provision for museums and art galleries as well as health
services.</p>
                <p>Youth preference took precedence in the development of WoB. YP were involved in
five workshops and gave regular feedback in groups or via direct messaging (zoom
and email) with comments, edits, suggestions and viewpoints for the developing
intervention. The 12 YP aged 16–24 involved in co-production were selected to
represent a diversity of viewpoints and were recruited from youth PPI groups
(three YP), volunteers from university staff and students with specific
expertise, for example, one works in a voluntary role with young refugees (three
YP) and a selection of those involved in the qualitative interview study (six
YP).</p>
                <p>Stages of co-production included selection of stories, generation of viewpoints,
determination of audio-visual preferences, navigation and optimisation of the
online platform. The co-production process revealed the importance of
authenticity, diversity, accessible language and a rich tapestry of stories to
encourage exploration and discovery. A more detailed description of the
co-production process has been described previously (<xref rid="bibr2-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 2021</xref>) and will be
described in more detail in a report (currently being co-produced with the YP)
elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The co-produced online intervention, called WoB, was designed to be entered at a
time and place convenient to the individual on their own device. Introductory
pages illustrated the features of WoB. A non-hierarchical menu page gave the
choice of 11 diverse ‘stories’, each of which encompassed a visual and a title,
e.g. ‘Being Ibrahim’. Once entered, these led into a long-form story (which
could be listened to or read) interspersed with visual media and then further
‘deeper’ stories which were interconnected. Alongside the stories was a comments
tool that enabled participants to add their own viewpoint to a variety of
viewpoints prepopulated during co-production, enabling participants to express
their responses anonymously which were then redisplayed within WoB. The features
of WoB are illustrated in a video walk-through (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQLFL4Tm-v8" ext-link-type="uri">www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQLFL4Tm-v8</ext-link>). A TIDieR checklist has
been completed (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00048674221115648" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Material 6</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Participants were requested to engage with WoB at least once a day for at least
three consecutive days from the day following allocation, for around 30 minutes
a day. The duration and intensity of the requested engagement was chosen in
discussion with YP during co-production and trial planning to balance the
content available on WoB with a realistic and non-onerous engagement requirement
at sufficient dose to evaluate proof of principle over the intervention
phase.</p>
                <p>The Ashmolean Website (Ash) is a typical museum website owned by the Ashmolean
Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford. Participants who were
allocated to Ash were directed towards the Ashmolean from Home webpage
(<ext-link xlink:href="https://ashmolean.org/ashmoleanfromhome" ext-link-type="uri">https://ashmolean.org/ashmoleanfromhome</ext-link>). This section of the
Ashmolean Website was specifically created as an online substitute for the
museum visit and material curated by museum specialists with a focus on art
movements or styles. Unlike WoB, the emphasis is on the objects themselves
rather than human stories. Participants allocated to Ash were asked to engage
with its content in line with the engagement requirement for WoB.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcomes were NA and PA, both measured via the Positive and Negative
Affect Scale (PANAS) (<xref rid="bibr70-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 1988b</xref>), and psychological distress, measured via the
Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) (<xref rid="bibr30-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>). The
‘intervention phase’ was an aggregate of scores at all time points
post-allocation including day 5. The only other time point was at 6 weeks which
was included to determine whether early differences in the performance of
cognitive tasks predicted changes at 6 weeks (<xref rid="bibr61-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed Sheriff et al., 2021b</xref>).
Therefore, intervention phase NA, PA and K10 are reported as the primary
outcomes.</p>
                <p>The PANAS is a widely used scale of emotion and comprises 20 items, 10 measuring
NA, upset, afraid etc., on a Likert-type scale of 1 (very slightly) to 5
(extremely), and 10 measuring PA, excited, inspired etc. The PANAS was
administered with reference to the previous 7 days at baseline and 6 weeks, the
previous 3 days at day 5 and at that precise moment twice daily during the 3-day
intervention period.</p>
                <p>The NA scale is highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated and stable.
Low NA reflects a state of calmness and serenity. High NA is related to
self-reported stress and difficulty coping with negative events. Lower scores
reflect lower levels of NA. The PA scale is valid and reliable with high
internal consistency. High PA is characterised by energy, concentration and
engagement (<xref rid="bibr70-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al.,
1988b</xref>). In this study, individual mean PA scores were used to
indicate PA at each time point and individual mean NA scores were used to
indicate NA at each time point.</p>
                <p>Psychological distress was used to ascertain the level of anxiety and depressive
symptoms at baseline, day 5 and 6 weeks. The K10 is one of the most widely used
mental health screening instruments (<xref rid="bibr4-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Andrews and Slade, 2001</xref>) and
demonstrates good properties with regard to validity, reliability (<xref rid="bibr4-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Andrews and Slade,
2001</xref>) and sensitivity to change (<xref rid="bibr45-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Perini et al., 2006</xref>). The K10 strongly
discriminates between community cases and non-cases of mental disorders
identified by a structured clinical interview (<xref rid="bibr30-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2002</xref>). The K10 was
asked with reference to the previous 4 weeks at baseline and 6 weeks and the
previous 3 days at day 5. Each item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale
(1 = none of the time to 5 = all of the time) and scores added to a possible
range of 10 to 50, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of distress
(<xref rid="bibr4-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Andrews and Slade,
2001</xref>).</p>
                <p>There was also a detailed feedback survey at 6 weeks based on the NIHR Research

                <p>Fifteen participants (eight from WoB and seven from Ash) dropped out after
randomisation but prior to any outcome assessments and were therefore not
included in the analyses. Overall, 349 (75%) completed assessments to 6 weeks.
There was no difference between groups in the proportion of dropouts (Ash = 59,
WoB = 55) (see <xref rid="fig1-00048674221115648" ref-type="fig">Figure
1</xref>). Baseline mean K10 was non-significantly higher in trial completers

resources were positive (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00048674221115648" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Material 5</ext-link>, Research Feedback Table and Panel 1).
Feedback specific to WoB was that participants exhausted the content before the
end of the intervention phase and would have appreciated more material.</p>

              <p>Although it is generally thought that engagement with culture and the arts is good
for mental health and well-being, this RCT provides the first reliable experimental
evidence lending support for online engagement for depression and anxiety in YP.
This report describes an online RCT with 1:1 allocation in which 463 participants
aged 16–24 were allocated to WoB, an online experience encompassing the diverse
human stories behind art and artefacts and a variety of viewpoints in favour of WoB,
or a traditional museum website. Group differences were apparent over the
intervention phase for NA but not PA or psychological distress (K10) and group
differences were not detected 6 weeks later. In both groups, mean K10 and NA
substantially reduced between baseline and the intervention phase and remained low
at week 6 despite increased COVID-19 restrictions. There were subgroup differences
in NA in favour of WoB in groups in whom help-seeking tends to be low, for example,
in ethnic minorities and males. These findings provide early evidence for the
potential of online arts and culture in supporting mental health in YP.</p>
              <p>This pattern of results is interesting because some models of psychopathology
postulate that NA is a core dimension and may be the key unifying thread in anxiety
and depressive disorders (<xref rid="bibr26-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Griffith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Mineka et al., 1998</xref>) and psychopathology
more broadly (<xref rid="bibr28-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Hinden et al.,
1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Krueger et
al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bibr69-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Watson et
al., 1988a</xref>) and is a mediator between stress and risk-taking behaviours
such as substance misuse and smoking in adolescents (<xref rid="bibr17-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Colder and Chassin, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Doran et al., 2011</xref>).
Psychological therapies have been shown to reduce NA in the short term (<xref rid="bibr34-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Kring et al., 2007</xref>).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, NA has been proposed as a mediator between social
media use and depression in YP (<xref rid="bibr73-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Zhao and Zhou, 2020</xref>). It is possible that online arts and culture could
positively impact on mental health via a reduction in NA, particularly at times of
psychosocial stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other stressful experiences,
perhaps including the transition into adulthood itself. These results offer an
intriguing indication that WoB includes elements which may have efficacy to reduce
mental health symptoms and/or protect against the evolution of mental disorder and
associated poor outcomes and provide an avenue for self-management in YP.</p>
              <p>Mental health outcomes appeared to improve in both groups over the period of the
trial despite increased COVID-19 restrictions. Many epidemiological studies have
demonstrated worsening mental health in YP in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic
and associated restrictions (<xref rid="bibr25-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Pierce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr68-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Vizard et al., 2020</xref>), whereas we observed
that both K10 and NA scores reduced. In fact, there appeared to be a clinically
significant improvement. In both groups, over 25% less people reported clinically
significant symptoms between baseline and the intervention phase which was sustained
at 6 weeks (<ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/00048674221115648" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Material 1, Table 3</ext-link>). Across the whole population, the
mean K10 reduced from 27.1 (range of moderate disorder) to 23.4 (range of mild
disorder) in the intervention phase and remained low at 6 weeks (23.3). It is
possible that online arts and culture acted as a protective factor for mental health
over this period.</p>
              <p>These findings also suggest that online arts and culture has potential as an
intervention for YP with high unmet mental health needs. At baseline, a high
proportion of trial participants reported levels of distress consistent with
disorder compared to other studies conducted at a similar time (<xref rid="bibr25-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Gray et al., 2020</xref>). Many
of those underserved clinically and underrepresented in research were recruited into
this study, such as ethnic minorities, non-students and males (<xref rid="bibr6-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Biddle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr37-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr38-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Memon et al., 2016</xref>). Subgroup analyses
indicated that those traditionally least likely to seek help, such as males and
ethnic minorities had a positive response to WoB. Ethnic minorities, non-students
and males are poorly served both clinically (<xref rid="bibr38-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Memon et al., 2016</xref>) and by the cultural
sector in the United Kingdom (<xref rid="bibr10-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Brook and O’Brien, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr58-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Syed Sheriff et al., 2021a</xref>). It is
encouraging that these YP engaged and benefitted in this online trial.</p>

                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p>This trial was innovative with rapid recruitment, high retention rates and
positive feedback. In contrast to many trials of non-pharmacological
interventions, this trial compared two alternative potentially active
interventions. This reduced the probability of detecting a difference. This
trial was conducted online, was inclusive and reached YP who are conventionally
hard to reach which may have been aided by its online setting and
non-restrictive inclusion criteria, allowing the inclusion of those who may not
have identified as having a current mental health problem. We are not aware of
any previous experimental research investigating online arts and culture for
anxiety and depression in YP.</p>

              <sec id="section26-00048674221115648">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>While the results are promising, it is likely that richer content delivered over
a longer period would have had a more sustained effect. In the same vein, the
design would have benefitted from a third arm to evaluate efficacy compared to a
waitlist control. We decided against this strategy given the mental health need
in YP at the time of the trial. In addition, it is not possible to elucidate
from this study alone the extent to which these findings are dependent on the
context of the psychosocial stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

              <sec id="section27-00048674221115648">
                <title>Implications</title>
                <p>These findings contribute to how we understand the links between the cultural and
health sectors suggesting there is untapped potential to reach vulnerable groups
through arts and culture, especially YP, many of whom are reluctant
help-seekers. More effort is needed to explore how online arts and culture
support different vulnerable groups and connect to other types of support.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Although museums seek to broaden their user base (which is 92% White) and push back
against traditional cultural approaches (<xref rid="bibr54-00048674221115648" ref-type="bibr">Shaindlin, 2019</xref>), development of resources
through co-production directly link these efforts to engage more diverse audiences
with efforts to promote health and thriving more broadly. Tailoring co-produced
cultural resources to optimise efficacy on mental health outcomes may be
particularly suited to online engagement and must be capitalised on, given the
burden of mental disorder in this age group, particularly as we emerge from the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
