                  <title>Summary</title>
                  <p id="Par1">This feasibility study for a future definitive randomized trial assesses the use and acceptability of a new clinical decision tool to identify risk of a vertebral fracture and those who should be referred for spinal radiography in women aged 65 or over presenting to primary care with back pain.</p>

                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Approximately 12% of older adults have vertebral fragility fractures, but currently fewer than one-third are diagnosed, potentially limiting access to bone protection treatment. Vfrac is a vertebral fracture screening tool which classifies individuals into high or low risk of having a vertebral fracture, allowing targeting of spinal radiographs to high-risk individuals. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use of an online version of Vfrac in primary care.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The study will run in six general practices, with three given the Vfrac tool for use on older women (&gt;â65Â years) consulting with back pain and three using standard clinical processes for managing such back pain. Anonymised data covering a 12-month period will be collected from all sites on consultations by older women with back pain. Focus groups will be undertaken with healthcare professionals and patients on whom the tool was used to understand the acceptability of Vfrac and identify factors that impact its use. These patients will be sent a paper version of the Vfrac questionnaire to self-complete at home. Outputs of the self-completion Vfrac (high versus low risk) will be compared with the face-to-face Vfrac (high versus low risk), and agreement assessed using Cohenâs kappa.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">This study will evaluate the use and acceptability of Vfrac within primary care and determine if data on resource use can be collected accurately and comprehensively.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par7">There are approximately 3.5 million people in the UK living with osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and more women are affected with this condition than men, with 1 in 2 women over the age of 50 breaking a bone because of it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Vertebral fragility fractures (VFFs) are of particular importance, as they identify people at a high risk of future fractures, which can lead to morbidity, disability and reduced health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treatment with bone protection therapies are available to reduce the risk of further fractures by 30â70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The problem is that many patients fail to receive a diagnosis of VFFs, with estimates suggesting that over two-thirds remain undiagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are many reasons for this important healthcare gap, including lack of clinical signs specific to vertebral fracture, the high prevalence of all-cause back pain in older people, and difficulty in understanding who should have spinal X-rays.</p>
              <p id="Par8">To address this, we have developed the Vfrac clinical decision tool to help primary healthcare practitioners decide if an older woman with back pain is at high risk of a VFF and therefore requires a spinal radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. Vfrac is targeted for use during consultations between a healthcare professional and an older woman consulting with back pain. Vfrac is the only evidence-based decision tool developed from research involving women with and without VFFs including qualitative[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], cross-sectional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and caseâcontrol studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The Vfrac tool comprises 15 questions based on self-reported data and a physical examination and takes approximately 5Â minutes to perform. It has been made available on a web-based online interface to make it accessible for use across different IT systems in primary care in the UK. Use of the pre-determined cutoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] produces the output (âlow riskâspinal X-ray is not recommendedââor âhigh riskâspinal X-ray is recommended as may have a vertebral fractureâ). As previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the Vfrac clinical tool has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.802 (95% CI 0.764â0.840). Statistical modelling shows no evidence of over/underfitting; optimism in the estimate of the AUC was 0.019 estimated using 500 bootstrapped samples; and multiple imputation to account for the missing data produced results that were similar to our final model and provides internal validation. A pre-trial economic evaluation, also published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], calculates the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Vfrac compared to standard care is Â£17,000 per QALY and Vfrac has the potential to be cost-effective but a definitive trial is warranted.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Prior to this study, no testing of Vfrac has been undertaken within a real-world clinical setting and this is necessary to understand if and how it will be used, and whether changes to the tool are required to optimise its use. Primary care service delivery has changed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unlikely that there will be a full-scale return to face-to-face consultations with GPs as the primary mode of clinical assessment. This warrants an investigation as to whether the Vfrac tool can be used remotely by patients, and this is the first aim of this feasibility study. Specifically, to assess whether patients can self-complete the questionnaire at home and whether the results will be in agreement with the use of the Vfrac tool by healthcare professionals in primary care. The second aim of this study is to investigate the acceptability of Vfrac as an online clinical decision tool in primary care, as this will help identify barriers and facilitators to its implementation and delivery for the design of a future definitive trial of Vfrac.</p>

Three practices will then be assigned to the intervention arm and three to the control by purposeful selection to ensure there are both large and small practices in both groups that have varying levels of deprivation. The control practices will use standard clinical processes for older women consulting with back pain. Those in the intervention arm will be trained in the use of Vfrac and will have it made accessible from their IT systems (through provision of a URL via pop-ups on typing relevant words such as back pain). The use of the Vfrac tool will be encouraged within their clinical pathways for management of older women (over 65Â years of age) who consult with back pain. The use of the tool in a manner that is in accordance with each practiceâs service delivery model will be facilitated by the research team in discussion with the clinical team. As the use of Vfrac poses only minimal/no risk, the use of a waiver of consent by individual patients for this cluster-level intervention is appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>

This will then be recorded in the individual patientâs medical records. Each practice will have their own URL allowing secure access to the online Vfrac tool, and also to allow analysis of differences in data collection across practices. No patient identifiable data will be recorded by the online Vfrac tool, the data stored will include the answers to each question for every entry per practice, the resulting Vfrac score, date submitted and unique Vfrac reference code generated per record. There will be no ability to link back any data to individual patients, only to practices. The Vfrac result and recommendation for each individual patient will have been copied and pasted into the medical records at the time of the consultation and will be captured during the electronic download from the general practices every three months using the watermark.</p>

Focus groups will aim to understand and assess the perceived acceptability of Vfrac and identify factors that impact on implementation, including barriers and facilitators to delivery. âTopic guidesâ for patients and healthcare professionals will be used to guide discussions, with flexibility to pursue emerging ideas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These will be informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], a framework that has been developed to guide the assessment of acceptability for providers and recipients, and implementation science theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], especially theories developed to explore the implementation of complex interventions.

              <p id="Par34">This is the first study to assess a new clinical decision tool to identify which older women presenting to primary care with back pain are at risk of having an existing VFF and should be referred for a spinal radiograph. The FRAX clinical tool is available to identify an individualâs future risk of VFF, but it differs from Vfrac in that it does not give any information on risk of existing VFFs, instead providing a probability of future fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) has identified regression models to predict those with VFFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and concluded that it was better to perform radiographs in all white women agedââ¥â70 with low bone mass. This is unlikely to be a useful strategy, as assessment of bone mass is not carried out at a population level, and spinal radiographs impart a dose of ionising radiation equivalent to an entire year of background radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Simple clinical tools to guide osteoporosis management within primary care have proven to be effective, as many (such as FRAX) are in common use in clinical practice today. Vfrac provides a targeted method of identifying those with existing VFF that could run alongside FRAX. The Vfrac decision tool has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.802 (95% CI, 0.764â0.840) and it identified 93% of those with more than one fracture and two-thirds of those with one fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Feasibility work is required before a large study can be designed to investigate the extent to which Vfrac improves the treatment of older people with osteoporosis. Specifically, this feasibility work will help assess the real-world clinical delivery and implementation of Vfrac and address key uncertainties around trial parameters including sample size required for the cluster design (based on numbers of women who attend their GP with backpain as well as an indication of the potential degree of clustering) and length of follow-up required (based on the time it takes from assessment to final management). It will also generate important information to understand the acceptability of Vfrac to healthcare professionals and patients and identify barriers, facilitators and contextual factors that impact on its implementation. In turn, this will help develop a series of recommendations to optimise the Vfrac tool and its delivery. Results from the second nested study will determine whether Vfrac can be used remotely, that is, as a self-completion tool or as part of a remote consultation. In addition, this feasibility study will assess whether appropriate data on resource use can be collected in a future clinical trial to provide a definitive estimate of the cost-effectiveness of Vfrac.</p>
              <p id="Par36">One of the limitations of this feasibility study is that the use of the Vfrac tool will only be evaluated in older women and the data collected would be confined to older women. Further work is being conducted as part of a separate study to determine whether the Vfrac tool can be used to identify vertebral fractures in older men with a similar success rate to older women. We will assess the level of agreement in Vfrac outputs obtained from face-to-face completion with a research nurse and self-completion by men. Semi-structured interviews will also be undertaken to determine if the Vfrac tool is acceptable to men. Another limitation of this study is the recruitment of only six general practices which will offer only limited data that does not account for UK-wide variability in consultation, management and healthcare use for back pain. Therefore, we will collect and analyse anonymized national data acquired from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to investigate UK-wide variability in consultation, management and healthcare utilisation for back pain in older adults. This will help understand what âusual careâ entails for older people with back pain and help plan future testing of the Vfrac tool.</p>
              <p id="Par37">A future parallel group cluster randomized trial will determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of Vfrac from the NHS perspective, compared with the standard care of older women with back pain. The stop/go criteria for a future cluster randomized controlled trial informed by this feasibility study will rely on a realistic required sample size (of up to 40 clusters), a realistic required length of follow-up (no greater than 15Â months), and evidence that the Vfrac tool is acceptable to healthcare professionals and patients.</p>
              <p id="Par38">In conclusion, this study is being conducted in preparation for a future definitive, cluster randomized controlled trial to fully evaluate the use of the Vfrac decision tool in improving the detection of VFFs in older women presenting to primary care with back pain. Outputs of this study will allow accurate evidence-led development, planning and funding of the future definitive evaluation of the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of Vfrac. If successful, national implementation of Vfrac is likely to identify more of the currently undiagnosed older women with VFFs. By appropriate interventions with medications that reduce their future fracture risk by 30â70%, implementation of Vfrac is likely to have a major benefit in reducing fracture risk within the older population. It would certainly change clinical practice for older women with back pain.</p>
