                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Does the early consumption of solids before 6 months of age influence infant sleep?</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial that included 1303 three-month-old infants randomized to early solids introduction vs exclusive breastfeeding, early solids introduction significantly increased sleep duration and reduced nighttime wakings and the reporting of very serious sleep problems.</p>

                  <p>The Enquiring About Tolerance study was a population-based randomized clinical trial conducted from January 15, 2008, to August 31, 2015, that included 1303 exclusively breastfed 3-month-old infants from England and Wales.

Following the early introduction of solids, infants in the EIG slept significantly longer and woke significantly less frequently than infants in the SIG. Differences between the 2 groups peaked at age 6 months. At this point, in the intention-to-treat analysis infants in the EIG slept for 16.6 (95% CI, 7.8-25.4) minutes longer per night and their night waking frequency had decreased from 2.01 to 1.74 wakings per night. Most clinically important, very serious sleep problems, which were significantly associated with maternal quality of life, were reported significantly more frequently in the SIG than in the EIG (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.22-2.61).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The British government currently advises all mothers to breastfeed exclusively for around the first 6 months of life.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, the proportion of mothers who achieve 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding is low at around 1% in the last Infant Feeding Survey undertaken in 2010, and three-quarters of mothers (75%) had chosen to introduce solids by the time their baby was 5 months old.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The UK Department of Health advises that infants be introduced to solids when they are ready. They also state that it is normal for infants to wake up in the night and that this is not necessarily a sign of hunger or an indication that solid foods should be introduced.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> If infants seem hungrier at any time before age 6 months, it is recommended that additional milk feeds are given.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>However, in the 2010 Infant Feeding Survey, the most common reason, given by 52% of respondents, for introducing solids before 6 months was the perception that their baby was no longer satisfied with milk feeds. Twenty-nine percent started introducing solids because they felt their infant was developmentally mature enough (able to sit up and hold food in his or her hand), but a similar proportion of mothers (26%) mentioned their baby waking up in the night as a motivation to begin introducing solids.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>It is a commonly held belief that introducing solids early will help babies sleep better.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, the choices website of the UK National Health Service states “Starting solid foods won’t make your baby any more likely to sleep through the night”<sup><xref rid="poi180019r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and the National Childbirth Trust leaflet “Introduction to Solid Foods” states “There is evidence that introducing solids does not affect the length of time babies sleep.”<sup><xref rid="poi180019r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The latter references the Davis Area Research on Lactation, Infant Nutrition, and Growth study, which was a small, nonrandomized study that assessed sleep (at ages 9 and 18 months), development, and nutrient intake in matched cohorts of 60 breastfed and 45 formula-fed infants.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Comparing the breastfed infants who had been introduced to solids before or after age 6 months, total sleeping time (day and night) at age 9 months was the same in those who had been introduced solids before and after age 6 months, and the age at solid food introduction was not related to the frequency of night feeds.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study is a large randomized clinical trial of 1303 infants that examined the effects of the early introduction of 6 allergenic foods from age 3 months as compared with infants encouraged to exclusively breastfeed until age 6 months and who were then introduced to allergenic foods at parental discretion.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Infants who were introduced to the 6 allergenic foods were allowed to consume nonallergenic foods as well. The study's primary hypothesis was that early introduction would prevent the development of food allergies to these 6 foods. As part of the study, a detailed validated sleep questionnaire was completed on 15 occasions between ages 3 months and 3 years. Therefore, the EAT cohort provides a unique opportunity to undertake a secondary analysis of sleep data to more definitively answer the question as to whether introducing solids results in improved sleep in infants.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Participants were randomized by simple randomization to the standard or early introduction group. The standard introduction group (SIG) was asked to exclusively breastfeed to around 6 months of age. The early introduction group (EIG) was encouraged to continue breastfeeding but also to introduce nonallergenic foods for the first week and then, while continuing these, to introduce 6 allergenic foods to their infant: cow’s milk, peanut, hen’s egg, sesame, white fish, and wheat. Full details are given in the eMethods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>.</p>
                <p>All families were sent an online questionnaire each month up to 1 year and then every 3 months until the child reached age 3 years. This recorded the frequency of food consumption (allergenic and nonallergenic) for both groups and included questions about breastfeeding frequency and duration.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The online questionnaires included a standardized tool for assessing infant sleep, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>), which asks about a child's sleep during the past week.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year interim questionnaires assessed maternal quality of life using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Quality of Life–BREF instrument.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This is a 26-item version of the WHO Quality of Life–100 and assesses 4 broad domains of quality of life: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>Analyses were undertaken using Stata, version 14 (Stata Corp), R, version 3.4.3 (R Foundation), SAS, version 9.4, and JMP, version 14 (SAS Institute). Longitudinal night time sleep (hours) was fit using linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept. Missing values were multiply imputed and modeled results were pooled across 100 imputed data sets. All model effects were linear except visit month, which was modeled using a flexible restricted cubic spline with 3 knots placed at the 0.10, 0.5, and 0.90 quantiles of the observed distribution of visit months, as recommended by Harrell.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> An average treatment effect was estimated over the entire study duration (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the age of a peak treatment effect was identified in a second mixed-effects complete case model in which an interaction term was included for assessment month (categorical variable) and randomized treatment assignment. Data were assumed to be missing at random. The mixed-effects model is known to give unbiased estimates when covariates associated with missing data and the outcome are included—this formed the primary basis for covariate selection. The covariates included were race/ethnicity, number of siblings, enrollment eczema severity (assessed with the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis score), hours of sleep at baseline, age at enrollment, and where and how the infant sleeps (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>). While the missing-at-random assumption is impossible to verify statistically, an analysis of missing data (eFigure 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) demonstrates that the intervention effect was consistent and stronger at the key assessments (12 months and 36 months) when the data were most complete (ie, 88% and 93% response rates, respectively). Furthermore, we asked a second statistician, who was not privy to the completed analyses, to independently conduct several modeling approaches to assess the robustness of our findings. The multiple imputation analysis results (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) and the sensitivity analyses (eTable 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>) are detailed in the eMethods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>. For the secondary outcomes, normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions were used to model sleep in hours, the presence of sleep problems, and the number of night wakings, respectively. A spatial power law correlation matrix was assumed for hours of nighttime sleep and number of night wakings. Last, a repeated-measures logistic regression model with an exchangeable correlation structure was fit after dichotomizing the presence or absence of participant reported sleep problems.</p>

However, while the introduction of allergenic foods before age 6 months in the SIG was minimal, most had introduced nonallergenic solids before this point, albeit significantly later than the EIG, and hence there was a broader distribution of age of solid food introduction within the SIG compared with the EIG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="poi180019f2">Figure 2</xref>). Shortly after age 6 months, infants in both groups were all consuming solids in essentially the same quantities, with no difference in any anthropometric parameter between the 2 groups when measured at age 1 year.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>

In the multivariable mixed-effects complete case analysis model, the EIG group experienced a mean (SD) of 9.1% (95% CI, 4%-14%) fewer night wakings over the duration of the study when compared with the SIG group in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (eFigure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>The differences observed in nocturnal sleep characteristics were not explained by the introduction of formula milk, which was minimal in both groups before age 6 months (see eResults in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-POI180019-1-s">Supplement 1</xref>). Responses to the generic Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire question of whether a family considered their child to have a sleep problem varied significantly by study group.

Mothers, anticipating improved infant sleep, could have reported better outcomes.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This potential bias could have been circumvented by assessing infant sleep by undertaking actigraphy, and not using actigraphy could be seen as a limitation of our study. However, to undertake actigraphy through to age 3 years (to match the data provided from the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire questionnaire which itself has been validated against actigraphy) was not feasible logistically or financially. It would have also imposed an unacceptable burden on the families.</p>
                <p>There are several reasons why we believe such a reporting bias is unlikely to explain these findings. Most importantly, the improvement in sleep was sustained throughout the first year of infancy and beyond. While it is plausible that mothers might overreport better sleep in the key early months (up to age 6 months), it seems very unlikely that beyond age 6 months, when both groups were consuming essentially identical quantities of solids, that this biased reporting would persist. Furthermore, the strong dose-response relationship seen not just in the key early months but through to 1 year and beyond, argues against this simply reflecting a bias.</p>
                <p>That the early introduction of solids before age 6 months should result in sustained sleep differences lasting beyond age 1 year, when both groups of infants would be consuming essentially identical quantities of solids, should not be unexpected. The Barker hypothesis, which evolved into the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, has a remit “to recognize the broader scope of developmental cues, extending from the oocyte to the infant and beyond, and the concept that the early life environment has widespread consequences for later health.”<sup><xref rid="poi180019r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> If fetal and infant nutrition can influence adult cardiovascular health, then it seems entirely plausible that sleep patterns established in early infancy can persist for several years.</p>
                <p>Consistent with the Barker hypothesis, infant sleep is also associated with other health outcomes. Studies in childhood have shown graded inverse associations between sleep duration and levels of adiposity, with increased sleep duration associated with lower levels of obesity<sup><xref rid="poi180019r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="poi180019r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and a recent British study has shown a strong inverse graded association in children between sleep duration, adiposity, and diabetes risk markers.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In the latter study of 4525 9- to 10-year-old children, a 1-hour greater sleep duration was associated with a 0.19 lower body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (95% CI, 0.09-0.28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 0.03 kg/m<sup><xref rid="poi180019r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> lower fat mass index (95% CI, 0.00-0.05 kg/m<sup><xref rid="poi180019r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>), 2.9% lower homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (95% CI, 1.2%-4.4%), and 0.24% lower fasting glucose level (95% CI, 0.03%-0.44%).<sup><xref rid="poi180019r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Our results confirm that poor infant sleep is strongly associated with parental quality of life. At age 6 months, when the ITT differences were most significant between the 2 groups, EIG infants were sleeping 17 minutes longer per night, equating to 2 hours of extra sleep per week, and were waking 2 fewer times at night per week. Most significantly, at this point, EIG families were reporting half the rate of very serious sleep problems. It is unknown over what period sleep differences need to be sustained to result in the changes in type 2 diabetes risk markers observed in the British study,<sup><xref rid="poi180019r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and while the differences observed in the study of British children were small at an individual level, at a population level they are likely to be of more significance.</p>
                <p>Sleep patterns at enrollment were associated with the likelihood of EIG participants adhering to the early introduction intervention. Infants who subsequently were adherent to the EIG regimen were sleeping significantly longer and had less night wakings at enrollment. It seems likely that infant maturity links the ability to consume solid food early and to have improved sleeping patterns. However, the ITT results indicate the improvement in sleep extends beyond differences in infant maturity at enrollment.</p>
                <p>The heaviest infants at enrollment slept the longest at night. Conversely, while it has been claimed that poor sleep and night wakenings in infancy are not related to hunger, we found that those infants with the highest weight gain between birth and enrollment were most likely to be waking at night. This is consistent with the idea that their rapid weight gain was leading to an enhanced caloric and nutritional requirement, resulting in hunger and disrupted sleep.</p>
                <p>Trials randomizing solid food introduction are scarce, and to our knowledge, no systematic reviews in this area exist. There has been 1 randomized clinical trial of feeding infants rice cereal in the bottle before bedtime at age 5 weeks or at age 4 months that did not show a statistically significant effect on sleep.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) collected sleep data in their cohort at age 6, 18, and 30 months. Parents recorded the amount of day and night sleep and the number of night wakings. Total sleep in ALSPAC was very similar to that in the EAT SIG, but night wakings at 6 months were much more common in EAT. This may reflect the clear differences in breastfeeding rates at age 6 months: in ALSPAC 31.7% of mothers were still breastfeeding as compared with 97.5% in EAT.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The differential questionnaire completion rate between study groups has the potential to bias the results, but a multiple imputation analysis suggests that bias due to missing data was unlikely to have influenced our results.</p>
                <p>We have shown previously that the EAT cohort is representative of the population in England and Wales because the study population was drawn from a wide geographical area.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We have also shown that within an ITT comparison, the early introduction of solids did not adversely influence the duration of breastfeeding in EIG mothers compared with SIG mothers.<sup><xref rid="poi180019r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A further strength of our study is that all mothers reported sleep patterns contemporaneously. The combined strengths of the number of participants in the EAT study, the highly significant ITT effect, and the enhanced per protocol effect shown in this analysis of sleep data demonstrate the robustness of the results presented. Additionally, the clear dose response between food consumption and better sleep indicates the biological plausibility of these results.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, we show for the first time in a randomized clinical trial setting that, consistent with the belief of many parents, the early introduction of solids does have a small but significant effect on sleep characteristics. With recent guidelines advocating introducing solids from age 4 to 6 months in some<sup><xref rid="poi180019r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or all<sup><xref rid="poi180019r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> infants, our results suggest that improved sleep may be a concomitant benefit.</p>
