                <p id="Par1">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 or CD22 have shown remarkable activity in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The major cause of treatment failure is antigen downregulation or loss. Dual antigen targeting could potentially prevent this, but the clinical safety and efficacy of CAR T cells targeting both CD19 and CD22 remain unclear. We conducted a phase 1 trial in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (<italic>n</italic> = 15) to test AUTO3, autologous transduced T cells expressing both anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 CARs (AMELIA trial, EUDRA CT 2016-004680-39). The primary endpoints were the incidence of grade 3–5 toxicity in the dose-limiting toxicity period and the frequency of dose-limiting toxicities. Secondary endpoints included the rate of morphological remission (complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) with minimal residual disease-negative response, as well as the frequency and severity of adverse events, expansion and persistence of AUTO3, duration of B cell aplasia, and overall and event-free survival. The study endpoints were met. AUTO3 showed a favorable safety profile, with no dose-limiting toxicities or cases of AUTO3-related severe cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity reported. At 1 month after treatment the remission rate (that is, complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) was 86% (13 of 15 patients). The 1 year overall and event-free survival rates were 60% and 32%, respectively. Relapses were probably due to limited long-term AUTO3 persistence. Strategies to improve CAR T cell persistence are needed to fully realize the potential of dual targeting CAR T cell therapy in B-ALL.</p>

              <p id="Par3">CD19 and CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown promising efficacy in relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, CD19-negative relapse is the predominant cause of treatment failure in patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells as a standalone therapy, occurring in 25–42% of responding patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Similarly, reduced CD22 antigen density at relapse was observed in a phase 1 study of anti-CD22 CAR T cell therapy, suggesting that escape by CD22 downregulation is also possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We reasoned that dual antigen targeting may prevent relapse given that a single leukemic stem cell is unlikely to downregulate both CD19 and CD22 simultaneously. Dual CAR targeting can be achieved in different ways: co-administration of two separate CAR T cell products (CD19 CAR T cells and CD22 CAR T cells), co-transduction of T cells with two vectors encoding the two separate CARs, transduction of T cells with a bicistronic vector encoding both CARs, or use of a tandem CAR. The optimal strategy is yet to be defined: each has its strengths and weaknesses and all are currently under investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Although co-administration or co-transduction allows for the combination of two single targeting vectors with minimal optimization, it results in a heterogeneous mixed product that has a more complex and costly manufacturing procedure. In contrast, bicistronic vectors encoding both CARs, and tandem CAR approaches are cheaper to manufacture and generate a more uniformed homogeneous product that ensures that every transduced cell has the ability to engage both targets.</p>
              <p id="Par4">We developed AUTO3, a CAR T cell treatment with dual specificity generated through transduction of autologous T cells with a bicistronic γ-retroviral vector encoding humanized anti-CD19 and CD22 CARs. Both CARs are in second-generation format and incorporate tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) co-stimulatory domains. The CD22 CAR functionality was further enhanced through the incorporation of a pentameric coiled-coil spacer from cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Pre-clinical experiments confirmed the ability of AUTO3 to target both double- and single-positive targets with superior in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity over a CD19 CAR with the FMC63 binder used in tisagenlecleucel.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Based on the results of the pre-clinical data, we designed a phase 1 clinical study with AUTO3 in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage ALL (AMELIA trial; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03289455">NCT03289455</ext-link>, EUDRA CT 2016-004680-39). Here, we report the pre-clinical experiments with AUTO3 together with the safety and efficacy results of this phase 1 clinical trial.</p>

                <p id="Par6">AUTO3 is a dual CAR T cell treatment generated through the transduction of autologous T cells with an RD114 pseudotyped, bicistronic γ-retroviral vector encoding a CD19 and CD22 CAR separated by a self-cleaving 2A peptide, transcribed from a single promoter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The CD19-binding moiety was derived from the HD37 antibody and targets a dominant epitope on the protein that is shared with other CD19-binding antibodies including FMC63; the CD22-binding moiety was derived from the LT22 antibody and targets the Ig-like C2-type 5 domain (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In an effort to reduce the immunogenicity of the AUTO3 product, both CD19 and CD22 binders were humanized in a process that maintained similar biophysical properties as the parental murine binders (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Pre-clinical validation of AUTO3.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, AUTO3 is a dual CD19 and CD22 CAR T cell encoded on a single bicistronic γ-retroviral vector under the same promoter.

                <p id="Par7">The TNFR co-stimulatory domains were used based on their ability to maintain engraftment of the CAR T cells compared with CD28 co-stimulation domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The CD19 CAR incorporates an OX40 co-stimulatory domain and the CD22 CAR incorporates a 41BB domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). OX40 has an analogous immune function to 41BB (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>) and utilizes similar downstream TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) signaling molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A comparison of CD19 CARs encoding either OX40 or 41BB co-stimulation domains showed equivalent function and upregulation of activation markers, with a more similar activated gene expression profile between OX40 and 41BB than compared with a CD28 encoding CAR (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par8">To enhance CD22 targeting, the CD22 CAR used the pentameric coiled-coil domain from COMP as a CAR spacer, which resulted in improved sensitivity to CD22 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Functional testing of AUTO3 showed specific killing of engineered cell lines expressing CD19 alone or CD22 alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In an in vitro experiment mimicking the emergence of CD19 antigen escape of a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, AUTO3 was capable of effectively killing, inducing interferon (IFN)-γ secretion and proliferating in response to CD19<sup>−</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> Raji targets (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p>

                <title>Superiority of AUTO3 over an FMC63-based CAR</title>
                <p id="Par9">When AUTO3 was compared with a CD19 FMC63-based 41BB-Z CAR used in tisagenlecleucel, AUTO3 showed enhanced cytotoxicity against CD19<sup>+</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> Raji cells in the in vitro co-cultures (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). When cytotoxicity assays were performed with increasing proportions of CD19<sup>−</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> targets, CAR T cells expressing an FMC63-based CD19 CAR showed progressive reduction in cytotoxicity whereas AUTO3 generated from the same donor highly effectively killed both CD19<sup>+</sup> and CD19<sup>−</sup> Raji targets (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In a NOD/SCID/ɣ (NSG) mouse CD19<sup>+</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> tumor model, AUTO3 demonstrated improved efficacy over the FMC63 CAR with equivalent persistence in the bone marrow (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Furthermore, this superior efficacy was maintained at lower, suboptimal doses of CAR T cells (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In a model recapitulating the loss of CD19 (CD19<sup>−</sup>/CD22<sup>+</sup> tumor), AUTO3 CAR T cells were able to stop tumor growth and reduce tumor burden and had a higher CAR T cell persistence in the bone marrow compared with the FMC63 CAR, which showed no improvement over non-transduced T cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>

                <title>Phase 1 trial with AUTO3</title>
                <p id="Par10">In the dose-finding portion of the AMELIA trial, pediatric or young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL (aged 1–24 years) were enrolled between 28 July 2017 and 10 June 2019 in three UK centers. Although originally planned, the adult cohort (aged ≥ 25 years) was not initiated. The initial study design included a phase 2 expansion cohort in the pediatric and young adult patient population to further evaluate AUTO3 efficacy. A study amendment in June 2019 included a phase 1 cohort for adult patients (at the highest dose level declared safe in the pediatric and young adult patient population). The study closure occurred before the end of the dose escalation phase. Study design and eligibility criteria are outlined in the Methods section.</p>
                <p id="Par11">The primary endpoints of the study were the incidence of grade 3–5 toxicity in the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period (30 d after AUTO3 infusion) and the frequency of DLTs. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving morphological remission (complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery) and having a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative response after AUTO3 infusion, as well as the frequency and severity of adverse events, the expansion and persistence of AUTO3, the duration of B cell aplasia, and overall and event-free survival.</p>
                <p id="Par12">A total of 23 patients were screened, a product was generated in 19 of 20 patients (95%) who underwent leukapheresis, and a total of 15 patients received infusion of AUTO3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Patients were followed up to a data cut-off of 1 June 2020, with a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 2–28 months). The median age was 8 years (range, 4–16 years) and the median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range, 1–4). One patient had previously received CD19 CAR T cell and blinatumomab therapy, while the remaining 14 patients were CAR T cell naive. Seven of 15 patients had relapsed following allogeneic stem cell transplant, and seven and eight patients were considered as having high-risk first relapse and second or greater relapse, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). AUTO3 CAR T cells were manufactured using a semi-automated process on the CliniMACS Prodigy. The median transduction efficiency was 17.7% (range, 8.6–39.3%) and the median vector copy number in the product was 0.55 per cell (range, 0.26–1.46 per cell). AUTO3 showed a predominantly effector memory phenotype, with a lesser contribution of central memory cells and a low expression of exhaustion markers in most patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CONSORT diagram and patient CAR T cell dosing.</title><p><bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>, CONSORT flow diagram (<bold>a</bold>) and the total AUTO3 dose and schedule (single versus split dose) for each patient treated with AUTO3 (<bold>b</bold>). Of the 20 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 15 received AUTO3 because two patients died, two discontinued due to progressive disease before the start of any study treatment and one AUTO3 final product was not released by quality control (<sup>†</sup>classified as manufacturing failure).

The frequency of DLTs was a primary endpoint of the trial. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Twelve of 15 patients (80%) developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at a median of 3 d (range, 1–12 d) after AUTO3 infusion.

Of the 13 patients who achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, the kinetics of initial AUTO3 expansion were similar to that previously described for tisagenlecleucel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> (mean C<sub>max</sub>, 46,717 versus 36,100 copies per μg DNA; AUC<sub>d0–28</sub>, 453,477 versus 315,000 copies per μg DNA in the patients who responded to AUTO3 and tisagenlecleucel, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">9b</xref>).

At the peak of expansion in the patients who received the highest dose, the expression of PD1 on CAR T cells was minimal, indicating that exhaustion was not the indicator for poor persistence in this cohort (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Furthermore, post hoc analysis of the CAR T cell memory phenotype showed that patients in the highest dose cohort of 4.3–5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per kg had a low level of CD4- and CD8-naive cells (median, 0.94% and 3.35%; range, 0.43–3.2% and 1.11–4.67%, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which might have resulted in the lack of persistency in this dose cohort.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par23">In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a bicistronic CAR T cell therapy (AUTO3) in a cohort of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL. Our data show no evidence of increased toxicity associated with dual antigen targeting despite 8 of 14 patients being treated in frank morphological relapse. Consistent with this, we found only modest elevations of IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α in a minority of patients compared with the approved FMC63 CD19 CAR T cell therapy. Importantly, the safety profile was consistent in the patients receiving a single or split dose of AUTO3, independently of the marrow tumor burden or the clinical status of the patients. Although the small sample size of patients receiving single (<italic>n</italic> = 12 patients) and split dosing (<italic>n</italic> = 3 patients) makes any comparison between both dose schedules very difficult, our data do not suggest that an AUTO3 fractionated dose could have prevented the incidence of CAR T cell-related adverse events. Studies with a bigger sample size, however, are needed to confirm this.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Although the higher dose level of 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per kg was not tested, the 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per kg dose is similar to the maximum dose range approved for tisagenlecleucel in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL with body weight ≤50 kg. And although our study used the Lee et al. scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> for grading CRS whereas the ELIANA trial used the University of Pennsylvania scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (which make a comparison between the two trials difficult), if we apply the University of Pennsylvania scale in the AMELIA study only one patient treated with AUTO3 developed grade 3 CRS, whereas in the ELIANA study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> 16 and 19 of the 75 treated patients developed grade 3 and 4 CRS, respectively. Similarly, no patients developed grade 3 AUTO3-related neurotoxicity compared with 10 of the 75 treated patients in the ELIANA trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, in which patients received a similar median CAR T cell dose of 3.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> per kg (range, 0.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>–5.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per kg), suggesting the favorable safety profile of AUTO3.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Thirteen of 15 treated patients responded to the treatment, regardless of disease burden, cytogenetic risk factors or the number of prior lines of therapy. High complete molecular response rates, similar to those seen with tisagenlecleucel, were observed in all dose cohorts. Of note, patient 7, who had 5.5% CD19<sup>−</sup>CD22<sup>+</sup> blasts before lymphodepletion, achieved molecular complete response, demonstrating the activity of the CD22 CAR.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Nine patients ultimately relapsed. Of these, eight had low CAR T cells at relapse (&lt;1,000 copies per μg) and five had detectable normal B cells in marrow aspirates. This suggests that the predominant cause of treatment failure was lack of sufficient long-term CAR T cell persistence. However, indications of CAR T cell modulation of the target antigen were observed. For instance, one patient who had mixed CD19-positive and -negative disease at treatment relapsed with CD19- and CD22-double negative disease, suggesting that the CD19-negative subclone outgrew and then modulated CD22 expression. A further patient relapsed despite having &gt;1,000 CAR T copies per μg and B cell aplasia. This patient relapsed with CD19-negative disease and dimming of CD22 expression, as previously described after CD22 CAR T cell therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It is thus possible that optimization of CD22 CAR recognition of low-antigen-density targets may be required to improve the efficacy of bispecific CARs in future studies. One further patient relapsed with CD19-negative disease without dimming of CD22 expression. In that case, CAR T persistence was low with return of normal B cells, perhaps indicating that an evolving antigen escape had been cut short by CAR T cell loss.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The reason for the reduced persistence of AUTO3 in our study is not fully established. Immune rejection is unlikely given the humanization of binding domains and the profound B cell aplasia observed after CAR T cell treatment. Also, in silico analysis predicted reduced immunogenicity when compared with the binding domain used in tisagenlecleucel (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The inability to detect CAR T cells on flow cytometry at later time points prevents assessment of whether dual signaling led to CAR T cell exhaustion. However, the complete loss of CAR T cells seen on quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 4 of 9 patients argues against this, and the infused products did not have an exhausted phenotype. We believe that the limited persistence of AUTO3 in vivo probably reflects the differentiated phenotype of the product in most patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which may in turn reflect the manufacturing methodology used. Data from both murine studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and integration site analysis after adoptive T cell transfer in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> suggest that long-term persisting T cells are derived predominantly from the stem cell-like memory T cell (T<sub>SCM</sub>) and central memory T cell (T<sub>CM</sub>) compartments of the infused product. Our own data suggest that this is also likely to be true after CAR T cell therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The lack of long-term CAR T cell persistence has also been observed in other approaches involving dual CD19 and CD22 antigen targeting with CARs. In the Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> study in which a cocktail of CD19 and CD22 CAR T cells were co-administered, persistence of both CAR T cell populations was short (median time to recovery of B cell hematogones, 4 months) and, consistent with this, 23 of 24 relapses were with CD19<sup>+</sup> CD22<sup>+</sup> disease, resulting in a 1 year progression-free survival rate (52.9%) similar to that seen with tisagenlecleucel alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Likewise, early data from the Seattle Pediatric and Young Adult Leukemia Adoptive Therapy (PLAT)-05 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> of T cells co-transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding CD19 and CD22 CARs and the Stanford–National Cancer Institute study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> using a CD19–C22 tandem CAR suggest that limited CAR T cell persistence makes the assessment of the effect of dual targeting on antigen-negative relapse challenging. Interestingly, in another phase 1 clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> with a bispecific CAR capable of simultaneously recognizing CD22 and CD19 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL and large B cell lymphoma, in contrast to our study, none of the relapses was associated with CD22 antigen loss or low expression, suggesting that potency toward the CD22 antigen was insufficient in this other dual targeting CAR construct. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of enhancing potency against the CD22 antigen and of CAR T cell persistence to maximize patient benefit from dual targeting strategies. A number of potential approaches are being studied to achieve this, including shortening the duration of manufacture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and incorporating small molecules such as AKT inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to favor retention of an early T<sub>SCM</sub>–T<sub>CM</sub> phenotype.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility and safety of dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 in ALL using bicistronic CAR T cells. Although the complete molecular response of patient 7 who had CD19-negative disease prior to CAR T cell therapy and the emergence of CD22-negative or -dim relapse in some patients confirms the activity of the CD22 CAR, the limited persistence of AUTO3 precludes assessment of the impact of dual targeting on relapse rates. AUTO3 did not seem to be superior to the approved CD19 CAR T cell therapy in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL. Dual CD19 and CD22 targeting resulted in a 1 year overall survival rate of 60% and an event-free survival rate of 32%, indicating a substantial clinical benefit of AUTO3 therapy in the relapsed or refractory B cell ALL setting. Nevertheless, strategies to further improve CAR T cell persistence and to further target leukemic clones expressing low levels of CD22 are needed to fully realize the potential of dual targeting CAR T cell therapy in B cell ALL.</p>

The HBSP+ buffer used for dialysis was filtered to 0.2 μm and used as the running buffer in BIAcore experiments. Sensograms were obtained by capturing an Fc-tagged single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or monoclonal antibody (ligand) on the surface of a CM5 chip pre-immobilized with anti-mouse antibody (Cytiva) or a protein A chip, to a density of 100–300 RU. Recombinant, purified CD19 or CD22 was used as the analyte and injected over the respective flow cells. In each experiment, flow cell 1 was unmodified and was used for reference subtraction. A 0 concentration sensogram of buffer alone was used as a double reference subtraction to factor for drift. Data were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Given that a capture system was used, a local R<sub>max</sub> parameter was used for the data fitting in each case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For competition binding assessment, purified recombinant FMC63 was covalently immobilized on a CM5 chip to 3,000 RU. Two analytes were injected at flow rates of 30 µl per min sequentially: the first contained recombinant CD19 with a C-terminal polyhis tag, while the second contained either a recombinant purified anti-CD19 scFv or an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Cytiva). Independent cycles were carried out using FMC63, HD37 and the anti-His antibody as the second analyte. Regeneration was carried out with 2.5 M glycine, pH 3.0, between each cycle.</p>

                        <p><bold>a)</bold> Competition for binding to CD19 between scFv proteins. FMC63 was captured as the ligand and injections of recombinant CD19 followed by FMC63 scFv, HD37 scFv or anti-His tag Ab were used as analyte (i). HD37 did not show interaction with CD19 bound to FMC63, indicating a shared or overlapping epitope. As expected, FMC63 was also unable to bind CD19, while the anti-His recognised a distinct epitope at the C-term of CD19. (ii) Determination of CD22 antibody binding epitope. LT22 was tested against various truncated variants of CD22. Binding was observed upon expression of Ig domain 5 indicating that the antibody targets this region. <bold>b)</bold> Humanisation of CD19 and CD22 binding domains does not affect binding kinetics in Surface Plasmon Resonance assay. Binding of Murine LT22 mAb (i), Humanised LT22 mAb (ii), Murine LT22 scFv (iii) and HuLT22 scFv (iv) to CD22. Binding of Murine HD37 mAb (v), Humanised HD37 mAb (vi), Murine HD37 scFv (vii) and HuHD37 scFv (viii) to CD19. i-viii) Black = reference subtracted sensograms; Red = sensogram fit with 1:1 Langmuir binding model. (ix) binding kinetic values for murine and humanized anti-CD19 mAb and scFv for CD19. (x) binding kinetic values for murine and humanized anti-CD22 mAb and scFv. <bold>c)</bold> Antibody humanness T20 score for the VH and Vk sequence of HD37, humanised HD37, LT22, humanised LT22 and FMC63 (i). A score &gt;85 is associated with a human sequence. Humanised HD37 and LT22 binders show improved scores, with values nearing or surpassing the humanness threshold. (ii) Prediction of Human MHC-I affinity (EC50) on HLA allele A*02:01 for scFv-derived peptides (8-14 aa). Red line = mean value of individual datasets. No significant average MHC-I affinity difference was determined for humanised HD37 (P = 0.3799) and LT22 (P = 0.9268) binders compared to their respective parental antibody (unpaired t-test). Significantly lower average MHC-I affinity was determined for both HD37 and LT22 (humanised and parental), compared to FMC63, suggesting reduced immunogenicity. One-way ANOVA (Dunnett post-test) *P = 0.0250 for FMC63 vs. LT22, *P = 0.0322 for FMC63 vs. HuLT22, **P = 0.0040 for FMC63 vs. HD37, **P = 0.0088 for FMC63 vs. HuHD37.
