                <p id="Par1">Primary aldosteronism (PA) due to a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma is a common cause of hypertension. This can be cured, or greatly improved, by adrenal surgery. However, the invasive nature of the standard pre-surgical investigation contributes to fewer than 1% of patients with PA being offered the chance of a cure. The primary objective of our prospective study of 143 patients with PA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02945904">NCT02945904</ext-link>) was to compare the accuracy of a non-invasive test, [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate positron emission tomography computed tomography (MTO) scanning, with adrenal vein sampling (AVS) in predicting the biochemical remission of PA and the resolution of hypertension after surgery. A total of 128 patients reached 6- to 9-month follow-up, with 78 (61%) treated surgically and 50 (39%) managed medically. Of the 78 patients receiving surgery, 77 achieved one or more PA surgical outcome criterion for success. The accuracies of MTO at predicting biochemical and clinical success following adrenalectomy were, respectively, 72.7 and 65.4%. For AVS, the accuracies were 63.6 and 61.5%. MTO was not significantly superior, but the differences of 9.1% (95% confidence intervalâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’6.5 to 24.1%) and 3.8% (95% confidence intervalâ€‰=â€‰âˆ’11.9 to 9.4) lay within the pre-specified âˆ’17% margin for non-inferiority (<italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.00055 and <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.0077, respectively). Of 24 serious adverse events, none was considered related to either investigation and 22 were fully resolved. MTO enables non-invasive diagnosis of unilateral PA.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Hypertension is a major cause of deaths from stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure and renal failure. The most common single cause of hypertension is primary aldosteronism (PA), accounting for 5â€“14% of all cases and 20â€“25% of treatment-resistant hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The cardiometabolic consequences of hypertension are approximately twice as likely in individuals with PA compared with age- and sex-matched individuals with essential hypertension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Traditionally, patients with PA are divided equally into those in whom aldosterone excess is due to a unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (APA), in whom surgical cure is possible, and those with bilateral production (often termed idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA)), who require long-term medical therapy. Although recent studies point to a continuum of disease between unilateral and bilateral subtypes, their distinction underpins the binary clinical decision of whether to remove one adrenal gland, and drives the investigations required to make this decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Current consensus is that patients with unilateral APAs should be offered laparoscopic surgical removal of that adrenal gland and those with IHA should be treated with aldosterone antagonist drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Despite the prevalence and penalty of PA, currently, fewer than 1% of patients are identified and fully investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Many reasons exist for this shortfall in clinical care, including: low levels of clinical suspicion; time-consuming and imperfect confirmatory biochemical tests that require discontinuation of many commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs; difficulties with patient selection for surgical intervention; and uncertainty about outcomes in patients hoping for surgical cure. The paradoxical consequence is patient and physician reluctance to embark on a diagnostic and therapeutic process with a high likelihood of major clinical benefit, and that often sub-optimal medical treatment remains the default for the overwhelming majority of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Molecular imaging has the potential to increase the number of patients with PA who can be fully investigated. The current criterion standard used to distinguish patients with APA from those with IHA is adrenal vein sampling (AVS)â€”an invasive, technically demanding procedure with restricted availability. Metomidateâ€”a methyl analog of the anesthetic agent etomidateâ€”is a potent inhibitor of CYP11B1 (11Î²-hydroxylase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), the final two enzymes involved in cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, respectively. Metomidate can be <sup>11</sup>CH<sub>3</sub> labeled and used as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer in combination with high-resolution computed tomography (CT) to detect adrenocortical tumors expressing these enzymes. A previous proof-of-concept study indicated that pre-treatment with dexamethasone for 3â€‰d before [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate PET-CT (MTO) scanning suppresses adrenal CYP11B1 (but not CYP11B2) protein expression, thus achieving in vivo selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This selectivity facilitates the detection of focal adrenal lesions with high [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate uptake due to CYP11B2 expression and separates them from normal adrenal tissue. International guidelines for the management of PA acknowledge the potential for molecular imaging in the subtyping of PA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but prospective outcomes-based data are needed to influence clinical practice.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The primary aim of this study, which we have termed MATCH (Is Metomidate superior to AVS in predicting ouTComes from adrenalectomy in primary Hyperaldosteronism), was to compare the accuracy of AVS and MTO in predicting the outcome from adrenalectomy in patients with PA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The diagnosis of PA, the protocol for and interpretation of AVS, and the biochemical and clinical outcomes after surgery were all assessed and conducted according to international consensus guidelines and/or statements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. MTO scanning was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and interpreted and graded before, and in ignorance of, the information provided by AVS. The design of the study also permitted the inclusion of a number of mechanistic secondary endpoints that have the potential to refine patient selection for surgery. These mechanistic endpoints included: a trial of aldosterone antagonist therapy (spironolactone or eplerenone) in predicting surgical cure; the influence of ethnicity and tumor genotype on surgical outcome; and the consequences of surgical and medical intervention on indices of cardiac injury and function, as determined by changes in amino (N)-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) levels and cardiac chamber dimensions on MRI.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study outline, hierarchical co-primary endpoints and CONSORT diagram.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Study outline. Patients with confirmed PA according to the Endocrine Society consensus guidelines underwent both AVS and MTO in random order. All patients were subsequently reviewed at a baseline visit and started on 50â€‰mg spironolactone, which was up-titrated to 100â€‰mg after 2â€‰weeks. The blood pressure response to spironolactone was recorded at 2 and 4â€‰weeks from the initiation of spironolactone. Eplerenone was used in those previously intolerant of spironolactone. Concurrently, the results of both investigations were reviewed at multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings where MTO was always reviewed first, followed by AVS. A score of high, intermediate or low probability of unilateral PA was assigned to each investigation. Recommendations for unilateral adrenalectomy were made if either investigation indicated a high probability of unilateral PA or, in a small number of patients, where both investigations indicated intermediate probability and there was a clinical indication for surgery (for example, because of drug intolerance or uncontrolled blood pressure). Note that the blood pressure response to spironolactone was not used by the MDT in the decision-making process for recommending adrenalectomy. <bold>b</bold>, Hierarchical co-primary endpoints.

              <p id="Par7">A total of 146 patients were recruited from endocrinology or hypertension clinics in three centers in the United Kingdom between 2 December 2016 and 11 September 2020. The final study visit was completed on 19 February 2021 and the data were censored on 26 February 2021 when the required number of patients (&gt;75) had primary outcome measurements following surgery. Further details on the study design and inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>. Patient flow is shown in the CONSORT diagram (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Because of the interruptions to elective surgery during 2020 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, primary outcomes were outstanding in six patients allocated to surgery in whom surgery and 6-month follow-up had not been completed by February 2021. The results are therefore presented for the 128 patients in the analysis set who had either completed primary follow-up from surgery (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰78) or enrolled for and been allocated to medical treatment in the same time period as the 78 patients who received surgery. The baseline data are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Of the 128 participants, 87 (68%) were male and 41 (32%) were female. The median age was 52â€‰years (interquartile rangeâ€‰=â€‰43â€“60â€‰years). Participants self-identified as one of the following ethnicities: 58% White, 30% Black, 11% Asian and 1% other. The proportions of individuals in the 128-patient analysis set (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were similar to those of the entire cohort, which includes those without primary outcomes (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                <title>Scoring of investigations</title>
                <p id="Par8">MTO and AVS graded 67/128 (52%) and 58/128 (45%) patients, respectively, as having a high probability of unilateral PA (indicating surgery). MTO and AVS were concordant in the diagnosis of unilateral disease in 39/128 (30%) patients, whereas 47/128 patients (37%) were diagnosed by one of MTO or AVS alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). In sum, 86/128 patients (67%) were scored as having a high probability of unilateral PA. It is apparent that this higher than usual proportion of patients was mainly due to the number in whom MTO was positive, over and above those diagnosed by AVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, two of the 86 patients lateralized to opposite sides on MTO and AVS.

The middle panel shows the accuracy of each investigation, expressed as a percentage. The accuracy for each investigation was calculated as the number of patients who were scored as having a high probability of unilateral PA by that investigation (purple and gold bars for MTO and purple and green bars for AVS) and who achieved success, minus the number of patients in whom the investigation failed to predict a cure. The percentages exclude from the denominator the three patients who underwent adrenalectomy based on two medium-probability scores, on the basis of clinical grounds. The right panel shows the difference between the accuracies of MTO and AVS and the 95% CI around the difference, plotted for each outcome. All four sets of CI intervals cross zero, indicating that neither investigation was superior to the other. None of the lower bounds of the CI intervals cross the pre-specified margin of âˆ’17%, indicating that MTO is not inferior to AVS.

In subsequent analyses of outcome, both MTO and AVS were scored as negative in these three patients and, being concordant, neither investigation was favored in the analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par10">In total, 78 patients had evaluable data 6â€‰months after surgery, of whom 77 achieved at least one of the hierarchical primary outcomes. Of the 78 patients with evaluable data, 69 (88%) achieved complete biochemical success and 24 (31%) achieved complete clinical success (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). All four PA surgical outcome (PASO) measures of success were as likely to be achieved whether patients were diagnosed by one or both of the investigations. This was apparent from comparing the proportion of patients predicted to have unilateral disease with the proportion of patients achieving success. For the primary analysis of the accuracy of each investigation, one point was assigned to one or both investigations if they correctly predicted success and to the other or neither investigation if they wrongly predicted success (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The Forest plot for the four sequentially analyzed primary outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) shows the differences in accuracy to favor MTO over AVS in correctly predicting biochemical and clinical success. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each difference crossed zero, excluding significant superiority for MTO. However, the lower bounds did not cross âˆ’17%. This was the pre-specified margin for recognizing non-inferiority, indicating that MTO is at least as accurate as AVS in predicting each of the biochemical and clinical outcomes from adrenalectomy.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Accuracy was influenced mainly by the proportion of true to false positive diagnoses, since adrenal glands were not removed from the patients in the medical group to validate negative diagnoses. Indeed, for estimation of false positive rates, we assumed that all patients assigned to medical therapy were true negatives (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Using the first of the four hierarchical outcomes (namely, complete or partial biochemical success), the true positive rate (sensitivity) was 55/74 (74.3% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰62.8 to 83.8%)) for MTO and 48/74 (64.9%; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰52.9 to 75.6%) for AVS. The false positive rates (1â€‰âˆ’â€‰specificity) were 2/42 (4.8% (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.6 to 16.2%)) for both MTO and AVS.</p>

We also wanted to establish whether leaving patients on spironolactone at the time of their MTO would prevent the detection of unilateral disease. Six patients underwent MTO scanning on two separate occasions: once having discontinued spironolactone (as part of the standard protocol) and on a separate occasion while taking at least 50â€‰mg spironolactone. The dose of spironolactone was not intended to achieve complete aldosterone blockade, but to reflect typical doses used in clinical practice. In five out of six patients, spironolactone did not change the scoring of MTO. In the sixth case, the MTO scan without spironolactone (the core protocol scan and the one used for analysis) was graded as a low probability of unilateral disease, whereas the scan performed while taking spironolactone indicated a high probability. AVS was concordant with the MTO results on spironolactone, as it too indicated unilateral PA. Post-adrenalectomy, this patient achieved complete biochemical and partial clinical success. Overall, there was no evidence that MTO performed while on spironolactone reduced the probability of detecting unilateral PA.</p>

                <p id="Par26">All 18 patients with <italic>KCNJ5</italic> mutations achieved clinical success, which was complete in 14/18 (78%) patientsâ€”an odds ratio of 10.4 compared with other patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Biochemical success was complete in 17 patients, the other one having the rare p.Glu145Gln mutation. In contrast, the odds ratio for complete clinical success in patients with <italic>CACNA1D</italic> mutations, which occurred in only 3/19 (16%), was 0.38, while they contributed to 7/10 (70%) absences of clinical success and 3/5 (60%) instances of only partial biochemical success.</p>
                <p id="Par27">These results posed the question of whether the driver of these opposing outcomes for the two most common genotypes was a difference in the syndrome of PA caused by the genotype, or the differences in age, sex and ethnicity associated with the genotype.

Conversely, <italic>CACNA1D</italic> genotype and ethnicity were difficult to separate as primary determinants of an absence of success. In a proportional odds model, in which all three clinical outcomes (complete, partial and absent) were considered against genotype, age, sex and ethnicity, only age was weakly significant, but the highest odds ratio, 7.84 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.24 to 55.96) was for the post-hoc comparison of <italic>KCNJ5</italic> versus <italic>CACNA1D</italic> genotype (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par29">Our principal finding is that MTO following pre-treatment with dexamethasone enables non-invasive detection of unilateral APAs and is at least as accurate in the prediction of outcomes from adrenalectomy as the standard, invasive investigation, AVS. The high proportion (almost two-thirds) of patients in whom we found and cured unilateral PA highlights the underdiagnosis in usual practice of unilateral disease. However, only 23/78 surgical patients achieved home blood pressure readings of &lt;135/85â€‰mmHg off all treatment. The mechanistic studies within MATCH have indicated how complete clinical success may, in the future, be predicted in advance of surgery, and why in the remaining patients an intervention to remove the source of autonomous aldosterone production may still be preferable to chronic medical treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In the 3â€“4â€‰years between the end of our proof-of-concept study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and the design of MATCH, experience of MTO in patients whose AVS had been non-diagnostic led to a hypothesis of superiority of MTO over AVS. However, clinical experience and retrospective analyses are susceptible to ascertainment and other biases. These potential study biases are avoided by conducting a prospective, within-patient comparison of both interventions, and MATCH also identified the probable source of clinical bias. More than one-third of patients in whom each investigation found unilateral PA were not diagnosed by the other investigation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This finding was unexpected and suggests that MTO and AVS might each be found to be falsely superior overall if tested in patients previously negative on the other test. In MATCH, there were many individual patients in whom MTO or AVS was superior in correctly predicting surgical success, but there was no overall superiority. Nevertheless there was a double dividend from finding so many patients who lateralized on only one of the tests. One was the higher than usual proportion of patients with PA who proceeded to adrenalectomy. The other dividend was that, in a within-patient study of categorical outcomes, it is the subset of patients with discrepant predictions by the two investigations who enable their accuracy to be compared. Low probability scores, in particular, by each investigation could only be evaluated if the other investigation in the same patient was scored as high probability and led to a surgical outcome. Both of these dividends increased our statistical power to discover differences in accuracy. After 2â€‰years, therefore, when it was apparent that MTO and AVS were detecting similar numbers of patients with unilateral PA, we added a meaningful non-inferiority hypothesis. Its lower bound of âˆ’17% was pre-specified in the formal protocol amendment, and at clinicaltrials.gov, and justified by the many clinical advantages of an entirely safe, non-invasive investigation, which is guaranteed to yield a same-day result, independent of operator skills.</p>
              <p id="Par31">[<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate has been available for more than two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, it has not entered routine clinical practice because, in studies that did not use dexamethasone, its in vivo selectivity for CYP11B2 was not apparent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In MATCH, we compared the in vivo uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate into APAs, non-aldosterone-producing adenomas and the adjacent adrenal, correlating with measurements of <italic>CYP11B1</italic> and <italic>CYP11B2</italic> expression of each region by quantitative PCR or RNA-seq. It was clear that the uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate is much lower in CYP11B1- than CYP11B2-rich regions of the adrenal (for example, see Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The main limitation of [<sup>11</sup>C]MTO is its 20-min half-life, which requires synthesis by an on-site cyclotron. <sup>18</sup>F ligands, with a 2-h half-life, are currently under evaluation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04529018">NCT04529018</ext-link>), with the potential for molecular imaging to become available in all PA centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par32">In the future, demand for intervention will outstrip supply as the proportion of PA diagnoses rises from &lt;1% to 10% and beyond. A secondary objective of MATCH was therefore to prospectively evaluate predictive measures of success, and to improve on the predictive power of univariate variables (young age, female sex and lower baseline blood pressure)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. A further aim was to harness improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of APAs and their phenotypes into clinical decision-making. These objectives led to the nested spironolactone study, and to the genotyping of almost all APAs and the measurement of particular urine steroid metabolites as a predictor of genotype. The 13-fold greater likelihood of achieving complete clinical success following surgery, if SBP on spironolactone was â‰¤135â€‰mmHg (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), probably reflects both the lower pre-treatment blood pressure in these patients and the contribution of aldosterone excess to this pressure.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The pre-specified molecular analyses build on the discovery of distinct genotypeâ€“phenotype patterns among the APAs, when the characteristics of either the APAs (for example, size, pathological appearance and transcriptome) or the patients (for example, age and sex) are compared between APA genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. At the same time, the conventional anatomical subtype division into unilateral and bilateral has become more blurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. So, the question arose as to whether some APA genotypes are more likely to be clearly unilateral, with others being asymmetric rather than unilateral. We are not the first to associate <italic>KCNJ5</italic> mutations with better clinical outcome following adrenalectomy, or with hybrid steroid excess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, the observation has not been uniform. In studies that are retrospective and/or in which the control group is wild-type APAs, it is more difficult to eliminate confounders, such as non-functioning adenomas masquerading as APAs, or to collect data of equal weight from all cases. The 78% complete clinical success rate for <italic>KCNJ5</italic>-mutant APAs, compared with 31% overall (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) and only 15% once <italic>KCNJ5</italic>- and <italic>GNAQ/CTNNB1</italic>-mutant APAs are excluded, is dramatic. Those achieving complete clinical success included males and females and older and younger patients. The paucity of young Black women with <italic>KCNJ5</italic>-mutant APAs in MATCH partially explains why our complete clinical success rate of 31% was at the lower end of the anticipated 30â€“60% range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The observation also makes it unlikely that good outcomes in patients with <italic>KCNJ5</italic>-mutant APAs are due to earlier detection of hypertension during obstetric or contraceptive consultations.</p>
              <p id="Par34"><italic>CACNA1D</italic> mutations are the dominant somatic genotype of APMs, which are the main site of aldosterone production in at least 30% of adult adrenalsâ€”even those of normotensive people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Unlike the discrete hotspots for somatic mutation in all other genes causing autonomous aldosterone production, &gt;60 mutations have been reported in <italic>CACNA1D</italic> since our first report of seven in 2013, with up to four different mutations in the same adrenal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. <italic>CACNA1D</italic>-mutant APMs may also underpin IHA, and before this paper, <italic>CACNA1D</italic> was already reported as the dominant mutation (rather than <italic>KCNJ5</italic>) in the APAs of Black male patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. We infer that the high rate of absence of success in Black patients may reflect asymmetric rather than unilateral PA, and this is presaged by a report of <italic>CACNA1D</italic> mutations in 6/10 APAs from Paris, whose removal did not cure PA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Some evidence from MATCH is that 4/5 patients who achieved partial biochemical success were Black. In these patients, renin levels remained suppressed despite aldosterone levels decreasing by &gt;75%, to &lt;300â€‰pmolâ€‰l<sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Conversely, <italic>KCNJ5</italic> mutations and the <italic>GNAQ/CTNNB1</italic> double mutations typically arise in solitary adenomas and are rarely seen in APMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To date, 16/16 double-mutant APAs have achieved complete clinical success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In most endocrine conditions, it is normalization of the culprit hormone that is the main goal of intervention, and in MATCH this was achieved irrespective of genotype. Furthermore, the large decrease in plasma NT-pro BNP adds weight to the recommendation for intervention as a means of cardiovascular protection (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although NT-pro BNP was a secondary outcome of MATCH, and is not included among PASO outcomes, it is important to recall that guidelines cite the substantially increased cardiovascular risk of PA, rather than difficulty in controlling hypertension, as the primary reason to recommend adrenalectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The failure of NT-pro BNP to decrease in the patients receiving medicine could suggest that aldosterone suppression is more effective than mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, with aldosterone able to stimulate non-mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. However, the allocation to surgical and medical management was not randomized, and this hypothesis should wait for formal randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing drugs in the aldosterone synthase inhibitor and mineralocorticoid antagonist classes.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Prospective studies in PA are rare, and all potential designs for MATCH had limitations. We drew on the experience of designing complex crossover trials of antihypertensive therapies that have influenced guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par37">A first limitation was that, by evaluating MTO against predicted biochemical and clinical outcomes (rather than against the criterion-standard investigation of AVS, as in our 2012 feasibility study), the accuracy of MTO could only be assessed in the surgical group. In practice, accuracy within these patients is more important than in the medical group since a wrongly removed adrenal cannot be restored.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Second, an RCT is often regarded as the gold standard, in which each patient has one or other intervention, but not both. However, an RCT would have been unlikely, in 2016, to stratify by ethnicity or the somatic mutations of yet-to-be diagnosed APAs. Most importantly, we would not have learned, in an RCT, that many APAs are diagnosed by only one of the investigations, and that consequently about one-third of patients going to adrenalectomy in each arm would differ by unknown factors. Conversely, a perceived limitation of within-patient studies is so-called carryover between interventions. As described in the <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, we were rigorous in always scoring the research intervention (namely, MTO) before the AVS result was revealed. In only seven patients did a composite interpretation lead to the multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision, and none of these cases could favor MTO or AVS: either the two investigations lateralized to opposite adrenals and surgery was, by protocol, deferred or both investigations scored medium and surgery was performed on clinical grounds.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Third, the study population in MATCH was more ethnically diverse than in previous studies, but our eligibility criteria might still have influenced the representation of different ethnic groups. The higher than usual number of patients (44%) who met the Endocrine Society trinity of high aldosterone, suppressed renin and hypokalemia, and the requirement for an abnormal adrenal on CT, potentially excluded patients with a milder phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the percentage of patients with hypokalemia was inflated by meticulous searching of patientsâ€™ hospital and primary care records for evidence of previous hypokalemia. Only 42 of all 143 recruited patients (29%) were hypokalemic at screening. Furthermore, our finding of fewer <italic>KCNJ5</italic> than non-<italic>KCNJ5</italic> mutations suggests that our eligibility criteria had minor influence, if any. APAs with <italic>CACNA1D</italic> mutations are typically smaller than <italic>KCNJ5-</italic>mutant APAs, so easier to miss on CT imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Yet, 30% of patients in MATCH were Black, of whom only one had a classical <italic>KCNJ5-</italic>mutant APA. Patients without an APA, whose unilateral PA is presumed due to APMs, would not be detected by MTO. Such patients, whose benefit from surgery is reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, will continue to have AVS if their CT is regarded as normal.</p>
              <p id="Par40">The final design question concerned the use of cosyntropin stimulation during AVS. The advantages and drawbacks of this are discussed in the Endocrine Society guidelines and expert consensus statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A debate in 2019 (too late to influence our design) found strong arguments both for and against the use of cosyntropin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The most contemporary papers have slightly favored cosyntropin use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, but in study design we were concerned more with consistency between centers than with whether cosyntropin or no cosyntropin was superior.</p>
              <p id="Par41">The primary objective of comparing the accuracy of MTO with AVS was limited to outcomes after adrenalectomy, using the PASO criteria for surgical success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These criteria have not been validated for medical outcomes. As a within-patient study, MATCH was not designed to compare overall medical and surgical outcomes between patients in whom only one of MTO or AVS detected a high probability of unilateral disease. It is theoretically possible that one of these two subgroups is higher risk and benefits more than the other from surgical intervention. It will be open to clinicians wishing to replicate MATCHâ€™s high probability of unilateral PA to undertake a second investigation in selected patients for whom surgery would be of high benefit:risk. However, we anticipate that the main impact of MATCH will be a gradual increase in the proportion of surgically to medically treated patients as molecular imaging becomes more available.</p>
              <p id="Par42">In conclusion, our study validates dexamethasone-suppressed MTO as a CYP11B2-selective investigation for lateralizing PA. MATCH shows that it will now be possible to diagnose unilateral APAs when AVS is either unavailable, unsuccessful or not desired by the patient. Unlike AVS, MTO is quick, safe and reliable. These advantages may attract more clinicians and patients to seek a diagnosis, especially if the <sup>18</sup>F analog becomes available and transportable to most hospitals with PET imaging facilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The longer-term impact of MATCH may be a reassessment of who undergoes lateralization and surgery, and a stimulus to decision-making by molecular, rather than anatomical, diagnosis. In this view, either surgery itself (a procedure usually undertaken for cure rather than prevention) or the counseling of patients to whom it is offered, will emphasize its success rate in patients with elevated hybrid steroid secretion and normal blood pressure on spironolactone. Conversely, patients advised of a &lt;1/10 likelihood of achieving complete clinical success based on demographics, steroid secretion and response to spironolactone may now prefer optimized medical treatment and/or to wait for nodular ablation if or when this is shown to decrease blood pressure, medication and plasma NT-pro BNP as much as surgery. When that time arrives, molecular imaging offers the potential advantages over AVS of localization as well as lateralization, given our examples of patients in whom the largest nodule on CT was not the [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate-avid, CYP11B2-positive adenoma.</p>

First, cannulation was considered successful if the cortisol level in each adrenal vein was â‰¥3Ã— greater than that in the iliac and/or infrarenal inferior vena cava. A high probability of unilateral PA was diagnosed if the aldosterone/cortisol ratio in one adrenal vein was â‰¥4 times that in the contralateral adrenal vein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. A low probability of unilateral PA was diagnosed with an aldosterone/cortisol ratio of &lt;3, which was indicative of bilateral aldosterone secretion. An aldosterone/cortisol ratio of 3â€“4 was considered intermediate. In the event of one or both adrenal veins not being successfully cannulated, the outcome was declared failed. Although in clinical practice it has been suggested that a focal right adrenal lesion in association with an aldosterone/cortisol ratio in a unilaterally cannulated left adrenal vein of less than half that of the infrarenal inferior vena cava/iliac vein can provide justification for a right adrenalectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, this was not adopted in MATCH.

                <p id="Par51">All patients received 0.5â€‰mg dexamethasone orally four times a day for 72â€‰h before MTO scanning. PET-CT imaging was performed on a GE Discovery PET/CT 690 scanner (GE Medical Systems). Non-contrast CT images were acquired over the adrenals (140â€‰kV; 30â€‰mA; slice thicknessâ€‰=â€‰3.75â€‰mm). Following an intravenous injection of [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate (mean: 215â€‰mBq; range: 86â€“289â€‰MBq), dynamic PET images were acquired for 30â€‰min at 30â€‰min after administration. The images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (ordered subset expectation maximization) using two iterations, 24 subsets and a Gaussian filter of 6.4â€‰mm. The reconstruction included time-of-flight, attenuation, scatter and decay corrections. The images were converted to standardized uptake values (SUVs; gâ€‰ml<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) by dividing the activity concentration in the image voxels (Bqâ€‰ml<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) by the injected activity per patient weight (Bqâ€‰g<sup>âˆ’1</sup>).</p>
                <p id="Par52">All MTO scans were analyzed and initially scored by a single experienced radiologist blinded to the AVS result. Three key features were used to determine the probability of unilateral PA: a focal adrenal nodule with Hounsfield units in keeping with a benign adrenocortical adenoma; uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]metomidate into the identified nodule; and, in keeping with our previous report, a calculated ratio of tumor maximum SUV (SUVmax) to normal background SUVmax of &gt;1.25 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). An opinion was formed on the basis of the presence or absence each of the three features described, and a score of high, intermediate or low probability of unilateral PA was assigned.</p>

                <title>Clinical decision-making</title>
                <p id="Par54">Each study patient was discussed in an MDT meeting attended by principal investigators, radiologists and a surgeon. The MTO scan was presented and interpreted by the reporting radiologist, always without previous knowledge of the AVS results. For each investigation, the question posed was: â€˜In the absence of any other information, would this result provide sufficient evidence for a referral for surgery?â€™. The MDT decision was not bound unconditionally to the criteria for diagnosis of unilateral PA as outlined above. The probability of unilateral disease could, by consensus, be reduced if data from the contralateral adrenal suggested bilateral disease (for example, adenoma in the contralateral adrenal with SUVmax higher than in the adjacent adrenal). Importantly, the agreed score for MTO was entered into the case report form before discussion of the AVS and could not be revised once the AVS results were revealed. The overall outcome of the MDT was a recommendation for either surgical or medical management. Surgery was recommended if either investigation was scored highly. In a small number of patients for whom both investigations indicated an intermediate probability of unilateral PA, surgery was recommended if there was a strong clinical indication to proceed. A decision for recommending surgery was deferred if MTO and AVS showed discordant results (lateralized to opposite sides). Such participants (two in total) were managed medically with a view to reviewing the results at the end of the study, when recommendations for surgery would be based on the outcomes from the study.</p>

Obtaining the baseline measurements at this point in the study allowed a maximum interval between the discontinuation of any interfering medicines being taken at screening and the opportunity for the blood pressure response to initiation of spironolactone to be assessed as a predictor of response to surgery.</p>
                <p id="Par56">After 4â€‰d of home blood pressure recordings (three readings twice daily; 24 in total), blood was drawn for electrolytes, renin activity and/or renin mass, aldosterone, NT-pro-BNP and troponin. On the rare occasion that the minimum number of home blood pressure recordings was not available, office blood pressure recordings (an average of three sequential readings) were used instead. Participants also performed a 24-h urine collection for urine steroid profiles. Participants then commenced spironolactone 50â€‰mg once daily for 2â€‰weeks, increasing to 100â€‰mg once daily depending on side effects and any concerns about renal function or potassium homeostasis. The response to spironolactone was recorded at 2 and 4â€‰weeks after initiation of spironolactone with both home and office blood pressure recordings. Patients unable to tolerate spironolactone were treated with 25â€‰mg eplerenone twice daily for 2â€‰weeks, increasing to 50â€‰mg twice daily.</p>

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy, using standard operative techniques, was performed by a single endocrine surgeon at two of the participating sites, unless the patient or referring physician preferred local referral. The serum cortisol value at the conclusion of the 72-h preparatory dexamethasone before the MTO scan was used to guide the clinical concern about potential post-operative adrenal insufficiency. Where appropriate, supplementary hydrocortisone was provided and withdrawn after subsequent clinical and biochemical reassessment. The outcomes from surgery were assessed biochemically and clinically at 3 and 6â€‰months after surgery, and at 12 and 24â€‰months in patients recruited in earlier years of the study. At each visit, the same measurements were performed as at the baseline visit, except that NT-pro BNP, troponin and 24-h urine measurements were repeated only once, at the 6-month post-surgery visit.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par59">Primary outcome measures were assessed at 6â€‰months post-surgery or after 9â€“12â€‰months of medical therapy. The primary objective of MATCH was to compare the accuracy of MTO and AVS in diagnosing unilateral PA, by measuring normalization of biochemical and clinical parameters following adrenalectomy. The criteria for normalization were the PASO criteria, agreed by international consensus in 2017 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) for each of partial or complete biochemical and clinic success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Since the rank order of partial and complete success of PA and hypertension could be assumed (with more patients achieving biochemical than clinical success), prospective studies in PA lend themselves to hierarchical analysis of each PASO outcome, in which all four are primary outcomes without needing to adjust for multiple statistical comparisons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). It is important to note that, whereas partial success may seem a softer version of complete success (either clinical or biochemical), it measures different parameters. Partial responses are changes in biochemistry, blood pressure and the defined daily dosage of medications, while complete responses are numbers below an absolute target. Of note, the first outcome in the hierarchyâ€”partial biochemical successâ€”is the sole outcome driven by reduction in the culprit hormone, aldosterone, to which excess cardiovascular risk in PA is attributed.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Secondary objectives of MATCH included serial measurements, up to 2â€‰years post-intervention, of the criteria for assessing biochemical and clinical success, analyzed separately in the surgically and medically treated participants, and analyses of parameters that may, in the future, enable more reliable prediction of which patients can achieve complete clinical success post-adrenalectomy. The main clinical test was a within-trial measurement of participantsâ€™ responses to 4â€‰weeks of treatment with spironolactone. Molecular analyses included RNA-seq of APAs for genotyping and transcriptomics. We also report the left ventricular mass and end diastolic volume measurements from the CMR sub-study of 50 patients, performed at baseline and 1â€‰year after surgical or medical management.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par61">The primary analysis was a comparison of the accuracy of MTO and AVS. Each test was deemed accurate if it recommended surgery and surgery resulted in a cure (according to each PASO criterion), or if the test did not indicate surgery and surgery did not result in a cure. Since surgery was almost exclusively undertaken when one or both tests indicated that surgery was required, for those patients for whom neither test indicated surgery, both tests were treated in the analysis as having equal accuracy. Only in those patients for whom the two tests gave conflicting recommendations was it possible to determine which of the two test was accurate and which was not.</p>
                <p id="Par62">The difference in accuracy between the two tests was estimated among those who underwent surgery using the Newcombeâ€“Wilson score method for paired binary data and tested using an exact McNemar test.</p>
                <p id="Par63">The sample size for the study was estimated from a table of all permutations of outcomes from each investigation and surgery, in which the frequency of each outcome reflected experience at participating centers (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). This estimated a need for 128 completed patients, with half undergoing surgery and half of those (32) doing so as the result of one of MTO or AVS, but not both. This sample size was based on having 90% power at a 5% significance level to detect a difference in accuracy between the two tests, assuming that on those occasions when only one of the tests was accurate, it would be MTO that was accurate 80% of the time. An initial sample size of 142 patients was defined, allowing for a 10% dropout rate, anticipated to be patients who declined either to have both investigations or to proceed with surgery even if lateralized.</p>
                <p id="Par64">The sample size was revised in November 2019 when it became apparent that the use of two investigations increased the proportion of participants with detectable unilateral PA, from the expected 50% to 66%. The dropout rate was much lower than 10%. The resulting smaller proportion of participants managed medically risked inadequate power for several secondary analyses (comparison of baseline characteristics and outcomes in the surgical and medical groups, and whether outcomes were sustained with time). The recalculated overall number of recruits anticipated to maintain the size of the medical group, and duration of follow-up, was 150. Still allowing for a 10% dropout rate, the revised total sample size was calculated to be 165.</p>
                <p id="Par65">Rather than reduce the margin of superiority of which increased numbers would permit detection, the larger sample size permitted declaration of a non-inferiority margin. A total of 150 completed patients, with at least 75 proceeding to surgery, would have 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of MTO versus AVS within a non-inferiority margin of âˆ’17%. The addition of this non-inferiority margin is specified in the protocol and statistical analysis plan and was published on clinicaltrials.gov after approval by the Dulwich Ethics Research Committee and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.</p>
                <p id="Par66">We had a qualitative and quantitative basis for the 17% margin. Regulatory advice is that bounds in equivalence and non-inferiority studies reflect â€˜the largest difference that is clinically acceptable, so that a difference bigger than this would matter in practiceâ€™<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. MATCH compared a 100% safe non-invasive procedure with (in principle) 100% technical success (no operator dependence) and an invasive procedure that requires a day off work, causes severe pain and hospitalization in 1â€“3% of patients, is available with a &gt;50% success rate in few hospitals, and in all but the best exposes patients to potentially 5Ã— more radiation than MTO when adrenal veins are difficult to locate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. If MTO were the established procedure, and AVS were the innovation, regulators would require much higher (&gt;17%) accuracy for AVS than MTO to justify all of the downsides of AVS. In a numbers-needed-to-treat analysis, one in every six patients correctly diagnosed by AVS would need to be wrongly diagnosed by MTO. If the numbers needed to treat were larger than six (superiorityâ€‰â‰¤â€‰17%), the downsides of AVS would be too great for approval.</p>
                <p id="Par67">The full analysis set was defined as all patients who had both investigations. Because of pandemic-associated interruptions to the study, particularly the availability of laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the study was censored when more than 75 patients had undergone surgery and at least one evaluable outcome visit. The analysis is reported for the 128 patients who had reached a primary outcome visit either 6â€‰months post-unilateral adrenalectomy (including five for whom data from their most recent, 3-month visit was carried forward) or 9â€“12â€‰months after their baseline visit in the medically treated patients.</p>
                <p id="Par68">A benefit of the delayed completion of MATCH was that the 25-participant extension could be revised to include a within-patient comparison of MTO and AVS with an <sup>18</sup>Fluoro analog of metomidate (<sup>18</sup>F-CETO), which had recently completed phase 1 evaluation.

                <p id="Par70">Groups were initially compared using Fisherâ€™s exact test or Kruskalâ€“Wallis test, as appropriate. Linear, binary logistic or proportional odds logistic regression models were then used, adjusted for age and sex. These models were extended to investigate other predictors of outcome after surgery, in the subset of patients who underwent surgery. There was particular interest in blood pressure at baseline and 4â€‰weeks, age, sex, ethnicity, the number of classes/defined daily dose of antihypertensive medications at baseline, tumor genotypes and immunohistochemical classification, contralateral suppression, numbers of nodules, blood biomarkers, SUVmax and the 24-hour urine steroid profile.</p>
                <p id="Par71">For each of the primary outcomes, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the impact of including patients for whom AVS was classified as failed. A bootstrap procedure was applied, sampling with replacement from the 78 patients who underwent surgery. Sampling was stratified by whether AVS was successful or failed. For each sample, the estimated difference in accuracy between MTO and AVS was calculated for the combined sample of 78 patients and for the 67 patients for whom AVS had not failed, and the difference between these estimated differences was taken as a measure of the sensitivity of the overall result to the inclusion of AVS failures. One million replicates were drawn and a 95% CI was derived by the percentile method. If the 95% CI excluded zero, the overall result was judged to be sensitive to the inclusion of AVS failures. If the 95% CI included zero, the results were judged to be insensitive to the AVS failures.</p>

The scans were graded blinded to the knowledge of spironolactone status and compared. The sub-study was the same size as that which validated dexamethasone pre-treatment in our 2012 study, and slightly larger than the number of patients (four) in whom 25â€‰mg spironolactone was reported to cause only slight de-suppression of plasma renin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p>

The generated angiotensin I was measured by RENCTK 125I competitive radioimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin) with blank subtraction of angiotensin I levels in aliquots incubated at 4â€‰Â°C. From 3 February 2017, the renin activity was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (North West London Pathology).

The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome using the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform. BAM files were generated as a result of this step. Somatic variants were called using the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform in somatic mode. Paired normal samples were used in the process, if provided, or a panel of normal was used to remove technical artifacts. Variants were further filtered and any variants in the following categories were considered false positives and removed: (1) marked as common variants in dbSNP build 151; and (2) non_cancer_ACâ€‰&gt;â€‰5 in the gnomAD exome database r2.1.1. The filtered VCF was then annotated with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor version 95. For each variant that was mapped to the reference genome, all overlapping Ensembl transcripts were identified and the effects that each allele of the variant may have on each transcript were predicted by Variant Effect Predictor. The set of consequence terms was defined by the Sequence Ontology. The most severe impact was selected for each variant and they were used for downstream cohort analysis. The impacts of the variants were classified based on MAF document specifications. The tumor mutation load was calculated based on the number of mutations in the genome region that was targeted.</p>

In brief, steroids were deconjugated from their sulfate and/or glucuronide conjugates through enzymatic hydrolysis with <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich; 60â€‰Â°C for 3â€‰h). The steroids were then extracted via solid-phase extraction (C18; 100â€‰mg; Biotage). The methanol eluent was collected and evaporated and the extract was reconstituted and run by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer was a Waters Xevo TQ-XS with an Acquity ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography system, with an electrospray source in positive ionization mode with a methanol and water gradient system (both with 0.1% formic acid). The gradient started at 30% methanol, linearly increasing to 39% over 6â€‰min. Next, the column was washed at 98% methanol and re-equilibrated before the next injection. Separation was achieved on a Waters HSS T3 1.2 Ã—â€‰50â€‰mm 1.8â€‰ÂµM column. With each batch of samples, a calibration series (0â€“1,500â€‰ngâ€‰ml<sup>âˆ’1</sup>), three spiked quality control samples and seven pooled biological control urine samples were extracted. Steroids were quantified relative to their deuterated internal standard cotisol-d4 or 18-hydroxycortisol-d4, against this calibration series. In addition to previously published methods 18-hydroxycortisol (18OHF) was included in this method. Bias (percentage deviation), calculated as the accuracy at three spiked concentrations (20, 300 and 200â€‰ngâ€‰ml<sup>âˆ’1</sup>) was &lt;5% for cortisol and &lt;10% for 18OHF at all concentrations.
