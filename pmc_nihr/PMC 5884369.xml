                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Patients can develop trismus from their head and neck cancer or as a result of treatment. Trismus affects the jaw muscles and makes mouth opening difficult. To potentially combat trismus, patients could undertake proactive jaw stretching exercises prior to, during and after radiotherapy, although currently these are not the standard of care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a randomised, open-label, controlled, two-centre feasibility study, to assess the objective and subjective effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of therabite use compared with wooden spatula in ameliorating trismus in patients treated for stage 3 and 4 oral and oropharyngeal cancer, managed either by primary surgery followed by (chemo)radiotherapy or primary (chemo)radiotherapy. The principal objective assessment is measurement of maximum jaw opening. Assessments in all cases will be performed preradiotherapy and again at 3 and 6 months postintervention.</p>
                  <p>Secondary aims of the study will be (1) to assess whether therabite or the wooden spatula intervention improves patients’ quality of life, (2) reduce the level of post-treatment clinical management/healthcare use and (3) a nested qualitative study will explore the experience of the patient taking part in the intervention; data will be transcribed verbatim and analysis will be based on content analysis methods using the interview questions as the framework for examination.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patients with head and neck cancer can experience a variety of complications following surgery and/or radiation/chemoradiation, including limited mouth opening or trismus.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Trismus will affect the ability to chew food, speak coherently, brush completely the lingual or palatal surfaces of the teeth, have routine dental assessment and oral examination to detect possible cancer recurrence. This can lead to malnutrition and lack of energy, chronic periodontal disease, caries, dental integrity with risk of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref> These patients may also suffer from lack of intimacy due to lack of kissing function, lack of self- esteem, depression, suicide tendencies and altered body image with nearly 60% of patients feeling discounted or stigmatised because of their cancer-related appearance.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Only a few studies exist in which the effects of interventions on trismus have been investigated. Buchbinder conducted a randomised clinical trial (RCT) with 21 patients who had radiation-induced trismus. At the end of the 10-week period, the group of patients using the therabite system (n=7) had shown the greatest improvement (mean of 13 mm), while the group using tongue depressors (n=7) only showed a modest improvement of less than 5 mm on average.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Maloney conducted a RCT with 46 patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disease comparing the use of therabite and an intraoral appliance (n=17), the use of tongue depressors in combination with an intraoral appliance (n=12) and an intraoral appliance only (n=17). It showed that patients using the therabite experienced increased mobility and decreased pain compared with the group using intraoral appliance alone.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Cohen studied the use of therabite in the early postoperative management of trismus in only seven patients who had surgical treatment and reconstruction for head and neck cancer. The authors report that the use of therabite increased the range of motion and decreased pain in both muscle and joint disorders.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Finally, a systematic review carried out by McNeely <italic>et al</italic> on the effectiveness of physical interventions for TMJ disorders concluded that the results support the use of active and passive oral exercises as effective interventions to reduce trismus.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This handful of studies shows that the use of therabite after radiotherapy and/or surgical treatments can improve maximum mouth opening, but some publications had not used a control group with which to compare maximum mouth opening readings. Also, all studies had small sample sizes and power calculations were not reported.</p>

                <p>The cohort will comprise previously untreated patients with stage 3 and 4 oral and oropharyngeal cancer managed either by chemoradiotherapy or surgery followed by (chemo)radiotherapy. Disruption of the TMJ, the pterygoid muscles or the masseter muscle is likely to result in trismus, and hence patients having surgery or radiotherapy in the vicinity of these joints/muscles will form the sample of this study.</p>
                <p>The inclusion of patients in stages 3 and 4 comes from the evidence that T3/4 patients are most likely to develop trismus.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The use of the therabite may prevent deterioration by maintaining or improving range of movement.</p>

The suggested improvement in jaw function comes about via a combination of stretching of connective tissues, mobilisation of joints and strengthening muscles across their full range of motion. Patients will be trained on the safe use of therabite or wooden spatula and recording procedure prior to commencement of primary chemoradiotherapy or after primary surgery. This at their prechemoradiotherapy assessment day, whichever visit is more convenient for the patient.</p>

</p>
                <p>This regime has been selected after consultation with Platon medical who manufacture the equipment and has worldwide experience of using the device. The importance of motion in the rehabilitation of patients with mandibular hypomobility is also supported by the literature. Israel and Syrop’s review highlights the point that the TMJ is a synovial joint and as such functions as the same as other synovial joints in the body. Therefore, lack of mobility of the TMJ may lead to restrictions in maximum mouth opening fairly rapidly.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                <p>Patients will commence therabite use approximately 3/4 weeks postsurgery.

The cost analysis will be performed from the perspective of the health service provider and from a societal perspective. Included in the healthcare provider costs will be those accrued by the acute trusts. Costs to the patients and their families, including social care, will be considered as the additional costs for society. It will be in the form of a structured interview documenting which healthcare professionals the patients have visited. Structured interview will take place at the 3 months and 6 months postintervention, covering the previous 3 months. Patients will also be asked which secondary healthcare services they have been referred to. Such services may include speech and language therapy, dietary and nutritional advice and/or artificial feeding and orthodontic interventions including surgery. Patient notes will be also be audited; however, as records may not always be complete, patient interviews are deemed to be a more accurate assessment of use of healthcare resources. Study patients will be monitored and any clinical interventions recorded. An estimate of costs of interventions will be made, an average cost per patient calculated, and this will be compared between study and control patients.

Telephone interviews will be conducted with patients in their own home by the researcher RL within 3 months of completing the exercise regime and will explore the experience of the patient taking part in the intervention, any issues that participants found difficult during the intervention, any problems with the therabite or wooden spatula and the mouth exercises, issues around compliance with the protocol or interference of the intervention with their lives and whether pain has been an issue in their compliance with the intervention. Hence, these interviews will aim to explore any practical issues that make the delivery of the intervention less feasible to control or consider such variables in a future phase III trial.

                <p>Since we are measuring the difference within each patient from their baseline to 6 months postintervention, we are not going to adjust for gender or dentate state (each person acts as their own control). This pilot will give us information on whether we need to adjust for these in a future phase III study. From published literature, we estimated that the SD of the differences in each of the treatment groups could be as high as 10 mm being the worse case scenario.</p>
                <p>In our prevalence study,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> median mouth opening was 40 mm when the patient could chew as well as ever, 30 mm when soft solids could be eaten but some foods could not be chewed and 24 mm when even soft solids could not be chewed. We estimate that if we want to detect a minimum of 5 mm improvement from the background difference, which is our control arm (no intervention), the common SD is 8 mm (patients that have had no intervention and have had radiotherapy). Based on our prevalence study data, if we wish to detect a difference between the two arms of 5 mm change with an SD of 8 mm with 80% power, we would require 42 cases per group. With an additional 25% attrition rate (as we have seen in our prevalence study), 112 patients will be required.</p>

On average, Christie and Aintree Hospital will see 1000 patients with head and neck cancer a year. Of these, approximately half will be oral and oropharyngeal patients. Of these 500 patients, 60% will be stage 3 and 4, giving a potential pool of 300 patients. Of these, 100 may not be suitable on account of clinical factors.</p>

The need for lengthy and expensive operations to try and correct trismus can also be reduced and patients may see improvements in all aspects of quality of life.

                <p>The research team consisting of six members will form the basis of the trial management group and will meet formally every 2 months to assess progress of the project against agreed milestones, present results and address any delays or problems. An independent monitoring committee will not be formed as there is no drug involvement and no risk to patients entering this study. The trial will be monitored by the Christie Trials Coordination Unit on the basis of a trial risk assessment.</p>

                <title>Compliance issues and loss to follow-up</title>
                <p>Melchers indicated that pain due to radiation-induced mucositis had a negative effect on adherence when using the therabite device. Other factors such as anxiety, ill-fitting therabite pads and the lack of goal setting during treatment also had a negative effect.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Our intention is to monitor for these symptoms/problems during the patients’ course of treatment and manage accordingly. Compliance of each intervention will be monitored using a patient log book and allow us to calculate the compliance rate. Such a log book has been used in a previous trial from our team based at The Christie, examining the tolerability of Manuka honey for oral mucositis. Compliance will be enhanced by identifying key factors and addressing them during the study (ie, setting up with patients a clear goal from the exercise, addressing oral pain more effectively to allow exercises to take place, provide patients with reminders particularly as the time from enrolment increases).</p>
                <p>In other studies of non-pharmacological interventions, we have carried out with this population, attrition from all reasons has been around 25% including death and recurrence within the 6 months follow-up.</p>

In keeping with previous clinical research by the authors, we intend to present at national and international meetings, such as the British Association of Head and Neck Oncologists, International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Quality of Life conferences in Head and Neck Cancer. Efforts will be made to update web-based information sites with the outcomes of our study including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.mouthcancerfoundation.org">www.mouthcancerfoundation.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.headandneckcancer.co.uk/Hospitals">www.headandneckcancer.co.uk/Hospitals</ext-link>. All these efforts are aimed at giving patients with head and neck cancer with this debilitating condition, some hope that a scientifically robust study is aimed at helping them improve their overall quality of life.</p>
