                  <p id="Par1"><italic>Point OutWords</italic> is a caregiver-delivered, iPad-assisted intervention for non-verbal or minimally verbal children with autism. It aims to develop prerequisite skills for communication such as manual and oral motor skills, sequencing, and symbolic representation. This feasibility trial aims to determine the viability of evaluating the clinical efficacy of Point OutWords.</p>

                  <title>Methodology</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We aim to recruit 46 non-verbal or minimally verbal children with autism and their families, approximately 23 per arm. Children in the intervention group will use Point OutWords for half an hour, five times a week, for 8 weeks. Children in the control group will have equal caregiver-led contact time with the iPad using a selection of control apps (e.g. sensory apps, drawing apps). Communication, motor, and daily living skills are assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Parents will keep diaries during the intervention period and will take part in focus groups when the intervention is completed.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Point OutWords was developed in collaboration with children with autism and their caregivers, to provide an intervention for a subgroup of autism that has been historically underserved. As autism is a heterogeneous condition, it is unlikely that one style of intervention will address all aspects of its symptomatology; the motor skills approach of Point OutWords can complement other therapies that address core autistic symptoms of social cognition and communication more directly. The current feasibility trial can inform the selection of outcome measures and design for future full-scale randomised controlled trials of Point OutWords and of other early interventions in autism.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Designing and testing interventions targeting communication skills in children with autism has proven difficult given its heterogeneous presentation and the lack of measures sensitive to change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], yet substantive progress has taken place in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] is effective but not routinely provided in most jurisdictions as its labour-intensive nature presents an economic barrier. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] recommend a combination of social skills groups, occupational therapy and speech/communication therapy, with most children receiving just 6–8 sessions. The most successful treatment studies have targeted children’s socially engaged imitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or parents’ evocation of children’s communicative behaviours, producing long-term social communicative improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but often at significant economic cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and without effectiveness for all children. The Early Start Denver Model intervention combines principles of ABA with adult responsivity and sensitivity to child cues, and has demonstrated effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], although the only domain of improvement replicated across studies is language, and not developmental quotient, autism severity, or adaptive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Alternative or complementary approaches to autism therapy are the several unproven, uncontrolled and in many circumstances invalid parent-delivered methods of manual motor symbolic communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These demand extensive training for those who implement them, are labour-intensive, and can be difficult to subject to controlled testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our novel intervention trains manual motor skills and symbolic representation and is facilitated by our freely downloadable iPad app, Point OutWords™ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], yielding light caregiver training - just 30 min by a research assistant with a 4-page instruction booklet. Built into Point OutWords are automated measures of motor performance, and of any caregiver-initiated movements of the device that might cue particular responses.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Our research and that of others has demonstrated strong association between language delay and motor dysfunction in a significant subgroup of autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In our own clinical sample, fully one third of autistic children who lack communicative speech manifest a distinctive pattern in which motor and particularly oral motor skills are impaired whilst expressive language is impaired disproportionately to more intact receptive language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] - the inverse of the more general pattern of receptive impairment in autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our work suggests that the high-level deficits in social communication so overtly characteristic of autism may emerge developmentally from interaction of lower-level, more subtle, more fundamental traits in three general areas: social motivation and reward, cognitive and motor control, and sensory perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and thus implies that early training directed towards such lower-level skills - in the case of this new intervention, motor control and sequencing - might exert a positive knock-on effect on the development of communicative skills. This approach aims to develop social communicative skills by training non-social, domain-general prerequisite skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] - implementing what is in a sense a “back door” route to autism therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Children with autism who are non-verbal or minimally verbal are often excluded from research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and children with severe communication impairments are less likely to be included in treatment studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Point OutWords was developed with the inclusion of clients with autism both explicitly by asking children to choose amongst graphical design options and by obtaining therapists’ feedback on their behalf, and implicitly by observing children’s preferences. Point OutWords was designed with the strengths of autistic cognition in mind. Many children with autism excel at detail-oriented tasks such as jigsaws due to their abnormally strong ability to perceive local details. Whereas many teaching and learning strategies adapted from methods for non-autistic people end up working <italic>against</italic> autistic cognition by asking people with autism to do what they cannot easily do, Point OutWords works <italic>with</italic> autistic cognition, by beginning from this point of strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, our pilot study (<italic>N</italic> = 7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] indicated that children and parents enjoyed using Point OutWords.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The current trial will evaluate the feasibility of testing the Point OutWords intervention, focusing on usability and engagement, fidelity to treatment, and recruitment and retention for a future full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT). It will assess variance in test-retest measures, informing the selection of suitable outcome measures sensitive to change and determining the target sample size of a large-scale randomised controlled trial, key steps in designing RCTs for autism interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p id="Par27">Our primary aim is to determine whether the clinical efficacy of Point OutWords as an intervention for enhancing communication and interaction in minimally verbal or non-verbal children with autism can be feasibly evaluated. Feasibility will be assessed based on the outcomes as follows:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Intervention fidelity and acceptability - Establishing whether Point OutWords can be delivered by parents based on frequency, duration, and content of intervention sessions, in addition to parents’ understanding of the intervention and proficiency in delivering it; assaying whether the intervention is accepted by children and how the intervention fits into the family routine.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Recruitment and retention - establishing whether sufficient participants can complete a future full-scale trial based on participation rates, drop-out, and completion rates; determining whether sufficient participants match inclusion criteria, including impairment in motor skills and expressive language.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Outcome measure efficacy - assessing whether candidate measures of motor and communicative function, alongside measures of individual and family social function, are acceptable and sensitive test-retest measures in the target population; ascertaining variance in outcome measures will inform the sample size of a future RCT.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par31">Positive outcomes from this feasibility study would lead to a subsequent full-scale RCT. Point OutWords carries potential for substantial economic benefit in the UK National Health Service (NHS) and other settings because it is designed for use by caregivers with minimal training.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par48">Point OutWords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] is an iPad game developed to train fine motor and cognitive skills in children with autism. Participants in the experimental group will receive the Point OutWords intervention, with a target of at least 20 h of contact time, as an adjunct to standard NHS clinical therapy. The intervention will be administered by parents/caregivers in the home, either on a loaned iPad or on the family’s own iPad if preferred. Parents will receive training from the research team to use Point OutWords, and written instructions.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Point OutWords has three modes of increasing difficulty, which tap skills prerequisite to language and communication. Learning starts in the Point mode where the child uses their finger to drag jigsaw pieces to complete a picture. The object is segmented into jigsaw puzzle pieces, which are scattered round the touchscreen. Puzzles are images from daily life e.g. bath, shampoo. The child has the opportunity to develop the manual motor skills prerequisite to pointing to interact with a touchscreen. The touchscreen software interface is adapted so as to accommodate the autistic user’s open-loop style of visuomotor control and is customisable to meet the child’s motor ability.</p>
                <p id="Par50">From here, the child progresses to Type mode. In Type mode, puzzle pieces cannot be dragged into place in an iconic style of reference, but instead must be cued by symbolic reference: Each puzzle piece is labelled with a letter in the word, there are as many puzzle pieces as there are letters in the word, and in order to cause a piece to snap into place within the puzzle, the participant must press the corresponding letter key on a virtual keyboard that appears on the touchscreen. The Type mode aims to encourage symbolic representation, with which non-verbal children with autism show difficulty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and which underpins communication development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition to improving motor skills, Point OutWords teaches sequencing through piecing several parts of a puzzle together. Cognitive sequencing underlies language development along with planning for social interaction and daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par51">Finally, in the Speak mode the child assembles each jigsaw piece by speaking each syllable of a word in order, allowing the child to practise their oral motor skills. The object is segmented into a number of puzzle pieces equal to the number of syllables in the word. Each syllable is modelled, the client is prompted to speak each one, and OpenEARS speech recognition software is used to detect these pronunciations. Speaking a syllable causes the corresponding puzzle piece to snap into place. Tolerance for articulation errors and other slight inaccuracies of the match between actual and modelled pronunciations can be configured by the caregiver. Advancing to Speak mode will be difficult for the majority of children in this non-verbal/minimally verbal sample; we expect that most children will stop with Type mode.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Point OutWords is intended to be used with a parent or other caregiver who can support the child in an “errorless learning” format, filling in responses and correcting errors when the child is unable to do so independently, and redirecting the child towards the task when attention wanders. Progressing to a more difficult level is at the discretion of the caregiver in interaction with the child.</p>

                <p id="Par53">Participants not receiving the experimental intervention receive standard NHS clinical therapy and equal iPad contact time using a selection of iPad apps, which include Magic Fluid Lite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], Heat Pad - Relaxing Heat Sensitive Surface!

Control apps were chosen based on their absence of skill promotion, particularly in areas Point OutWords aims to enhance, such as sequencing, assembling puzzles, vocabulary learning, fine motor skills training, social learning, or skills that underpin language development (e.g. category learning). The control group will receive equal regular support during the study period, and will be offered Point OutWords intervention after the end of the study.</p>

During telephone calls, consent for continuing participation is taken or, on the participant’s request, the intervention is stopped. iPad data logged during sessions will be used to monitor session frequency, session length, and games played. Participants will be asked to keep a diary during the intervention period, which includes questions related to frequency of iPad sessions, when during the day iPad sessions take place, and the types of games played.

Relevant to the study, the fine motor, receptive language, and expressive language subscales will be administered.

Research assistants will ascertain consent, allocate participants according to an independent randomisation procedure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sealedenvelope.com/">https://SealedEnvelope.com/</ext-link>), and administer assessments, including recording a 12-min video of child and parent in free play for later scoring with the DCMA and BOSCC. The Principal Investigator (PI) received formal training in DMCA and BOSCC coding, which he passed on to the research assistants. The research assistants are trained to a high standard in psychometric and qualitative administration and coding, and receive regular supervision from the PI, the clinical lead, and qualitative specialist. Members of the research team responsible for data collection have completed CPFT Good Clinical Practice training. Parents will receive training to deliver the intervention and will be asked to keep a diary. Parents will be asked to complete the optional think-aloud session and focus group.</p>

Per the informed consent, anonymised data will be retained permanently (except in the case of withdrawal during the study) and may be released to other researchers. Identifying data (e.g. video, voice) will be deleted after scoring or transcription. Data entry will be completed and checked by research staff. Video data (for DCMA and BOSCC) and voice recordings (think-aloud, focus group, clinician interviews, and diaries) will be stored on a password-protected laptop computer at Nottingham Trent University. Physical data will be stored in locked cabinets within CPFT, accessible only by the research team. Internal data from Point OutWords will be pseudonymised and stored on a file server. The trial statistician and research team will undertake statistical analysis of the data. Only the clinical staff will have access to clinical records. As a small-scale feasibility study, this protocol does not include a data monitoring committee.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis plan</title>
                <p id="Par88">Results will be analysed by the intention-to-treat principle. Guidelines and standard practices for each outcome measure will be used to impute values for missing items in individual datasets. For example, guidelines for the SRS-2 recommend using the median of the items answered. Any systematically missing subscales within feasibility candidate measures will inform the decision as to which measures would be carried forward to a full-scale RCT. This feasibility trial aims to determine the sample size for the full RCT. Test-retest variances in internal iPad data and external outcome measures will be entered into a standard calculation of statistical power to inform the sample size of a full RCT. Participant flow in terms of recruitment and retention, reported in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for non-pharmacological interventions, will also inform the sample size for a large RCT. The trial statistician will perform the power and sample size calculations. Statistical analysis will be conducted in R.</p>
                <p id="Par89">We will explore the predictability of treatment effects based on the baseline measures. Findings may shed light on whether the intervention is more suited to certain profiles of autism than others. Inclusion criteria for a subsequent full trial would be fixed accordingly. Standardised scores from psychometric assessments will be analysed using mixed-model analysis of variance with time point (pre-intervention, post-intervention) as the within-subjects factor, and treatment (intervention, control) as the between-subjects factor. The internally logged outcome measures of visuomotor accuracy in Point OutWords will be analysed using three separate exploratory analyses of covariance, with Point OutWords usage time, number of distinct Point OutWords sessions, and real time as covariates. Participants’ own responses will be discriminated from caregivers’ model inputs by a statistical clustering method. Fidelity will be assayed using descriptive reports of content, and duration and number of intervention sessions completed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par92">Point OutWords was developed in collaboration with children with autism and their therapists and caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], to include engaging jigsaws, high-contrast graphics, and exogenous cues to help capture and maintain attention, and customisable reinforcement prompts. The interface was adapted to accommodate open-loop visuomotor control (a visuomotor impairment common in people with autism), eliminating a major source of users’ frustration. Working from autistic cognitive strengths, Point OutWords aims to enhance motor skills and to promote representation of objects as sequences (of iconic puzzle pieces, symbolic letters, or symbolic sounds), prerequisite abilities that can support communicative development.</p>
              <p id="Par93">There is a need for therapies that address underserved subpopulations of autism and can be delivered with ease at a low cost. For children with autism who have motor impairment and greater receptive than expressive communication, our new intervention could fill this gap in services were it shown effective in a full-scale RCT. Before such a large-scale study can be framed, a feasibility trial is a necessary step to evaluate recruitment and retention rates and identify actions for reducing attrition. Feasibility trials are especially helpful if the proposed population, in this case, autism with motor impairment, has not previously been specifically tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Attrition poses a particular challenge with respect to the control group, but we hope that explaining the study’s contribution to science, regularly telephoning families to offer support, and offering the prospect of using Point OutWords after participation in the trial will motivate families to complete the study. As the acceptability of the control apps is a likely predictive factor in reducing attrition in the control group, with advice from parents of autistic children we have selected iPad apps that are enjoyable and fun for children and families. These control apps were selected based on the absence of Point OutWords skills and tasks, as the inadvertent involvement in similar therapy or training in a control group can confound results as recently reported in one large-scale trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par94">Variance in outcome measures will be an outcome measure itself, used to inform on the suitability of certain psychometric assessments and the sample size in a full-scale RCT. The proportion of missing data in assessments will demonstrate which measures are acceptable to children and their caregivers. For example, in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] children were not compliant with an oral motor assessment (Com DEALL Oro Motor Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]) possibly because of sensory sensitivities around the mouth. The last decade and a half of research on early intervention in autism has spurred the development of new measures sensitive to change from which the current trial benefits, such as the BOSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and the AIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Furthermore, we use a wide range of assessments to comprehensively ascertain the impact of the Point OutWords intervention, including measures of restricted and repetitive behaviour (BOSCC, SRS, AIM); some studies have found that improvement in communication skills can have a knock-on effect on the reduction of restricted/repetitive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Along the same lines, measuring an intervention’s outcomes, not just on autistic symptom severity but on individual and family well-being and daily functioning, has recently been underscored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], so we include measures of parent stress (PSI), family quality of life (FQoL), and children’s challenging behaviour (maladaptive behaviour subdomain on VABS-2).</p>
              <p id="Par95">Qualitative data from diaries, interviews, and focus groups will help identify barriers to successful delivery of the intervention, allowing such issues to be resolved. The Point OutWords intervention is flexible therapy, not constrained to an environment or a time of day, which can be delivered when the child’s mood is most conducive to learning. Feedback about how Point OutWords slots into the daily family routine will be used to enhance the social validity of the intervention design.</p>
              <p id="Par96">As autism is a heterogeneous condition it is unlikely that one style of intervention will address all individuals, nor all aspects of its symptomatology within each individual. Our intervention for motor and communication skills facilitated by Point OutWords can complement other therapies that address communication and social skills more directly. Indeed, the answer will lie in cumulative effectiveness research and the use of common outcome measures across trials so that systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be easily conducted in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The current trial prepares for this prospect, adopting measures such as the DCMA and BOSCC used in the PACT-G trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], and VABS-2 and the MSEL used in the Early Start Denver Model trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and many other studies of autism. While the current trial is not sufficiently scoped to ascertain whether the Point OutWords intervention is effective in improving communication skills in children with autism, it can inform the design of larger RCTs, not only for Point OutWords but also for other early interventions in autism.</p>
