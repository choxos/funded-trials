                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Trauma can play an important role in the development of psychosis, yet no studies have investigated whether a trauma-focused psychological therapy could prevent the onset of psychosis in people at high risk of developing this condition. This study aims to establish whether it would be feasible to conduct a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to prevent the onset of psychosis in people with an at-risk mental state (ARMS).</p>

                  <title>Methods/analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a single-arm trial with a nested qualitative study where all participants (target n=20) will be offered EMDR. Eligible participants are those who meet criteria for ARMS; have experienced a traumatic event before the onset of ARMS symptomatology; and have at least one symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants will be followed up at 4, 8 and 12 months after the baseline assessment. The primary outcome measure is transition to psychosis, and secondary outcome measures include severity of psychotic symptoms, PTSD, depression, anxiety, impaired functioning, health status and resource use. The analysis will aim to establish the rates of recruitment and retention for a large-scale RCT. Interviews with therapists and patients will explore their views of the study and their experiences of delivering or receiving EMDR.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Psychotic illnesses are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The onset of psychosis is often preceded by a prodromal phase, known as an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis, which is characterised by a series of non-specific or attenuated psychotic symptoms.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Approximately 22% of ARMS individuals will transition to psychosis within 1 year and 36% of them within 3 years.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Various interventions have been used for the prevention of psychosis, but there is still limited evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches. Clinical guidelines recommend cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) as a first-line treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, while a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) showed that CBT has a moderate effect on transition to psychosis at 12 months of follow-up (relative risk (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.93), the evidence was of low to moderate quality and the effect was not maintained over the longer term (18 months: RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.19).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>Exposure to trauma is two to three times more common in ARMS or psychosis than in controls,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also common, although not usually detected.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Despite strong evidence showing that trauma is a key factor in the development of psychosis,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> no studies have yet investigated whether a trauma-focused therapy could prevent the onset of psychosis in ARMS.</p>
              <p>Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a trauma-focused therapy that has comparable efficacy to trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) in treating PTSD.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> However, the two forms of therapy are different. While TF-CBT seeks to directly identify and restructure the negative beliefs, EMDR does this indirectly, relying more on the integration of emotional, cognitive, sensory, physical and contextual information to allow adaptive processing of traumatic memories. Unlike TF-CBT, EMDR does not require patients to give a detailed description of the trauma, which may be distressing. Also, unlike TF-CBT, EMDR does not involve homework, which may make it more suitable for people with a disorganised lifestyle, such as those with ARMS.</p>
              <p>To date, there has been only one RCT comparing EMDR with treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with comorbid psychosis and PTSD. This study showed that EMDR improved PTSD, and also reduced paranoid delusions, but did not reduce auditory hallucinations at 6 months of follow-up.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, the EMDR protocol did not specifically target psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, most participants had chronic forms of psychosis and hence psychotic symptoms might have been less amenable to treatment than more recent onset symptoms present in ARMS subjects.</p>

Therapeutic sessions will be delivered by EMDR UK and Europe trained therapists who will receive training based on the LSCFT manual for the study. The training will be tailored to therapists’ needs, and will last between 4 and 8 hours. All EMDR therapists will have at least 1 year of experience of providing EMDR, and monthly supervision with an EMDR consultant will be in place. Each session will last approximately 90 min. The first two to four sessions will focus on establishing the therapeutic alliance, preparation for EMDR and stabilisation techniques, assessment and identification of targets, cognitions, emotions and bodily sensations. The following 8–10 sessions will focus on desensitisation, installation of positive cognitions and body scan for past, present and future stressful situations.</p>
                <p>Written permission will be sought to audio record the therapeutic sessions.

                <title>Challenges to recruitment</title>
                <p>The original feasibility study was designed as an RCT comparing EMDR with TAU. TAU in AWP is quite heterogeneous and consists of discharge back to the referrer, signposting to other services, CBT, family intervention or psychoeducation. Randomisation took place using a remote computerised randomisation service administered by the Bristol Trials Centre ensuring that allocations were concealed from the recruiting researcher. Randomisation was minimised by psychotic symptom severity (score on positive symptoms on CAARMS &lt;11 or ≥11). However, following challenges to recruitment (described below), the study design was changed to a single-arm study.</p>
                <p>During the first 7 months of the study (May to December 2018), we only recruited three participants (against a target of 21). This poor recruitment was primarily because the number of patients identified as ARMS by the EI teams within AWP was much lower than expected, and only three of the six EI teams we originally planned to recruit from were able to support the study due to financial constraints to managing ARMS clients. Therefore, from July 2019, all participants recruited to the study were offered EMDR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of participants in the randomised and single-arm phases of the trial.</p>

                <title>Sample size and feasibility of recruitment</title>
                <p>In the original protocol we had planned to recruit up to 40 participants. The initial sample size was informed by literature guidelines<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and pragmatic considerations concerning potential difficulties accessing this population. The feasibility study would not be powered to detect important clinical differences between EMDR and TAU groups but would provide estimates of the completion and retention rates that would further assist in planning the recruitment for a future RCT.</p>
                <p>Given the challenges with recruitment and modification of our study design (from a randomised to single-arm trial), we decreased our target sample size from 40 to 20 participants. This sample size will provide us with reasonable precision around estimates of percentages completing the intervention and follow-ups. For example, if 70% of those who started EMDR complete the intervention, the 95% CIs would be 45% and 88%. Similarly, if 75% of those who started EMDR are followed up to 12 months, the 95% CIs for the retention rate would be 50% and 91%.</p>

                <p>The follow-up schedule will involve face-to-face assessments at 4, 8 and 12 months after the baseline assessment. Each follow-up assessment will last about 60 min. The primary outcome will be collected at 12 months of follow-up, and the secondary outcome at 4, 8 and 12 months.</p>
                <p>A 12-month follow-up will provide us with adequate data on retention rate that can be used to ensure that a definitive trial is adequately powered. If, in the definitive trial, the intervention was shown to be effective at 12 months, then further follow-up could examine whether effects are maintained over the longer term.</p>

Data collection and analysis will proceed in parallel, so that insights from earlier data can shape later data collection, and enable the team to establish when data saturation has been reached. The data gathered will be analysed thematically. Transcripts will be independently coded by different researchers, who will then meet to discuss their coding and interpretation of the data. This will help control for researcher bias and may lead to the coding frame being revised or defined more clearly. Transcripts will then be imported into the software package NVivo V.12<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> to allow electronic coding and retrieval of data. Once all the transcripts have been coded, data will be analysed using an approach similar to framework analysis.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>

                  <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                  <p>Patient and public involvement (PPI) played an important role in this study. This research idea was initially presented at a PPI event which brought together people with lived experiences of psychosis, their carers, clinicians, academics and commissioners. Further on, this idea was presented at the Hearing Voices Network, and through these contacts we established a PPI group who gave us important feedback on the research question, the intervention and which measures to use. We anticipate that the group, which is still active, will: (1) ensure that the views of patients who have had a psychotic illness are heard at every stage of the study; (2) inform any developments of the intervention to make sure these are acceptable to the target population, (3) ensure patient documentation is easy to understand to maximise response and retention rates; and (4) help interpret and disseminate study findings.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the feasibility of conducting a large RCT to establish whether EMDR could prevent the onset of psychosis in people with an ARMS. As psychotic illnesses usually occur in early adulthood and disrupt a key period of professional and social development, preventing psychosis would improve patients’ outcomes, and also decrease the substantial economic burden of this condition.</p>
              <p>The results of this feasibility trial will provide us with a better understanding of this patient group, and will provide us with information that will be used to inform whether progression to a full trial would be feasible. The nested qualitative study will address issues of patient and therapist views of the intervention, and provide new insights into treatment pathways and experiences of this patient group. If shown to be feasible, a full-scale RCT will be conducted to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of EMDR to prevent the onset of psychosis in ARMS.</p>

                <p>Recruitment to this study opened in May 2018, and closed in May 2020. At the time of writing (July 2020), 14 participants have been recruited to the study. We expect to finish follow-up data collection by May 2021.</p>
                <p>This article describes protocol version 4, dated 2 August 2019. When all regulatory approvals had been received, the protocol was version 1, dated 11 January 2018. Since then, two major amendments have been made with changes to incorporate additional qualitative work, decrease the sample size and change the study design from an RCT to a single-arm trial. The latter change took place in July 2019 prior to which we had recruited six participants.</p>
