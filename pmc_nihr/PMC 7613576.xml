                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) has historically been associated with high levels of childhood mortality in Africa. Although malaria has a major contribution to this mortality, to date, the clinical pathology of malaria among children with SCA has been poorly described. We aimed to explore the relationship between SCA and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in further detail by investigating the burden and severity of malaria infections among children recruited with severe anaemia to the TRACT trial of blood transfusion in Africa.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study is a post-hoc secondary analysis of the TRACT trial data, conducted after trial completion. TRACT was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised controlled trial enrolling children aged 2 months to 12 years who presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;6·0 g/dL) to four hospitals in Africa. This secondary analysis is restricted to Uganda, where the birth prevalence of SCA is approximately 1% and malaria transmission is high. Children were classified as normal (HbAA), heterozygous (HbAS), or homozygous (HbSS; SCA) for the rs334 A→T sickle mutation in <italic>HBB</italic> following batch-genotyping by PCR at the end of the trial. To avoid confounding from SCA-specific medical interventions, we considered children with an existing diagnosis of SCA (known SCA) separately from those diagnosed at the end of the trial (unknown SCA). The outcomes considered in this secondary analysis were measures of <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasite burden, features of severe malaria, and mortality at day 28 in malaria-positive children.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3944 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. 3483 children from Uganda were considered in this secondary analysis. Overall, 1038 (30%) of 3483 Ugandan children had SCA. 1815 (78%) of 2321 children without SCA (HbAA) tested positive for <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria, whereas the prevalence was significantly lower in children with SCA (347 [33%] of 1038; p&lt;0·0001). Concentrations of plasma <italic>P falciparum</italic> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a marker of the total burden of malaria parasites within an individual, were significantly lower in children with either known SCA (median 8 ng/mL; IQR 0–57) or unknown SCA (7 ng/mL; 0–50) than in HbAA children (346 ng/mL; 21–2121; p&lt;0·0001). In contrast to HbAA children, few HbSS children presented with classic features of severe and complicated malaria, but both the frequency and severity of anaemia were higher in HbSS children. We found no evidence for increased mortality at day 28 in those with SCA compared with those without SCA overall (hazard ratios 1·07 [95% CI 0·31–3·76] for known SCA and 0·67 [0·15–2·90] for unknown SCA).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The current study suggests that children with SCA are innately protected against classic severe malaria. However, it also shows that even low-level infections can precipitate severe anaemic crises that would likely prove fatal without rapid access to blood transfusion services.</p>

The causal mutation, the rs334 A→T single-nucleotide polymorphism in <italic>HBB</italic>, is the classic example of a balanced polymorphism, where current allele frequencies reflect a survival advantage in carriers and increased mortality in homozygotes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There is now abundant evidence to support a central role for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in the positive selection of heterozygotes (HbAS)<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> but its place in the negative selection of SCA (HbSS) is less clear.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">It is often stated that severe malaria is a major reason for the high mortality seen in children with SCA in Africa.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Severe and complicated malaria is defined on the basis of a range of specific clinical and laboratory features in the presence of <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasitaemia.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The commonest forms of severe malaria among children in Africa are cerebral malaria, respiratory distress (caused by deep or acidotic breathing), and severe malaria anaemia.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Similar clinical features can develop in children with SCA who do not have malaria,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> which can make it difficult to attribute such features to malaria.

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed for articles on the relationship between sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and malaria using the search terms (“sickle cell disease” OR “sickle cell anaemia” OR “sickle cell anemia”) AND “malaria”. The search was done on June 16, 2022, without date or language constraints. Our search revealed 865 articles in total, of which 671 included original research. Most studies included very small numbers of children with both SCA and malaria and less than ten were relevant to the question at hand. It is widely believed that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria has exerted opposite selective forces on children with sickle cell trait (HbAS) and SCA (HbSS). Although the evidence for a malaria-protective effect of HbAS is now overwhelming, recent epidemiological studies have raised questions about the negative effects of malaria on children with SCA.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, the current study, which included 347 children presenting with both SCA and malaria to three hospitals in Uganda, is the most comprehensive study yet conducted on this subject. Unlike most previous studies, the current study includes the measurement of plasma concentrations of <italic>P falciparum</italic> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), an assay that captures the total body load of <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites in patients with malaria. Recent studies have shown that such measurements can be useful in distinguishing children hospitalised with true severe malaria from children with severe febrile illnesses of alternative cause that are accompanied by incidental parasitaemia.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">In conjunction with the findings from previous epidemiological studies, the current study provides strong evidence in support of a malaria-protective effect of SCA at a level similar to that afforded by HbAS. Nevertheless, the study also shows that this protection is incomplete, and that even low-grade malaria infections can precipitate severe anaemic crises in children with SCA that, in the absence of blood transfusion, would almost certainly be rapidly fatal. Overall, the study supports the need for early diagnosis and proactive interventions for preventing malaria in children with SCA.</p>

                <p id="para110">The current study is a post-hoc secondary analysis of data from the TRACT trial, conducted after the trial was completed. The TRACT trial was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised controlled trial enrolling children aged 2 months to 12 years who presented with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;6·0 g/dL) to four hospitals in Africa. Full details of the trial have been published previously.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> TRACT was registered (ISRCTN84086586) on Feb 11, 2013. The trial flow is detailed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 4)</xref>. Briefly, TRACT investigated the management of both complicated and uncomplicated severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;6·0 g/dL) among children in Uganda and Malawi. Data were collected on structured case report forms that were completed at admission and at reviews every 30 min during transfusion, then regularly (at 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h, and daily thereafter) during admission. After discharge, children were routinely followed up on days 28, 90, and 180 after randomisation for review of clinical status and haemoglobin measurements. Serious adverse events were actively solicited at every assessment. Quality control of data was done through monitoring visits and data checks performed centrally by the trial statistician (ASW and ECG). We restricted our current analysis to Uganda because the low birth prevalence of SCA in Malawi meant that only six (1·3%) of 461 children recruited there had either known or unknown SCA, as anticipated from the low national allele frequency data for the country.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> In Uganda, the trial was conducted in three hospitals, two in the malaria hyperendemic Eastern region (Mbale and Soroti<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>), and Mulago Hospital in Kampala, where transmission is mesoendemic.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The background prevalence of SCA during infancy in these regions has recently been estimated at 1·2% and 0·7%, respectively.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para120">Eligibility for the complicated anaemia stratum required the presence of one or more of the following features of clinical severity: profound anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;4·0 g/dL), impaired consciousness, increased work of breathing, blackwater fever, or known SCA. Children recruited to this stratum were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mL/kg or 30 mL/kg of whole blood, or the equivalent volumes (10 mL/kg or 15 mL/kg) of packed red blood cells. Children were eligible for recruitment to the uncomplicated anaemia stratum if their haemoglobin concentration was between 4·0 g/dL and 6·0 g/dL and they had none of the aforementioned severity features. In this stratum, children were randomly assigned to receive either no immediate transfusion or immediate transfusion of 20 mL/kg or 30 mL/kg of whole blood or the equivalent volumes (10 mL/kg or 15 mL/kg) of packed cells. Children with known SCA were ineligible for recruitment to this stratum because the investigators lacked equipoise regarding the ethics of withholding transfusions from children with known SCA and a haemoglobin concentration of less than 6·0 g/dL. All children were followed up until day 28 for the primary endpoint, mortality, and to day 180 for a range of additional events that included readmission and death.</p>

All samples were stored and transported at 4°C until processing and all samples for archiving were frozen at –80°C within 24 h of collection.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para160">We classified children as either: (1) normal (HbAA), (2) heterozygous (sickle cell trait; HbAS), or (3) homozygous (HbSS; SCA) for the rs334 A→T mutation. The homozygous group were further classified into those with an existing diagnosis (known SCA) and those whose diagnosis was only revealed by genotyping at the end of the trial (unknown SCA). Because patients with known SCA were excluded from one arm of the trial, and because they are often managed differently in terms of their clinical care (such as the routine receipt of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis and other malaria-preventive measures), we analysed data on known and unknown SCA groups separately to avoid potential problems with interpretation. We compared baseline characteristics in malaria-positive trial participants by SCA group using Mann-Whitney U tests or Fisher's exact tests for continuous and categorical factors, respectively, and used histograms to examine the distributions. PfHRP2 was also categorised as less than 1000 ng/mL or more than (or equal to) 1000 ng/mL, a value that has been used to distinguish children with true severe malaria from those with severe illnesses in the presence of incidental parasitaemia in other studies.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> We investigated the association of SCA group and mortality at day 28 using a previously developed Cox proportional hazards model for predictors of mortality, which adjusted for the centre of recruitment, transfusion volume randomisation, temperature, and the interaction between transfusion volume and temperature. Other potential confounders were identified using backwards elimination with a threshold p value of 0·1, and included as covariates in the models. Candidate covariates, which were identified using clinical input, previous knowledge, and through review of the literature, were demographic details, vital signs on admission, clinical history of the illness, results of laboratory tests at admission, and information on the trial arm and trial transfusions. Continuous variables were tested for linearity by modelling as fractional polynomials with α=0·05. All analyses were conducted using Stata, version 16.1.</p>

              <p id="para240">Among 3483 children presenting with all-cause severe anaemia who were enrolled at the point of hospital admission into the TRACT trial in Uganda, 30% had SCA overall. In comparison to HbAA children, a significantly lower proportion of those with SCA tested positive for <italic>P falciparum</italic> malaria, and both total parasite burden and levels of inflammation, a correlate of clinical severity,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> were significantly lower in those with SCA who tested positive compared with HbAA children who tested positive. Only a small proportion of the children with SCA presented with the clinical or laboratory features of classic severe malaria.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> These observations suggest that malaria infections are both less frequent and less severe among children with SCA than they are in HbAA children. Only 4% of children recruited to TRACT had HbAS, in comparison to approximately 16% of children within the same community,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> reflecting the very high levels of malaria protection afforded by this condition.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p id="para250">Given that steady state haemoglobin concentrations in children with SCA in Africa average only 6·0–8·0 g/dL,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> on first impression the high proportion of children with SCA might not seem particularly surprising. Importantly, however, more than three-quarters of all the malaria-positive children with SCA were recruited through the complicated stratum of the trial. Recruitment to this stratum required the presence of at least one severity feature, many of which would qualify as classic severe malaria<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> in children without SCA. Many of the children recruited to this stratum of the trial were profoundly unwell, 10% being prostrated, 9% having respiratory distress, and 17% being profoundly acidotic; however, in marked contrast to those without SCA, very few of the children with unknown SCA had malaria infections that were characterised by either high parasite densities or by a high sequestered parasite load based on high PfHRP2 plasma concentrations. Notably, 75% of the malaria-positive children with unknown SCA were recruited with profound anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;4·0 g/dL). Focusing specifically on the children with clinically defined cerebral malaria, median plasma PfHRP2 concentrations were more than 1000 ng/mL among the HbAA subgroup, levels consistent with those reported in previous studies.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Conversely, concentrations were low or undetectable in all those in this same subgroup who had SCA. Classic cerebral malaria is related to the biomass of mature <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites that are sequestered in the cerebral vasculature<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and, as a consequence, is associated with a high plasma PfHRP2 concentration.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The very low concentrations found in the children with SCA within this subgroup means that in the majority, their impaired consciousness was probably not causally related to malaria. This notion accords with observations made in several previous studies. For example, in a prospective study of children presenting with severe malaria to Kilifi County Hospital in Kenya, on post-study genotyping we found that only 11 (0·5%) of 2220 children with severe malaria had SCA and that none had features of cerebral malaria.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> SCA might therefore protect against true cerebral malaria by protecting against high-density parasitaemia. Alternatively, protection might also relate to the reduced ability of <italic>P falciparum</italic>-infected SCA red blood cells to sequester in the microvasculature. A previous study found that the red cell surface molecule <italic>P falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1) was underexpressed on malaria-infected HbSS red cells and that this led to reduced cytoadherence.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Subsequent work has linked this phenomenon to reduced protein trafficking through a disruption of the intracytoplasmic actin network.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Finally, we recently showed that all children with SCA who do present with signs of severe malaria are infected by parasites of a specific genetic background.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Another plausible explanation, therefore, is that such parasites are naturally less virulent. Further work will be required to pinpoint which of these mechanisms is most important in vivo.</p>
              <p id="para260">To the best of our knowledge, ours is the second study to have assessed the burden of <italic>P falciparum</italic> parasites in children with SCA through the measurement of plasma PfHRP2 concentrations. One previous study involved children hospitalised with severe anaemia and malaria in Kampala, Uganda. The authors found that plasma PfHRP2 concentrations were significantly lower among 22 children who tested positive for SCA (197 ng/mL; IQR 6–469) than they were in 205 children with HbAA (1050 ng/mL; 468–2840; p&lt;0·001).<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Although most of the children in our current study were recruited in areas where malaria transmission was considerably higher than in Kampala, overall concentrations of PfHRP2 were comparatively low, and were undetectable in almost a third of patients. We believe this finding was attributable to low-density infections rather than to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> for several reasons. The primary method of malaria diagnosis in TRACT was by a PfHRP2-based RDT that would not have returned positive results when infections were caused by parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. Furthermore, such RDTs primarily detect PfHRP2 in malaria-infected red blood cells, in which concentrations are approximately 20 times higher than they are in plasma, where they are mainly determined by the release of PfHRP2 at schizogony during the previous erythrocytic cycle.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Finally, based on the current literature, the prevalence of parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is still relatively low in most of sub-Saharan Africa, where they are generally found in children with asymptomatic infections,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> although either <italic>pfhrp2</italic> or <italic>pfhrp2</italic>/<italic>3</italic> deletions were found in almost 7% of parasites in one recent study, conducted in Uganda during the same era as TRACT.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Moreover, the frequency was greatest in the east of the country, where the majority of TRACT participants were also recruited. Our observations should therefore be interpreted in this context. Our study materials did not include questions regarding specific treatments such as malaria chemoprophylaxis or the use of hydroxycarbamide among children recruited with known SCA, a potential limitation of our study. The possibility that some children might have been receiving specific treatments of this sort was our rationale for treating known and unknown SCA separately in our analysis. However, the fact that the clinical and parasitological indices of malaria were broadly similar in these two groups of children suggests that the receipt of specific therapies does not explain our current observations.</p>
              <p id="para270">Although our study is consistent with the conclusion that children with SCA are innately protected from high-density malaria infections, this does not mean that in such children malaria cannot be a significant clinical problem. First, highlighting the major vulnerability of children with SCA to severe anaemia, almost 20% of all the children recruited to TRACT in Uganda who had no previous knowledge of their SCA status were subsequently found to have SCA. This is despite the fact that SCA affects less than 1% of children in the same population overall.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Second, approximately one-third of the children with SCA tested positive for malaria overall, a likely trigger for their anaemic crises. This notion is supported by the fact that, unlike children with HbAA, haemoglobin concentrations were significantly lower in the malaria-positive subgroup of children with SCA compared with the malaria-negative subgroup. Finally, all the deaths that did occur in the malaria-positive subgroup were among children with detectable plasma concentrations of PfHRP2, presumably the group with the highest parasite burdens. Taken together, these observations reinforce how important it is that in Africa, SCA is diagnosed as early in life as possible and that affected children are offered malaria protection.</p>
              <p id="para280">Some limitations to our analysis of the association of SCA and 28-day mortality are acknowledged. First, there is always some uncertainty in the causal interpretation of hazards ratios.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Second, although we have attempted to adjust for all confounding factors, we cannot exclude the possibility that unmeasured confounders remain. Finally, in some groups, the number of events per variable in the multivariable model was lower than that which is generally recommended (ten),<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> which in some situations could lead to biased estimates or poor confidence interval coverage.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para290">In conclusion, data from the current and other recent studies<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> are consistent with an earlier model<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> in which we proposed that even under conditions of intense malaria transmission, SCA affords a degree of innate resistance to high-density malaria infections, and thus protects against organ failure caused by microcirculatory obstruction by sequestered parasites. However, our study also shows that even low-density <italic>P falciparum</italic> infections can trigger sudden and catastrophic falls in haemoglobin that can rapidly result in death where emergency supplies of blood for transfusion are not available.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref></p>
