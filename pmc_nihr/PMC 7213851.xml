                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) can improve glycaemic control or even achieve remission through weight loss and reduce their use of medication and risk of cardiovascular disease. The Glucose Lowering through Weight management (GLoW) trial will evaluate whether a tailored diabetes education and behavioural weight management programme (DEW) is more effective and cost-effective than a diabetes education (DE) programme in helping people with overweight or obesity and a recent diagnosis of T2D to lower their blood glucose, lose weight and improve other markers of cardiovascular risk.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, two-arm, superiority trial. We will recruit 576 adults with body mass index&gt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and diagnosis of T2D in the past 3 years and randomise them to a tailored DEW or a DE programme. Participants will attend measurement appointments at a local general practitioner practice or research centre at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is 12-month change in glycated haemoglobin. The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome will be estimated and tested using a linear regression model (analysis of covariance) including randomisation group and adjusted for baseline value of the outcome and the randomisation stratifiers. Participants will be included in the group to which they were randomised, under the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes include 6-month and 12-month changes in body weight, body fat percentage, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lipid profile; probability of achieving good glycaemic control; probability of achieving remission from diabetes; probability of losing 5% and 10% body weight and modelled cardiovascular risk (UKPDS). An intention-to-treat within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from NHS and societal perspectives using participant-level data. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants to understand why and how the programme achieved its results and how participants manage their weight after the programme ends.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The treatment of diabetes and related complications (eg, cardiovascular disease, amputation, kidney failure) uses approximately 10% of the UK NHS budget.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This is predicted to rise to 17% in 2035 as the number of people with diabetes in the UK rises to 6.25 million, of which 5.6 million cases will be adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Adults who are living with T2D are at increased risk of developing physical and mental health comorbidities and have reduced quality of life and shorter life expectancy.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> There are considerable social and economic costs to the individual living with diabetes as well as to wider society.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 4</xref></p>
              <p>While T2D is typically characterised as a progressive, irreversible condition, there is evidence of remission in patients losing weight through bariatric surgery<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> or closely supervised very-low-calorie formula diets.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> However, many patients with T2D may be unsuitable for or unwilling to undergo these interventions and, given their high cost and reliance on specialists, they are unlikely to be widely adopted in the NHS in the near future. Partial or complete remission of T2D has also been observed following smaller weight losses achieved through behavioural interventions.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Moreover, even without remission, weight loss and behaviour change can lead to improvements in health outcomes in people who have diabetes. We have shown that losing a moderate amount of weight or making healthy behaviour changes (eg, increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol, energy and fat intake) in the first year after diagnosis can reduce the likelihood of stroke or heart attack in the next 5–10 years<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> and increase the likelihood of achieving remission at 5 years.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that intensive specialist-led behavioural programmes could lead to weight loss and reductions in cardiovascular risk factors over 8-year follow-up.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, there are currently insufficient resources in the UK NHS to provide intensive, specialist-led behavioural programmes to 3.2 million individuals who have T2D and the additional 200 000 individuals who are diagnosed each year. Instead, current guidelines focus on structured diabetes education (DE) and dietary advice,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> which is cheaper and scalable but has small, short-term effects on weight and glycaemia, and relatively poor uptake.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18</xref> A recent systematic review found that supportive behaviour change programmes (with ≥11 hours of contact time) achieve greater reductions in weight and glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) than structured education without additional support (≤10 hours).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Integrating effective but scalable behaviour change programmes into care pathways for T2D could potentially improve patients’ glycaemic control and related risk factors and reduce complications. This would improve health and quality of life for people living with diabetes and reduce the burden of diabetes on healthcare resources.</p>
              <p>We have previously shown that commercial open-group behavioural weight management programmes, such as WW (formerly Weight Watchers) or Slimming World, offer a scalable and cost-effective way to help people lose weight and reduce risk of diabetes.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–22</xref> A randomised trial in the USA showed that a combination of WW classes and remote dietary counselling achieved greater weight losses and reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> than standard care over 1 year in people with diabetes.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A quarter of participants randomised to this programme achieved good glycaemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> below 53 mmol/mol) at 12 months compared with 14% of those receiving standard care. In the UK, a similar intervention has been developed for use in the NHS that combines referral to WW with NICE-compliant DE and dietary advice. However, this programme is unlikely to be widely commissioned without robust evidence of cost-effectiveness. The proposed trial will provide reliable evidence on the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a tailored diabetes education and behavioural weight management programme (DEW) versus DE, for people with a recent diagnosis of T2D (≤3 years).</p>

                <p>The tailored DEW programme was developed and is delivered by WW. It lasts 6 months and is overseen by a registered dietitian with experience in diabetes, diet and behaviour counselling and specific training in the standard WW programme.</p>

                  <title>​Structured DE</title>
                  <p>The structured DE programme is delivered remotely (video conferencing/telephone) on a 1:1 basis by the registered dietitian over two education sessions, 3–5 weeks apart (total time 1 hour 30 min, divided between two calls). It covers a standardised QISMET-accredited core curriculum but can then be adapted for the individual’s needs. Additional self-help education materials to support the curriculum will be available online and are delivered to all participants via email or mail at the patient’s preference. These materials may be minimally tailored to the individual participant. Information on the materials can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/uk/live-well-diabetes">www.weightwatchers.com/uk/live-well-diabetes</ext-link>. During the education sessions, materials on goal setting, understanding diabetes, the glycaemic index, carbohydrates, physical activity and weight management are reviewed.</p>

                  <title>​Behavioural programme</title>
                  <p>The behavioural weight management component consists of free membership of WW for 6 months. This includes attendance at weekly in-person group meetings (30–40 min) held at a variety of times in a range of local community venues. These are open-group meetings (new people may join or leave the group at any time) and are led by a coach (trained lay person with experience of the programme). Meetings include a confidential weigh in with the coach and a 30 min interactive education session led by the coach which includes advice on diet, physical activity and positive mindset, using behavioural strategies (eg, goal setting, self-monitoring, problem solving, modifying the personal food environment and relapse prevention). Peer support is available from coaches and other group members. Participants can be accompanied by a friend, relative or carer. Participants will also have access to the WW app, online digital tools and standard materials such as recipe booklets, physical activity guidance and meal trackers for the duration of the intervention. Participants can contact their coach for support/advice between meetings via an online chat function.</p>

                  <title>​Participant engagement</title>
                  <p>Once a referral is received, the registered dietitian will telephone the participants, welcome them to the programme, sign them up to a local WW meeting and arrange the first education session. Participants are also given an information sheet with details of how to contact the dietitian directly. A closed social media support group will be formed and all participants will be encouraged to join if they wish to do so. Activity on the group forum will be monitored and supported by the registered dietitian. Each week, the dietitian will contact 2–5 participants (selected at random from those who have participated in the programme for longer than 3 months) via the social media group or phone. Participants can also contact the dietitian proactively during the intervention period for additional remote support where needed, but they will be encouraged to do so via the social media group in the first instance. If participants miss four or more WW standard in-person meetings, their local coach will call to help the individual return to the programme.</p>

Participants can attend 6 hours of structured self-management group education, covering: thoughts and feelings about diabetes; understanding diabetes and glucose—what happens in the body; understanding risk factors and complications associated with diabetes; understanding monitoring and medication; how to take control—food choices and physical activity and planning for the future. The structured education is delivered in 1 day or 2 half days by two trained healthcare professionals in local healthcare or community venues. Sessions are delivered in groups of up to 10 participants, and participants can bring a friend or partner with them. The education sessions are supported by specially developed resources.</p>

                  <p>Anthropometric measurements will be made at participating primary care practices or research centres by research-trained healthcare professionals (hereafter ‘research nurses’) blind to intervention allocation, in line with standardised operating procedures. Participants will be asked to remove shoes and heavy clothing items. Height will be measured in centimetres using a mounted stadiometer (make and model dependent on practice). Where possible, weight (kg) and body fat percentage will be measured using a calibrated Tanita segmental body composition analyser (Tanita Ltd; MA Tokyo, Japan; model dependent on practice) which will be provided to practices by the research team. Where we have an insufficient number of Tanita scales to measure body fat at a practice, we will measure weight (kg) only using calibrated electronic scales (model dependent on practice). To maximise the number of participants for whom we can measure body fat, we will prioritise the use of Tanitas at large practices with a large number of eligible patients, and Clinical
Research Networks (CRN)-led practices (as CRN nurses can transport the Tanita scales to numerous practices). Blood pressure will be measured three times in a resting state using a calibrated OMRON automatic blood pressure monitor (OMRON Healthcare UK, Milton Keynes, UK; model dependent on practice).</p>
                  <p>If a research nurse is not available to conduct follow-up assessments, assessments may be conducted by trained research centre staff. If participants are unable to attend follow-up appointments at a participating practice, the research team may offer appointments at the local hospital or research centre, or home visits. Participants who are unable or unwilling to attend a visit will be asked to provide a self-measured weight. All other participants will also be asked for a self-measured weight at the time of appointment booking to enable us to quantify the degree of misreporting of self-measured weights.</p>

                  <p>Participants will be asked to provide a blood sample for the measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid profile and carotenoids. If possible, this sample will be taken at the practice at the same time as the anthropometric measurements. Blood samples will be collected in three tubes labelled with an anonymised barcode (4.9 mL serum tube for lipid profile, 2.6 mL Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube for HbA<sub>1c</sub>, 4.9 mL and lithium heparin (LH) tube for carotenoids). The LH tube is light sensitive, so it will be wrapped in foil to avoid degradation. Samples will be placed in a Royal Mail Safebox and posted via first-class mail to the central laboratory for analysis. Each sample is stable for up to 3 days at room temperature. Plasma samples for analysis of carotenoids will be frozen and analysed in batches.</p>

                    <p>Physical activity will be measured objectively using a triaxial accelerometer (Axivity AX3, Newcastle, UK) which measures raw acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>). Participants will be asked to wear the accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist continuously for seven consecutive days and nights. The device is small, light and waterproof and is worn like a watch. It does not need to be taken off while showering, bathing or swimming.</p>
                    <p>At the baseline visit, the nurse will take the participant through the accelerometer instruction sheet. They will demonstrate to the participant how they should wear the monitor on their wrist. The nurse will also ensure that the timing of the monitor and return is feasible for the participant. The study team will initialise the accelerometer and will post it out to the participant with the instruction sheet. The participant will wear the monitor for 7 days and nights and will complete an activity log. For the 6-month and 12-month visits, accelerometers will be mailed out to participants. At the end of 7 days, the participant will be asked to post the device back to the research centre using prepaid, preaddressed materials. Trained staff will download the data from the accelerometer and check it to ensure the integrity of the data recording. This method has been used in large-scale epidemiological studies including the UK Biobank study in 100 000 individuals.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Data will be analysed using established methods used in UK Biobank.

                  <p>Primary care practices will be identified and recruited by the CRN. Participating practices must be currently referring patients with a recent diagnosis of T2D to structured DE (DESMOND) as part of standard practice and should have active WW meetings in the local area. They should also be research active with the capacity to recruit and follow-up participants. The CRN will attempt to recruit practices from diverse areas using known characteristics of the practice population to enable recruitment of a sample broadly representative of the target population (UK adults with overweight and obesity and who have a recent diagnosis of T2D).</p>

                  <p>Eligible patients will be identified through electronic searches of primary care records and waiting lists for DE. GPs will write to all potentially eligible patients inviting them to participate. This letter will include a participant information sheet and details of how to contact the study team at the research centre. Participants will also receive opportunistic invitations during routine consultations via an invitation letter and participant information sheet to take home with them. Pop-up alerts on patient records (triggered by diagnosis or attempted referral to DE) will be implemented to facilitate opportunistic recruitment. To boost enrolment, advertisements will also be placed in local pharmacies, news media and other relevant settings.</p>

Research centre staff will answer any questions and conduct a telephone screening. If patients are eligible and willing to participate, the research staff will check that they have received the participant information sheet (sending another if they have not) and arrange a baseline assessment with the research nurse at a local participating practice or research centre.</p>
                  <p>At the baseline visit, the research nurse will take informed consent. This will include ensuring that participants have read the information sheet and had the opportunity to ask questions. They will also confirm eligibility, including an objective measure of height and weight, before taking the rest of the baseline measurements. At the end of each day, the research nurse will email the study coordinator a list of participants who have formally enrolled on the trial.</p>

                  <p>Given the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants to their intervention group. GPs will be informed of the intervention allocation and participants will be allowed to discuss the intervention with their GP, as they would outside a trial scenario. However, participants will be asked not to reveal their intervention group to outcome assessors (ie, research nurses taking measurements). The trial statistician and the investigators will be blinded to intervention allocation until the database is locked and the primary analysis is complete.</p>

Based on data from a previous trial in adults with a recent diagnosis of T2D,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> we assumed a 16 mmol/mol SD, a 0.8 correlation between baseline and follow-up and 25% attrition.

                  <p>A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed and signed off by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) prior to analysis. Participants will be analysed in the group to which they were randomised, based on the intention-to-treat principle. The intervention effect, representing the baseline-adjusted difference in change from baseline to 12 months in HbA<sub>1c</sub> between the intervention and control group, will be estimated using a linear regression model including randomisation group, baseline value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> (ie, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) and the randomisation stratifiers (sex, duration of diabetes). The missing indicator method<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> will be used to ensure inclusion of participants with a missing baseline value of HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Participants with missing values of HbA<sub>1c</sub> at 12 months will be excluded (ie, a complete-case analysis). If there are &gt;5% of participants with missing values of HbA<sub>1c</sub> at 12 months, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using multiple imputation by chained equations; full details of this analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.</p>
                  <p>Continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed using the method described earlier. Binary secondary outcomes will be analysed using a logistic regression model including randomisation group and the randomisation stratifiers.</p>

If the p value for a particular interaction is &lt;0.05, then the intervention effect and 95% CI will be estimated within the relevant subgroups.</p>

An intention-to-treat within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from both the NHS and the societal perspectives using participant-level data. Benefits will be measured by changes in HbA<sub>1c</sub> at 12 months for the primary analysis and changes in weight (kg), HRQoL (EQ5D-5L), capability/well-being (ICECAP-A) and QALYs at 12 months for the secondary analyses. Resource use data will be extracted from patient-completed questionnaires and validated with primary care notes review. Unit costs will be extracted from standard NHS cost databases and publications (eg, NHS Reference Costs). Costs and benefits will be left undiscounted as follow-up is only 1 year. If required and appropriate, missing data will be imputed using recognised techniques such as multiple imputation. Descriptive statistics for resource use, total costs, HRQoL and capability/well-being at 1 year as well as incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios and incremental net (monetary) benefit measures will be reported. We will undertake deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, presenting the results of the latter as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Value of information analysis will quantify the value of reducing the decision uncertainty which will inform whether further research is worthwhile following completion of this study, and if so on which parameters.</p>

Analyses will also explore the key challenges anticipated around treatment cessation and weight loss maintenance, and the value attached to the possibility of freedom from or reduction in medication and the concept of ‘remission’.</p>
                  <p>Recordings will be transcribed by an experienced external agency and checked for accuracy by the research team. Verbatim transcripts will be coded using NVivo software, retaining a focus on narrative sequences and transitions as well as salient themes. A dual coding approach will be used: a first inductive round based on emerging themes relating to the research questions and a second round sensitised by quantitative findings. In the first inductive stage, open codes will be generated based on line-by-line scrutiny of verbatim transcripts uploaded into NVivo. Inconsistencies between coders will be resolved through discussion. Patient and public involvement (PPI) representatives will assist with the analysis of qualitative data; this will include coding a subsample of transcripts following training, and ensuing dialogue.</p>

Independent members include Professor Lucy Yardley (University of Southampton), Dr Thomas Fanshawe (University of Oxford), Dr Edel Doherty (NUI Galway), Mr Graham Rhodes (PPI representative) and Ms Hazel Patel (PPI representative). This is a low-risk trial in which participants in both trial groups are referred to accredited education programmes. There are no rules for early stopping and participants and GPs are not blind to intervention allocation. Thus a separate data monitoring committee is not deemed to be necessary.</p>

Members of the research team will be involved in reviewing drafts of the manuscripts, abstracts and any other publications arising from the trial. The PIs will have final approval on all publications and any press release, where appropriate. Authorship will be determined using ICMJE criteria. On publication of the main findings, participants will be sent a newsletter that describes the results and gives details of whom to contact to ask questions or obtain further information. Newsletters will be prepared with input from PPI representatives. Where appropriate, we will communicate our findings to local and national stakeholders via tailored summaries of the key findings and by presentations at meetings of local and national networks.
