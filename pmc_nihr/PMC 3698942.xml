                <p><bold>Objective</bold> To develop and evaluate a best practice model of general hospital acute medical care for older people with cognitive impairment.</p>
                <p><bold>Design</bold> Randomised controlled trial, adapted to take account of constraints imposed by a busy acute medical admission system.</p>
                <p><bold>Setting</bold> Large acute general hospital in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p><bold>Participants</bold> 600 patients aged over 65 admitted for acute medical care, identified as âconfusedâ on admission.</p>
                <p><bold>Interventions</bold> Participants were randomised to a specialist medical and mental health unit, designed to deliver best practice care for people with delirium or dementia, or to standard care (acute geriatric or general medical wards). Features of the specialist unit included joint staffing by medical and mental health professionals; enhanced staff training in delirium, dementia, and person centred dementia care; provision of organised purposeful activity; environmental modification to meet the needs of those with cognitive impairment; delirium prevention; and a proactive and inclusive approach to family carers.</p>
                <p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold> Primary outcome: number of days spent at home over the 90 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes: structured non-participant observations to ascertain patientsâ experiences; satisfaction of family carers with hospital care. When possible, outcome assessment was blind to allocation.</p>
                <p><bold>Results</bold> There was no significant difference in days spent at home between the specialist unit and standard care groups (median 51 <italic>v</italic> 45 days, 95% confidence interval for difference â12 to 24; P=0.3). Median index hospital stay was 11 versus 11 days, mortality 22% versus 25% (â9% to 4%), readmission 32% versus 35% (â10% to 5%), and new admission to care home 20% versus 28% (â16% to 0) for the specialist unit and standard care groups, respectively. Patients returning home spent a median of 70.5 versus 71.0 days at home (â6.0 to 6.5). Patients on the specialist unit spent significantly more time with positive mood or engagement (79% <italic>v</italic> 68%, 2% to 20%; P=0.03) and experienced more staff interactions that met emotional and psychological needs (median 4 <italic>v</italic> 1 per observation; P&lt;0.001). More family carers were satisfied with care (overall 91% <italic>v</italic> 83%, 2% to 15%; P=0.004), and severe dissatisfaction was reduced (5% <italic>v</italic> 10%, â10% to 0%; P=0.05).</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Specialist care for people with delirium and dementia improved the experience of patients and satisfaction of carers, but there were no convincing benefits in health status or service use. Patientsâ experience and carersâ satisfaction might be more appropriate measures of success for frail older people approaching the end of life.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <sec>
                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>We recruited patients admitted for acute medical care to a large British National Health Service hospital providing sole emergency medical services for its local population. Suitable patients were identified on the acute medical admission unit and were randomly allocated between the specialist unit and standard care. Randomised patients were subsequently approached for recruitment to the study. This approach was necessary so that patients could be moved from the admission unit to wards at any time of day or day of the week at the pace required for the efficient operation of the hospital yet allowing sufficient time for patients to be recruited ethically.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>Participants were aged over 65, and identified by physicians in the admissions unit as being âconfused.â We used the term âconfusedâ as there is considerable overlap between delirium and dementia in this population,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> presentation to emergency care is usually with undifferentiated confusion rather than a specific diagnosis,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> dementia is often undiagnosed in the community and hospital,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and skill in mental health diagnosis is sometimes poor in acute medical settings. Patients with a clinical need for another specialist service (such as critical care, surgery, or stroke unit) were excluded. We recruited a family member or carer, if available and willing, to act as an informant. A carer was defined as a non-professional who saw the patient for at least an hour most weeks.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>Potentially suitable patients were entered on a computerised screening log and, if a bed was available on the specialist unit, randomised 1:1 between the unit and standard care in a permuted block design, stratified for previous residence in a care home. Readmitted patients were assigned their original allocation. The randomisation sequence was concealed from clinical staff who allocated patients, but as recruitment took place after randomisation, research staff who collected baseline data were not blind to allocation.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Intervention and control</title>
                <p>Regardless of allocation, patients had access to standard medical and mental health services, rehabilitation, and intermediate and social care. Physical restraints were never used.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Standard care</title>
                  <p>âStandard careâ wards included five acute geriatric medical wards and six general (internal) medical wards. Practice on geriatric medical wards was based on comprehensive geriatric assessment, and staff had general experience in the management of delirium and dementia. Mental health support was provided, on request, from visiting psychiatrists on a consultation basis.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome was the number of days spent at home (or in the same care home) in the 90 days after randomisation. This composite outcome took account of death; time spent in hospital, re-admissions, inpatient rehabilitation or intermediate care; or new placement in a care home. We chose 90 days as the time frame over which the consequences of short term hospital intervention might unfold.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and data collection</title>
                <p>After allocation to a ward, research staff identified patients who had been randomised and assessed them for capacity to give consent to take part in the study. Those with capacity who agreed and gave written consent were asked for permission to allow us to invite a carer to take part. Most potential participants lacked capacity, in which case a carer was asked to agree to participation. If there was no available carer, a nurse was asked to act as a âprofessional consulteeâ in accordance with English mental capacity law. We excluded patients admitted to the wards who had not been randomly allocated.</p>
                <p>A researcher collected information through interviews with the patient, family members, or other informal or professional carers. Medical and nursing notes were scrutinised for diagnostic, drug, and functional information. Researchers were extensively trained in data collection procedures and underwent periodic co-observation.</p>
                <p>Baseline data included social and demographic information; presenting medical problems; recent use of health services; cognitive impairment<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; delirium diagnosis and severity<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>; physical disability before the acute illness and at admission <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; behavioural and psychological symptoms<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>; quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); medical diagnoses (based on Charlson comorbidity index<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and drugs taken on admission.</p>
                <p>Structured non-participant observations of the experience of care on study wards were undertaken by using dementia care mapping.<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Two trained researchers observed the care of 90 randomly subsampled participants. Observations were made every five minutes for six hours per patient. Clinical staff were not aware of which patient was being observed. Quantified mood and engagement scores, activity, noise, and staff interactions that met or disregarded patientsâ emotional and psychological needs (âpersonal enhancersâ and âpersonal detractorsâ) were recorded, according to strict definitions. Inter-rater reliability was assessed throughout the study and was satisfactory (Cohenâs Îº 0.50-0.85).</p>
                <p>One of two senior geriatricians assessed process of care on a random sample of 205 sets of case notes and recorded the presence or absence of 132 items of assessment, treatment, communication or planning. Inter-rater reliability was tested and was satisfactory (Îº 0.57-0.82).</p>
                <p>Research staff who were not involved in recruitment or collection of baseline data and who were blind to allocation carried out outcome assessments. Carersâ satisfaction with hospital care was ascertained through telephone calls one to three weeks after discharge. Health outcomes were ascertained at interview with the patient and carer at home 90 days (Â± 7 days) after randomisation. Routine health services records were examined for information on service use, mortality, and readmission.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>We compared baseline characteristics between the two groups and used Mann-Whitney or Ï<sup>2</sup> tests to test for significance as chance was not the only possible explanation for any differences observed because of the randomisation and recruitment process. Outcome analyses were by intention to treat and compared differences between the specialist unit and standard care on primary and secondary outcomes. Stata version 11.2 was used (Statacorp, College Station, TX). âDays spent at homeâ is a variable with a large proportion of zeros (those who did not return home). We analysed this using both a Mann-Whitney test and also a two part model to allow adjustment for baseline covariates. The two part model estimated the effect of allocated group on the probability of returning home (with logistic regression) and the amount of time spent at home for those participants who returned home (with Î² regression<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Other outcomes were analysed with multiple linear, logistic, negative binomial, and Cox regression, as appropriate to the error distribution of each outcome variable. In each case, adjustment was made for prespecified prognostically important variables (age, sex, residence, cognitive impairment, activities of daily living, number of comorbidities) and variables with an imbalance between groups at baseline. We compared data on process, carersâ satisfaction, and patientsâ experience using Mann-Whitney and Ï<sup>2</sup> tests.</p>
                <p>Analysis of health status outcomes for surviving participants used multiple imputation for missing data: 50 imputed datasets were created and estimates combined across datasets with Rubinâs rules.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> There were no substantial differences between analyses that used imputation and those that used complete cases only. </p>
                <p>Potentially different effects in prespecified subgroups were examined by considering interaction terms.</p>
                <p>To calculate the sample size we used data on number of days spent at home from a previous cohort study in a similar population.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Among 245 participants in that study, 24% did not return home after the initial admission, and days at home were negatively skewed for participants who returned home. Our calculation assumed that we would use a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to explore the overall effect of the intervention on days at home. Three hundred participants in each group gave 80% power to detect a probability of 0.566 or more that a participant from the specialist unit would have more days at home than a participant randomised to standard care. We used simulation to explore how this translated into plausible effects of the specialist unit. It equated to an increase in the proportion of participants returning home from 76% randomised to standard care to 80% randomised to the specialist unit, plus a five day increase in median days at home for those participants returning home from the specialist unit.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

                <p>Between July 2010 and December 2011, 310 patients were recruited from the specialist unit and 290 from standard care (fig 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>). One hundred and seventy four (29%) were recruited on the day of admission, 354 (59%) the following day, the rest in the next two days. Median time to transfer from the admission unit was one day (interquartile range 0-1) for both groups. Recruitment rate was slightly higher on the specialist unit (71% <italic>v</italic> 66% of those randomised). Those not recruited were of similar age, sex, and area of residence (postcode), but care home residents assigned to the specialist unit were more likely to be recruited than those assigned to standard care (73% <italic>v</italic> 56%). Four hundred and sixty two participants lacked mental capacity, 227 (73%) assigned to the specialist unit and 235 (81%) assigned to standard care. Recruitment with a professional consultee was 30 versus 31, respectively. Follow-up was completed in March 2012.</p>

                <p>Family carers of patients randomised to the specialist unit were significantly more satisfied with overall care, nutrition, dignity and respect, the needs of confused patients being met, and discharge arrangements. Most carers were very or mostly satisfied, but there was a tail of severe dissatisfaction in both groups, which was about twice as frequent in standard care (table 5<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5"/>). Health status outcomes, carer strain, and carersâ psychological wellbeing were no different between groups 90 days after randomisation (table 6<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6"/>).</p>

              <p>In this comparison between older patients with cognitive impairment managed on a specialist medical and mental health unit or on standard care wards there were no significant differences in days spent at home or other health status outcomes. Patientsâ experiences, however, were better, and family carers were more satisfied with care on the specialist unit.</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
                <p>The main strengths of this study were that we tested a realistic intervention that demonstrated good practice and evaluated it in a pragmatic manner, despite the difficulties of undertaking a clinical trial in a pressurised acute medical admissions system. The main weakness was that this required compromises in trial design that could have introduced bias. The hospital had high bed occupancy: keeping beds empty on the specialist unit, or keeping patients waiting for research assessments on the admissions unit, was impossible. The design violated best practice for a randomised trial by recruiting participants after randomisation but was similar to a Zelen design.<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This led to imbalances at baseline for some prognostically important variables, which we adjusted for in the statistical analyses, resulting in differences between unadjusted and adjusted estimates of the intervention effect and the possibility of residual confounding. Collecting follow-up data was not easy for frail participants who frequently moved around the health and social care system, and we relied on proxy reports for much information. Some data were missing, and we used imputation to include all cases when possible. As the first randomised controlled trial in this specialty, the study was powered to detect relatively large effects, and we might have missed moderate sized effects. The observed difference of six extra days at home would be clinically important, as would the 8% observed absolute reduction in new care home placement. The 95% confidence intervals for the primary and many secondary outcomes are compatible with clinically worthwhile benefits. The six day difference in median days at home between the two groups was not significant because the power calculation assumed there would be a small increase in the proportion of participants returning home from the specialist unit (as observed) but also an increase in the median number of days spent at home (location shift) for those returning home (which was not observed). Multiple outcome measures are necessary in the evaluation of complex interventions as services have multiple objectives. This raises the possibility of chance associations, although the direction of differences was consistent and in the expected direction. We did not measure some potentially important outcomes, such as incident delirium. Dementia care mapping observations were unblinded, but observers followed rigid rules to minimise bias at the cost of potentially understating the extent of differences.</p>

                <title>Context and interpretation</title>
                <p>This is the first randomised trial of a specialist medical and mental health unit for older people.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Slaets et al described a pseudo-randomised trial, which suggested a reduced length of hospital stay.<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Non-randomised evaluations have supported this, but evidence is limited.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Other outcomes have not been systematically explored.</p>
                <p>The specialist medical and mental health unit was an ambitious and mature intervention, taking 18 months to develop, and successfully implemented best current practice. We assumed that better recognition and management of medical and psychiatric diagnoses, prevention of delirium and other complications, improved wellbeing and communication, more timely planning, and better follow-up arrangements would reduce length of stay, readmissions, and care home placement,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> but the benefits we observed were modest and could have occurred by chance. Most âstandard careâ was on specialist older peoplesâ wards delivering comprehensive geriatric assessment,<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> although process measures showed that the intervention was different from control. The failure to produce marked improvements in health status outcomes was probably due to frailty and the inexorable progression of dementia and underlying diseases. Our primary outcome, days at home, was also dependent on social care, family choices, and community health services outside the control of the hospital. Mortality was high and not significantly reduced by the intervention, suggesting that many patients were reaching the end of their life, when the objectives of care focus on dignity and positive experience rather than survival and restoration of function. It can be argued that for this population experiences of care and carersâ satisfaction are outcomes of equal importance to more conventional health status,<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> making our findings important and residual poor patient experience and carer dissatisfaction worthy of further attention.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Implications and future work</title>
                <p>If the improvements in quality of experience and care we found are believed to be worth having, healthcare providers and funders are set a challenge as investment was required to achieve these improvements. A full economic analysis is required, but we found no evidence that increased staffing costs might be offset by reduction in hospital use. The intensity of intervention on the specialist medical and mental health unit was beyond that likely to be provided by older age psychiatry liaison services, which have also been promoted as resource saving,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> calling into question their ability to improve outcomes markedly or reduce costs.</p>
                <p>The findings require replication to determine whether such units have moderate but clinically worthwhile health benefits and because the study was done in a single hospital in a country with well developed but resource constrained health and social care systems, which might not apply elsewhere. Some commentators have suggested that the whole model of acute hospital care is inappropriate for frail older people,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> but we found that most patientsâ experience of hospital was positive (or at least neutral), and caregivers were satisfied with hospital care. A minority of patients in both settings, however, experienced predominantly negative mood or disengagement, had unmet psychological needs, or had carers who remained dissatisfied with care. Work is needed to understand these patients. They are likely to be those who persistently vocalise, become agitated or aggressive, are apathetic, are at high risk of falls, or are approaching the end of life. More innovative interventions are required to ensure optimal care for these patients, who are often difficult to look after.</p>
