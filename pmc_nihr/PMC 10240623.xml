                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>A range of evidence for the effectiveness of one-to-one peer support in mental health services is emerging. Levels of engagement with peer support vary with limited studies showing few individual participant characteristics predicting engagement. Implementation factors that might predict engagement have not been considered.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section2-00207640221148090">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Data were analysed from the intervention arm of the ENRICH trial of one-to-one peer support for discharge from acute psychiatric inpatient care. Two outcomes were considered: (1) a measure of ‘engaged with peer worker’; (2) number of face-to-face contacts with peer worker post-discharge. Two sets of independent variables were analysed against each outcome: (1) pre-randomisation participant characteristics; (2) implementation factors measured pre-discharge. Analyses used logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models according to outcome structure.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Data were analysed for 265 participants randomised to peer support who had a known peer worker. Non-heterosexual participants had increased odds of engaging with peer support compared to heterosexual participants, <italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 4.38 (95% CI: 1.13, 16.9, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .032). Longer duration of first contact with peer worker (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.04, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; .001) and more relationship building activities in the first contact (<italic toggle="yes">OR</italic> = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.85, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .004) were associated with greater odds of engaging with peer support. Analysis of number of contacts post-discharge showed consistent findings.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Implementation of peer support should include a focus on relationship building in the first session of peer support. The potential for peer support to break down barriers to accessing mental health services experienced by people from marginalised communities warrants further investigation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Peer support in state funded or regulated mental health services is often delivered one-to-one by peer workers; people with personal experiences of using mental health services, employed and trained to offer support to others receiving care for similar mental health difficulties. Qualitative research has consistently reported positive experiences of the impacts of peer support (<xref rid="bibr12-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gidugu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Walker &amp; Bryant, 2013</xref>). Evidence is mounting for the effectiveness of one-to-one peer support in mental health services, with a recent systematic review indicating that peer support can lead to modest but significant improvements in personal recovery (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) of 0.22, 95% Confidence Internal (CI) (0.01, 0.42), based on 593 participants from three trials) and empowerment (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI 0.04, 0.42, 519 participants from four trials) (<xref rid="bibr37-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">White, Foster et al., 2020</xref>). However, no significant effects were observed for hospitalisation, psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, satisfaction with services, social functioning, social network support or working alliance, and numbers of studies remain small and of variable quality (<xref rid="bibr37-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">White, Foster et al., 2020</xref>). This mixed picture lacks clarity for policy makers and as a guide to implementing peer support into mental health services.</p>
              <p>Data from recent trials have indicated a range of rates of engagement with peer support. In two trials of peer support for people at discharge from psychiatric hospital, 45.8% (22 of 48) (<xref rid="bibr26-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">O’Connell et al., 2018</xref>) and 63% (40/63) (<xref rid="bibr32-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>) of participants respectively took up a minimum of one session of peer support. In studies of community-based peer support, 72.4% (160/221) of participants took up at least three of the peer support sessions on offer in one trial (<xref rid="bibr22-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>), with 75.4% (86/114) of participants taking up a least four sessions in another (<xref rid="bibr23-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Mahlke et al., 2017</xref>). Average number of sessions attended per participant as a proportion of maximum or target number of sessions on offer also varies, from 15.4% (mean of 6 out of a maximum of 39 on offer) in one of the hospital discharge trials (<xref rid="bibr32-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>), to 46.9% (mean of 12.2/26) (<xref rid="bibr23-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Mahlke et al., 2017</xref>) and 70% (median of 7/10) (<xref rid="bibr22-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>) in the community-based trials. With studies not reporting further analysis of these data, this variation alone warrants investigation.</p>
              <p>There is limited literature exploring levels of engagement with peer support and outcome. In an analysis of service use data from people attending a peer-based recovery service for people with a diagnosis of substance use disorder, a positive association was observed between number of peer- supported follow-up sessions attended and recovery capital score (<xref rid="bibr1-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Ashford et al., 2021</xref>). A per-protocol analysis from a trial of a peer specialist intervention for people with mental illness and substance use disorders indicated that participants with high engagement with peer support (12 contacts or more) were more likely than control group participants to show positive change in psychiatric symptoms compared to participants with low engagement (<xref rid="bibr4-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Chinman et al., 2018</xref>). A small amount of research to date has explored factors that might predict levels of engagement with peer support. A study of peer support among homeless veterans with mental health conditions and substance use histories found that neither participant socio-demographic characteristics nor mental health and substance use severity were predictive of engagement (<xref rid="bibr9-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Ellison et al., 2016</xref>). In a randomised controlled trial of peer specialist services, also for homeless veterans, higher hope for the future, shorter period spent homeless prior to being offered peer support, higher severity of self-reported substance use symptoms and higher level of mental health service use were all associated with engagement with peer support (<xref rid="bibr5-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Chinman et al., 2019</xref>). These studies did not explore any association between how peer support was delivered and engagement.</p>
              <p>Literature on the values and principles underpinning peer support is clear that choice and control over engaging with peer support is core to the distinctive nature of the peer support relationship (<xref rid="bibr15-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2017</xref>). If people choose not to engage or continue with peer support once they have been offered it, there remains a need to better understand how peer support might be offered in a way which is more engaging and therefore potentially more effective. This echoes a wider mental health literature indicating how strength of therapeutic relationship is predictive of the effectiveness of many mental health therapies and interventions (<xref rid="bibr17-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Priebe &amp; Mccabe, 2008</xref>). In addition, it has been argued that the peer-to-peer relationship should also be grounded in shared experiences of marginalisation related to community (including gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age and religion), especially where people are excluded from mental health services (<xref rid="bibr10-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner &amp; Kalathil, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Hope &amp; Ali, 2019</xref>). Questions about potential association between outcomes and this ‘matching’ of peer workers and participants (<xref rid="bibr28-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Pfeiffer et al., 2011</xref>) remain unanswered.</p>
              <p>Our study aims to address these questions in order to optimise engagement and, potentially, the outcomes of one-to-one peer support in mental health services.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We conducted a multisite, individually randomised controlled trial (ENRICH) of peer support for discharge from inpatient to community mental health care, with the full methods described elsewhere (<xref rid="bibr13-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2020</xref>). The trial recruited 590 participants who were currently psychiatric inpatients with a previous recent admission, randomising half (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 294) to one-to-one peer support for discharge in addition to care as usual (CAU; follow-up from community mental health services post-discharge), and half (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 296) to CAU only. Participants allocated to peer support were offered at least one face-to-face contact with a designated peer worker while still in hospital, and then 10 weekly contacts followed by three fortnightly contacts post-discharge. Peer workers had all completed manualised training and provided flexible support focused on building individual strengths and connection to community (<xref rid="bibr13-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
              <p>Participants offered peer support were no less likely to be readmitted to inpatient care in the year post-discharge – the primary outcome – compared to those in the CAU group (relative risk (RR) 0.97 95% CI 0.82, 1.14; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .68) (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>). A Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis (<xref rid="bibr7-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Dunn et al., 2015</xref>) compared participants who had had at least two contacts with their peer worker, at least one of which was in the community post-discharge, with a subgroup of similar participants in the CAU group (identified using all baseline participant data). These criteria were developed with the study’s Lived Experience Advisory Panel – people with direct experience of peer support – and reflected the principle of choice in peer support (i.e. choosing to meet away from the restrictive environment of the ward) (<xref rid="bibr18-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmith et al., 2019</xref>). We found that participants who met these criteria were significantly less likely to be readmitted in the year post-discharge than similar participants not offered peer support (RR 0.88 95% CI 0.76, 0.99) (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
              <p>This association between amount of contact with peer support and outcome emphasises the importance of better understanding the process of engagement with peer support. We also found that Black participants who were offered peer support had lower odds of being admitted to hospital compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 0.40 (95% CI 0.17, 0.94)) than were participants of any other ethnicity (OR 1.12 (95% CI 0.77, 1.63)); interaction <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .031) (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>). While we did not match participants to peer workers by ethnicity, it is of interest to explore whether incidental matching was predictive of engagement. This paper reports two analyses which aim to identify pre-randomisation and pre-discharge predictors of engagement with peer support.</p>

                <title>Data</title>
                <p>Two dependent variables were examined: (1) ‘engaged with peer worker’, defined in the CACE analysis (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>) as having had at least two contacts with the allocated peer worker, one of which was in the community following discharge; (2) number of face-to-face contacts with peer worker post-discharge. Data were attained from structured questionnaires and standardised measures collected at a baseline interview prior to randomisation, electronic patient record extracted by site information management personnel for the 12 months pre-index admission, and a contact log completed by peer workers using an online survey after each attempted contact.</p>
                <p>At baseline socio-demographic data for each participant were collected, and standardised assessments made of social inclusion using the Social Outcomes Index (SIX) (<xref rid="bibr30-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Priebe et al., 2008</xref>), severity of symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (<xref rid="bibr27-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Overall &amp; Gorham, 1962</xref>), hope for the future using the Herth Hope Index (<xref rid="bibr20-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Herth, 1992</xref>), treatment stigma using the stigma subscale of the Barriers to Care Evaluation (BACE-3) (<xref rid="bibr6-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Clement et al., 2012</xref>), and internalised stigma using the Questionnaire on Anticipated Discrimination (QUAD) (<xref rid="bibr11-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gabbidon et al., 2013</xref>). The QUAD scale produces two measures of anticipated stigma, severity (mean of all items) and count of life areas where stigma has been anticipated. Number of psychiatric admissions in the year prior to index admission, and type of index admission were extracted from patient records. Using the contact log, peer workers indicated which of a list of activities were covered in each contact. Based on our theoretical model (<xref rid="bibr16-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2015</xref>), we calculated a variable ‘relationship building’ as a count of the activities ‘using your own lived experience’, ‘learning from the lived experience of the person you are supporting’, ‘negotiating (or renegotiating) the boundaries in your relationship’, ‘accompanying or being alongside the person you are supporting’ and ‘using active listening skills’ recorded as having taken place in the first peer support contact (range of 0–5).</p>
                <p>Pre-randomisation predictor variables were; index admission type (compulsory/voluntary), sexual orientation (heterosexual/not heterosexual/declined to answer), gender (male/female), diagnostic group (psychosis/personality disorder/other non-psychotic), ethnicity (Black/Other), age (years), social inclusion (SIX), severity of symptoms (BPRS), hope (HHI), number of admissions in year prior to index admission, treatment stigma (BACE-3), severity of anticipated stigma and count of life areas of stigma (QUAD). Ethnicity data were dichotomised as any Black ethnicity and any other ethnicity because being of Black ethnicity has been shown to be a significant predictor of psychiatric readmission (<xref rid="bibr19-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Halvorsrud et al., 2018</xref>) (our primary outcome) and because, as noted above, Black participants offered peer support were significantly less likely to be readmitted compared to control than participants of any other ethnicity (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
                <p>Pre-discharge predictor variables were: same gender, same age (within 18–35, 36+ age groups), same ethnicity (within Asian, Black, White, other ethnic groups) and same diagnosis (within diagnostic groups as above) as allocated peer worker; relationship building at first contact with peer worker (equal to 0 if no contact with peer worker); length of first contact with peer worker (minutes, equal to 0 if no contact with peer worker); days between recruitment and discharge; whether the participant had two or more peer worker contacts pre-discharge.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Logistic regression was used to model the relationship between the two groups of predictor variables and the ‘engaged with peer support’ dependent variable. Results are reported with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression was used to model the relationship between the two groups of predictor variables and the number of face-to-face contacts post-discharge. The dependent variable had a high proportion of zero values (zero-inflated) – participants who, for a range of reasons, might have either chosen or been unable to continue to meet their peer worker post-discharge – and a skewed distribution with a few very high values (over-dispersed). ZINB regression models the two parts of the distribution using two linked models; the first estimates the odds of a zero count (zero face-to-face contacts post-discharge) using logistic regression reported with ORs (odds of zero contacts), the second estimates the non-zero counts (number of face-to-face contacts post-discharge) using negative binomial regression reported by incidence rate ratios (IRR), both with 95% bootstrapped percentile confidence limits (BPCL).</p>
                <p>A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the pre-randomisation predictors models due to missing data and a high correlation between two of the predictors.

              <p>This study aimed to identify whether pre-randomisation (participant characteristic) or pre-discharge variables (peer support characteristics) were predictive of either ongoing engagement with peer support or number of peer support sessions post-discharge. We observed little association between participant characteristics and engagement with peer support. Participants who identified as non-heterosexual had significantly higher odds of engaging with peer support post-discharge than heterosexual participants. Notwithstanding low numbers of participants in this group, we note a lack of research explicitly exploring mental health peer support among LGBTQ+ people (<xref rid="bibr10-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner &amp; Kalathil, 2012</xref>). Other research has indicated that people who identify as LGBTQ+ are reluctant to disclose their sexual orientation to healthcare providers (including primary care and mental healthcare providers), with evidence suggesting that LGBTQ+ people can continue to feel pathologised because of their sexuality (<xref rid="bibr2-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Bachmann &amp; Gooch, 2018</xref>), and as a result are less likely than heterosexual people to access care that meets their needs (<xref rid="bibr8-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Durso &amp; Meyer, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr33-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Salway et al., 2018</xref>). We also note that Black participants might have been less likely to engage with peer support, while still benefitting more from the intervention than people of other ethnicity (<xref rid="bibr14-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2022</xref>). This could reflect heterogeneity resulting from grouping together Black ethnicities, but suggests a need to investigate further the experiences and understandings of peer support in different cultural contexts. Other research has indicated that peer support offers a different sort of relationship to a typical patient-clinician relationship, enabling disclosure more generally (<xref rid="bibr16-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2015</xref>). As such our findings raise the possibility that people who experience marginalisation in mental health care might find it easier to engage with, and/or open up to peer workers than to other mental healthcare providers.</p>
              <p>Findings from elsewhere that higher baseline hope scores were associated with a greater level of subsequent engagement in peer support (<xref rid="bibr5-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Chinman et al., 2019</xref>) were not replicated in our study. Research has indicated a positive association between hope and intention to seek both informal and formal psychological help (<xref rid="bibr25-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">McDermott et al., 2017</xref>). We note that mean values for hope were lower in the inpatient population in our study than they were for participants in <xref rid="bibr5-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Chinman et al. (2019)</xref> community-based study, that relative lack of optimism in our sample perhaps accounting for some lack of enthusiasm for peer support, possibly indicating that the timing of the offer of peer support was challenging for this group of people.</p>
              <p>We observed more associations between pre-discharge characteristics of peer support, and engagement with peer support post-discharge. Longer first contact with peer worker was associated with engagement with peer support and, correspondingly, with less likelihood of having no contacts post-discharge. A higher number of relationship-building activities in that first contact was similarly associated with ongoing engagement with peer support, suggesting that a first session of peer support with a clear focus on relationship building may lead to improved engagement and potentially better outcomes. Our earlier research was indicative of the importance of relationship building as a peer support mechanism (<xref rid="bibr16-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bibr15-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This informed an emphasis on relationship work in peer worker training and in the supervision of peer workers by an experienced peer, as specified in the intervention handbook for the trial (<xref rid="bibr24-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 2021</xref>). The importance of role specific training for peer workers has been widely noted (<xref rid="bibr34-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Simpson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Tse et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we found no association between having multiple contacts with the peer worker pre-discharge and ongoing engagement, while a longer duration between recruitment into the study and discharge was associated with lower odds of remaining engaged with peer support and fewer contacts in total post-discharge. This felt counter-intuitive as more opportunities to meet with the peer worker before discharge might be assumed to enhance relationship building. It is possible that this longer length of stay on the ward reflected a frustrating period of delayed discharge, or a prolonged period of acute mental distress for those individuals, with associated challenges to building a relationship with the peer worker.</p>
              <p>We also found no association between matching of participant to peer worker (incidental rather than planned in our study) – in terms of either age, gender, ethnicity or diagnostic group – and engagement with peer support. This is despite research suggesting that peer identification in mental health encapsulates wider aspects of shared identity beyond experiences of mental distress (<xref rid="bibr10-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner &amp; Kalathil, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Hope &amp; Ali, 2019</xref>), and studies reporting peer support targetting specific clinical groups (<xref rid="bibr3-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Pfeiffer et al., 2011</xref>). As such we saw people engaging in peer support ‘across difference’, again raising the possibility that there is something about the quality of the peer-to-peer relationship – perhaps in contrast to the patient-clinician relationship – that encourages ongoing engagement independent of the identities of the individuals involved.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths of this study were our a priori identification of potential predictor variables grounded in empirical and theoretical research in the field, and our ‘engaged in peer support’ criteria we developed with our lived experience advisory group. Confidence in our findings was enhanced by the complementarity of our analyses; pre-discharge predictors of being engaged with peer support were all supported by either the zero-inflation or count model of number of peer support contacts post-discharge.</p>
                <p>Missing data in some baseline variables was a potential weakness of the study, although sensitivity analysis indicated that findings remained robust when measures with missing and highly correlated variables were removed. Low numbers of participants in some groups, particularly, for example, participants identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, suggest that some of our estimates should be treated with caution and seen as avenues for further study, rather than definitive findings. We also note that the socio-demographic categorisation we used for sexual orientation and ethnicity were incomplete and limited our analyses. Incomplete contact logs by peer workers at one site also potentially undermined reliability of findings. Finally, this was a quantitative study; qualitative research exploring people’s experiences and views on engaging with peer support would help interpret these findings.</p>

                <title>Implications for practice</title>
                <p>Given our findings around an association between length and quality of first peer support contact and ongoing engagement with peer support, a focus on relationship building in peer worker training, supervision and guidance for the crucial first session should inform peer support practice in mental health services going forward. However, our findings also suggest that leaving inpatient care might be a difficult time for people to build and sustain a new relationship. The approach to peer support we developed was very flexible, encouraging peer worker and participant to agree how they worked together, choosing from a range of tools (<xref rid="bibr13-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Gillard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Marks et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that people might have benefitted from a more structured and explicitly supportive approach, including a more structured first session to support relationship building, introducing flexibility as the relationship developed.</p>
                <p>In addition, our findings with respect to sexual orientation, ethnicity and the lack of association between incidental matching and engagement suggest that peer support has the potential to work ‘across difference’ (limitations in our data notwithstanding). These findings raise the possibility that peer support might offer additional benefits to people who may feel marginalised, unheard or discriminated against by mental health services. Mental health services struggle to address inequalities in access, experience and outcomes of care for people from marginalised communities (<xref rid="bibr19-00207640221148090" ref-type="bibr">Halvorsrud et al., 2018</xref>), and as such, support and training for peer workers to work with diversity and break down barriers to communication and relationship building in mental health care would seem to offer an opportunity to address, at least in part, historic inequities in care.</p>
