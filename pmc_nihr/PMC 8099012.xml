              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Dementia represents a major and growing challenge for patients, their families, health and social care systems and society as a whole. In 2016, the global number of dementia cases was 43.8 million [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and annual global costs of dementia (mostly from informal and social care) could grow to $2 trillion by 2030 [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dementia is also the most common single reason for care home entry [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as progression of cognitive and functional impairment and the expression of risky behaviours undermine ability to live independently with safety. Quality of life for people with dementia worsens following care home placement [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Maximising the time people with dementia can spend in their own homes represents the most economically efficient long-term care model [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and has become the stated policy in many care systems, including in the UK [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Assistive technology (AT) refers to electronic or mechanical devices that can support independence and improve quality of life by assisting with daily living activities, reducing harmful risks and improving communication. Devices used in dementia care can be broadly categorised as reminder or prompting devices, monitors and detectors to support safety, safer walking technologies, communication devices and devices to support use of leisure activities [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Telecare uses a combination of monitored alarms, sensors and other equipment to help people live independently [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Largely on the basis of data from uncontrolled project evaluations [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], assistive technology and telecare (ATT) has been promoted to support people with dementia to live independently [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Whole Systems Demonstrator included a large randomised clinical trial (RCT) of telecare in the UK and found no overall reduction in people having to move into care homes, although people with dementia were not specifically recruited to the trial [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Meta-analysis of two small and short randomised controlled trials in people with dementia found no significant delay of care home entry with ATT [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>We carried out a pragmatic RCT, Assistive Technology and Telecare to maintain Independent Living At home in people with dementia (ATTILA trial), to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ATT in supporting people with dementia to continue to live safely within their own homes.</p>

                <title>Patients and procedures</title>
                <p>Participants were people diagnosed with dementia or cognitive difficulties sufficient to suggest dementia, who met English Social Services’ eligibility criteria for Fair Access to Care Services and were consequently entitled to receive services [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], were living in the community (including sheltered/supported and very sheltered/supported accommodation) within 11 local authority areas in England, and had a working telephone line. Exclusion criteria were: current receipt of an ATT intervention, previous unsuccessful installation of ATT and an identified urgent need for a home care package. Informed written consent was obtained from participants and from caregivers who provided data.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The trial compared outcomes in participants randomised, on a one-to-one allocation, to receive: (1) an ATT needs assessment, followed by installation of indicated ATT devices and response services (ATT Intervention), or (2) ATT needs assessment, followed by installation restricted to only smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and a pendant alarm, if indicated (ATT Control) <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Co-primary outcomes were time to residential care entry and cost-effectiveness [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Secondary outcome measures included burden and quality of life in unpaid carers, the number and severity of serious adverse events and data on acceptability, applicability and reliability of ATT packages.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the UK National Health Service Health Research Authority National Research Ethics Committee (Reference 12/LO/186) and was registered (ISRCTN86537017).</p>

                <title>Trial end-points and assessments</title>
                <p><italic>Time in days from randomisation to institutionalisation</italic> was defined as time to permanent transition from living in participant’s own home to a nursing or residential care home or admission to an acute care facility that resulted in permanent move into a residential care or nursing home. <italic>Cost-effectiveness:</italic> We examined the incremental cost of community-based support: per institutional day avoided (days to institutionalisation), per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) lived in the community and per minimum clinically important difference (of 0.074) in the EQ-5D index [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. EQ-5D index scores (utilities) were available from both participant and caregivers. Analyses took a health and social care perspective and a societal perspective (costs to participant and caregiver, including out-of-pocket payments for home adaptations, ADL equipment, travel to appointments and opportunity costs of providing unpaid care).</p>
                <p>Secondary trial outcome assessments included the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Model of Human Occupation Screening Tool (MOHOST) [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] at baseline. Additional outcome measures were participant’s quality of life measured with the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and unpaid caregiver outcome measures including the Zarit Burden Inventory [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the State Trait Anxiety Inventory [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the Short Form Health Survey [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and the Carer Technology Acceptance Questionnaire [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>Analyses were by intention to treat, with all randomised participants included in the comparison and analysed according to their randomised allocation, including those who discontinued the trial. <italic>Time to institutionalisation</italic> was compared between intervention and control arms using survival analysis methods. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were created for graphical representation of the time to event comparisons. Statistical significance was determined by the log rank test. Analyses included all events, even those occurring after 2 years. Participants who died, withdrew from follow-up or were lost to follow-up were censored at the date of withdrawal from the study. Continuous outcome measures were analysed using repeated measures regression techniques to maximise statistical power.</p>
                <sec id="sec7">
                  <title>Costs and cost-effectiveness analyses</title>
                  <p>Costs were calculated on the basis of caregiver-reported service use over the prior 3 months at baseline, 12, 24, 52 and 104 weeks, attaching nationally applicable unit cost measures to health and social care use for each participant using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The costs of the intervention were calculated drawing on information from key informant interviews, nationally applicable unit costs and price information from procurement frameworks provided by the Northern Housing Consortium [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Costs and days in the community were discounted at 3.5% annually [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Mixed effects linear difference-in-difference models compared the between-group difference in EQ-5D scores [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and average 3-month costs over the follow-up relative to baseline. Analyses of days lived in the community, QALY, total health and social care costs and total societal costs combined group-level estimates from different models (gamma generalised linear model with a square root link for costs, with inverse-probability weights derived from parametric models, [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Weibull accelerated failure time model for days in the community, group-mean utilities to calculate QALY by the integrated quality survival product method) [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Bootstrap standard errors of the estimates of costs, QALY and days in the community (based on 25,000 replications) and of costs and the EQ-5D index (based on 5,000 replications were produced). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed from bootstrapped estimates to depict the probability of cost-effectiveness at a series of threshold willingness to pay for an incremental effect, ranging from £0 to £50,000. This range included the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) threshold of between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY.</p>
                  <p><italic>Sample size estimations</italic> were based on the observation that 50% of participants with a BADLS score of &gt;15 would be expected to have entered residential care after 24 months [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], so that a 30% reduction in the institutionalisation rate from 50% to 35% would require involvement of 500 participants, allowing for 10% attrition due to death whilst still community resident. This would equate to an average of 55 days of longer independent home life for participants receiving the intervention.</p>

The most common reason for entering care was inability to perform activities of daily living, and this was reduced in the intervention group (14 versus 29; <italic>P</italic> = 0.016). Moving to a care home because of safety concerns, which might have been expected to be reduced by ATT, was actually more common in the intervention group (12 versus 4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.043). Wandering, a behaviour whose associated risks might be mitigated by appropriate ATT, was non-significantly reduced as a reason for entering care in the intervention group (5 versus 13; <italic>P</italic> = 0.054).</p>

Allocation groups did not differ significantly in QALYs derived from proxy-reported EQ-5D at any point. There were no significant differences in 24-week, 52-week and 104-week censor-adjusted health and social care and societal costs between intervention and control participants (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A10</xref>).

              <p>ATTILA is the first randomised controlled trial of ATT in people with dementia, which was powered to detect moderate benefits associated with the use of the technology. We found provision of home-based technology, installed following an individual needs assessment within current practice in England, had no significant effect on the time that people with dementia were able to continue to live independently in their own homes. There was no evidence of cost-effectiveness in terms of days lived in the community, impact on health-related quality of life or QALY based on proxy-reported EQ-5D, from the health and social care or societal perspective. The ATT intervention group attained fewer QALY, based on participant-reported EQ-5D over 104 weeks, than the control group.</p>
              <p>Optimising the care of people with dementia within their own homes, to delay or reduce transition to alternative care settings, is preferred by people with dementia; this maintains higher quality of life [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], costs less [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and is a public health imperative [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A major role for ATT and robotics in augmenting human care provision in the homes of people with dementia is anticipated [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], yet there are very little available data on the effectiveness, safety and costs of the technology [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Currently available technologies have focussed on monitoring well-being, safety, physical activity and social participation, but robotic devices to assist with physical care, social support and mobility, and therapeutic technologies to improve social participation are also being actively marketed [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
              <p>ATTILA aimed to answer a simple but important question: would the provision of a full package of ATT increase the length of time that people with dementia were able to live safely and independently in their own homes, compared to provision of a very basic package? Whilst the results indicate that a full ATT package did not extend the time lived in the community, the planned survival analyses could not control for all the factors that might underlie the difficult decision to enter residential care. When the reasons for moving into care were compared between trial arms (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Appendix A3</xref>), participants allocated to the full ATT package were less likely to move because of wandering or loss of activities of daily living function, but more likely to move because of concerns about safety at home. Although the number of participants moving for each of these reasons was small within the overall trial, differences between trial arms provide evidence that ATT may be able to reduce the risks associated with some of the common reasons for a move to care in a small number of people. It is also possible that the provision of a full ATT package leads to an increased awareness of safety concerns with consequent shortening of independent living. This could also underlie reductions in QALY based on participants’ own ratings in the intervention group. Qualitative work, undertaken as part of the study, found that people with dementia and their caregivers sometimes experienced the technology as disruptive to their daily lives.</p>
              <p>Rates of admission to care in people with Alzheimer’s disease are influenced by functional ability. In our analyses, we found a highly significant effect of Baseline BADLS score on time to admission to care. Participants with a higher Baseline BADLS (indicating more impairment of function) were more likely to be admitted to care (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Unfortunately and by chance, there was an imbalance in Baseline BADLS scores between participants in the intervention and control arms. More participants in the intervention arm had lower BADLS scores (indicating less impairment of function). Consequently, we adjusted for this difference at Baseline in the primary analysis.</p>
              <p>ATT installation to meet imposed performance targets can reduce accurate matching of technology to need, [<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and the assessor's understanding of technology and need can be suboptimal [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We have reported elsewhere the outcomes of the ATTILA standardised needs assessments in terms of the ATT components that were recommended for participants, and that there was limited fidelity of technology recommendation to the ATTILA needs assessment [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This finding is a potential major limitation and the trial’s negative results need to be viewed in this light. ATTILA was, however, a large and pragmatic trial, which examined the effectiveness of ATT in a real-world setting within which technology is currently deployed to support people with dementia living in their own homes. Our results are likely to be generalisable to real world settings within which ATT is used.</p>
              <p>We recognise several limitations to generalisability of results from this study. Blinding to allocation of participants and assessors was not undertaken as this would not have been feasible and would have been a potential source of bias. Although we obtained data from caregivers, recall bias could have affected the precision and size of cost estimates. Estimation of costs in intervals not covered by the cost collection instrument assumed constant use of most services between intervals (although ED and hospital admission costs reflected use during those intervals). Participant-reported EQ-5D ratings were missing in substantial numbers at follow-up. The analyses of QALY drew on group mean utilities at each time point and did not adjust for baseline characteristics. The finding that the ATT intervention group had lower QALYs on the participant-reported EQ-5D-5L must be interpreted with caution, given the substantial rates of attrition on that measure.</p>
              <p>Our data suggest that it would be premature to conclude that more extensive ATT systems to support independent home living for people with dementia are clinically important or cost-effective compared to more basic systems. This may be because basic ATT such as carbon monoxide and pendant alarms are themselves effective in preventing harms, or because more extensive ATT systems are inadequately supported by providers, or inadequately tailored to the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
