                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Most people living with dementia want to remain living in their own homes and are supported to do so by family carers. No interventions have consistently demonstrated improvements to people with dementia’s life quality, functioning, or other indices of living as well as possible with dementia. We have co-produced, with health and social care professionals and family carers of people with dementia, a new intervention (NIDUS-family). To our knowledge, NIDUS-family is the first manualised intervention that can be tailored to personal goals of people living with dementia and their families and is delivered by facilitators without clinical training. The intervention utilizes components of behavioural management, carer support, psychoeducation, communication and coping skills training, enablement, and environmental adaptations, with modules selected to address dyads’ selected goals. We will evaluate the effect of NIDUS-family and usual care on goal attainment, as measured by Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) rated by family carers, compared to usual care alone at 12-month follow-up. We will also determine whether NIDUS-family and usual care is more cost-effective than usual care alone over 12 months.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">A randomised, two-arm, single-masked, multi-site clinical trial involving 297 people living with dementia-family carer dyads. Dyads will be randomised 2:1 to receive the NIDUS-family intervention with usual care (<italic>n</italic> = 199) or usual care alone (<italic>n</italic> = 98). The intervention group will be offered, over 1 year, via 6–8 video call or telephone sessions (or face to face if COVID-19 restrictions allow in the recruitment period) in the initial 6 months, followed by telephone follow-ups every 1–2 months to support implementation, with a trained facilitator.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Increasing the time lived at home by people living with dementia is likely to benefit lives now and in the future. Our intervention, which we adapted to include remote delivery prior to trial commencement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to address barriers to living as well and as independently as possible that distress people living with dementia, exacerbate family carer(s) stress, negatively affect relationships, lead to safety risks, and frequently precipitate avoidable moves to a care home.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par32">Most people with dementia want to remain living in their own homes and are supported to do so by family carers. In the UK, 61% of people with dementia live in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, care at home often breaks down, necessitating a move to a care home, which can be sudden. Challenging or distressing behaviours leading to family carer stress, challenging relationships with home care services, poor self-care, and home safety risks are common reasons for this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par33">NHS England’s Well Pathway for Dementia and other national initiatives stress the importance of promoting independence for people living with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Living well with dementia has been conceptualised as living with quality of life, choice, autonomy, dignity, and as independently as possible. To our knowledge, only two interventions have demonstrated efficacy in enabling people with dementia to remain in their own homes for longer, to date. Both were delivered in the USA, by clinically trained staff. They were individually tailored and goal focussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par34">In stream one of the NIDUS study, we carried out qualitative interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and worked with our public and patient involvement (PPI) co-production group and practitioners, to develop the theoretical model underpinning our intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to support people with dementia to attain goals they and their family carers considered critical to living as well as possible at home. The intervention is fully manualised and modular, so it can be tailored to the needs of each dyad. Modules draw on behavioural management techniques, enablement strategies, communication, carer support, and psychoeducation strategies, with material selected from existing interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and newly developed by the coproduction group. We tested the feasibility of the intervention with 14 people living with dementia/family carer dyads. We found it to be acceptable to participants, and we used these findings to modify the training and intervention booklets in preparation for the full trial, based on feedback from participants receiving the intervention and the researchers delivering it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">Our NIDUS-family intervention is delivered to people with dementia and family carers by NIDUS facilitators (graduate psychologists/social researchers with relevant experience but without formal clinical training) with supervision, training, and clinical oversight, so it can be widely implemented and give value if effective.</p>
                <p id="Par36">We originally planned to deliver the NIDUS-family intervention face-to-face to people in their homes; however, just before the trial started, lockdown restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic were imposed in the UK. Following discussion with our PPI members and project management team, we adapted delivery to online video or telephone sessions, so participants could continue to receive it until it is deemed safe for researchers to meet with participants face-to-face. We also adapted our intervention content, specifically to signpost to remote rather than face-to-face services, to acknowledge the restricted options for outdoor activity and the stresses of living through the pandemic lockdown. Most psychological interventions (NHS and research) for people living with dementia are being delivered remotely at the time of writing due to the needs for social distancing during the pandemic. This has illustrated the possibilities of remote delivery as well as challenges. Interventions can be potentially delivered in people’s homes very cost-effectively through video calling or over the telephone, and catchment areas can be widened. Not everyone has access to video calling, however, and engaging dyads over telephone alone may be particularly challenging.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Eight-five percent of people asked by the Alzheimer’s Society said they would want to stay at home for as long as possible if diagnosed with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The purpose of our intervention, to increase the time lived at home, and life quality of people living with dementia by supporting them and their family carers, is all the more pertinent in the current climate, with provision of support services diminished by the COVID-19 restrictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We have selected Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) as our primary outcome, asking dyads to set goals that reflected what they considered most important in enabling them to live as well and as independently as possible at home. GAS can detect individualised, clinically meaningful outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], through measuring the extent to which individual patients or their families meet goals that they set. It has been used across many types of interventions and several conditions with heterogeneous outcomes, including dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], where it has been the primary outcome in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) recommends the development of dementia care plans that address physical and mental health, communication arrangements with secondary care, and identification of a carer in primary care and a face-to-face review every year; in practice, around half of people living with dementia in the UK have a documented annual review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par73">The intervention is delivered over a 1 year period: 6–8 manualised sessions within the first 6 months, by video call/telephone (with potential for face to face when COVID-19 restrictions permit), followed by catch-up calls every 1–2 months (at preference of participating dyad) to review progress towards goals and troubleshoot any difficulties for the remainder of the intervention period. The manualised sessions are tailored to participant’s preferences and needs for staying independent at home. In session one, the facilitator explores the participant’s identified goals and maps them to a menu of training modules, based on their priorities and concerns around maintaining independence at home. They also explore their support networks and identify gaps, sign-posting participants to existing resources and services. The modules include information and strategies addressing the following areas:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par74">Accepting care, arranging, and planning for the future</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par75">Communicating with people living with dementia, family, and professionals</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">Managing behaviours and challenging behaviours</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">Managing physical health conditions</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">Exercise, activity, and mobility</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">Managing low mood, anxiety, and apathy</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">Carer wellbeing and support</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par81">Safety, environment, telecare, strategies supporting functioning at home</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par82">Relaxation and stress management strategies</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par83">Sleep, diet, and healthy routines</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par84">Each of these modules, if selected, is completed over 1–3 sessions; so, we anticipate most dyads will have the opportunity to complete between 2 and 4 modules. At the final appointment (the 6th, 7th or 8th session depending on the needs and preference of the dyad), the facilitator brings together old and new strategies that have worked to help the participant formulate a final action plan. They then conduct telephone calls every 1–2 months to offer support and guidance on implementing strategies and to troubleshoot any problems. Sessions are delivered to family carers and people living with dementia together or to the family carer alone. This is agreed with each dyad (depending on their goals and circumstances) so that the most appropriate arrangement is made for each session for each dyad.</p>
                  <p id="Par85">The University College London (UCL) and University of Bradford (UoB) employed facilitators have been trained to deliver the NIDUS-family intervention to people living with dementia at home and their family carers. The intervention delivery training is provided by members of the research team (including an old age psychiatrist (CC), clinical psychologists (MP/PR) and the trial manager (AB), and research network volunteers from the Alzheimer’s Society (MO, DS). Initial training took place over 9 days face to face between January and March 2020. Taught content included clinical skills, taught by a clinical psychologist, with most of the time spent role-playing the sessions to practice delivery and troubleshoot scenarios that might arise. Role plays were conducted within the UCL/UoB research teams, and facilitators also role played sessions with PPI representatives with experience of caring, who then gave feedback to the research team. Facilitators were signed off to deliver the first intervention session, subsequent intervention sessions, and the final intervention session using written sign off sheets completed by members of the research team delivering the training. Facilitators attend group supervision with a qualified clinical psychologist every two weeks and can access individual support between formal supervision sessions if needed.</p>

The intervention is currently being delivered online/by telephone as opposed to face-to-face in response to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure participant and facilitator safety. The psychosocial intervention has been assessed as low risk; therefore, we have not set criteria for discontinuation; however, participants may decide to discontinue the intervention sessions or withdraw from the project at any point. If participants decline the intervention at any point, they will be asked if they would still wish to meet with the researchers completing outcome assessments. Although it will be stressed that participants can withdraw at any time without giving a reason, any assessments that have been collected to that point will be retained and contact with participants will be maintained unless researchers are told otherwise. All contacts with participants and reasons for withdrawing from the intervention or study will be documented on the study database.</p>

Should a family carer withdraw from the intervention, we will explore the possibility of involving a second family carer, and, if they are eligible and willing, we would consent them into the trial and invite them to complete the primary outcome (GAS) and other proxy complete follow-up questionnaires, but not the follow-up questionnaires that relate to family carer wellbeing. We will record and report where these adaptations are made to support retention of participants in the trial. Facilitators will receive guidance in the form of intervention protocols and manuals. Throughout the trial, facilitators will be supervised to ensure adherence to protocol, with weekly update and monitoring meetings. Audio recordings of 20% of intervention appointments will be used to assess fidelity to the intervention manual, and details of how these will be rated are below.</p>

Trained researchers will work with family carers and people living with dementia to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) goals across domains including: cognition, instrumental activities of daily life/self-care, mood, behaviour, and mobility. Family carers will evaluate ‘performance’ of the person living with dementia (or carer wellbeing if the goal relates to this) on a minimum of three and maximum of five goals set at baseline, on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘much worse’ to ‘much better’ than expected. As people will have different goals and numbers of goals, a summary formula standardises the degree of goal attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], analysed as a change score. We will calculate GAS for people with dementia who have died, using procedures outlined by Gordon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Where death was unexpected, attainment in each domain will be rated as − 2. Where death was expected (we exclude clients who are considered to be in their last 6 months of life, but circumstances can change and we follow-up clients for 1 year), goals will be rated as achieved prior to death.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par148">To our knowledge, this is the first manualised intervention tailored to personalised goals of people living with dementia and their families, delivered by facilitators without clinical training. GAS, our selected primary outcome, can detect clinically meaningful outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], through measuring the extent to which individual patients or their families meet the goals that they set. Our approach of using GAS as both an outcome measure and to directly inform a non-pharmacological intervention for people living with dementia and their families, and to train non-clinical staff to set goals, is novel.</p>
              <p id="Par149">GAS can serve as a co-intervention, where setting a goal is key to achieving it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For this reason, various means of modifying the process have been developed, including standardised, protocol-specific training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and semi-standardised menus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which we will employ. Limitations of GAS include the sometimes cumbersome process of setting and adjudicating individual goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and a current lack of good quality validity studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. While there will be heterogeneity in goals set, this is remedied through its employment in a randomised controlled trial, with masking of who has received the intervention, and with patient assignments to treatment arms occurring only after goals have been set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par150">There have been operational issues associated with the shift to remote delivery. We worked collaboratively with Rockwood’s team to ensure the goals we set using GAS were SMART, including being achievable and relevant to the uncertain COVID and post-COVID world. A particular concern was to avoid goals where achievement would be dependent on lifting of lockdown restrictions. Researchers received additional training in delivering remote interventions and supporting participants to set up video calls. We have considered carefully how to support researchers delivering the intervention from their own homes and to ensure the boundaries of sessions are maintained in this new format; regular clinical supervision has been key to addressing this. Session content has also been adapted, as discussed in the ‘Introduction’ section. Remote delivery means that the format of our intervention is further from that delivered in our feasibility trial than originally intended. In the light of COVID-19, there have been considerable recent efforts to explore how remote and face-to-face psychological intervention delivery may differ in their impacts; one review reported minimal to no difference between telephone and face-to-face therapy in terms of the nature of the interaction between the therapist and client [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], but more information will emerge as we assimilate knowledge from the sudden shift to remote delivery in spring 2020. The usual care received by all participants will also have shifted to mainly remote delivery during lockdown, and social care receipt will have reduced. While we could not have envisaged the huge shifts to telecare the pandemic has enforced, NIDUS-family was always intended as a pragmatic intervention, comparing tailored, structured additional support sessions to usual care. The pragmatic and flexible nature of the intervention has enabled us to continue evaluating it throughout this period.</p>
