                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Stillbirth rates in the United Kingdom (UK) are amongst the highest of all developed nations. The association between small-for-gestational-age (SGA) foetuses and stillbirth is well established, and observational studies suggest that improved antenatal detection of SGA babies may halve the stillbirth rate. The Growth Assessment Protocol (GAP) describes a complex intervention that includes risk assessment for SGA and screening using customised fundal-height growth charts. Increased detection of SGA from the use of GAP has been implicated in the reduction of stillbirth rates by 22%, in observational studies of UK regions where GAP uptake was high. This study will be the first randomised controlled trial examining the clinical efficacy, health economics and implementation of the GAP programme in the antenatal detection of SGA.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">In this randomised controlled trial, clusters comprising a maternity unit (or National Health Service Trust) were randomised to either implementation of the GAP programme, or standard care. The primary outcome is the rate of antenatal ultrasound detection of SGA in infants found to be SGA at birth by both population and customised standards, as this is recognised as being the group with highest risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes include antenatal detection of SGA by population centiles, antenatal detection of SGA by customised centiles, short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes, resource use and economic consequences, and a process evaluation of GAP implementation. Qualitative interviews will be performed to assess facilitators and barriers to implementation of GAP.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This study will be the first to provide data and outcomes from a randomised controlled trial investigating the potential difference between the GAP programme compared to standard care for antenatal ultrasound detection of SGA infants. Accurate information on the performance and service provision requirements of the GAP protocol has the potential to inform national policy decisions on methods to reduce the rate of stillbirth.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">The rate of stillbirth in England and Wales has declined recently from 5.7/1000 births in 2003 to 4.7/1000 in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] but the United Kingdom (UK) rate remains amongst the highest in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Reducing stillbirth is a national priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It has been estimated that up to 57% of babies who die in utero are small for gestational age (SGA) and 9% have placental insufficiency. However, rates are dependent upon which perinatal classification system is used (32.6–57%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">The use of routine screening achieves antenatal detection of SGA in approximately 20–25% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the UK, routine screening involves fundal-height measurements in low-risk pregnancies and serial growth scans in high-risk pregnancies; however, there is variation in risk factors considered and frequency of assessment. Since the publication of the National Health Service (NHS) England ‘Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle’ in 2017, there has been a move towards consistency on risk factor stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other strategies, such as universal third-trimester ultrasound, could increase the antenatal detection of SGA to 57% for nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A population-based study has reported that antenatal detection of SGA may halve the risk of stillbirth through appropriate antenatal surveillance and timely delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This suggests that improvements in the detection of SGA infants could potentially result in further reduction in the incidence of stillbirths.</p>
              <p id="Par26">SGA is traditionally defined as weight below the 10th centile for gestational age and sex according to population references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The development of population-based centiles is an improvement over the use of estimated fetal weight or absolute birthweight to characterise abnormalities of fetal and infant growth. This is exemplified by a 2000-g neonate which will be considered small at term (37–42 completed gestational weeks) but normally grown at 32 weeks. SGA by population birthweight references account only for the physiological effects of gestational age and fetal sex, and it has been hypothesised that there are additional physiological maternal and fetal characteristics that may affect fetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some foetuses, currently defined as SGA, may be appropriately grown for maternal constitution (i.e. the constitutionally small foetus). Other foetuses with impaired growth may still fall within the normal range by population references, particularly if genetically predetermined to be at higher centiles.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The concept of customised fetal growth standards attempts to address these issues and is based on three principles: (1) individualised (adjusted for physiological factors that affect birth weight – maternal height, weight, ethnicity, parity, fetal sex and gestation at delivery); (2) optimised growth potential (excluding pathological factors affecting the weight standard such as smoking and diabetes) and (3) use of fetal growth curves, derived from normal pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. International studies have demonstrated that the use of customised standards identifies additional SGA foetuses, which were not otherwise identified by population standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Infants who are SGA only by customised standards are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including stillbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These studies have also suggested that foetuses that are considered SGA by population references, but not by customised standards, have outcomes similar to those of appropriately grown foetuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A non-randomised study of the use of customised charts for fundal-height measurement and estimated fetal weight demonstrated an increase in antenatal detection of small babies (47.9% vs. 29.2%, odds ratio 2.23; 95%CI 1.12–4.45) when compared to routine care, but did not demonstrate differences in other key perinatal outcomes, including for stillbirth (five vs. four stillbirths: odds ratio 1.14 (95%CI 0.30–4.25) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Implementation of customised charts has also been explored observationally in Australia where a doubling in the detection rate of SGA was demonstrated in nulliparous women, when compared with historical controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">The Growth Assessment Protocol (GAP) is a programme developed by the Perinatal Institute that consists of the use of gestation-related optimal weight (GROW) customised charts, alongside a schedule of antenatal risk assessment for SGA, management protocols for suspected SGA foetuses, audit tools and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. GROW utilises a systematic method of measurement, achieved through standardised training and accreditation, with measurements plotted onto customised fundal-height charts. Estimated fetal weights from ultrasound assessment are also plotted onto these customised fetal growth charts when growth scans are performed. The risk assessment and management protocols were adapted from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green-top Guideline on Investigation and Management of the Small-for-Gestational-Age Foetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The audit tool is aimed at identifying missed cases and assessing the reasons for failure to antenatally recognise the SGA foetus.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The use of the GAP/GROW programme has expanded since its development and is now implemented in 121 (76%) UK Trusts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A study in the UK compared regions with high uptake to regions with low GAP uptake during the period 2008 to 2012, using stillbirth data from the Office for National Statistics’ records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Overall, there was a 22% lower stillbirth rate in the high-uptake regions during the period analysed, compared to static rates in the low-uptake areas, although it should be noted that the low-uptake regions had lower rates to begin with (4.86 stillbirths/1000 births vs. 5.63/1000 births in the high-uptake regions) and ecological comparisons such as these cannot be assumed to reflect an effect of GAP and may instead reflect a number of changes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, the Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries across the UK (MBRRACE-UK) Perinatal Mortality Surveillance Report (2013) confirms a gradual decline in stillbirth rates across the UK over a similar period (the decade up to 2013), and attributes this to Sands (the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death charity) raising awareness of a number of initiatives designed to reduce stillbirth rates, and/or to new guidance from the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in redefining which stillborn babies require registration (i.e. not those known to have died in utero prior to the end of the 24th gestational week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">It is widely recognised that the highest level of evidence for intervention effectiveness is obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and a Cochrane review has highlighted that these are currently lacking in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A RCT to accurately assess the GAP programme is, therefore, imperative and timely. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data on the effect of GAP on other maternal and neonatal outcomes such as caesarean section rates, induction of labour, gestational age at delivery or on the use of clinical resources including ultrasound scan appointments, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and lengths of maternal or neonatal stay in hospital. These outcomes may have a significant health-economic impact which must also be balanced against any improvement in perinatal outcomes (stillbirth, early neonatal death, serious neonatal morbidity).</p>
              <p id="Par31">We propose a cluster RCT to evaluate the GAP programme as a strategy for improving the antenatal detection of SGA, including an evaluation of the GAP implementation and a health economic assessment. This protocol (version 7.0, dated 18 January 2018) has been written and reported according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidance and Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1-S2).</p>

                <p id="Par32">The objectives are to: (1) determine whether implementation of the GAP programme will result in an improved detection of SGA by ultrasound; (2) investigate the effect of the intervention on short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes; (3) estimate the impact of GAP on clinical service provision and health economics and (4) assess fidelity and quality of implementation, acceptability and identify contextual factors associated with variation in the effect of GAP.</p>

                <title>Trial design and setting</title>
                <p id="Par33">A cluster RCT will compare the detection rates of SGA in hospitals randomised to the GAP programme to those randomised to standard care (local policy for screening and detection of abnormal fetal growth); see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Maternity units (some containing more than one site) were approached on the basis that they were willing to introduce GAP into their unit and were willing to be randomised to the intervention (immediate implementation of GAP) or standard care (implementation delayed at least until the trial ends). Maternity units randomised to standard care agreed that they would continue with current practice until the completion of the data collection period, at which point they will have the opportunity to implement GAP. Each UK Trust within the study forms a cluster. We intend to test superiority of the GAP in the antenatal detection of SGA by ultrasound.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Diagram of expected procedures in participating clusters in the intervention and standard care arms</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3242_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par34">A cluster RCT design has been chosen due to the nature of the intervention. The GAP programme requires culture change and retraining of multidisciplinary maternity care staff; it is, therefore, not feasible to partially implement GAP in a hospital and randomise individuals to either study arm. The RCT was planned with the majority of the sites in London, since uptake of the GAP programme in this region was low at the start of the trial and the London maternity network had recommended the use of GAP regionally as a strategy to reduce stillbirth rates which were higher than the national average (5.3/1000 in 2013 compared to 4.8/1000 in 2013 in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]).</p>
                <p id="Par35">This is a pragmatic trial for which the intervention will be introduced by the clinical care team with the support of the Perinatal Institute (the only providers of training in GAP/GROW).

In the absence of GAP, primary screening for anomalies of fetal growth in the UK commonly includes fundal-height measurements that are either plotted onto (non-customised) antenatal growth charts or approximated to the gestational period. Approximation to the gestational period refers to McDonald’s rule, the number of centimetres is expected to approximately equal the gestational age in weeks (± 2–3 cm). The population chart in clinical use in the standard care arm was not pre-specified.</p>
                  <p id="Par39">The equation used to calculate the estimated fetal weight based on ultrasound biometry was not pre-specified in the study protocol for either arm of the trial, but Hadlock is the most commonly used in the UK.</p>

                <p id="Par43">We have already recruited 13 clusters to the trial. The first eight clusters committing to participate were divided into two strata of four clusters each according to their size (number of deliveries during the year 2013–2014). Two further strata (of three and then two) clusters were subsequently defined for clusters that agreed to participate in the study at later dates. For the stratum of size 3 it was randomly determined that two clusters would be allocated to intervention and one to control rather than vice versa, and in all other strata allocation was equally to intervention and control, so that, in total, seven clusters have been allocated to intervention and six to the control. Within-strata allocation to intervention and control was by random permutation using Stata v14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Due to the nature of the intervention, concealment is not possible.</p>

These meetings support implementation and provide a forum for Trusts to share experiences and solutions. Research meetings with site leads are being held throughout the study period to ensure continued engagement with the research project for provision of data for trial purposes. Regular email correspondence and newsletters are distributed to all cluster sites.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Pre-specified requirements for cluster compliance with GAP comprise: (1) identification of a local multidisciplinary GAP team; (2) a pre-specified proportion of staff who have completed training and (3) confirmation that local guidelines and audit are in line with GAP recommendations. A minimum of 75% staff should receive face-to-face training and be e-learning compliant. Both the Perinatal Institute and the trial team will support non-compliant clusters to discuss strategies to improve compliance with GAP. If these clusters remain non-compliant by the time of data collection, despite attempts to comply, they will still be analysed as randomised to GAP in the intention-to-treat analyses, but the lack of compliance will be acknowledged in other analyses (see the ‘<xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Analysis methods</xref>’ section).</p>
                <p id="Par46">Retention and compliance in units randomised to standard care is maintained through regular contact via site visits, newsletter and review of changes in clinical guidelines which may have an impact on the detection of SGA infants (e.g. implementation of the NHS England Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]).</p>

In this trial, we are focussed on the antenatal detection of those infants who weigh less than the 10th centile for gestational age on both population and customised growth charts at birth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

                <title>Sample size – power calculation</title>
                <p id="Par49">A minimum target sample size of 12 clusters (six per arm) was set based on information collected during protocol development. First, we assessed that the mean births per cluster per year in a sample of London maternity Trusts likely to participate in the trial was 5053. We assumed a 10% rate of SGA by a single definition. Pooled estimates from previous studies suggest that 75% of SGA infants defined by customised standards are also SGA by population references and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, we estimate a SGA rate by either definition (customised or population) of 12.5% and 60% of these babies (7.5% of total sample) will be SGA by both definitions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par50">During the trial outcome period (minimum of 4 months) we anticipate a mean of 42 babies to be SGA by customised standards only; 42 SGA by population references only; and 126 SGA by both definitions per cluster based on the assumptions above (see Distribution – Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Further details of this assumptions are provided in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1-S2. However, we have explored the impact on power of fewer babies meeting both SGA definitions, defined as a mean of only 84 SGA babies per cluster in the unlikely extreme scenario where the number of infants in the overlap is reduced by a third. Published reporting using detection during standard antenatal care suggest that, regardless of whether population or customised standards are used to define SGA at birth, around 20% of SGA births are detected antenatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

                <p id="Par51">We were unable to identify reports of an intra-cluster correlation coefficient for detection of SGA; therefore, a coefficient of the most approximate outcome (fetal growth restriction) was used (0.019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A cluster size of 126 SGA infants (by customised standards and population references) and six clusters in each arm provides 84% power to demonstrate superiority of GAP at the 5% significance level (two-sided test) for our primary outcome. In the alternative unlikely scenario of only 84 SGA infants by both definitions per cluster the design provides 79% power.

                  <p id="Par57">The analysis will acknowledge the clustering of individual participants by centre. Due to the modest number of clusters the analysis will be performed using a cluster-summary statistic approach, i.e. calculating the proportion with the primary outcome for each cluster and comparing these values between intervention and standard care arms and presenting 95% confidence intervals for the average difference. Adjustment will be made for key characteristics of the individual participants, e.g. age, parity, ethnicity to account for imbalance between arms that might occur from the randomisation of only a modest number of clusters. An adjusted cluster summary value of the primary outcome will be generated for each cluster for both the trial period and the baseline (i.e. pre-trial) period. Then, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analysis will be conducted to compare intervention and control clusters accounting for differences at baseline. The primary analysis will be on a modified intention-to-treat basis, in which any Trusts in the intervention arm that did not contact the GAP provider to initiate training and implement the intervention in the study period due to changes in local strategy are excluded, since such changes are not considered informative concerning how GAP would have performed in the Trust. In addition, we will conduct an intention-to-treat analysis including all Trusts as randomised. This sensitivity analysis will not be influenced by potential differences between a Trust that is randomised to the GAP arm but does not register to use it, compared to those that do use it, which could confound the effect estimate. A further secondary analysis will be conducted under a per-protocol approach restricting analysis of the intervention arm to clusters that complied with GAP (as defined in the ‘<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Retention and compliance</xref>’ section).</p>

                  <p id="Par60">The economic evaluation will draw on patient-level clinical resource use (e.g. use of ultrasound) with data extracted from the hospital records combined with data on the primary clinical outcome to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of GAP. National and locally applicable unit costs will be used to cost resource-use identified for each patient, and subsequently to evaluate the difference between the pregnancy and neonatal care costs, between the intervention and control sites. We will also evaluate the impact of costs relating to additional activities required for successful implementation of the GAP protocol on conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness, including the cost of training clinical teams and on-going costs associated with monitoring adherence to the GAP protocol.</p>
                  <p id="Par61">The economic evaluation will be carried out from the NHS hospital (NHS Trust) perspective and will, therefore, exclude measurement of wider resource use linked to activities that are not undertaken by Trust maternity or neonatal care teams, e.g. use of community-based primary care services.

                  <title>Monitoring for potential harms</title>
                  <p id="Par67">The non-medicinal intervention being tested in this trial is not expected to have side effects and is already widely adopted across the UK. Nevertheless, we shall monitor for harms due to the intervention, or its implementation within the trial, as for the sites concerned this is a new method of patient care. The intervention comprises measurement of fundal height and prompt referral for ultrasound where needed. Side effects of fundal-height measurement may consist of maternal discomfort due to the semi-recumbent position required and discomfort due to increased skin sensitivity. Ultrasound is a mechanical wave and can theoretically increase the temperature in the studied tissue. The Doppler ultrasound uses higher energy and focusses on a smaller volume of tissue, resulting in greater changes in temperature. In a clinical obstetric scenario, however, the increase in temperature is less than 1 °C, which is not considered clinically significant. The World Health Organisation performed a systematic review of 61 publications on the subject and reported no association with adverse maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Both components of the intervention are used in different levels in routine care; therefore, any of the above cannot be strictly assigned to the intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Adverse events may occur and may be attributed to incorrect use of the GAP programme. As an example, mistakes in the manual plotting of fundal height on any chart could lead to missed referrals and ultimately the potential for a serious adverse event (SAE). The audit of missed SGA cases and the review of all stillbirth cases will be performed locally in each cluster as recommended by GAP. Any event associated with misuse of GAP will be reported as an adverse event in the trial. Any serious adverse events recognised by the sites because of the intervention (which result in death, life-threatening conditions or prolonged hospitalisation) must be reported to the sponsor within one working day of the investigator becoming aware of the event. Both the site clinical team and the sponsor should investigate the SAE for causality. The trial team will also record instances of concerns raised by either staff or participants at intervention sites relating to the intervention or how it is implemented.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par70">This study will provide the first evidence from a RCT into the effect of implementing the GAP programme, compared to standard care, on the identification of SGA measured by ultrasound scan. The study is powered for detection of SGA babies, and not for stillbirth rates. Although a study to show differences in stillbirth is ultimately desirable, it is unfortunately not feasible to power such a trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] due to the infrequency of this event and hence very large sample size required. It is widely recognised that antenatal detection of SGA is associated with reduction in stillbirth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par71">The primary outcome for this trial has been chosen following consensus agreement from the co-investigators and independent reviewers. It is recognised that there is an overlap between SGA defined by customised and population standards. The group of infants meeting criteria for both definitions are at the highest risk of morbidity/mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Detection of these babies is crucial. Focussing on this overlapping group addresses the issue that GAP was not developed to detect SGA by population standards, and vice versa.</p>
              <p id="Par72">Customised standards have been criticised because some factors (namely maternal weight and ethnicity) might contribute to differences in birth weights due to pathological, rather than physiological, mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The Perinatal Institute recommends the adjustment for maternal weight based on their report that, in women with a Body Mass Index (BMI) within the normal range (20–25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), variation in maternal weight was not associated with increased risk of perinatal mortality. In women with BMI &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the rate of perinatal mortality was correlated with SGA using customised standards but not population references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, cause-specific perinatal mortality may differ by maternal BMI. The influence of ethnicity is more complex due to the known association between ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], which is associated with antepartum stillbirth risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The INTERGROWTH-21st study recruited low-risk, well-nourished women of optimal health, education and socioeconomic status in urban sites with low levels of pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and showed similarities in fetal growth (as assessed by head circumference) and newborn length in those pregnancies studied across eight international and multi-ethnic sites. In contrast, work using the Canadian Stillbirth Registry reported that when using population standards, women of Chinese and South Asian ethnicity have higher rates of SGA, when compared to native ethnicities, but lower rates of perinatal mortality. In the same group, the rate of SGA was lower and concordant with the prevalence of perinatal mortality when neonates were assessed using customised, rather than population growth, standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. More recently, the World Health Organisation has published new fetal growth charts that do acknowledge differences in fetal growth between women of different ethnicities, heights, weights, ages and parity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. According to this evidence, adjustment for ethnicity may improve the detection of SGA infants at risk of morbidity and mortality, irrespective of any indirect adjustment for the pathological influences such as socioeconomic conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par73">In the UK, there is a high-level ambition to reduce the rate of stillbirths, arising from the RCOG and the Department for Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Maternity clinical networks and local maternity systems are currently recommending several interventions aimed at reducing rates of stillbirth in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. One theme of the national stillbirth recommendations is reduction of SGA-related stillbirth by improved detection of SGA. The GAP programme is the most widely adopted of the available potential solutions, leaving few available sites for recruitment into this trial. We therefore also face the last opportunity to conduct a prospective randomised trial of customised growth charts and the GAP protocol in the UK. Finally, other national initiatives to reduce stillbirth include policies to support smoking cessation, improve intrapartum fetal monitoring and increase reporting of reduced fetal movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Uptake of smoking cessation support is anticipated to impact upon rates of SGA infants, which could affect analysis of our primary outcome, and all initiatives may impact upon several of the secondary outcomes in this trial. Hospitals recruited to both arms of the trial are under external pressure to adopt some of these policies. We are collecting information on all policies introduced which are independent of the intervention during the trial period to evaluate any potential effect of contamination.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Regarding the health-economic analyses, we have considered the usefulness of reporting the costs from a Trust or health service perspective. The current UK payment system uses tariffs, according to a low-/high-risk stratification of individual patients, rather than crude costs for work done. Whilst this will allow us to calculate the cost of the GAP programme to the health service (by estimating any changes to the likely tariff distribution because of GAP), it does not necessarily translate into financial cost to the hospitals themselves from providing resources to implement GAP, or from the implications of implementing GAP on the patients/resources (by affecting rates of SGA diagnosis). This justifies our approach of reporting the health-economic analysis from a Trust perspective.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Regarding the implementation analysis, we anticipate variation between clusters in GAP implementation, including local adaptations to suit available resources (e.g. number of sonographer lists, and the financial resources required to implement the programme). Such variations will need to be placed in context when assumptions are made about external validity. Nevertheless, the implementation study should produce documented evidence of such differences, and by examining these in relation to the logic model produced for the study, we hope to extend understanding of how variations in implementation might affect the impact of GAP in real-world situations.</p>
              <p id="Par76">Overall, we aim to provide high-quality evidence, through a RCT, of the performance and service provision requirements of the GAP protocol. This may have the potential to inform national policy decisions on methods to reduce the rate of stillbirth.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par77">The first eight cluster sites were randomised to either the intervention or control arm on 3 November 2016. A further three sites were randomised in December 2016 and the final two sites randomised in July 2017. Baseline audit and training procedures were then required prior to the use of the intervention in the active clusters. The first cluster sites began to use the intervention in October 2017 and we anticipate that the intervention will continue to be applied to women attending for maternity care at those sites, with the last women to be included in the data collection likely to have the intervention applied in early July 2018. Data will be collected on all babies being born between 1 June and 31 November 2018.</p>
