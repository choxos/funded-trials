                  <title>PURPOSE</title>
                  <p>The contemporary management of early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (ES-HL) involves balancing the risk of late adverse effects of radiotherapy against the increased risk of relapse if radiotherapy is omitted. This study provides information on the risk of radiation-related cardiovascular disease to help personalize the delivery of radiotherapy in ES-HL.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>We predicted 30-year absolute cardiovascular risk from chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy in patients who were positron emission tomography (PET)â€“negative following three cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy within a UK randomized trial of PET-directed therapy for ES-HL. Cardiac and carotid radiation doses and chemotherapy exposure were combined with established dose-response relationships and population-based mortality and incidence rates.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Average mean heart dose was 4.0 Gy (range 0.1-24.0 Gy) and average bilateral common carotid artery dose was 21.5 Gy (range 0.6-38.1 Gy), based on individualized cardiovascular dosimetry for 144 PET-negative patients receiving involved field radiotherapy. The average predicted 30-year radiation-related absolute excess overall cardiovascular mortality was 0.56% (range 0.01%-6.79%; &lt; 0.5% in 67% of patients and &gt; 1% in 15%), whereas average predicted 30-year excess incidence was 6.24% (range 0.31%-31.09%; &lt; 5% in 58% of patients and &gt; 10% in 24%). For cardiac disease, the average predicted 30-year radiation-related absolute excess mortality was 0.42% (0.79% with mediastinal involvement and 0.05% without) and for stroke, it was 0.14%.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Predicted excess cardiovascular risk is small for most patients, so radiotherapy may provide net benefit. However, for a minority of patients receiving high doses of radiation to cardiovascular structures, it may be preferable to consider advanced radiotherapy techniques to reduce doses or to omit radiotherapy and accept the increased relapse risk. Individual assessment of cardiovascular and other risks before treatment would allow personalized decision making about radiotherapy in ES-HL.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Over recent decades, the standard management of early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (ES-HL) has been combined modality treatment including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For favorable ES-HL, this is currently two cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy and 20 Gy involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), giving excellent 5-year survival (&gt; 90% relapse-free and &gt; 95% overall).<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Attention is now focused on reducing late toxicity.

              <p>The UK National Cancer Research Institute Lymphoma Study Group RAPID trial was an RCT in ES-HL designed to test the omission of radiotherapy following a complete metabolic response on fluorodeoxyglucose-PET scans after three cycles of ABVD. Patients achieving Deauville score<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> 1-2 were randomly assigned either to no further treatment (NFT) or to IFRT.

However, considering only the patients who received their allocated treatment, the benefit of radiotherapy was significant (NFT 90.8% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 97.1%, 6.3% absolute reduction, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02).<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Further evidence for radiotherapy benefit was reported for the EORTC/LYSA/FIL H10 and GHSG H16 Trials.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> While PFS is appropriate for assessing the efficacy of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treatment over 3-5 years, an overall assessment of the effect of radiotherapy needs to take late toxicity into account, balancing a proven improvement in initial disease control versus radiotherapy toxicities that may occur beyond 5-10 years and compromise long-term health and survival.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Among HL survivors, cardiac death was, historically, the leading cause of mortality associated with radiotherapy exposure of a single organ.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> While cardiac doses are lower with IFRT than extended-field radiotherapy,<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> no detailed description of doses received by individual cardiac substructures with IFRT has been published, nor have any predictions been made of the resulting cardiovascular risks for an RCT cohort.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study is to quantify the cardiovascular radiation doses received by ES-HL patients given IFRT within a recent RCT and to use them to predict the absolute risk of radiation-related CVD.

Five hundred seventy-one received three cycles of ABVD followed by fluorodeoxyglucose-PET.

                <p>IFRT comprised treating the extent of disease detected by computed tomography (CT) before chemotherapy. There was no intention to treat uninvolved contiguous nodal areas, or entire nodal regions.

Average MHD was higher for females than for males (5.4 <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 2.7 Gy) because of a higher proportion with mediastinal involvement (59% <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> 41%) and, on average, a lower inferior border to the mediastinal radiation field (median level seventh thoracic vertebra in females <italic toggle="yes">v</italic> sixth in males).

              <p>This study reports the cardiovascular radiation doses received by ES-HL patients treated with IFRT within the RAPID trial and uses them to predict 30-year radiation-related cardiovascular risks for patients who were PET-negative after initial chemotherapy. Because of the varied distribution of disease, the doses received varied widely between individuals and so, therefore, did the predicted radiation-related risks. For 67% of patients, the predicted radiation-related 30-year absolute excess cardiovascular mortality risk was &lt; 0.5% and for 58%, the incidence risk was &lt; 5%. Although these risks are low, they are clinically relevant when considered in the context of an expected 5-year relapse-free survival of &gt; 95% for ES-HL. At the other end of the scale, for 15% of patients, the mortality risk was &gt; 1% and for 24%, the incidence risk was &gt; 10%. For all patients, individualized late toxicity risks should be balanced against the 6%-12% absolute benefit in PFS from consolidation radiotherapy observed in three large RCTs.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our study gives a representative picture of cardiovascular risk from IFRT for all patients in the RAPID trial who were PET-negative after initial chemotherapy. Previous dosimetry studies have concentrated largely on patients with more extensive mediastinal involvement and reported techniques to reduce cardiac exposure.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In this study, radiotherapy did not include the mediastinum for more than half the patients and we confirm previous findings that the level of mediastinal involvement is a critical determinant of cardiac dose, largely independent of the radiation techniques used.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> With our methods, the minority of patients receiving the highest radiation doses to the heart and carotid arteries have predicted risks of CVD similar to those seen for historical forms of radiotherapy (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and consistent with results observed from large cohort studies with prolonged follow-up.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In sharp contrast are the 35% who received only unilateral neck irradiation in the RAPID trial for whom the doses to cardiovascular structures, and consequently the predicted risks, are much lower.</p>

              <p>Anthracycline-based chemotherapy approximately doubles the risk of cardiac disease from mediastinal irradiation, even in the presence of lower cardiac radiation doses,<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>-<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and it increases cardiac mortality risk even in the absence of radiotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Anthracycline exposure was therefore included in the models used to predict treatment-related cardiac disease. It is important to recognize that the cardiac risk from chemotherapy in many patients is equal to, or greater than, the risk from radiotherapy. Indeed, we estimate that in the RAPID cohort, the cardiovascular risk from anthracycline exposure exceeded that from radiotherapy in 65% of individuals.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is the number of individuals (n = 247, 144 PET-negative) for whom dosimetry was completed, which is considerably greater than in the largest previous study reporting cardiac doses from IFRT (n = 41).<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Dosimetry was completed on a high proportion of patients receiving radiotherapy within the trial (79%), and comparison of baseline characteristics suggests that this sample is representative of the entire cohort. The study includes patients from 42 radiotherapy centers across the United Kingdom (87.5% of departments within the trial). It is therefore a representative sample of UK practice at the time.</p>
              <p>There are, however, some limitations to this study. First, not all dosimetry was based on individual anatomy, as substitute CT data sets and data interpolation were used to calculate doses for a minority of patients (28%). This is unlikely to affect the average cardiovascular doses and predicted risks substantially, as demonstrated in a recent study.<sup><xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Second, the method used to predict radiation-related CVD has not been prospectively validated, as 20 additional years of follow-up would be required to assess the accuracy of the predictions. Our method is, however, based on the best available epidemiologic evidence regarding the magnitude of the long-term risks of radiation and anthracycline chemotherapy in HL survivors, together with current mortality and incidence rates in the general population. Third, we cannot provide separate risks for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and diabetes. In the future, adjustments to the model could use individual data on cardiovascular risk factors, but such information was not available for this study. Fourth, we did not attempt to model the possible impact of HL relapse in a small proportion of patients or the cardiotoxicity of subsequent treatments, so it is likely that we are underestimating the net benefit of initial radiotherapy. Finally, although we used the dose metrics from the best epidemiologic evidence currently available<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> as the basis for our methods, we recognize the ongoing uncertainty over the radiation dose metric that may best predict the risks of radiation-related cardiac disease and stroke.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The challenge of a personalized approach in ES-HL is to balance the risk of late adverse effects from radiotherapy against the omission of radiotherapy, which in turn increases risk of relapse and necessitates further therapy, perhaps including autologous stem-cell transplantation. If, rather than giving radiotherapy to all patients (or to none) regardless of their individual risk of late effects, radiotherapy were given just to patients predicted to be at lower risk of radiation-related CVD, then a substantial proportion of the benefit in terms of recurrence reduction would remain while fewer radiation-related cardiovascular complications would occur. For example, if the 50% of PET-negative patients at lowest risk of cardiovascular complications received radiotherapy, around 50% of the recurrences that would occur by withholding radiotherapy would be prevented, but only one fifth of the excess cardiovascular mortality from irradiating the whole cohort would be incurred (0.11%, Figs <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, of the total 0.56%, Fig <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). No individual patient's 30-year excess absolute cardiovascular mortality risk from IFRT would exceed 0.26% (Fig <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A) and the therapeutic ratio of the treatment would be improved. Current efforts to identify which individuals have greatest reduction in relapse risk from upfront radiotherapy (eg, using maximal tumor dimension at diagnosis<sup><xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>) may also help to identify patients who would benefit most from combined modality treatment.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that developments in radiotherapy techniques since the RAPID trial, including smaller target volumes,<sup><xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> the use of deep-inspiration breath-hold techniques,<sup><xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> optimized intensity-modulated radiotherapy,<sup><xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and proton beam therapy,<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> have reduced irradiated volumes and radiation doses to normal tissues, especially when combined with a 20 Gy prescribed dose for favorable ES-HL.<sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Radiation-related CVD is not the only late side effect that may be reduced by the omission of radiotherapy. Risks of second cancers and other radiation-related late toxicities such as xerostomia and hypothyroidism, which would also be reduced by a chemotherapy-only approach, are also likely to be lower with contemporary radiotherapy, but a comprehensive assessment of late toxicities goes beyond the scope of this study. Consideration of all the important toxicities of alternative treatment strategies including the toxicity of treating possible HL relapse would likely suggest that an optimal approach will involve irradiating those ES-HL patients who are at lower risk of RT-related toxicity, rather than a strategy advising radiotherapy for all or none, based only on PET response.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, IFRT for ES-HL as given in RAPID is likely to produce a small increase in the long-term risk of CVD. However, the magnitude of the risk varies widely and, for a majority of patients, the benefit of reduced HL relapse substantially outweighs the risk of CVD. With more modern radiotherapy techniques, the cardiovascular radiation doses achieved<sup><xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> would result in even lower predicted risks than those seen for the RAPID cohort. As the sites of disease and degree of mediastinal involvement are known at diagnosis, the radiation doses to cardiovascular organs, and hence the risk of radiation-related CVD, can be estimated when the initial treatment strategy is decided. Such an approach could identify high-risk patients who, because of their predicted radiation-related cardiovascular risk, should be considered for treatment with chemotherapy alone as well as for novel radiation techniques, such as deep-inspiration breath-hold techniques and proton beam therapy, that can minimize cardiac exposure.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> As knowledge increases, a personalized assessment including all relevant risks would be helpful in determining the optimal strategy for individual patients.</p>
