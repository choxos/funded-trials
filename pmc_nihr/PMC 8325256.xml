                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Although Alzheimerâ€™s disease affects around 800,000 people in the UK and costs almost Â£23 billion per year, currently licenced treatments only offer modest benefit at best. Seizures, which are more common in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease than age matched controls, may contribute to the loss of nerve cells and abnormal brain discharges can disrupt cognition. This aberrant electrical activity may therefore present potentially important drug targets. The anti-seizure medication levetiracetam can reduce abnormal cortical discharges and reverse memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Levetiracetam has also been shown to improve memory difficulties in patients with mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Clinical use of levetiracetam is well-established in treatment of epilepsy and extensive safety data are available. Levetiracetam thus has the potential to provide safe and efficacious treatment to help with memory difficulties in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The proposed project is a proof of concept study to test whether levetiracetam can help cognitive function in people with dementia. We plan to recruit thirty patients with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease with no history of previous seizures or other significant co-morbidity. Participants will be allocated to a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial that tests levetiracetam against placebo. Standardised scales to assess cognition and a computer-based touchscreen test that we have developed to better detect subtle improvements in hippocampal function will be used to measure changes in memory. All participants will have an electroencephalogram (EEG) at baseline. The primary outcome measure is a change in the computer-based touchscreen cognitive task while secondary outcomes include the effect of levetiracetam on mood, quality of life and modelling of the EEG, including time series measures and feature-based analysis to see whether the effect of levetiracetam can be predicted. The effect of levetiracetam and placebo will be compared within a given patient using the paired t-test and the analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline values.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is the first study to evaluate if an anti-seizure medication can offer meaningful benefit to patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. If this study demonstrates at least stabilisation of memory function and/or good tolerability, the next step will be to rapidly progress to a larger study to establish whether levetiracetam may be a useful and cost-effective treatment for patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par42">Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The socioeconomic impact is vast. Many patients live for 10 years after diagnosis and the cost per annum for each patient with AD is more than the median UK salary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the only currently licenced treatments for AD offer modest benefit at best. Given the paucity of effect of currently available treatments, finding a novel therapeutic agent for AD represents one of the most pressing of current global health issues.</p>
                <p id="Par43">As well as memory loss, seizures are more frequent in patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In the developed world, the incidence of seizures is highest in the older population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, seizures are three times more common in patients with AD aged 80 than those without dementia and the absolute risk of seizures in people with AD is approximately 10 to 20% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease may also have evidence of abnormal cortical activity detectable with an electroencephalogram (EEG) without having obvious clinical seizures [reviewed in 2]. Similarly, neuronal hyperactivity in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe structures might be an important precursor to cognitive decline in AD [reviewed in 4].</p>
                <p id="Par44">Seizures and seizure-like EEG activity were considered a consequence of the loss of nerve cells in the brain of a patient with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. However, seizures may contribute directly to the synaptic reorganisation, network disruption, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits observed in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Excitotoxicity, as is often observed in seizure-mediated neuronal loss, can cause tau tangle formationâ€”a molecular marker of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Molecular cascades important in AD are also deregulated in epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In older patients with focal cortical dysplasia (a common cause of drug-resistant epilepsy), tau tangles and neuronal loss are observed within the dysplastic cortex, but not in adjacent histologically normal tissue, further suggesting a convergence of molecular processes important in epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par45">All anti-seizure medications aim to achieve therapeutic function by stabilising neuronal networks. Older medications, for example phenobarbitone, had significant adverse effect profiles and could impair cognitive function. Modern anti-seizure medications are much better tolerated and most do not tend to adversely affect cognition, even in older patients [reviewed in 2]. The potent, established anti-seizure medication levetiracetam binds synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and inhibits N-type calcium channels to impede synaptic transmission. Intriguingly, SV2A can contribute causally to late-onset AD by mediating the impact of apolipoprotein E4 on amyloid precursor protein (APP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">Initial trials of levetiracetam in epilepsy recruited more than 1000 patients with significant reduction in seizures compared to placebo (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The drug was well-tolerated with main adverse events being somnolence and fatigue. Subgroup analyses showed that levetiracetam may be particularly efficacious in those aged over 65â€‰years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Levetiracetam has no adverse impact on cognition (including in older subjects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In individuals with AD and seizures, levetiracetam associated with improvements in attention and verbal fluency as well as better seizure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is, however, difficult to determine whether levetiracetam offered additional cognitive benefits beyond that associated with seizure control alone. Also, levetiracetam has no known pharmacokinetic interactions and clinical use over more than a decade has confirmed it to be effective and well-tolerated. Levetiracetam, which is now available as a generic medication, is widely prescribed and there is considerable familiarity with the medication from primary through to tertiary care.

                <p id="Par47">Owing to its lack of drug-drug interactions and favourable cognitive profile, levetiracetam is a preferred medication in older people with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the interest in utilising levetiracetam in AD is founded on animal experiments. Levetiracetam decreases amyloid plaques and alleviates behavioural deficits in an APP-transgenic model of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Levetiracetam has also been shown to reduce abnormal electrographic activity and reverse learning and memory deficits in the human APP-transgenic mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Such effects were not observed with other anti-seizure medications that were tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">Clinical evaluations of levetiracetam in AD have been limited to people with overt clinical seizures. Levetiracetam is effective at controlling seizures and is well-tolerated in people with epilepsy and AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Importantly, levetiracetam can improve memory function in people with mild cognitive impairment at risk of developing AD potentially through changes in hippocampal activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">We therefore propose performing a double-blind proof of concept crossover study to evaluate whether levetiracetam may be beneficial to cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD who do not have epilepsy or a history of seizures. To shorten trial duration, refined measures of cognition will be employed to detect any subtle differences in patients while taking levetiracetam compared to placebo.</p>

Therefore, more sensitive markers of cognition will be employed including a neuropsychological test measuring binding of features which has been shown to be important in memory associated with hippocampal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], including in familial AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We have accounted for a possible attrition of 20% and a cohort of 30 participants is adequately powered to detect a meaningful difference of 0.7 in the hippocampus-dependent memory-binding test.

                <p id="Par100">The selected dose of levetiracetam is informed by well-established clinical practice. A dose of levetiracetam at 500â€‰mg twice daily is generally considered the lowest therapeutic dose for people with overt seizures and is well-tolerated by elderly individuals with epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesise that levetiracetam at 500â€‰mg twice daily will modulate potentially epileptogenic networks. Studies in patients with AD and epilepsy have generally had a mean levetiracetam dose of 1000â€‰mg daily (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and in these studies, this dose has again been well-tolerated.</p>
                <p id="Par101">Trials of levetiracetam in patients with MCI are beginning with dosing of levetiracetam 250â€‰mg twice per day. We hypothesise that in AD the neuronal networks are less stable than in MCI and hence a higher dose of levetiracetam should initially be tested in patients with AD. The dose proposed of levetiracetam 500â€‰mg twice daily is therefore realistic in terms of titration schedule and tolerability and offers the best opportunity to determine if levetiracetam can change cognition through stabilisation of neuronal networks in patients with AD.</p>

                <p id="Par111">All participants will have a baseline EEG. The benefit of EEG in AD is not certain, but novel modelling approaches are gaining traction. By acquiring these data prior to commencing treatment/placebo, we will look to determine whether there are EEG biosignatures that predict responsiveness to levetiracetam.</p>
                <p id="Par112">Blood samples (10â€‰ml for analysis of full blood count, urea, creatinine, electrolytes, liver function tests, blood glucose) and a standard urinanalysis (30â€‰ml urine) will be collected once, at the screening visit. These samples are collected to ensure that there is no evidence of sub-clinical renal or hepatic impairment that may not have been apparent from review of the notes alone. Samples will be disposed of using the disposal facilities of the recruiting site as per standard clinical care. The blood and urine samples are only provided to confirm eligibility and will not be retained.</p>
                <p id="Par113">Randomisation will occur at or shortly after the baseline visit. Levetiracetam and placebo will be packaged with clear instructions to take tablets as outlined (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Each tablet of levetiracetam is 250â€‰mg. Participants will commence on one tablet at night and increase by one tablet every week to two tablets twice daily (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). They will then continue on two tablets twice daily for 4 weeks before reducing by one tablet each week until the IMP is withdrawn. The participant will then cross over to either levetiracetam or placebo, whichever they were not initially allocated to, and complete the same up- and down-titration schedule. Given the short half-life of levetiracetam (6 to 8â€‰h (SMPC)) and the assessment schedule, which includes repeat testing prior to entry into the second arm of the trial, a washout period after the first arm was not thought necessary.

                <p id="Par155">The trial is relatively short and one would not anticipate being able to detect changes in ADAS-Cog over this time-frame. Therefore, the trial is powered to detect a standardised effect of 0.7 in a specific and sensitive test of hippocampal function that has already been tested in people with AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The estimated variability of 2% was taken from data on a memory-binding task for older individuals (aged 60â€“83) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The standard deviation of the difference between the treatment and placebo was then calculated assuming equal variability in the two groups. This yielded an estimate of 3%. Using the two-sided test for paired means in PASS 11, the total sample required to detect a mean difference of 2.1% with a standard deviation of the difference of 3% and achieve 90% power at a 5% significance level in 24 patients.</p>
                <p id="Par156">Therefore, a sample size of 30 allows an attrition rate of 20% for the study still to be able to detect a meaningful difference in sensitive measures of cognitive function.</p>

                <p id="Par158">Potentially eligible patients will be approached by a clinician who knows them and will be provided with an opportunity to hear more about the study. The initial approach will usually be made at the routine clinic visit for that patient. Eligible participants may initially be approached without their carer being present as all recruited patients must have capacity to consent to the ILIAD trial at screening.</p>
                <p id="Par159">Those interested will be provided with the PIS and either meet with a member of the research team on the same day (if the participant is able to do so) or given instructions on how to contact a member of the research team and arrange to meet at a mutually convenient time. The researcher will then go through the PIS and provide further information about the study. This meeting will occur in the out-patient clinic setting.</p>
                <p id="Par160">If the patient wishes to participate, they will be asked to provide verbal consent for the researcher to review their medical notes and screen against basic inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient appears eligible, they will be asked to give informed consent be enrolled into the trial. The patient will then undergo full screening including necessary blood tests, ECG recording and urinalysis. Should any patients, on full screening, be found to not meet all eligibility criteria, those patients will then be withdrawn.</p>

                <p id="Par166">Unblinding should not normally be necessary as serious side effects will be dealt with on the assumption that the patient is on active treatment. Study medication should be omitted rather than unblinded. Request for unblinding should be directed to the Study Office during office hours. Each recruiting site will hold trial information for that site.</p>
                <p id="Par167">Given that levetiracetam is a well-established anti-seizure medication with a known side effect profile and is therefore considered a relatively low-risk IMP, out of hours code breaking is not thought to be required. However, to mitigate against any possible risk to participants, the main site, at the John Radcliffe Hospital, will have the CIâ€™s mobile telephone number held at their Switchboard to enable prompt discussion about potential unblinding.</p>

                <p id="Par193">Levetiracetam, as outlined, is a well-tolerated and widely prescribed anti-seizure medication and is a drug of choice in older people with epilepsy. The safety and tolerability profile of levetiracetam is therefore very well-established and familiar to both investigators and General Practitioners. Common side effects from levetiracetam include asthenia, an effect on sleep and an effect on mood. Gastrointestinal disturbance, change in weight and rash are occasionally reported. The effect of levetiracetam on mood in patients with AD is captured within the data that will be collected from recruited participants. The full list of potential expected adverse events is listed in the Summary of Product Characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par194">Given the familiarity with levetiracetam in both tertiary and primary care and, in particular, given that levetiracetam is being used at its licenced dose, non-serious adverse events will not be recorded within the ILiAD study unless they lead to withdrawal from treatment.

The participants in this study are from an older population and may have co-morbidities beyond Alzheimerâ€™s disease. An event that is part of the natural course of the disease (i.e. disease progression or admission for standard treatment) will not be reported as an SAE. However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected, or if the investigator considers that there may be a causal relationship between the IMP or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, then it must be reported.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par203">It has long been recognised that seizures are more common in older people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. More recently, it is appreciated that there is likely a bi-directional relationship between epilepsy and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and that both represent large-scale disruption of neuronal networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As such it seems tractable that anti-seizure medications, which help stabilise neuronal networks in epilepsy may offer some benefit to memory difficulties in people with dementia.</p>
              <p id="Par204">Basic science work suggests that levetiracetam, which works by binding to the protein synaptic vesicle protein 2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], holds the most promise as such a treatment in AD. Further benefits of levetiracetam include its limited side effect profile, ease of titration and lack of drug-drug interactionâ€”this being particularly important in older people who may be taking multiple other medications and have significant co-morbidities. Levetiracetam is now available in generic preparations thus reducing the associated costs to healthcare providers. At a time when many are exploring very expensive immunological treatments for AD, it may be that the simple and inexpensive levetiracetam will at least offer some help to people with AD. To explore this, we developed the ILiAD trial.</p>
              <p id="Par205">ILiAD is very different to most studies in AD. It is short, involves repurposing of an existing widely prescribed medication and, as a crossover study, all participants have the opportunity to be given levetiracetam. While AD generally progresses slowly, the hippocampal binding task we employ in this study offers a very precise assessment of memory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and this test can detect changes that may be apparent over a few months. The test may therefore be helpful in other AD studies going forwards. Similarly, EEG may provide a very helpful non-invasive biomarker to determine who may benefit from specific treatments in AD. Future, longer duration studies will also help evaluate the possible enduring impact of levetiracetam on cognition in people with AD as well as monitoring for any adverse events. We appreciate that by choosing to preferentially analyse data from participants who complete the study, there might be a bias towards people who tolerate levetiracetam. To mitigate this we will record all adverse events and the reasons why participants may have had to withdraw from the study before completion. As this is, very much, a pilot study all such data will inform future work exploring the potential role of levetiracetam in those with dementia.</p>
              <p id="Par206">Perhaps most importantly, irrespective of results, ILiAD opens an entirely new frontier in the treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease bringing together the fields of epileptology and cognitive neurology. Were an anti-seizure medication, not necessarily levetiracetam, shown to positively influence memory in AD, this would be revolutionary. Moreover, as the utility of anti-seizure medications is in neuronal network stabilisation, independent of the cause of perturbation to that neuronal network, it may be that anti-seizure medications will also prove beneficial in other dementing illnesses beyond AD.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par207">The ILiAD trial is currently open but not actively recruiting. The current protocol version number is 5. The first patient was recruited in December 2019. We anticipate completing recruitment in July 2022.</p>

                <title>Addendum: Adjustments owing to COVID-19 pandemic</title>
                <p id="Par208">At the time of initial submission, April 2020, owing to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, all â€˜visitsâ€™ are now being performed telephonically to minimise any exposure of participants to hospital environments and to ensure that we do not burden NHS staff or facilities. IMP is delivered to the participantâ€™s residence and there is no face-to-face contact between research personnel and participants. We are suspending all new recruitment to the study at the current time.</p>
                <p id="Par209">While we appreciate that these measures have a very significant impact on the trial, and if prolonged restrictions continue we may only be able to report safety data, we are nonetheless pleased that the study is being allowed to continue. Participants and their carers have invested considerably in the project and it would have been difficult had the trial stopped abruptly. Moreover, it remains important to complete research in populations who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19, but similarly are also more likely to have other health conditions that need addressment.</p>
                <p id="Par210">At the time of submitting the revised manuscript, ILiAD is planning on re-opening July 2021 with recruitment planned to end in July 2022. This is, though, contingent on how the COVID pandemic evolves over the next 18â€‰months.</p>
