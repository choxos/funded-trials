                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Children with persistent hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion are commonly managed by surgical intervention. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment would enhance treatment options. Underpowered, poor-quality trials have found short-term benefit from oral steroids. We aimed to investigate whether a short course of oral steroids would achieve acceptable hearing in children with persistent otitis media with effusion and hearing loss.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this individually randomised, parallel, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial we recruited children aged 2–8 years with symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months and with confirmed bilateral hearing loss. Participants were recruited from 20 ear, nose, and throat (ENT), paediatric audiology, and audiovestibular medicine outpatient departments in England and Wales. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to sequentially numbered identical prednisolone (oral steroid) or placebo packs by use of computer-generated random permuted block sizes stratified by site and child's age. The primary outcome was audiometry-confirmed acceptable hearing at 5 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN49798431.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 20, 2014, and April 5, 2016, 1018 children were screened, of whom 389 were randomised. 200 were assigned to receive oral steroids and 189 to receive placebo. Hearing at 5 weeks was assessed in 183 children in the oral steroid group and in 180 in the placebo group. Acceptable hearing was observed in 73 (40%) children in the oral steroid group and in 59 (33%) in the placebo group (absolute difference 7% [95% CI −3 to 17], number needed to treat 14; adjusted odds ratio 1·36 [95% CI 0·88–2·11]; p=0·16). There was no evidence of any significant differences in adverse events or quality-of-life measures between the groups.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Otitis media with effusion in children with documented hearing loss and attributable symptoms for at least 3 months has a high rate of spontaneous resolution. A short course of oral prednisolone is not an effective treatment for most children aged 2–8 years with persistent otitis media with effusion, but is well tolerated. One in 14 children might achieve improved hearing but not quality of life. Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will be supported by this evidence.</p>

              <p id="para10">Otitis media with effusion is estimated to affect 50–80% of children by the age of 5 years and costs the National Health Service (NHS) up to £90 million per year.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and mucolytics are ineffective treatments for this condition.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Intervention options are largely limited to watchful waiting, hearing aids, or surgical insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic membrane (with or without adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy). Use of an autoinflation device resulted in a modest benefit for some children aged 4–11 years.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, 80% of children are affected by otitis media with effusion before the age of 4 years, a time when language development is most rapid, hearing loss has its greatest effect on language development, and when children are generally unable to use an autoinflation device.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but children often find them uncomfortable, might feel self-conscious, and can become a target for bullying.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Both hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary care, with major cost implications.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment, especially if implementable in primary care, would enhance treatment options.</p>
              <p id="para20">Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term.

                  <p id="para50">Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion, updated in 2011, found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus control with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). We searched PubMed on Jan 22, 2018, and identified an additional trial showing that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but that this advantage disappeared by 3 months.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">This study is, to our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the primary outcome. We achieved good long-term follow-up and found weak evidence of a small benefit in achieving acceptable hearing but no effect on quality-of-life measures from a short course of oral prednisolone in children with persistent otitis media with effusion. In children with documented hearing loss and symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months, the rate of spontaneous resolution is high.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will be supported by this evidence of the effectiveness and clinical course of oral steroids.

                <p id="para140">The intervention was a 7-day course of soluble prednisolone, given as a single daily dose by mouth of 20 mg for children aged 2–5 years or 30 mg for children aged 6–8 years, or placebo matched for packaging, colour, solubility, and consistency (Piramal Healthcare, Morpeth, UK). This is the most commonly used dose in previous studies of otitis media with effusion, and similar to the standard dose for treatment of other inflammatory conditions, such as asthma.

Medical history, audiometry, tympanometry, and otoscopy findings were recorded at baseline, and the parent or legal guardian was asked to complete the Otitis Media (OM8-30) questionnaire to assess the child's functional health status as an overall score and by three facets: infection-related physical health, general developmental impact, and reported hearing difficulties (with a low [more negative] score indicating better quality of life).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) measured health-related quality of life overall and by the following domains: physical, emotional, social and school functioning, and psychosocial health summary score.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.

The diary was used to record daily treatment adherence (all, some, or no medication taken) for the first week, as well as symptoms and adverse events, alongside resource use for the economic analyses. Parents scored each of the ten symptoms weekly on a scale from 0 (problem not present at all) to 6 (problem is as bad as it could be). Follow-up assessments were done at week 5 (4 weeks after completion of treatment), and at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation, when completion of the validated questionnaires and the audiometry, tympanometry, and otoscopy were repeated as well as questions about resource use. Participants were asked to not have ventilation tube surgery during the first 5 weeks of follow-up, but then resumed usual care.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para170">The primary outcome was acceptable hearing at 5 weeks from randomisation (4 weeks after conclusion of treatment), defined as less than or equal to 20 dB HL averaged within the frequencies of 0·5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz in at least one ear in children assessed by pure tone audiometry, ear-specific insert VRA, or ear-specific play audiometry, and less than or equal to 25 dB HL averaged within the frequencies of 0·5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 KHz in children assessed by soundfield VRA or soundfield performance/play audiometry. Hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion averages 18–35 dB HL, and the thresholds we used are based on national guidelines.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We selected a short-term primary outcome as we considered that this would be the point at which oral steroids would be most likely to be effective, and that short-term benefit (even if only temporary in some children) would be worthwhile from a relatively safe, cheap, and easy to implement intervention. Demonstrable short-term improvement in hearing is arguably more important than longer-term outcomes, as short-term improvement is most likely to influence the decision to undergo surgery for insertion of ventilation tubes.</p>
                <p id="para180">Secondary outcomes assessed the effects of the intervention on acceptable hearing (defined through audiometry) at 6 months and 12 months; tympanometric resolution of otitis media with effusion (moving from type B or type C to type A tympanogram, in at least one ear with calibrated standardised tympanometers and modified Jerger classification<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>); otoscopic findings; functional health status (OM8-30); health-related quality of life (PedsQL and HUI3); health-care consultations relating to otitis media with effusion and other resource use; short-term and longer-term cost-effectiveness all assessed at 5 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months; insertion of ventilation tubes by 6 months and 12 months; and adverse events and symptoms (as reported by parent and child if appropriate) reported during the 5 weeks from randomisation.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">We required a sample size of 302 to show a change in the proportion of children with resolved hearing loss at 5 weeks after randomisation from 20% in the placebo group to 35% in the oral steroid group, with 80% power at a 5% significance level. We selected a conservative effect size of 1·75 (ratio of proportions) as we considered that a 15% absolute increase in the rate of resolution at 5 weeks would represent a clinically meaningful benefit that could result in a meaningful reduction in insertion of ventilation tubes. Our sample size was increased to 380, to allow for a 20% loss to follow-up at 12 months.</p>
                <p id="para200">All analyses were by intention to treat without imputation for those lost to follow-up, with outcomes compared between the oral steroid and control groups by use of mixed-effects two-level regression models to adjust for trial site (random-effects) and the age of the child at recruitment (2–5 years <italic>vs</italic> 6–8 years; fixed-effects) as stratification variables. All parameter estimates are presented alongside 95% CIs and p values.</p>
                <p id="para210">The primary analysis used a logistic regression model with comparisons presented as the absolute difference in proportions and adjusted odds ratios (aOR). The model was also adjusted for days from randomisation to 5-week follow up. For comparison with other studies, the adjusted relative risk and 95% CI were also presented by use of a generalised linear model with log-link function. Sensitivity analyses were done in the per-protocol population and with allocation respecting methods such as complier averaged causal effects (CACE) modelling to investigate the effect of adherence to treatment by use of instrumental variable regression.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The per-protocol population comprised those who were randomly assigned and satisfied the study eligibility criteria, received and adhered to their allocated intervention for the 7-day course, and did not receive any surgery for grommets 5 weeks from randomisation. Children who presented more than 14 days before or after the scheduled 5-week visit date were considered not to have complied with the trial protocol and were excluded from the per-protocol population. Diaries were used to assess adherence to the medication; adherence to oral steroid or placebo was defined as reporting taking all 7 days of oral steroid (partial adherence was defined as &lt;7 days and reporting taking some or none during the 7 days). Confounders and interaction terms were entered into the model to do prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). Secondary analyses of the primary outcome used weighted average dB HL (to account for the number of frequencies recorded) at the 5-week follow-up as a continuous outcome. As 327 (90%) of 363 children had their ears tested at all four frequencies, weighted results were similar to the unweighted and so the unweighted results were dropped from the analysis. This outcome was modelled as a child-level analysis to explore the average, best, or worst hearing levels from children assessed via pure tone audiometry, ear-specific insert VRA, or ear-specific play audiometry, and also as an ear-level analysis to account for both ears being tested with the ear-specific VRA. Both approaches used multilevel linear regression modelling (child nested within site, and ears nested within child nested within site) adjusting for baseline dB HL, child's age at recruitment, and time of the 5-week follow-up (days).</p>

              <p id="para260">Between March 20, 2014, and April 5, 2016, 1018 children were assessed for eligibility and 389 (38%) children from 20 sites were randomly assigned (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref>). The main reason for exclusion was hearing loss that did not meet inclusion criteria (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). After randomisation, a further nine children were excluded, with none of their data being used (six because their baseline audiometry data indicated that they did not have sufficient hearing loss to meet the eligibility criteria, and three who withdrew from the trial and withdrew consent to use any data). Therefore, 380 children (193 [51%] in the oral steroid group and 187 [49%] in the placebo group) were included in the analyses. There was a slight imbalance of children randomly assigned to each group resulting from the splitting of allocation blocks because of medication packs being withdrawn and destroyed as a result of temperature excursions and reaching their expiry dates. This issue affected the balance within some sites and in the older age group (6–8 years). The baseline demographics and medical and family history of the randomised groups were well balanced (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Hearing was slightly better in the oral steroid group, with most children having mild to moderate hearing loss. Otoscopy and tympanometry were done in almost all children, the majority with type B. The tympanic membrane was visualised in most ears and suggested the presence of middle ear effusion. Around 11% of children had bubbles behind the ear drum. 349 (92%) of diaries were returned (179 [93%] in the oral steroid group and 170 [90%] in the placebo group). Parents of 138 (77%) children in the oral steroid group and 134 (79%) in the placebo group reported full adherence to the study medication for all 7 days.<fig

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para350">This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the primary outcome, with long-term follow-up achieved. We found high rates of acceptable hearing at 5 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year in children with initial documented hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion in secondary care clinics and with symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months. If effective, a short course of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion would have been appealing as the treatment is generally well tolerated and would avoid more burdensome and expensive interventions such as ventilation tubes or hearing aids. Although we found an absolute increase of 7% in the proportion of children with acceptable hearing at 5 weeks after randomisation in the oral steroid group, an increase that was maintained at 6 months and 12 months, these differences were not significant. We found no significant differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures. A short course of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion is unlikely to be effective for most children aged 2–8 years, although steroid treatment was well tolerated and one in 14 children might receive some benefit in achieving acceptable hearing. However, we did not identify any subgroup that showed meaningful advantage from steroid treatment. We also did not find any differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures between study groups. Our evidence does not support a 1-week course of oral steroids as a cost-effective option for children aged 2–8 years with otitis media with effusion, but there is considerable uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness estimates.</p>
              <p id="para360">We recruited within our target sample size and achieved close to 90% follow-up over 12 months, including hearing and functional health status and quality-of-life assessments. We recruited children from 20 routine secondary care clinics across a wide geographical area, social deprivation, and age categories, which facilitate judgments about applicability. The study groups were well balanced for children's characteristics. A high proportion of children adhered fully to the study interventions. More children than we anticipated recovered spontaneously, raising the possibility that we might not have had sufficient power to detect a real (but smaller than anticipated) difference in our primary outcome. However, although we did find differences in tympanometry findings at 5 weeks, we found no differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures at any timepoint, suggesting that even with a larger sample size the difference in hearing outcomes would not have translated into meaningful advantages on these measures. A large proportion of participants (68% in the steroid group and 61% in the placebo group) reported having symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for 12 months or more. Although these are only self-reported data, and the duration of actual effusions might have been substantially shorter, it is possible that we included a large proportion of children with more prolonged otitis media with effusion and viscous middle ear fluid. However, our subgroup analysis did not find a significant differential treatment effect by duration of symptoms and the point estimates suggested reduced benefit for those with a shorter duration of symptoms (&lt;12 months).</p>
              <p id="para370">The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion found no benefit from intranasal steroids.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, the review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, risk ratio 1·99 [95% CI 1·14–3·49] for persistent otitis media with effusion at follow-up), and a non-significant point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, risk ratio 3·80 [95% CI 0·93–15·52]). Oral antibiotics alone were not effective.</p>
              <p id="para380">Studies included in the systematic review were limited by short-term follow-up, low power, poorly described inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No previous cost-effectiveness studies of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. A non-placebo-controlled trial published subsequent to the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para390">Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. We included more patients than the combined total number of participants included in previous studies of oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included hearing, tympanometric, and quality-of-life assessments at follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, language, and other functional outcomes compared with watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para400">An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.</p>
              <p id="para410">Otitis media with effusion causes substantial problems for patients and their families, and results in considerable costs to the NHS. It continues to be the most common reason for childhood surgery despite reported reductions in the number of ventilation operations.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The McKinsey report commissioned by the Department of Health states that the NHS could save £21 million per year by reducing insertion of ventilation tubes by a further 90%, a procedure that they assessed as being “relatively ineffective”.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guideline published in 2008 for management of otitis media with effusion recommends a “watchful waiting” period of 3 months, with referral to an ENT department if hearing is significantly affected, if the condition persists for longer than 3 months, or if there is suspected language or developmental delay.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> US guidelines also recommend watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Oral steroids might be a reasonable candidate intervention to help reduce the burden of otitis media with effusion. However, our findings suggest that any hearing-related benefit from oral steroids is likely to occur in one in 14 children (aged 2–8 years) with otitis media with effusion, and that this benefit might be of questionable clinical significance, since we found no evidence of a beneficial effect on functional health status and health-related quality of life. Therefore, based on these findings we do not recommend routine use of oral steroids in this setting.</p>
              <p id="para420">The high rate of spontaneous resolution identified in this study will support the evidence base informing discussions about watchful waiting in children with hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.</p>
              <p id="para430">Given the findings of some benefit from antibiotics for otitis media with effusion in children, and limited trial evidence for a benefit from oral steroids in combination with antibiotics, a rigorous trial of oral steroids combined with antibiotics might be indicated.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>

                <p>The OSTRICH trial was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme (reference 11/01/26). The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR, or the UK Department of Health and Social Care. The Centre for Trials Research (CTR) is funded by the Welsh Assembly Government through Health and Care Research Wales and the authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of CTR to study implementation. CCB is an NIHR Senior Investigator. We thank all the children and families who participated in the trial, without whom this trial would not have been possible. We thank and acknowledge input from Ceri Philips, Mathew Smith, and Mark Haggard and Helen Spencer in respect of their help with the OM8-30 mapping. We also thank Katy Addison, Judith Evans, Vincent Poile, Dr Jane Davies, Hayley Prout, Vasileios Gkiousias, and Ellen Smith for their contribution to the trial implementation and management. We acknowledge the contribution of Sarah Jones as the patient/public representative on the trial management group. We also acknowledge the contribution of independent members of the trial steering committee: Ian Williamson (Chair), Alastair Sutcliffe, Claire Hopkins, and Ros Cox; and independent members of the data monitoring committee: Rafael Perera (Chair), Nnaemeka Okpala, and Shanaz Dorkenoo. We thank staff at the local NIHR Clinical Research Networks and the Health and Care Research Wales Workforce and staff involved at our participating sites, including principal investigators, ENT consultants and specialist registrars, audiologists, clinic staff, research nurses, research coordinators, and administrators (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p>
