                  <p id="Par1">
Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting inflammatory vasculitis affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries. A number of recent studies conducted in different European countries have demonstrated alarmingly high coronary complications despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). These high complication rates now emphasize the need for an urgent reappraisal of IVIG as the sole primary therapeutic agent for KD. The Kawasaki disease CAA prevention (KD-CAAP) trial will test the hypothesis that immediate adjunctive corticosteroid treatment to standard of care IVIG and aspirin will reduce coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) rates in unselected KD patients across Europe.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">KD-CAAP is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed trial that will be conducted across Europe supported by the conect4children pan-European clinical trials network. Patients with KD who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomised (1:1) to receive either oral prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day plus standard of care therapy IVIG (2 g/kg) and aspirin (40 mg/kg/day); or IVIG and aspirin alone. Further management is dictated by temperature and C-reactive protein (CRP) responses. Co-primary outcomes are as follows: (i) any CAA within the 3 months of trial follow-up; (ii) average estimate of maximum coronary <italic>Z</italic>-score at weeks 1, 2 and 6 adjusting for rescue treatment. Additional outcomes will be assessed including cost effectiveness, quality of life, corticosteroid toxicity and other safety outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Several recent studies have indicated that coronary complications associated with KD across Europe are much higher than early trials of IVIG had initially suggested. KD-CAAP directly addresses this issue by exploring the therapeutic benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids in unselected KD cases. If we find that corticosteroids prevent CAA and are safe, this is a cheap and widely available intervention that could be implemented immediately for the benefit of children.</p>

                  <title>Kawasaki disease (KD)</title>
                  <p id="Par41">KD is an acute self-limiting inflammatory vasculitis affecting predominantly medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary arteries causing coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. KD is currently the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. KD causes CAA in 15–25% of untreated patients whilst 2–3% of untreated cases die as a result of coronary vasculitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Coronary artery vasculitis can cause acute myocardial events in the early stages of the disease leading to myocardial infarction or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Late morbidity can also arise from late KD vasculopathy, a process involving remodelling following the acute inflammatory event, distinct from atherosclerosis, but ultimately leading to coronary vascular insufficiency and late cardiac events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Notably, as more children with KD survive into adulthood, the disease remains an important cause of long-term cardiac disease in adulthood and requires rigorous follow-up, particularly for those with persisting/giant CAA, to reduce risk of myocardial ischaemia and infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par42">The disease has a world-wide distribution with higher risk in males (male: female case ratio of 1.5: 1), seasonality and occasional epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. KD is more prevalent in Japanese children (308/100,000 under the age of 5 years). An increased incidence of KD is also observed in Japanese and other Asian children resident in North America and Europe, suggesting a genetic contribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the UK, a recent direct British Paediatric Surveillance Unit epidemiological survey (2013–2015) showed that the incidence of KD in the UK and Ireland was 4.55/100,000 children under 5 years, which represents a slight increase since the last survey in 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whilst the majority of cases were Caucasian, KD in the UK is over-represented in Chinese or Japanese Asians and Black Africans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Current treatment of KD and reported rates of coronary complications</title>
                  <p id="Par43">Randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have unequivocally demonstrated that early recognition and treatment of KD with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin reduces the occurrence of CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Therefore, IVIG and aspirin should be started as soon as a patient is diagnosed with complete or incomplete KD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Two grams per kilogram of IVIG is the recommended dose, usually given as a single infusion (typically over 12 h), in view of greater therapeutic effect in preventing CAA when compared to a lower, divided dose regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Close monitoring of patients is critical, considering temperature, acute phase reactants (particularly C-reactive protein; CRP), clinical symptoms and other signs of systemic inflammation. All patients should also initially receive aspirin at a dose of 30–50 mg/kg/day, in 3–4 divided doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Aspirin should be reduced to an antiplatelet dose of 3–5 mg/kg/day, but only after the fever has settled for 48 h, clinical features are improving, and CRP levels are falling in line with CRP half-life (approximately 18 h in the absence of ongoing hepatic production) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par44">Early recognition and treatment of KD with aspirin (30–50 mg/kg/day, in 3–4 divided doses) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 2 g/kg) was previously thought to reduce the risk of occurrence of CAA from approximately 20% in untreated patients to 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IVIG resistance occurs in up to 20–40% of cases, however, and this IVIG resistance is associated with increased risk of developing CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Notably however, several recent studies conducted in Europe (UK, Sweden and Germany), Russia and North America have found alarmingly high rates of coronary complications despite IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent UK survey (2013–2015) suggested that 19% of children with KD developed CAA despite IVIG; and, even more worryingly, 39% of those under 1 year old developed CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Similarly, in Germany overall CAA rates of 22% (42% in younger children) have been reported despite treatment with IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Skane, Sweden, the overall rate of CAA in a recent survey was reported as 16% despite IVIG, with 45% under the age of 1 year developing CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par45">The reasons for these alarmingly high rates of CAA are currently unclear. Late diagnosis is of concern (particularly for those with incomplete KD) and delayed treatment undoubtedly plays a role, since in the latest UK survey, time to IVIG treatment was found to be delayed in those with CAA compared with those without CAA. Additionally, Caucasians may not respond as well to IVIG as non-Caucasians, perhaps due to an as yet unidentified pharmacogenomic differences, such as the hypothesis with respects to Fc gamma-receptor polymorphisms that may influence IVIG-responsiveness in different populations. Whatever the reason(s), these very high CAA complication rates now emphasise the need for an urgent reappraisal of IVIG as the primary therapeutic agent for KD.</p>

                  <title>Corticosteroids for the treatment of KD: efficacy and safety data</title>
                  <p id="Par46">Corticosteroids are an effective treatment for virtually all forms of vasculitis, but they have not been widely adopted as first-line treatment in unselected KD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This is largely due to conflicting efficacy data from previous clinical trials in non-European patients using very different corticosteroid dosing regimens in patients with differing risk profiles for CAA. This is illustrated when the American Paediatric Heart Network trial and the Japanese RAISE trial (two of the largest RCTs examining this issue) are considered in more detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Both these trials investigated the use of corticosteroids in addition to standard IVIG and aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The American trial evaluated the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) given as a single dose combined with IVIG in unselected patients with KD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In contrast, the RAISE trial evaluated different dose (2 mg/kg) intravenous methylprednisolone given for 5 days; if fever settled, this was then converted to oral prednisolone which was subsequently tapered over 15 days after the C-reactive protein (CRP) normalised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, patients were included in RAISE only if they were at high risk of IVIG resistance, based on a risk score (Kobayashi score ≥ 5). Perhaps unsurprisingly then, these two studies produced different results, with corticosteroids conferring significant benefit in the Japanese RAISE trial, but a lack of overall benefit in the American trial, possibly because this latter trial did not use enough corticosteroid. Importantly, a large ‘post-RAISE’ observational study of 724 high-risk Japanese patients receiving corticosteroid treatment in addition to IVIG and aspirin showed that primary IVIG plus prednisolone therapy had an effect similar to that seen in the RAISE trial, and significantly reduced the incidence of CAA with minimal adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This observational analysis provides additional ‘real-world’ support for the use of corticosteroids in high-risk KD cases in Japan.</p>
                  <p id="Par47">Notably, meta-analysis of data from several published studies of corticosteroid therapy in KD also provides evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids as primary adjunctive treatment for patients with severe KD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Meta-analysis of 16 comparative studies (mostly observational, few randomised) involving 2746 KD patients demonstrated that early addition of corticosteroids to conventional IVIG therapy was associated with reduced risk of CAA compared with IVIG therapy alone (odds ratio 0.424; 95%CI, 0.270–0.665) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This benefit was only observed when corticosteroids were used as primary therapy rather than rescue therapy for IVIG resistance, and was greatest for Japanese patients who were determined at baseline to have high risk for IVIG resistance. Meta-regression analyses also demonstrated that corticosteroids were more effective when started earlier in the disease course. Overall, this meta-analysis provided evidence that corticosteroids combined with IVIG as initial treatment reduces overall risk of CAA in severe KD, but did not resolve the ongoing debate about which KD patients should receive this, probably explaining why less than 5% of patients in the UK currently receive corticosteroids as primary adjunctive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A high-risk patient is regarded as one where the risk of CAA is 20–30% despite IVIG treatment, and in Japan is identified as those patients with a Kobayashi score ≥ 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For UK and European patients, however, the Kobayashi risk score had poor sensitivity to identify patients at higher risk of CAA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In line with this evidence, recent European SHARE guidelines for KD recommend adjunctive corticosteroids for high-risk patients, but acknowledge that identifying such patients in Caucasian populations is difficult and that clinical scores to define high risk patients developed for Japanese patients perform sub-optimally in Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, given the high CAA rates emerging from several countries, and the lack of risk assessment tools to accurately identify such cases, it is reasonable now to argue that all European KD patients are at significant risk of CAA despite IVIG (19–45%) and could potentially benefit from primary treatment with corticosteroids.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">Several previous studies have also indicated that short courses of corticosteroids were safe in KD. Specifically, in the American Paediatric Heart Network trial that evaluated the use of intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) given as a single dose combined with IVIG in unselected patients with KD (experimental group), compared to controls who received placebo plus IVIG, there was no evidence of differences in adverse events reported in both trial groups: 37/101 (36%) in the experimental group compared to 24/97 (25%) in the control group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The majority of these adverse events were judged to be related to IVIG use and were not related to corticosteroids. The few adverse events clearly attributed to corticosteroid use, observed in only 5/101 patients, included hypotension, and one episode of hypokalaemia; all were quickly resolved with no intervention. Similar favourable safety data have been reported from studies of corticosteroids in Japan. The Japanese RAISE trial evaluated different dose (2 mg/kg) intravenous methylprednisolone given for 5 days in high-risk, severe (i.e. Kobayashi score ≥ 5) Japanese patients; when fever settled, this was then converted to oral prednisolone, tapered over 15 days after normalisation of CRP; versus a control group who received IVIG alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Again, the adverse event profile for both groups was comparable: serious adverse events occurred in 3/121 (2%) patients in the experimental group and 2/121 (2%) in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The types of serious adverse events were also similar between both groups: in the intravenous immunoglobulin plus prednisolone group, two patients had high total cholesterol, and one had neutropenia; and in the intravenous immunoglobulin group, one patient had high total cholesterol, and there was one episode of non-occlusive thrombus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Importantly, observational data involving 724 high-risk Japanese patients (again identified by a high Kobayashi score) routinely treated with adjunctive corticosteroids also demonstrated minimal adverse events relating to corticosteroids, which occurred in only 2/724 patients (hypertension (<italic>N</italic> = 1); bacteraemia (<italic>N</italic> = 1)). Several more side effects were reported in relation to IVIG therapy, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This observational analysis therefore provides reassurance regarding the safety of corticosteroids in high-risk Japanese KD cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Lastly, meta-analysis of 16 comparative studies of 2746 patients with KD supported the use of corticosteroid therapy in severe KD (see above) and highlighted that efficacy was conferred without an increased risk of corticosteroid-related adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These data therefore suggest that overall corticosteroids are a safe treatment for KD.</p>

                  <title>Rationale for KD-CAAP</title>
                  <p id="Par49">As summarised above, a number of recent studies conducted in different European countries (UK, Sweden and Germany), Russia and the United States have recently demonstrated alarmingly high rates of coronary complications despite IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These high complication rates now emphasise the need for an urgent reappraisal of IVIG and aspirin as the primary therapeutic agents for KD. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment for virtually all forms of vasculitis, but they have not been adopted as first-line treatment of unselected KD cases, for which there remains significant equipoise. Increasingly, evidence summarised above from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses supports corticosteroid use as primary adjunctive treatment for patients with severe KD, particularly for Japanese patients with a Kobayashi score ≥ 5, and for patients regardless of ethnicity for whom CAA risk is 20–30% despite IVIG. This does not, however, resolve the ongoing debate about which KD patients should be considered as ‘severe’ outside of Japan, since the Kobayashi score and other clinical severity-scoring systems have poor predictive value in non-Japanese patients. Given however, the aforementioned high CAA complication rates seen across Europe (16–45%), all KD patients are arguably at high risk of CAA despite IVIG and could therefore potentially benefit from adjunctive corticosteroids as primary treatment for KD. Therefore, there remains significant equipoise regarding the use of corticosteroids as primary treatment combined with IVIG for all patients, i.e., not just the most severe cases. This protocol therefore describes a multi-centre randomised, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed, trial to explore the efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy combined with IVIG/aspirin, versus IVIG/aspirin alone in unselected KD cases across Europe.</p>

Consent for the use of the child’s medical, personal and samples for further research once the study is complete may be requested and the request to approach them in the future to find out how their child is doing.

                <p id="Par97">The high CAA complication rates associated with KD seen across Europe (16–45%) suggest that all patients are arguably at high risk of CAA despite IVIG, and could therefore potentially benefit from additional primary treatment. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment for virtually all forms of vasculitis, but they have not been adopted as first-line treatment of unselected KD cases, for which there remains significant equipoise. KD-CAAP will therefore explore the efficacy and safety of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy combined with IVIG and aspirin compared to IVIG and aspirin alone (standard of care) in unselected KD cases across Europe.</p>

Prednisolone is a medicine with high solubility and high permeability (Biopharmaceutics Classification System—BCS class I). This means two immediate-released products (e.g. soluble tablet versus normal tablets) are likely to be bioequivalent (assuming similar excipients). A bioequivalence study was not considered necessary to support the licensing of prednisolone oral solution. It was considered bioequivalent to soluble tablet and to another prednisolone solution.</p>
                  <p id="Par125">The experimental group will receive oral prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day as soon as possible following randomisation. Maximum daily dose of oral prednisolone in first week (and subsequently) is 80 mg. If oral prednisolone is not tolerated then intravenous methylprednisolone may be given at equivalent doses (1.6 mg/kg/day, i.e. 0.8 mg/kg IV every 12 h). Corticosteroid tapering is allowed from day 5 onwards provided there is resolution of fever (temperature &lt; 38 °C) and CRP ≤ 10 mg/L, and should be completed over 15 days in 5-day steps from 2 to 1 to 0.5 mg/kg/day, then to 0 mg.</p>
                  <p id="Par126">Oral prednisone may be substituted for prednisolone at the same dose at the discretion of the local investigator following usual practice. Single daily dose soluble forms are acceptable in children.</p>
                  <p id="Par127">Doses should be rounded to the nearest milligrams (easily achievable using soluble forms) that allow whole tablets to be administered (in accordance with dose ranges permitted). Flexibility in dose of ± 12.5% (but not exceeding 80 mg daily) from the milligram per kilogram dose above is allowed.</p>

Standard paediatric lansoprazole dosing will apply: for example children/adolescents &lt; 30 kg 0.5–1 mg/kg (max dose of 15 mg) once daily; for children/adolescents ≥ 30 kg 30 mg once daily.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                <p id="Par145">Adverse events caused by corticosteroid toxicity leading to a treatment change are expected to be rare. In the situation where this occurs, treatment may be discontinued at the discretion of the local investigator. Children/adolescents should remain in the trial for follow-up and should continue to follow the assessment schedule. Further treatment can be considered based on local investigator discretion. Lastly, if corticosteroids are stopped early, this should be tapered over several days (in accordance to local practice, i.e. not protocolised) to prevent adrenocortical insufficiency, in line with routine clinical care. The risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding may be increased when acetylsalicylic acid and corticosteroids are co-administered. This risk can be mitigated by the use of non-mandatory of proton pump inhibitors as per local practice.</p>
                <p id="Par146">We emphasize that an important goal of KD-CAAP is to document corticosteroid toxicity as well as effectiveness and efficacy. Although corticosteroids have been used for decades for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the young, hitherto there has been no systematic method or tool to collate corticosteroid- related toxicity. We and others have recently developed such a tool for use in adults, the glucocorticoid toxicity index. We have now been involved in the development of a similar tool for use in paediatric trials: the paediatric Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (pGTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The pGTI consists of a Composite Index and a Specific List [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The Composite pGTI reflects glucocorticoid toxicity that has the potential to change during a clinical trial: to worsen if glucocorticoid doses increase, or to improve if successful glucocorticoid sparing is achieved. Toxicities included in the Composite pGTI are expected to occur commonly and to vary with glucocorticoid exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. They are therefore weighted and an aggregate score calculated. In contrast, the Specific List is designed to capture glucocorticoid toxicity not included in the Composite pGTI; these are often clinical events that are not reversible on lower corticosteroid exposure, or are uncommon (typically affecting ˂5%). The Composite Index of the pGTI consists of ten domains of glucocorticoid toxicity: body mass index, growth, glucose tolerance, lipid metabolism, systolic blood pressure, bone mineral density, glucocorticoid-induced myopathy, skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric impact and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The Specific List includes six additional unique domains that address other features of glucocorticoid toxicity such as pubertal delay, sex hormone access interruption, ocular toxicity (cataracts, central serous retinopathy) and bone health (osteonecrosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par147">Corticosteroids will be initiated whilst the child is in hospital. In hospital, they will be administered by ward nurses and recorded on CRFs by trial staff. Therefore, non-adherence will be minimal. Intravenous methylprednisolone will only be given in hospital whilst the child is too unwell to tolerate oral medication. After discharge, we will document as accurately as possible what trial oral medication the patient actually takes, and the reasons for any reported noncompliance (including spitting out or refusing doses) using patient medication diaries for corticosteroids (as for aspirin). Corticosteroids are widely used worldwide for the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases. The importance of adherence will be reinforced at the time trial medication is dispensed and during any subsequent contacts with the trial team. Formal assessment of corticosteroid-related toxicity, and how this may affect adherence, will also be assessed by using the pGTI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited during the trial {11d}</title>
                <p id="Par148">All regular medications will be recorded at enrolment. Parents will be asked to report the use of additional medications during follow-up visits. If a medication with a known major or moderate drug interaction with prednisolone or IVIG or aspirin is essential for a child’s management and cannot be replaced by a drug that does not have an interaction with these therapies, then the trial medication should be stopped and the concomitant medication used.</p>
                <p id="Par149">Since the main differential diagnosis for KD is infection, in line with routine clinical care, we anticipate that many children enrolled will be treated concomitantly with antibiotics (either oral or intravenous). Similarly, since KD is associated with fever, we anticipate that most, if not all, children will receive paracetamol (orally, as rectal suppository, or even intravenously if preferred by the standard of care at the recruiting site). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the relief of pyrexia are contraindicated, however as discussed below. Antibiotics, paracetamol or any other medicines will be documented in the CRF.</p>
                <p id="Par150">In view of the age of participants eligible for inclusion in the trial (up to 15 years only), that pregnancy/breastfeeding is an exclusion criteria, the relatively short duration of follow-up (12 weeks), the fact that participants will be recruited when they are acutely unwell and hospitalised and will likely remain in hospital for at least a week and only be discharged on low-dose aspirin, and that corticosteroids and low-dose aspirin are commonly used in pregnancy the use of contraception is not expected in the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par151">Use of NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin and mefenamic acid, amongst others) except aspirin is not allowed, because they abrogate the anti-platelet effect of low-dose aspirin therefore should be avoided following guidelines.</p>
                <p id="Par152">Immunisations should follow current recommendations regarding immunisations post IVIG. Immunisation with all live vaccines should generally be deferred for at least 6 months following an episode of KD treated with IVIG, mainly due to the potential lack of effectiveness following IVIG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thereafter, all vaccines should be administered as recommended by national schedules. Currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are not live and therefore guidance is as per any non-live vaccines.</p>

                <p id="Par153">We do not anticipate that any of the patients recruited to KD-CAAP will need to continue any of the IMP beyond the 3 months duration of the trial. Post-trial care will be according to local practice and based on the discretion of the local treating clinical team.</p>
                <p id="Par154">The Sponsor of the trial is UCL. UCL holds insurance against claims from participants for injury caused by their participation in the clinical trial. Participants may be able to claim compensation if they can prove that UCL has been negligent. However, as this clinical trial is being carried out in a hospital, the hospital continues to have a duty of care to the participant of the clinical trial. This applies whether the hospital is a National Health Service Trust in the UK or otherwise. Participants may also be able to claim compensation for injury caused by participation in this clinical trial without the need to prove negligence on the part of UCL or another party. Participants who sustain injury and wish to make a claim for compensation should be advised to do so in writing in the first instance to the Chief Investigator, who will pass the claim to the Sponsor’s Insurers, via the Sponsor’s office. Institutions selected to participate in this clinical trial shall provide clinical negligence insurance cover for harm caused by their employees and a copy of the relevant insurance policy or summary shall be provided to UCL, upon request.</p>

                <p id="Par165">CAA has been chosen as the primary endpoint because it is the most meaningful from the clinical viewpoint in terms of future risk of poor outcomes, and accords with previous trials in KD. CAA is defined as meeting the criteria at any time point—that is, it is a binary endpoint of the child ever experiencing this severe outcome. The intention-to-treat analysis of this endpoint therefore assesses the effectiveness of corticosteroids, i.e. is a real-world comparison of the intention to start corticosteroids as soon as possible vs not to start them immediately. To protect children, we have to allow children who are not doing well on their randomised therapy to switch to alternatives—it would not be ethical to propose maintaining children on randomised allocation until the point of developing CAA, which is what would be needed to consider the direct efficacy of corticosteroids vs no corticosteroids. This effectiveness comparison is arguably most relevant to clinicians, on the reasonable assumption that the kind of changes that occur to treatment during the trial would be similar to what would occur outside of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par166">However, in order to estimate the direct efficacy of corticosteroids, we are proposing to conduct a novel inverse probability of (change from) treatment weighting co-primary analysis of the continuous outcome coronary diameter <italic>Z</italic>-score—we will have greatest power to identify differences between corticosteroids vs no corticosteroids (efficacy) with this continuous endpoint. The multiple values will be dealt with using standard repeated measures methods (most commonly generalised estimating equations with the weighting proposed to address efficacy).</p>

                <title>Participant timeline {13}</title>
                <p id="Par193">The following table summarises the time schedule of screening, enrolment and assessments for participants.</p>
                <p id="Par194">Following randomisation, a window of 12 h either side of each trial visit will be permissible for visits up to D5, up to 1 day before and 3 days after for the week 1 assessment, up to 3 days either side of the week 2 assessment and up to 14 days either side for the week 6 and week 12 assessments. A visit on any given day from randomisation will only be counted once against the scheduled visit to which it is closest.</p>
                <p id="Par195">An unscheduled visit should be used to report a visit if it includes required assessment(s) that were not collected at the nearest scheduled visit, or to report any significant clinical event.</p>
                <p id="Par196">Every attempt should be made to keep the blood draw (including any losses in the manoeuver) for research samples within the 3% of the total blood volume recommended for children/adolescents during a period of 6 weeks for all children weighing over 8.75 kg and will not exceed 1% at any single time for all children weighing over 6.87 kg (since the total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 ml/kg body weight, 3% equates to 2.4 ml blood per kg body weight). For any enrolled children lighter than 6.87 kg, the clinician should endeavour to ensure that the total blood volume for research samples does not exceed 1% at any single time. Since KD is an acute, severe illness, bloods required for routine clinical may occasionally surpass these limits as is often the case when managing critically ill children in routine clinical care.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par197">KD-CAAP adopts a novel methodological approach utilising two co-primary outcomes: one assessing the binary intervention of effectiveness of prednisolone (development of CAA or not); the other assessing intervention efficacy based on a continuous numeric outcome (average of the maximum of the <italic>Z</italic>-score of the diameter of the proximal right coronary artery or left anterior descending coronary artery, estimated across weeks 1, 2 and 6), improving the clinical relevance of the trial and using inverse probability weighting methods to adjust for non-compliance with the randomised intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par198">The advantage of the binary CAA primary endpoint is that it is clinically meaningful in terms of future mortality risk, and has been used in previous KD trials.</p>
                <p id="Par199">The sample size calculation was performed in Stata. Our estimated sample size of 262 children/adolescents provides 80% power to detect a reduction in CAA from 20% (based on existing survey data, 1–4) to 8% (based on reductions seen in ‘high-risk’ children, 20–23) (two-sided alpha = 0.05). We assume that this endpoint can be completely ascertained, given its severity and the severity of the condition (meaning 3-month follow-up is likely to be almost complete). Recruiting 262 children/adolescents is realistic over 30 months.</p>
                <p id="Par200">There is, however, a possibility that more children/adolescents in the control group will move to rescue therapy than in the experimental group, resulting in dilution of any efficacy signal in relation to the binary endpoint of presence or absence of CAA. We therefore include a co-primary outcome of average maximum <italic>Z</italic>-score across weeks 1, 2 and 6; analysed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) with inverse probability weighting to account for censoring of children/adolescents at the time they initiate rescue treatment (non-compliance with randomised strategy). This analysis would adjust for baseline <italic>Z</italic>-score using three strata: missing (to allow for the fact that some children/adolescents may not have a scan performed before randomisation), below median, above median. As well as accounting for differences in rescue treatment, this endpoint is continuous, so provides greater power. At any time point, 262 children/adolescents provides &gt; 80% power to detect changes in the maximum coronary artery <italic>Z</italic>-score of 0.4 times the standard deviation (two-sided alpha = 0.05), assuming 13% children/adolescents may have missing values. There are no data to inform what effect estimate could be anticipated on continuous <italic>Z</italic>-scores, and therefore this effect size is pragmatic, based on the sample size for the binary CAA endpoint above.</p>
                <p id="Par201">The two endpoints will be considered separately, each with a nominal 0.05 level of significance, reflecting the fact that KD is a relatively small population in which it is important to generate randomised unbiased evidence and consider its totality. The overall type I error will depend on the correlation between the two effect estimates which is unknown (no data available to estimate this), but will be estimated using bootstrapping at the final analysis. The two endpoints are addressing different aspects (efficacy vs effectiveness) on different outcomes (highly clinically relevant binary endpoint with lower intrinsic power as binary vs potentially less relevant continuous endpoint with higher power as continuous). Therefore, it would be entirely possible to have significance on one and not the other and the clinical judgement is that corticosteroids should still be used immediately in all children.</p>
                <p id="Par202">Given the size of the trial, subgroup analyses are planned only by minimisation factors (excluding country), namely age (&lt; 1 vs ≥ 1 year) and gender.</p>

                <title>Recruitment {15}</title>
                <p id="Par203">We have estimated recruitment rates in at least 30 centres across up to 15 countries in Europe over a 30-month recruitment period (at the time of writing, we have requested a 12-month extension due to pandemic delays). The MRC CTU at UCL is managing the trial and will be responsible for co-ordination of centres recruiting from the UK. The conect4children national hubs will be responsible for co-ordination of recruitment from non-UK sites to enable centres to open to recruitment in a timely fashion and to meet recruitment targets. The KD-CAAP trial design is similar to current standard of care, requiring a similar number of visits as per standard care. Our focus group of children and young people affected by KD showed a clear desire for an evidence base. Patients and parents told us at the focus group that they worry about cardiac outcomes, and therefore are motivated to attend for assessments that include echocardiography at follow-up. The compliance rate is therefore anticipated to be good, and thus loss to follow-up rates very low (less than 2–3%), particularly since follow-up is relatively short (3 months).</p>
                <p id="Par204">Reliable and up-to-date epidemiological data for KD from the UK suggest an incidence of 4.55 per 100,000 children under the age of 5 years per annum. In a recent British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) study, we had 553 cases over 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A KD-CAAP feasibility study circulated through the C4C network has indicated preparedness across 17 countries, with multiple centres willing to recruit to the trial. Survey responses across Europe (including the C4C network, but also the PRINTO network) also indicated a similar case load to that suggested by the UK BPSU study. Thus, recruitment of 262 KD patients from at least 30 centres across Europe will be achievable over 30 months.</p>

Epidemiological data suggest worse outcomes in terms of CAA for very young patients (age &lt; 1 years) and male children/adolescents, who will therefore form two key subgroup analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There remains significant equipoise about the use of corticosteroids in this young age group, however, and therefore it is essential to include these patients in KD-CAAP. In order to balance the groups for these two factors (age &lt; 1 versus ≥ 1 year, sex), randomisation will be stratified for these two factors, as well as for recruiting country.</p>

Thereafter, the final trial assessment will be carried out at week 12 (last follow-up visit for each individual patient) after randomisation. A window of 12 h either side of each trial visit will be permissible for visits up to D5, up to 1 day before and 3 days after for the week 1 assessment, up to 3 days either side of the week 2 assessment and up to 14 days either side for the week 6 and week 12 assessments. However, if a child/adolescent attends late, all information required at the missed visit should still be collected, even if they attend outside the window. Further, given the age of the participants and the acuity of the illness, visits that do not happen within these windows will not be considered as protocol deviations.

Relevant country-specific translations for these tools are available. It will be scored at day 0 and week 12. The PedsQLTM is a 23-item generic QoL questionnaire that has a child self-report for ages 5 through 18 years and a parent proxy report for children ages 2 through 18 years. The questionnaire takes 5 to 10 min to complete. The questionnaire yields information on the physical, emotional, social and school functioning of the child during the previous 4 weeks. It has been extensively tested in both healthy children and children with chronic disease. Mean scores are calculated based on a 5- point response scale for each item and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with a higher score representing better quality of life. The PedsQLTM yields 3 summary scores: a total scale score, a physical health summary score and a psychosocial health summary score. There are 4 scale scores: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning. The total score is comprised of the average of all items in the questionnaire. The psychosocial summary score is comprised of the average of the items in the emotional, social and school functioning scales.

                <p id="Par232">The expected lost to follow-up is likely to be minimal due to the duration of the trial. A parent/guardian who chooses to discontinue trial treatment for their child/adolescent should be encouraged to follow the trial procedures and follow-up schedule. However, if they do not wish to remain on trial follow-up, their decision must be respected and the child/adolescent will be withdrawn from the trial. The CTU should be informed of this in writing using the appropriate documentation. Prior to transferring to routine follow-up, the parent/guardian will be asked to have assessments performed as appropriate for a final trial visit. They would be at liberty to refuse any or all individual components of the follow-up assessments.</p>
                <p id="Par233">If follow-up is stopped early, the medical data collected during their participation in the trial will be kept and used in the analysis for the KD-CAAP trial, as consent cannot be withdrawn for data already collected. Similarly, samples and data obtained prior to this time will be processed according to the protocol for further research, unless the parent/guardian explicitly and unprompted requests otherwise. Consent for future use of stored samples already collected can be refused if follow-up is stopped early (but this should follow a discussion).</p>

                <p id="Par241">The recruitment of large numbers of KD patients from multiple centres in Europe together with the collection of throat swab and low volume blood samples at multiple timepoints will be invaluable for future research on the diagnosis, aetiology, pathogenesis and genetics of the KD. So we propose a number of sub-studies in the context of KD-CAAP.</p>
                <p id="Par242">Over the past decade, there has been increasing evidence of the utility of RNA expression profiling to diagnose and understand the mechanisms involved in infectious and inflammatory diseases, and the development of minimal gene signatures that enable each condition to be diagnosed using small numbers of transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. KD can be distinguished from a wide range of infectious and inflammatory disorders with as few as 13 gene transcripts. The small number of transcripts, and high level of sensitivity and specificity of the RNA signature, suggest that it could be developed as a diagnostic test. The KD-CAAP trial will enable validation of this approach, and investigation of whether RNA profiling can predict treatment response. Retrospective analysis of RNA samples will enable improved diagnostic accuracy of KD diagnosis for patients recruited to the trial. In parallel to RNA profiling, collection of serial serum and plasma samples will enable a parallel proteomic and metabolomic approach.</p>
                <p id="Par243">Collection of DNA, RNA, plasma and throat swabs from the trial cohort will advance research on mechanisms and aetiology of KD, through interrogation of the host response and of potential viral and bacterial pathogens or triggers. A major international effort is underway to identify precipitating infectious agents, including a metagenomic study of throat or nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. Samples taken on diagnosis from this trial will contribute to this larger study.</p>
                <p id="Par244">Genetic studies have shown important roles for gene variants in KD susceptibility and aneurysm formation. Patients recruited to the trial will be included in International KD Genetics studies<bold>.</bold> Protocols regarding collection, storage, analysis and eventual destruction of all biological materials are provided in the supplemental laboratory standard operating procedure (see supplemental material).</p>

                <p id="Par245">The primary analysis population is intention-to-treat, ITT, which consists of all patients as randomised, regardless of treatment received (using inverse probability weighting to adjust for rescue treatment for the efficacy co-primary endpoint). Primary analysis will adjust for randomisation stratification factors, and secondary analyses will be unadjusted.</p>
                <p id="Par246">For the primary endpoints, analysis will include complete cases only if there is missing data in less than 10% of participants. If there is missing data in &gt; 10%, for the binary endpoint multiple imputation (MI) by chained equations will be used to adjust for this. MI will be performed separately for each randomised group using logistic regression. If there is missing data, &gt; 10% of participants for the continuous endpoint, additional probability weights will be used to adjust for this. All secondary endpoints will be analysed with complete cases only.</p>
                <p id="Par247">The CAA co-primary endpoint will be analysed using marginal effects after a logistic regression to calculate a risk difference and 95% confidence interval. The efficacy co-primary endpoint will be analysed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) with an independent correlation structure, with inverse probability weighting to account for censoring of children/adolescents at the time they initiate rescue treatment. This analysis will adjust for baseline <italic>Z</italic>-score using three categories: missing (as not all patients will have an echocardiogram at baseline), below median and above median. Weights will be calculated using logistic regression to determine the probability of receiving rescue treatment based on baseline characteristics (age, CRP and temperature at screening, baseline <italic>Z</italic>-score (if available, otherwise using a ‘missing’ group as above), country).</p>
                <p id="Par248">Analysis of secondary outcomes will use logrank tests and Cox regression for time-to-event outcomes, exact tests and binomial regression for binary outcomes, and <italic>t</italic>-tests and normal linear regression (potentially on log-transformed data depending on the observed data distribution, adjusted for baseline values) for continuous outcomes. Ranksum tests will be used if there is gross departure from normality that cannot be adequately addressed by data transformation. GEE with independent working correlation will be used to provide global tests of repeated measures. Adverse events will also be summarised by body system.</p>

We will do this using unit cost values for each country, allowing costs to be assessed from the health care provider perspective in each country. We will convert the HRQL measures into utility scores using country-specific tariffs where available and will use these to compute 3-month QALYs for every participant. We will then undertake a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis calculating the incremental cost per unit of outcome gained, where outcomes will be measured separately in terms of the co-primary outcomes of the trial and QALYs. We will undertake extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, including calculating cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. We will also use the incremental cost estimates combined with projected population sizes to calculate the budget impact of the new treatment regime.</p>

Similarly, IVIG and low-dose aspirin (to reduce pre-eclampsia) are used in pregnancy. Given the age range that will be recruited and short duration of follow-up, a pregnancy test for adolescents menstruating will be carried out at week 12. Adolescents who become pregnant within their trial participation will be followed up to pregnancy outcome. Administration of the trial IMP if pregnancy is identified should be managed by the local investigator taking into account the risks and benefits to both the participant, given the serious and acute nature of Kawasaki disease, and to the unborn child.</p>
                <p id="Par276">All AEs should be recorded in the patient’s medical notes. All grade 3 or 4 adverse events should be reported on the relevant CRFs, as should be adverse events of any grade that lead to modification of IVIG, aspirin or corticosteroids, clinical adverse events judged definitely/probably/possibly related to IVIG, aspirin or corticosteroids and any SAEs. SAEs should be notified to the CTU within 24 h of the investigator becoming aware of the event. When an AE or AR occurs, the investigator responsible for the care of the child/adolescent must first assess whether or not the event is serious using the definition given in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. If the event is serious, then an SAE form must be completed and the CTU notified within 24 h.</p>
                <p id="Par277">The severity of all AEs and/or ARs (serious and non-serious) in this trial should be graded using the toxicity grading in The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events.</p>

There are five categories: unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable and definitely related to receipt of the trial drug.

                <p id="Par282">If the IMP’s causal relationship to the serious adverse event has been assessed as possible, probable or definitely, the CTU has the responsibility to determine the expectedness of the event to the trial IMP. An unexpected adverse reaction is one that is not listed within the trial Reference Safety Information or one that is more frequent or more severe than previously reported. If a SAR to the trial IMP is assessed as being unexpected, it becomes a SUSAR. Section 4.8 of a representative SPC will be considered as the Reference Safety Information. The trial Safety Management Plan will define the choice of SPC.</p>

Fatal and life-threatening SUSARs must be reported to the competent authorities within 7 days of the CTU becoming aware of the event; other SUSARs must be reported within 15 days.

It is anticipated that several opportunities will arise for publication during the course of and following completion of the KD-CAAP trial. Publications include papers (including abstracts) for presentation at national and international meetings, as well as the preparation of manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication. All publications are to be approved by the TMG and TSC before submission for publication. Any publication arising before the end of the trial (not by randomised groups) will also be approved by the DMC to ensure that the primary objective of the trial (the randomised comparison) is not compromised. No analyses by randomised group of any outcome (primary, secondary or other) in either the main trial or associated sub-studies will be conducted or presented before the end of the trial, other than those for interim review by the DMC. In line with MRC policy that the results of publicly funded research should be freely available, manuscripts arising from the trial will, wherever possible, be submitted to peer-reviewed journals which enable Open Access via UK PubMed Central (PMC) within 6 months of the official date of final publication. Wider public dissemination also falls into the remit of the patient engagement work which is being undertaken as part of KDCAAP facilitated by Societi UK.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par292">Several recent studies have indicated that coronary complications associated with KD across Europe are much higher than early trials of IVIG had initially suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. KD-CAAP directly addresses this issue by exploring the therapeutic benefit of adjunctive corticosteroids in unselected KD cases. If we find that corticosteroids prevent CAA, and are safe, this is a cheap and widely available intervention that would be implemented immediately for the benefit of children across Europe and likely North America where these issues are of similar concern.</p>
              <p id="Par293">One of the novelties of KD-CAAP is that it will have two co-primary end points and will explore both the effectiveness and efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in unselected KD cases, in contrast to previous studies which focused on predominantly severe Japanese KD cases. Despite several comparative and non-comparative studies comparing the impact of corticosteroids in KD, this potentially highly effective treatment is not commonly used across Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Several factors likely explain this: inability to identify high-risk children early on in the disease course, when the meta-analysis suggests benefits will be greatest; lack of clarity on wider benefits in terms of longer-term cardiovascular health in children without overt vasculitis (coronary artery aneurysms, CAA); relative weakness of the evidence base with randomised trial evidence being relatively small; and concerns about generalizability of findings from Japanese studies to non-Japanese populations in case ethnic differences contribute to variable efficacy. KD-CAAP will delineate the evidence supporting adjunctive corticosteroids (or not), in all-comers with KD, leading to a pragmatic and easily implementable recommendation.</p>
              <p id="Par294">Historically, resolution of fever has been regarded as the sole metric of therapeutic success when treating acute KD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], but this is inadequate in isolation and may lead to false reassurance of therapeutic response. KD-CAAP includes check points for additional /rescue treatments to be added depending upon resolution of fever, and for the first-time normalisation of CRP. We have designed a trial that also actively manages the control group with rigorous assessments based on clinical status, fever and CRP to determine IVIG treatment failure in the control group, whilst keeping them corticosteroid-free. Such an approach was strongly supported by patient representatives and makes the trial ethically much more feasible. We highlight that KD-CAAP has been designed from its earliest inception with strong patient involvement (Societi UK). This close partnership with patient representatives will ensure successful delivery of the trial and dissemination of results to other patients and the wider public. Lastly, another novelty of KD-CAAP is the use of the pGTI to assess systematically corticosteroid toxicity in addition to adverse event reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par295">KD-CAAP is one of the academic proof of viability studies supported by the conect4children (c4c) network, a novel European research network that aims to facilitate drug research in children (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://conect4children.org">https://conect4children.org</ext-link>). The specific goal of the c4c consortium is to set up and evaluate selected elements of a paediatric-focused clinical trial infrastructure that are tailored to meet the needs of children involved in clinical trials. The elements are as follows: expert advice providing input on study design and/or paediatric development programmes (including patient involvement activities); a network of sites following harmonised procedures and coordinated by national hubs (NH) and a single point of contact (SPoC) for Europe; a facility for education and training for sites and trial teams; and support for managing data used by the network and a common paediatric data dictionary. The work of c4c on trials is being evaluated through studies such as KD-CAAP that will test the viability of the network and will provide outputs such as reports on operational feasibility at country and site level, consistent support for trial conduct, and facilitation of timely opening and completion of trials.</p>
              <p id="Par296">We highlight that the risks of subjects’ involvement in KD-CAAP were also specifically assessed in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the applicable precautionary response measures in place at both a local or national level for participating sites and countries. Together with c4c, we have worked on mitigating the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic through a comprehensive business continuity plan. The main barriers to the progression of KD-CAAP were the availability of staff to work on the clinical studies or their ability to process contracts and submit applications for ethical and other regulatory approvals, and the prioritisation of COVID-related trials and studies over any other type of trial or research activity across several European countries. This has inevitably led to a delay of at least 12 months in site set-up, with a direct impact on recruitment timelines for KD-CAAP. The possibility of remote patient visits was also explored but this was not possible for the primary outcome assessment (echocardiography) and some other study procedures (blood tests). We have also explored remote monitoring, but some national regulatory authorities limit this approach. Shortage of supply of IVIG is currently closely monitored and so far has not impacted our progress.</p>
              <p id="Par297">An additional challenge we face relates to the diagnostic equipoise between KD and a novel hyperinflammatory syndrome in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 that has recently emerged, referred to as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. PIMS-TS possibly represents a rare, delayed immune-mediated response rather than direct viral sepsis in a small minority of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Patients with PIMS-TS may have KD-like feature, but typically have shock requiring intensive care unit admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. KD-CAAP already excludes patients with cardiogenic shock and therefore so far has not been impeded by inclusion of patients with PIMS-TS. In addition, treatment of PIMS-TS and KD is essentially the same, with corticosteroids and IVIG forming the mainstay, further reducing risk of any harm to patients if the diagnosis changes after recruitment to KD-CAAP. Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 may trigger KD but this should not have any impact on treatment as patients should still receive KD treatment and be considered for recruitment to KD-CAAP irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 or any other infectious trigger. Lastly, we are currently considering some additional biomarker studies to examine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and serology status on the results of KD-CAAP.</p>
              <p id="Par298">In summary, KD-CAAP is a multicentre randomised, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint assessed, trial that for the first time explores the efficacy of adjunctive corticosteroids in the prevention of CAA in unselected cases of KD across Europe and is likely to lead to easily implementable changes in the management of KD.</p>

              <p>DE, PB, NK and ASW conceived the idea for the trial; all co-authors contributed to the trial design and protocol development and drafted and approved this manuscript. All publications are to be approved by the TMG and TSC before submission for publication. Any publication arising before the end of the trial (not by randomised groups) will also be approved by the DMC in order to ensure that the primary objective of the trial (the randomised comparison) is not compromised. In particular, no analyses by randomised group of any outcome (primary, secondary or other) in either the main trial or associated sub-studies will be conducted or presented before the end of the trial, other than those for interim review by the DMC. The TMG and TSC will resolve problems of authorship and maintain the quality of publications. For all publications, the TMG will nominate a chairperson or approve an individual’s request to chair a manuscript writing committee. The chair will usually be the primary or senior author. The chairperson is responsible for identifying fellow authors and for determining with that group the order of authorship that will appear on the manuscript. The TSC will resolve any problems of authorship and maintain the quality of publications.</p>
