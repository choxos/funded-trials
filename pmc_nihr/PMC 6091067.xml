                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Early detection of oesophageal cancer improves outcomes; however, the optimal strategy for identifying patients at increased risk from the pre-cancerous lesion Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) is not clear. The Cytosponge, a novel non-endoscopic sponge device, combined with the biomarker Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) has been tested in four clinical studies. It was found to be safe, accurate and acceptable to patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">The aim of the BEST3 trial is to evaluate if the offer of a Cytosponge-TFF3 test in primary care for patients on long term acid suppressants leads to an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with BE.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The BEST3 trial is a pragmatic multi-site cluster-randomised controlled trial set in primary care in England. Approximately 120 practices will be randomised 1:1 to either the intervention arm, invitation to a Cytosponge-TFF3 test, or the control arm usual care. Inclusion criteria are men and women aged 50 or over with records of at least 6 months of prescriptions for acid-suppressants in the last year. Patients in the intervention arm will receive an invitation to have a Cytosponge-TFF3 test in their general practice. Patients with a positive TFF3 test will receive an invitation for an upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy at their local hospital-based endoscopy clinic to test for BE.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The primary objective is to compare histologically confirmed BE diagnosis between the intervention and control arms to determine whether the offer of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test in primary care results in an increase in BE diagnosis within 12 months of study entry.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">The BEST3 trial is a well-powered pragmatic trial testing the use of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test in the same population that we envisage it being used in clinical practice. The data generated from this trial will enable NICE and other clinical bodies to decide whether this test is suitable for routine clinical use.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par37">Incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased six-fold since the 1970s and carries a dismal prognosis (13% 5-year survival) despite advances in neo-adjuvant therapy and surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical guidelines have focused on urgent referral for those with alarm symptoms, specifically dysphagia, chronic gastro-intestinal bleeding, weight loss, persistent vomiting, anaemia or an epigastric mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Routine referral is advised for those with reflux symptoms that persist despite recommended lifestyle and pharmacological management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. General Practice (GP) referral rates vary widely and low endoscopy referral rates have been linked with poor outcomes from oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">Approximately 3 to 6% of individuals with reflux predominant symptoms may have Barrett’s oEsophagus (BE), the precursor lesion to EAC. However, only 20 to 25% of patients with BE are diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is estimated that the burden of EAC could be reduced by up to 50% as a result of increasing the proportion of individuals with reflux predominant symptoms who are investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This is a formidable task since dyspepsia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affect between 5 and 20% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and account for up to 10% of GP consultations in the UK.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Endoscopic treatment of BE, which progresses through dysplastic and superficially invasive stages, can prevent the development of EAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Indeed, endoscopic treatment is now recommended for patients with low and high grade dysplasia following new randomised controlled trial evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By identifying and referring to endoscopy those most likely to have BE, it should be possible to reduce mortality from EAC in patients with reflux who would not otherwise receive endoscopy.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Cytosponge diagnostic test for Barrett’s oESophagus</title>
                <p id="Par40">A non-endoscopic diagnostic modality for BE has been developed which involves a device called the Cytosponge™ combined with molecular biomarker Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cytosponge™ expanded (left) and in gelatin capsule (right) (<bold>b</bold>) representative picture of positive TFF3 staining in a sample from a patient with BE (× 20 magnification)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2018_4664_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par41">The Cytosponge™ consists of a Class I, non-CE marked 3 cm diameter, polyester, medical grade mesh sphere on a string, compressed within a gelatine capsule. The capsule is swallowed while holding onto the string. After 5 min, the gelatine capsule has dissolved allowing the sphere to expand. Using the string the sphere is pulled from the stomach to the oesophagus and mouth thus collecting cells from the whole of the BE segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as well as from the squamous oesophagus and oropharynx. The sample is put into a preservative, processed, and assessed for the presence of BE via immunohistochemical staining for TFF3.</p>
                <p id="Par42">A series of four clinical studies have been carried out so far with the following findings (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). First, no serious adverse events were attributed to the Cytosponge™ after administering this test over 2000 patients, showing that it is a safe intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Second, the Cytosponge™ is acceptable to patients with a mean score of 6.0 (95%CI 5.0–8.0) on a visual analogue scale from zero (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) reported by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Third, the Cytosponge intervention was shown to be transferable to the NHS: 27 nurses were trained with a single training session in 11 sites and sample processing was run in an NHS pathology laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Fourth, a feasibility study conducted in 504 patients in 11 general practices showed that the intervention can be applied to primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Fifth, the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test was found to be accurate for diagnosing BE regardless of patient cohort or study setting. Last, this test is cost-effective in comparison to the usual care. A micro-simulation model suggested a gain of 0.015 QALYs (Quality adjusted life years) and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15,700 per QALY for Cytosponge™ versus endoscopic diagnosis of BE followed by endoscopic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Studies summary, sensitivity and specificity of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test per segment length</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study Ref n#</th><th>Publication Year</th><th>Study type</th><th>Setting</th><th>BE length</th><th>Sensitivity % (95% CI)</th><th>Specificity % (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pilot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]</td><td>2008</td><td>Cohort</td><td>2<sup>ary</sup> care</td><td>≥C1</td><td>78.0 (64.0–89.0)</td><td>94.0 (87.0–98.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">BEST1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]</td><td rowspan="2">2010</td><td rowspan="2">Prospective</td><td>1<sup>ary</sup> care</td><td>≥C1</td><td>73.3 (44.9–92.2)</td><td>93.8 (91.3–95.8)</td></tr><tr><td/><td>≥C2</td><td>90.0 (55.5–99.7)</td><td>93.5 (90.9–95.5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">BEST2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</td><td rowspan="3">2014</td><td rowspan="3">Case:control</td><td rowspan="3">2<sup>ary</sup> care</td><td>≥C1</td><td>79.5 (75.9–82.9)</td><td rowspan="3">92.4 (89.5–94.7)</td></tr><tr><td>≥C2</td><td>83.9 (80.0–87.3)</td></tr><tr><td>≥C3</td><td>87.2 (83.0–90.6)</td></tr><tr><td>CASE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]</td><td>2015</td><td>Cohort</td><td>2<sup>ary</sup> care</td><td>≥C1 or ≥ M3<break/>≥C3</td><td>95.4 (86.9–98.9)<break/>96.8 (83.7–99.5)</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par43">Our long-term vision is for the Cytosponge™-TFF3 technology to be adopted as a triage test within the standard primary care clinical pathway for patients on treatment with acid suppressants (proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)) who do not fulfil the referral criteria for endoscopy. This strategy will increase the proportion of patients diagnosed with BE, and in turn allow for endoscopic therapy and monitoring for those at greatest risk of EAC.</p>

Other secondary objectives include confirming the safety and diagnostic accuracy of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test and determining the uptake in primary care. Inviting 10% of BEST3 participants for a research endoscopy will enable us to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test in primary care. We will also assess the acceptability of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test to patients, GPs and practice nurses, and their experiences of its use in primary care.

Patients with a positive TFF3 test will receive an invitation for an upper gastro-intestinal (GI) endoscopy at their local hospital-based endoscopy clinic to test for BE. In addition to the TFF3-positive patients, 10% of the patients in each arm (who have not had an endoscopy since the start of the trial) will be randomly selected to be invited for an endoscopy at approximately 12 months.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>BEST3 trial design overview showing both BEST3 anonymous data collection steps (green) and intervention, Cytosponge™-TFF3 test or upper GI endoscopy related procedures (blue)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2018_4664_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

If a practice database search identifies more than 100 eligible patients, 100 patients will be randomly selected to be included in the trial. Once the practice consents to participate in BEST3, each practice will be randomised via block randomisation and stratified by number of eligible patients. Three groups of approximately 40 practices are proposed, each with the following number of patients:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par52">Stratum 1 (small practices): 50–60</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Stratum 2 (medium practices): 61–74</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Stratum 3 (large practices): 75–100.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par55">The number of patients invited in each stratum and/or the number of strata used might be increased depending on uptake of the Cytosponge. Once a practice has consented to participate in the trial, a database search will be carried out to determine the number of eligible patients and as part of which stratum they will be randomised. Practices will be randomised 1:1 between the intervention and control arms. Randomisation will be balanced by geographical area to ensure that Cytosponge™ clinics will have similar number of bookings in each area. However, as the number of eligible patients in the different practices who will participate is not definite, the number of practices per stratum and the number of strata overall will be adjusted as necessary. The process will be managed so that number of practices in each arm and each stratum will be equal and that the numbers of participants per practice within a stratum will be similar.</p>

The capsule reaches the stomach while remaining attached to the string which is held onto by the patient or nurse (and which is affixed to a card preventing inadvertent swallowing of the entire string). In the stomach the capsule is left for up to 5 min where it dissolves allowing the sponge to expand to its full size. It is then withdrawn by the research nurse using the string, and as it does so collects cells from the lining of the oesophagus. The retrieved sphere is placed in preservative liquid. Linked anonymised samples will be sent directly from the practice to the pathology laboratory to be processed and analysed for TFF3 and H&amp;E.</p>

                  <p id="Par113">The assumed 4% prevalence of BE in individuals eligible for the study was based on the BEST1 trial, which reported 3% in a population, but included patients with less severe GORD compared with the BEST3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since only 50% of patients in the Cytosponge™ arm are predicted to have the Cytosponge™ test and patients who do not take up the offer of the test will have the same management as if they were in the usual care arm we only expect 2.0% of patients in the intervention arm to be diagnosed with BE. Furthermore, we expect 0.6% of patients in the usual care arm to be diagnosed with BE. For a 90% power (not allowing for clustering) comparing 0.6% with 2.0%, we would need 3028 individuals (1514 in each arm).</p>
                  <p id="Par114">To account for the fact that individuals within a cluster, here a GP practice, might be more similar to each other than to individuals in other clusters, the number of participants required for an individually randomized trial has to be increased. The sample size calculations were adjusted for cluster randomization using the variance inflation factor (VIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We allowed for variation in practice size and adjusted the sample size calculations for three groups of practices recruiting either 50–60, 61–74 and 75–100 patients. Allowing for intra-cluster correlation of 0.025, an overall coefficient of variation of 0.2, and mean cluster sizes of 55, 68 and 88 the VIF was estimated as 2.4, 2.7 and 3.3 respectively. Multiplying the VIF with the sample size estimated for individual randomization for each stratum, we would need a total of 8488<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> patients. If we are recruiting three groups of 40 practices with 50–60, 61–74, or 75–100 patients each, then 120 practices will result in approximately 90% power. Assuming 50% uptake, this would result in 2122 patients having the Cytosponge™ test. If the uptake is lower, the overall number of patients entered into BEST3 will be increased so that still a total of 2122 patients will have the Cytosponge test.</p>

                  <p id="Par123">To gain an in-depth understanding of the health economics of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test we will undertake a detailed analysis of the cost and cost-effectiveness of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test versus usual care from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services. For the cost analysis, cost components will include costs of diagnosis using the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test, endoscopies and biopsies, endotherapy, oesophagectomy, and follow-up in primary and secondary care. Volume of resource use data will be collected from practice records up until 12 months after study entry. Unit costs will be taken from published sources such as NHS Reference Costs, the British National Formulary, and the Personal and Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU). We will calculate mean (SD) and median (IQR) costs for both study arms for each cost component and all components combined.</p>
                  <p id="Par124">Cost-effectiveness will be measured in terms of the incremental cost per QALY gained. We will adapt a previously-developed decision analytic model which compared the cost-effectiveness of three strategies: Cytosponge™ screening with confirmatory endoscopy, endoscopy alone, and no screening, for 50 year-old men with GERD. The parameters for prevalence of BE, sensitivity and specificity of screening, uptake of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test, costs and utilities will be updated to reflect the BEST3 data. For these and all other parameters, including disease progression and management strategies, we will search the literature for updated evidence. We will extend the modelled population to also include women over 60 years, obtaining gender/age-specific parameters from BEST3 or searches of the literature where necessary. We will also undertake value-of-information (VoI) analyses, based on the notion that investing in further research on probabilities of events, HRQL and costs will reduce decision uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test. This will include both the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI). The latter focusing on individual model parameters or groups of parameters.</p>
                  <p id="Par125">As well as looking at total costs, costs will be disaggregated by sector since this may affect implementation of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test. Using epidemiological data on the national incidence of reflux predominant symptoms plus cost data from the present study we will also undertake a budget impact study to calculate what the total cost would be to the NHS if the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test was rolled out nationally.</p>

This protocol was used for the pilot phase of BEST3, which consisted of the first 6 practices, to evaluate the feasibility of this design. The study design was then amended based on the findings from the these practices (uptake = ~ 30%; male: female ratio = 46:54%) (Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). In brief, patients will receive one reminder about their invitation to make a Cytosponge™-TFF3 test appointment. Furthermore, we may adopt a shorter follow up period for practices recruited later in the trial using a simulation tool to ensure parity across datasets. This will allow timely completion of the trial. Overall, the pilot phase showed that the study design was logistically sound and that the full study could go ahead.<table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Amendments to the study protocol post pilot phase</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Pilot study findings</th><th>Amendments to study protocol</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Female to male ratio slightly higher than 50:50 overall</td><td>If the proportion of females to males consistently exceeds 55:45 within the overall cohort, the study team may institute a 50:50 split for females: males in line with known BE prevalence, at the discretion of the Trial Statistician.</td></tr><tr><td>Cytosponge™ appointment uptake &lt; 50%</td><td>Patients will receive a total of one reminder in the form of a letter, phone call or text message.</td></tr><tr><td>Time required for practice and patient recruitment might take longer for each practice than anticipated</td><td>Practices recruited in the latter stages of the trial may adopt a 6 month follow-up period to allow timely completion of study activities with a simulation tool used to ensure parity across the datasets.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par127">Due to the continuing low uptake of less than 30% further amendments were made after the 6-month milestone review (Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption><p>Amendments to the study protocol post 6 months milestone review</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Milestone review findings</th><th>Amendments to study protocol</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cytosponge appointment uptake 27%: Substantial impact on sample size as number of practices would have to be increased to ~ 200</td><td>1) Sample size amended<break/>- Using uptake = 27%<break/>- including patients with false negative Cytosponge test diagnosed with BE during 12-month follow-up: (1–0.85)*0.6%<break/>2) Additional individual randomisation arm added to reduce the sample size</td><td>- Individual randomisation sample size (without adjusting for cluster randomisation): 6764<break/>- Variance inflation factor (VIF) for confirmed and projected sample sizes are 3.72 and 4.5, respectively. 1 individually randomised participant would therefore be equivalent to 3.72 or 4.5 cluster randomised participants<break/>- Practices already commenced set up on the cluster randomisation design allowed to continue to randomise in a cluster fashion<break/>- Sample size will be adjusted depending on number of patients in cluster randomised group</td></tr><tr><td>Due to small number of smaller practices, stratification by both area and practice size has resulted in imbalances in arm allocations for some areas</td><td>Stratification by practice size will not be taken into account during randomisation but in the analysis instead</td><td>- To simplify randomisation and avoid any further imbalances for remaining cluster randomisation practices<break/>- Analysis: the primary analysis will be a stratified test of proportions taking into account the variation inflation within each stratum.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par128">Firstly, to obtain sufficient power without greatly expanding the number of participants and practices required, we plan the addition of an individually randomised group to the current design. Practices already setup or trained to take part in the cluster-randomised arm will be permitted to continue with this randomisation method. Newly engaged practices will randomise using individual randomisation methods. The sample size calculations have also been updated to include patients in the intervention arm with a false-negative Cytosponge™-TFF3 test as having the same chance of a BE diagnosis via routine endoscopy as in the control arm (10%). This adjustment and the updated uptake of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test allowed us to estimate that about 1.4% patients in the intervention arm will be diagnosed with BE within 1 year of follow-up. Requiring 90% power and a significance level of 0.05% gives am updated sample size of 6764 individually randomised patients. The VIF for practices randomised up to now is 3.72, whereas we are using a VIF of 4.5 for practices which have not been randomised yet as we do not know the number of recruited patients yet. One individually randomised participant would therefore be equivalent to 3.72 or 4.5 cluster randomised participants. Based on confirmed and projected numbers of participants in cluster-randomised practices, we anticipate 11,816 patients from 100 practices contributing the equivalent of 2924 individually randomised patients. That would leave 3840 to be recruited from practices employing individual randomisation and a total sample size of 15,656 participants overall.</p>
                <p id="Par129">Secondly, due to small numbers of smaller practices, stratification by both area and practice size has resulted in imbalances in arm allocations for some areas. Stratification by practice size will not be taken into account during randomisation anymore, but in the analysis instead.</p>
                <p id="Par130">These changes will ensure that the sample size will be sufficiently large to detect differences in BE diagnosis between the two arms and that the study will be completed in the time frame required.</p>

Additionally, BEST2 has established that the sensitivity to BE of the Cytosponge with TFF3 staining is very high.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par135">The key question is to know how the use of the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test would work in practice. Hence, we need a pragmatic clinical trial and the most appropriate control arm is “usual care”.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par136">We considered individual randomisation in the original trial design, but rejected it because we were planning to offer the Cytosponge prospectively to patients who consulted about reflux. As some patients would have had more than one consultation during the recruitment period there was a risk that they would get randomised more than once. Furthermore, it might have been difficult for GPs to remember which arm a patient would have been in, and how to advice them. As we are now recruiting prevalent patients, these issues would not occur. However, cluster randomisation was initially chosen as it makes the day to day management of the trial easier for general practice teams.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par137">There is also a “mechanistic” element to the trial. People are also interested in what might be the features of individuals who have a false negative Cytosponge™-TFF3 test and what other benign diseases (of the oesophagus or the stomach) would be diagnosed or missed by offering the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test to patients. Hence, we propose offering endoscopy for research purposes to a sample (10%) of patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par138">Analysis of a CPRD cohort has shown that patients with at least 6 months of prescriptions for an acid suppressant are the most suitable for this trial, as they had the highest conversion rate to BE (manuscript in preparation). Eligible patients will therefore be identified and invited based on a GP database search.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par139">Informing patients in the usual care arm about this increased risk and a new diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of BE, but not giving them the opportunity of having this test, could result in increased patient worry.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par140">A qualitative study carried out to aid in the design on the BEST3 trial showed that the majority of participants were not aware of the increased risk of BE and oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Some participants felt that telling patients who are being invited to have the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test about the link between GERD, BE and cancer would scare them. Furthermore, usual care arm patients might be requesting the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test in practices where it is not available or endoscopies creating additional burden for endoscopy services. Therefore, patients in both arms will first only be informed about the BEST3 anonymous data collection, but not told about the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test. Patients in the BEST3 intervention arm will then be separately invited to the Cytosponge™-TFF3 test. The PPI representatives based at Cambridge University Hospitals felt this study design was appropriate.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par141">With the incidence of EAC having increased dramatically over the last 30 to 40 years and it being the highest in the UK worldwide, this test has the potential to reduce the number of late diagnoses and therefore increase 5-year survival significantly. The BEST3 trial is a well powered pragmatic trial testing the use of the Cytosponge-TFF3 test in the same population that we envisage it being used in clinical practice and will be reasonably short lasting only 3 years. The data generated from this trial will enable NICE and other clinical bodies to decide whether this test is suitable for clinical use.</p>
