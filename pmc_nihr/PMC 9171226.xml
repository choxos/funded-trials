                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>About 6% of the UK general practice population has a record of a penicillin allergy but fewer than 10% of these are likely to be truly allergic. In the ALABAMA (Allergy Antibiotics and Microbial resistance) feasibility trial, primary care patients with penicillin allergy were randomised to penicillin allergy assessment pathway or usual care to assess the effect on health outcomes. A behavioural intervention package was developed to aid delabelling. This study aimed to investigate patients’ and clinicians’ views of penicillin allergy testing (PAT).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>We conducted a mixed-methods process evaluation embedded within the ALABAMA trial, which included a clinician survey, a patient survey (at baseline and follow-up) and semistructured interviews with patients and clinicians.</p>

                  <p>The study was conducted in primary care, as part of the feasibility stage of the ALABAMA trial.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Clinicians (N=53; 52.2%) were positive about PAT and its potential value but did not have previous experience of referring patients for a PAT and were unsure whether patients would take penicillin after a negative allergy test. Patients (N=36; 46%) were unsure whether they were severely allergic to penicillin and did not fear a severe allergic reaction to penicillin. Clinician interviews showed that they were already aware of the benefit of PAT. Interviews with patients suggested the importance of safety as patients valued having numerous opportunities to address their concerns about safety of the test.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A total of 6%–10% of primary care patients in the UK have a penicillin allergy record<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> but fewer than 10% of these patients are likely to be allergic when formally tested,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which means that a large proportion of these people are unnecessarily avoiding first-line antibiotic treatments. Penicillin allergy testing (PAT), usually undertaken in specialist immunology clinics, offers the opportunity to confirm or discount a penicillin allergy, although such services are only currently available for a limited number of patients. The negative consequences of having a penicillin allergy record include: suboptimal clinical outcomes, increased antibiotic resistance<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> and higher healthcare costs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7 8</xref>
</p>
              <p>Barriers to removing incorrect penicillin allergy records include lack of standardised protocols across practices,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> lack of access to skin testing (ST)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and the difficulty of convincing patients that the record is no longer needed after a negative test.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> These studies also suggest multiple ways to improve research, testing and implementation of penicillin allergy delabelling initiatives such as easier access to ST reagents, standardised ST protocols and a greater understanding of penicillin allergy epidemiology.</p>
              <p>There is limited understanding of the views of patients and primary care healthcare professionals on delabelling initiatives in primary care. Specifically, it would be helpful to have a better understanding of their views about simplifying and standardising ST protocols for use only in high risk patients and performing routine direct oral challenges in individuals with low-risk histories to confirm current tolerance. It is necessary to develop a greater appreciation in patients and clinicians of the well-established epidemiology of suspected penicillin allergy, particularly how rarely it is confirmed. The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)-funded Allergy Antibiotics and Microbial resistance (ALABAMA) programme includes a randomised controlled trial of primary care patients who are randomised to a pre-emptive penicillin allergy assessment pathway (PAAP) or usual clinical care to assess the effect on health outcomes.</p>
              <p>Within this study, we addressed the current gap, by investigating the perspective of both patients and clinicians on PAT as part of the mixed-methods process evaluation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> of the ALABAMA feasibility trial. Our mixed-methods process evaluation included a clinician questionnaire, a patient questionnaire and interviews with clinicians and patients.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The ALABAMA feasibility trial involved 11 general practices based in the Leeds/Bradford area of England. The behavioural intervention package was designed to target both general practice clinicians responsible for the prescription of antibiotics and patients with a suspected incorrect penicillin allergy record, and was an integral part of the PAAP. The details on the process, methods and outcomes of the development of the behavioural package of the ALABAMA intervention has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The PAAP targets patients assessed as ‘low risk’ of having a true penicillin allergy, that is with no history of anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions. It also aimed to streamline the test process by undertaking patient history screening in general practice (stage 1) and introducing an efficient one-stop procedure at a hospital immunology clinic for PAT. The PAT included either an ST (stage 2) and oral challenge test (OCT) involving taking oral doses of a penicillin solution while supervised (stage 3), or proceeding directly to an OCT, depending on the individual patient history (the majority of patients). Following the PAT, patients and practices received confirmation of a patient’s allergy status by letter from the immunology clinic.</p>
              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Patients in the intervention arm (PAAP arm) received a booklet about allergy testing (pretest booklet), completed the two/three stages of PAAP (screening/patient history, skin test and/or OCT) and, if tested negative, received a booklet and a card giving information about their result. The pretest booklet informed patients about incorrect allergy records, how they may benefit from having a PAT and what was involved. The post-test booklet informed on the reliability of test results and consequences of a negative test result. A laminated card was provided stating the negative allergy result which could be shown to General Practicioners (GPs) and other prescribers.</p>
                <p>Clinicians’ booklet aimed to increase their motivation to refer patients to PAT and prescribe penicillin after a negative PAT result, together with a letter to inform them about the patient test results and how to change allergy records when the test result was negative. A computer pop-up alerting a GP to the change in the patient’s allergy status was built into the electronic patient record system (SystmOne, TPP).</p>

Clinicians were invited to take part in the survey by email at two time points; at the start of the feasibility trial and once all patient participants from a practice had been followed up for 4 months postrandomisation.

The patient survey included 13 items on a 7-point Likert scale, where 7 was strongly agree and 1, strongly disagree (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 2</xref>). Patients were asked about their beliefs concerning their penicillin allergy status, their views on possible reactions during a PAT, and their intentions to take penicillin in the future in the case of a negative test result.</p>
                  <p>The aim of the surveys was to compare participants’ knowledge and beliefs about penicillin allergy and PAT before and after the feasibility trial. Patients completed the questionnaire at two time points. Patients completed the belief questionnaire at baseline over the telephone with a member of the trial team. They completed the follow-up questionnaire 28–30 days postrandomisation over the telephone with a member of the trial team.</p>

                <p>Fifty-three clinicians responded to the survey (43 GPs, 9 nurse practitioners and 1 pharmacist), response rate of 52.2%. Results for each item are presented in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Clinicians gave positive responses to the majority of items. In general, they did not have previous experience of referring patients for a PAT, and were unsure whether patients would accept a prescription of penicillin after a negative PAT. Results suggested that GPs and nurses had slightly different beliefs. GPs were more likely than nurses to indicate that they would be happy to refer patients for a PAT, change allergy records and prescribe penicillin, following a negative test result. Nurses seemed less certain that a PAT would benefit their patients, more unsure about the safety of prescribing penicillin after a negative result, more unsure whether colleagues would support delabelling and less confident about discussing PAT results with patients.</p>

                <p>Seventy-nine patients participated in the feasibility study, of which 36 (46%) completed the baseline questionnaire. Nineteen patients were randomised to the intervention arm. Fifteen of these completed the PAT (2 positive, 13 negative). Ten of these patients completed the follow-up survey (all PAT negative). We checked whether survey responses from participants in the intervention and control arms were similar at baseline. As there were no significant differences, we then compared responses at baseline and follow-up for the 10 patients in intervention arm who answered both surveys. Five items indicated that participant beliefs had changed (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Clinicians highlighted that penicillin allergy is a ‘major problem’ in primary care resulting in fewer antibiotic options for patients and difficulty in prescribing, particularly for patients with multiple allergies and co-morbidities. They were aware that a number of allergy records may be incorrect but had limited access to allergy services. Hence, they saw the study as an opportunity to revoke erroneous labels which otherwise would not be possible.</p>

                      <p>I think it’s a huge problem.

                    <p>Clinicians felt that the training they received as part of the study allowed them to answer patients’ questions. Clinicians found the pretest booklet informative and some used it in their discussions with patients, to explain the study and potential benefits from the patients’ perspective:</p>

                      <p>Very well prepared actually, from the information provided and also with the information sheets that are given to patients […] I found that very helpful to look up and read beforehand, so the glossy leaflets about what to expect if you were going to the penicillin testing, so it was helpful to read through that so I could talk about that, from a patient’s perspective.

                    <p>Clinician’s confidence in the safety of testing meant that they also felt comfortable and confident in reassuring patients, if they asked about safety.

                    <p>The main motivation to take part in the study was to have a definite answer on whether they were allergic or not. Patients had varying knowledge about the benefits of penicillin; some were aware that it would be beneficial for them to have access to a wider range of antibiotics and described this as one motivation to get tested. Undergoing testing to help tackle antibiotic resistance was mentioned very rarely and likely prompted by the patient pretest booklet.

                      <p>After reading all the information and hearing that it’s one of the best antibiotics, then I just thought, ‘Well, if I can actually take it safely, then it’s probably a good thing to see if I can get tested or not, so I’ll take part.’ [P8, Negative allergy test]</p>

                    </disp-quote>
                    <p>Despite having this information before attending for the test, patients still appreciated having the process explained to them by nurses and clinicians in the hospital. Clear information presented in lay terms put patients at ease.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study provides an in-depth understanding of patients and primary care clinicians’ views of the key barriers and facilitators to referring to and attending PAT and prescribing/taking penicillin after a negative test. It also highlights the positive effects of the behavioural intervention for both patients and clinicians.</p>
              <p>Clinicians who took part in the study were motivated by having access to testing as they were convinced of the benefits of penicillin for their patients and their practice. In line with other studies, clinicians were often unsure about criteria for referral or what allergy testing involves,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> and reported little prior experience and only some knew what was involved in the test prior to the trial.</p>
              <p>Our survey results also suggested that nurses might be more tentative about referring patients and changing an allergy status on medical records. Studies with hospital nurses suggested that they could play a role in antibiotic stewardship activities, including accurate and detailed documentation of penicillin allergy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> However, more studies are needed to explore the views of this group of healthcare professionals and better define the multidisciplinary approach to delabelling.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p>
              <p>While the baseline survey showed that patients had positive beliefs about testing, including safety, these beliefs seemed to be strengthened after they had completed the PAAP. In line with other studies,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23–25</xref> qualitative interviews also highlighted the importance of safety of testing as patients valued having numerous opportunities to address their concerns about safety of the test, including conversations with their GP and later with hospital staff.</p>
              <p>Our study identified a number of important clinical implications. First, we note the importance of clinician training through provision of educational materials to ensure successful implementation of referral to PAT and subsequent penicillin prescribing in primary care. The information materials provided were useful to clinicians and increased their knowledge and confidence in referring people and having discussions with patients about PAT. Second, it also raises the importance of a clear plan in relation to the delabelling process, involving clear procedures for informing other colleagues about test results to facilitate penicillin prescribing in the future. Our study indicates that communication between staff member is crucial with dedicated roles being key. Third, while patients may have a number of concerns about safety of PAT,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 21 26</xref> these concerns can be successfully addressed and educational materials may be useful in increasing patients’ motivation; however, primary care clinicians need to be provided with appropriate resources and time to address these issues.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The study benefits from using both survey and interviews, providing complementary perspectives. Including qualitative studies is important in trial and implementation settings, where they are now recommended as part of the mixed-methods evaluations<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
                <p>However, the response rate, and the number of participants in both clinician and patient surveys was low (52.2%; N=26% and 46%; N=53, respectively), thus, the results may have to be interpreted with caution, especially as both patients and clinicians taking part in the survey are already motivated to take part in the trial. Our study would have also benefited from a follow-up survey with clinicians; this was not possible due to study delays. The study recruited from one region in England and includes small numbers due to issues with recruitment and testing availability; hence the results should be extrapolated with caution. Not all trial participants completed the survey, meaning that only views of participants who chose to complete the survey are represented. Both patients and clinician interview participants were a convenience sample recruited within a feasibility study, hence now allowing to capture perspectives of patients and clinicians who did not want to take part in the interviews, which means that these findings may have to be interpreted cautiously in terms of their transferability to other settings.</p>
