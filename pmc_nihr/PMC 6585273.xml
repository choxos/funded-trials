              <title>What did I do?</title>
              <p>I developed a novel home-based rehabilitation programme, including ‘<italic>The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual</italic>’, for patients with a first transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ‘minor’ stroke of atherosclerotic origin, using the core components of home-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and conducted a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="s2">
              <title>Why did I do it?</title>
              <p>CR is an effective form of secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease. CR after myocardial infarction results in reduced reinfarction risk and all-cause mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, despite sharing similar pathology with coronary heart disease and the 90-day risk of further vascular events after a TIA or ‘minor’ stroke being as high as 18%,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> the value of CR for patients with a TIA or ‘minor’ stroke is unclear.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="s3">
              <title>How did I do it?</title>
              <p>I followed the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing complex health service interventions. First, I conducted a systematic review (SR) of secondary prevention lifestyle interventions initiated within 90 days of a TIA or ‘minor’ stroke and then a SR on the use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) in home-based CR. I used the SRs’ findings to adapt a home-based CR manual and design an intervention that was refined following stakeholder input (TIA/minor stroke patients and carers; clinical academics and health professionals). Then, to assess the applicability of the intervention, I conducted a feasibility study. Patients, recruited from hospital clinics within 4 weeks of a first TIA or minor stroke, were randomly allocated to three groups<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>: (1) standard/usual care<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; (2) CR manual<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>; and (3) CR manual plus a pedometer. All groups received telephone follow-up 1 and 4 weeks postenrolment and were reviewed after 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>Following the feasibility study and further intervention refinement, I conducted a 12-week pilot study to test the study protocol before a definitive RCT. Participants, recruited from four different centres, &lt;4 weeks after their first TIA or ‘minor’ stroke, were randomly allocated to: (1) standard care (n=12); (2) CR manual, pedometer and general practitioner follow-up (n=14); and (3) CR manual, pedometer and stroke nurse follow-up (n=14). Follow-up was by telephone at 1, 4 and 9 weeks. Outcome measures were assessed after 12 weeks. Participants’ views on the intervention and research methods were explored using content analysis of poststudy focus group and interview data.</p>

            <sec id="s4">
              <title>What did I find?</title>
              <p>My first SR<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> identified four eligible studies. While individual studies reported increased aerobic capacity, meta-analysis found no significant change in any cardiovascular risk factors. Thus, evidence of the effectiveness of early post-TIA secondary prevention lifestyle interventions was limited. My second SR<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> included 11 studies of home-based CR with good methodological quality and identified the use of 20 different BCTs. The most frequently used were social support (unspecified) (11 studies) and goal setting (behaviour) (10 studies).</p>
              <p>In the feasibility study,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> 28 patients were invited to participate: 15 (10 men, 5 women; 9 TIA, 6 minor stroke; mean age 69 years) consented and completed all assessment measures except VO<sub>2max</sub> testing, which all declined. The intervention was welcomed, and pedometers were valued highly, particularly for goal setting.</p>
              <p>In the pilot study, 35.2% of eligible patients (44/125) consented to contact from a researcher; 90.9% of these (40/44) participated and 97.5% (39/40) completed the study. At 12-week review, cardiovascular risk factors in both intervention arms had improved. Qualitative data confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of the research methods and intervention.</p>

            <sec id="s5">
              <title>What is the most important clinical impact/practical application</title>
              <p>The study’s recruitment and retention rates, and the intervention’s acceptability and potential effects, indicate that an RCT of a novel home-based CR programme based on ‘<italic>The Healthy Brain Rehabilitation Manual</italic>’,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> implemented early after a first TIA/minor stroke, is feasible, with important impact on secondary prevention of stroke.</p>
