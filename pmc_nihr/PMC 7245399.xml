                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Diabetes affects more than 425 million people worldwide with a lifetime risk of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) of up to 25%. Management includes wound debridement, wound dressings, offloading, treatment of infection and ischaemia, optimising glycaemic control; use of advanced adjuvant therapies is limited by high cost and lack of robust evidence.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre, seamless phase II/III, open, parallel group, multi-arm multi-stage randomised controlled trial in patients with a hard-to-heal DFU, with blinded outcome assessment. A maximum of 447 participants will be randomised (245 participants in phase II and 202 participants in phase III). The phase II primary objective will determine the efficacy of treatment strategies including hydrosurgical debridement ± decellularised dermal allograft, or the combination with negative pressure wound therapy, as an adjunct to treatment as usual (TAU), compared with TAU alone, with patients randomised in a 1:1:1:2 allocation. The outcome is achieving at least 50% reduction in index ulcer area at 4 weeks post randomisation.</p>
                  <p>The phase III primary objective will determine whether one treatment strategy, continued from phase II, reduces time to healing of the index ulcer compared with TAU alone, with participants randomised in a 1:1 allocation. Secondary objectives will compare healing status of the index ulcer, infection rate, reulceration, quality of life, cost-effectiveness and incidence of adverse events over 52 weeks post randomisation. Phase II and phase III primary endpoint analysis will be conducted using a mixed-effects logistic regression model and Cox proportional hazards regression, respectively. A within-trial economic evaluation will be undertaken; the primary economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis presenting ICERs for each treatment strategy in rank order of effectiveness, with effects expressed as quality-adjusted life years.</p>
                  <p>The trial has predefined progression criteria for the selection of one treatment strategy into phase III based on efficacy, safety and costs at 4 weeks.</p>

              <p>Diabetes currently affects more than 425 million people worldwide,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and this is expected to increase to 629 million by 2045.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A total of 21%–30% of patients with diabetes develop peripheral neuropathy or lose sensation in their feet<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and extrapolation from incidence studies suggests that lifetime incidence of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) may be as high as 25%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> More than 50% of DFUs become infected, requiring hospitalisation, and 20% of infections result in amputation,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> contributing approximately 80% of non-traumatic amputations performed in the developed world.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>In the UK, diabetes affects 4.5 million people<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> with approximately 64 000 having a DFU at any one time.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In 2014–2015 National Health Service (NHS) England spent an estimated £1 billion on DFU treatment.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This does not take into account the costs imposed on the public sector and society as a whole through working days lost, reductions in tax revenue, increases in benefit payments and social care resources. Furthermore, DFUs have a major impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including impaired physical function, mental well-being and social interaction.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Management of DFUs comprises provision of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended best ‘treatment as usual’ (TAU) through multidisciplinary team (MDT) DFU clinics (podiatrists, diabetologists, vascular surgeons etc) and concomitant treatment strategies including: optimising glycaemic control, sharp non-surgical debridement, dressing application, off-loading, treatment of infection and ischaemia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There are a number of advanced/adjuvant therapies but their use is limited by high unit cost and an absence of robust evidence.</p>
              <p>Despite implementation of MDT care, a national audit of over 33 000 ulcers reports 48.3% remain unhealed at 12 weeks.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Of those patients with less than the median reduction in DFU area at 4 weeks (&lt;53% reduction), only 9% went onto heal at 12 weeks,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> while those in the top half for healing at 4 weeks (≥53% reduction) had a higher probability of healing of 58% at 12 weeks. Delayed healing increases the probability of adverse sequelae including infection and amputation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Drivers of the cost of care change with the need for hospitalisation: in a recent study community nurse visits accounted for 65% of total costs for healed and unhealed wounds managed in the outpatient setting, whereas 65% of costs in patients having amputation were incurred in secondary care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Thus implementation of adjuvant therapies, which are often more costly, is more likely to be cost-effective in those patients identified as ‘hard to heal’ (failing to decrease by &gt;50% at 4 weeks), whereas those DFUs reaching &gt;50% healing at 4 weeks are likely to heal without the need for more expensive interventions. Those DFUs reported as unhealed at 12 weeks in the 2019 UK National Diabetic Foot Audit<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> may have benefited from such therapies.</p>
              <p>Establishing efficacious adjuvant therapies for use in non-healing wounds is a priority for improving healing rates and HRQoL, and reducing the risk of morbidity and cost. There is a paucity of high-quality trials assessing adjuvant wound therapies in DFUs, and NICE guideline NG19 and others have highlighted the need for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and other adjuvant therapies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 16</xref> Technological advances in three adjuvant therapies mean they are now available for routine clinic use.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>NPWT is available in a small portable pump which doesn’t restrict patient movement.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>Sufficient surgical debridement which changes a chronic wound biology to an acute wound can now be undertaken using hydrosurgical debridement (HD) under local anaesthetic in clinic, enhancing patient experience and reducing costs by avoiding additional hospital visits for day-case surgery. This also allows wound bed preparation to a ‘graft ready state’ for advanced wound adjuncts, a state which cannot be achieved by less aggressive debridement with wound debridement pads such as Debrisoft. HD has been shown to be as effective as operating theatre surgical debridement in wound healing outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

                  <p>Decellularised dermal allograft (DCD) has been used in the USA for treatment of DFU, with improved healing compared with standard care<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> but cost has been prohibitive in the UK. A novel DCD, prepared from skin donated by voluntary UK deceased donors and recently been developed within the NHS, is approved by the Human Tissue Authority and is available for use in the UK. DCD is prepared and supplied by NHS Blood and Transplant (a Department of Health special health authority). However, the application of DCD requires surgical debridement to a ‘graft ready wound bed’ and it is not known whether the surgical debridement alone leads to improved healing in this setting.</p>

              </list>
              <p>Performing multiple RCTs to assess each intervention individually would be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, these therapies are often used in combination. The Multiple Interventions for Diabetic Foot Ulcer Treatment Trial (MIDFUT) uses an efficient, informative and ethical, adaptive, multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) design.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This involves early evaluation of combinations of the candidate interventions in a phase II/III design, stopping recruitment to treatment strategies which fail to demonstrate sufficient improvements in DFU healing, using an intermediate endpoint at 4 weeks post randomisation, and evaluating only one treatment strategy showing greatest efficacy in a phase III trial.</p>
              <p>The evidence for adjuvant therapies for DFU treatment was reviewed in NICE guideline NG19,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which concluded that the quality of trials was poor due to binary and early endpoints and small sample sizes. It recommended that future trials are sufficiently powered, with outcomes including time to healing, incidence and extent of amputation (major or minor), ulcer recurrence, HRQoL, adverse events (AEs), hospital admissions and length of stay. These findings were supported by a review by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>In summary, quality data on the outcome of adjuvant therapies for DFU is rare. A 30% increase in prevalence of disease is anticipated by 2035, which will add to the already substantial costs of treating DFUs, in a time of global fiscal uncertainty. With international guidance advocating the need for robust RCTs in this area,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and technical advancements in three adjuvant therapy options (HD, DCD and NPWT), an RCT to compare treatment strategies is timely.</p>

              <p>Three treatment strategies will be compared with TAU in phase II. Treatment strategies for which the estimated proportion of responders is less than 10% higher than the proportion of responders on TAU (absolute difference) will be dropped at the end of phase II (response defined as achieving at least 50% reduction in wound area of the index ulcer). One treatment strategy and TAU will be evaluated in phase III. If more than one treatment strategy shows a sufficient response in phase II, then the decision on which treatment strategy to evaluate in phase III will consider information on the safety profile and costs of the treatment strategies up to 4 weeks post randomisation.</p>
              <p>A maximum of 447 participants will be recruited, 245 participants in phase II and at most 202 participants in phase III. Recruitment at centres will continue without interruption between phase II and phase III.</p>

                <p>Due to the nature of the treatment strategies it is not possible to blind participants, the clinicians or research team to the treatment group allocation. However, primary outcome assessments will be conducted by an independent clinical assessor with no knowledge of treatment allocation. To mitigate risk of assessment bias the blinded assessor will also have no access to participant notes or trial case report forms. Blinding will be maintained when tracings and photographs at week 4, and confirmation of the index ulcer healing assessments, are returned to the CTRU (eg, through separate mail or independent clerical staff).</p>
                <p>For the phase II primary outcome and phase III exploratory objective, a blinded assessor at each site will complete an acetate tracing and take a two-dimensional digital photograph of the index ulcer at week 4. Measurements will be obtained from the index ulcer tracing using ‘Image J’ software<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> by a member of the CTRU team who is independent of the research teams at recruiting sites and blind to treatment allocation. A photograph of the index ulcer will be taken as a backup in the event that a tracing cannot be taken or is of insufficient quality to determine the index ulcer outline.</p>
                <p>For the phase III primary endpoint, all participants recruited to both phase II and III will also have a photograph taken of the reported healed index ulcer by the blinded assessor within 3 days of healing being reported and 2 weeks later as a confirmation of healing, which will undergo blinded central review.</p>
                <p>Photographs taken of healed and of unhealed index ulcers for randomly selected participants will be submitted for central blinded photography review by clinical members of the Trial Management Group who will not be aware of the participant’s identity, treatment group or time point at which the photograph was taken.</p>

Treatment of any other ulcers will continue as per the treating clinician’s decision.</p>
                <p>At baseline, randomisation and each follow-up visit all participants will receive TAU. At the randomisation treatment visit, the participant will be randomised to receive the treatment strategy specific to the arm of the trial for the index ulcer.

This will be in line with NICE guidelines<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and is likely to include attendance at the MDT DFU service clinic(s) at least fortnightly until healing is confirmed for wound assessment, sharp non-surgical debridement of callous/non-viable tissue, review of off-loading and to optimise diabetes and wound assessment as required, including community services visits, typically once to two times weekly. In line with NICE guidelines, use of removable below-knee walking device or removable cast walker will be encouraged. Wound dressing changes will be performed between clinic visits according to local policies.</p>

                  <p>HD, a one-off procedure on the day of randomisation, applies saline at high pressure via a pump through a hand piece. This has an operating window located at the instrument’s distal tip. During operation the flow of pressurised saline creates a local vacuum. As the operating window of the handset is passed over the tissue, non-viable material and debris are removed. The ulcer bed is debrided to healthy bleeding tissue which may require local anaesthetic.</p>

                  <p>NPWT, applied on the day of randomisation, consists of a foam dressing cut to shape and applied to the wound. An airtight seal is established with a film dressing; this is then connected to a pump which applies gentle suction to the wound. This allows the removal of fluid from the wound, which is collected in a canister attached to the pump, which is carried by the participant at all times in the bag provided. Alternatively, a self-contained system consisting of a disposable NPWT pump attached to an absorbent adhesive dressing may be used. The dressing is usually changed at least once a week, and the NPWT will be applied for 2 weeks post randomisation.</p>

                  <p>DCDs are prepared from split skin grafts obtained from deceased human tissue donors, which are processed and sterilised. Processing retains the normal skin structure, but removes donor cells and cell remnants meaning the graft is not rejected and functions as a permanent tissue replacement. On receipt at participating sites, the graft will be stored between 0°C and 40°C until the expiry date stated on the graft label. Prior to application the graft is soaked in a bowl of sterile saline solution for 15 min. The graft is then cut to size using sterile scissors and applied directly to the debrided wound bed, epidermal side upwards. Following application, the ulcer is covered with a non-adherent contact layer and a secondary bolster dressing or NPWT (as per randomisation). In those DFUs allocated to DCD, the wound bed is not debrided for 4 months post-treatment, unless clinically indicated, although debridement of wound edge and surrounding tissue can continue as per TAU.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The planned maximum sample size is 447 participants, 245 participants in phase II and 202 participants in phase III. The apportionment of participants to phase II and phase III was estimated using a series of simulation studies.</p>
                <p>In phase II, 49 participants per treatment strategy arm and 98 participants in the TAU arm will be recruited. The target effect size in phase II is an absolute increase of 25% in the proportion of participants achieving at least a 50% reduction in wound area by 4 weeks post randomisation, assuming 39% reach at least a 50% reduction by week 4 in the TAU arm (local audit data) and 64% achieve this outcome in the treatment strategy arms.</p>
                <p>An additional 101 participants will be recruited into each arm evaluated in phase III, corresponding to a total (phase II and III combined) of 150 in the remaining treatment strategy group and 199 in the TAU arm (total of 349 participants for evaluation in phase III).</p>
                <p>The minimum clinically important effect size in phase III is a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.5, assuming a median time to healing of 21 weeks for the TAU arm (local audit data) and 14 weeks for the treatment strategy arms<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 27–30</xref> and 18.0% and 7.6% <italic>un</italic>healed at 52 weeks in the TAU and treatment strategy groups, respectively (assuming exponential distribution for time to healing).</p>
                <p>Several scenarios for the power of the trial have been considered. In all cases a 10% loss to follow-up by 4 weeks and 25% loss to follow-up by 52 weeks is assumed. In the case where there is a single effective treatment strategy arm, the design has 83.9% power to recommend a truly effective treatment strategy (ie, for it to progress from phase II and for a significant result found at phase III). A treatment strategy group that progresses to phase III and which is significantly better than TAU at the two-sided 4% significance level (to control the familywise error rate at 5%) on the time to healing endpoint will be declared clinically effective.</p>
                <p>A formal sample size review will be conducted at 52 weeks, after 220 participants have been recruited, to re-estimate the proportion of participants lost to follow-up by 52 weeks post randomisation and the final sample size. The review will allow the overall loss to follow-up to be estimated to a minimum precision ±5.7% (corresponding to half width of the 95% CI), assuming a maximum loss to follow-up of 25%.</p>

The proposed secondary endpoints and methods for the economic evaluation follow the reference case set out by NICE.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The primary economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis presenting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each treatment strategy in rank order of effectiveness, with effects expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An NHS and Personal Social Services perspective for costs will be adopted. Costs and effects for each treatment strategy will be calculated for the trial follow-up period of 52 weeks.</p>
                <p>Health resource use questionnaires will collect information on NHS and personal social care use in line with NICE guidelines.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This will include primary, secondary and community resource use. Unit cost data will be obtained from national databases such as the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> and <italic>Personal Social Services Research Unit Costs of Health and Social Care</italic>.</p>
                <p>Treatment costs include the cost of delivering each strategy (mainly given by person-time of healthcare professionals) and the cost of the necessary equipment. The scope of resources considered includes the direct healthcare costs incurred for necessary patient care and excludes resources driven by the study protocol (eg, routine clinics will be included, while research visits that are just for checking for reulceration are excluded; also, the cost of photography and visit time for collecting data for study purposes will be excluded). To cost the treatment strategies, data on average duration of appointments for delivering the treatment strategy will be collected.</p>
                <p>ICERs, incremental net monetary benefit and incremental net health benefit statistics will be computed. NICE considers a cost per QALY within the range of £20 000–£30 000 to be acceptable.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>

Their input was central to study design, actively helping to shape discussions and decisions through written feedback and group discussion. In particular they informed decisions on how frequently patients should be reassessed at the study site; whether patients would be willing to report healing or other outcomes directly to the research team or through their community clinician; agreement to completion of questionnaires; wound tracing and photographs which may be considered a burden; how willing patients will be to take part in the study; the acceptability of each intervention.</p>

                <p>Since opening, the trial has undergone a trial redesign. The original design included a fourth treatment strategy in phase II corresponding to a combination of HD and NPWT as an adjunct to TAU, and also allowed a maximum of two treatment strategies to go forward into phase III under the same progression criteria. This original design required a maximum sample size of 660 participants, 324 participants recruited in phase II and 336 in phase III, under the sample size assumptions. Following a review of treatment strategies which would be considered in clinical practice if shown to be clinically effective and cost effective, a revised trial design dropped the combination of the HD and NPWT arm, which reduced the maximum sample size to 447 patients while still ensuring a trial of clinical relevance.</p>

                <title>Hard-to-heal ulcers</title>
                <p>A registration phase was also included in the original trial design. It is important that the trial includes a patient population with ‘hard-to-heal’ ulcers, reflecting the target population that would be considered for such adjuvant therapies in clinical practice. As there is variability in usual wound area assessment and documentation across recruiting centres, the registration phase included in the original design allowed a consistent approach to assessment of healing over a 4-week run-in period, and thereby considered ‘best practice’ for trials of DFU healing. However, the recently published LeucoPatch Trial,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> using an identical registration phase criterion of 50% healing at 4 weeks, reported only 22% healing in the control and 34% healing in the intervention arms, suggesting that this registration phase criteria is overly selective in the definition of ‘hard-to-heal’. Early audit of data from a single centre in MIDFUT showed that patients were not recruited to the trial at presentation to an MDT DFU clinic, and had been subjected to an ‘in house assessment period’ prior to registration in the trial. Seventy-five per cent of those failing the trial registration period due to ulcer healing of &gt;50% remained unhealed at 12 weeks, suggesting the trial was excluding a group of ulcers that were in fact ‘hard-to-heal’. The 2018 UK National Diabetic Foot Care Audit data of 21 000 ulcer episodes reports 49.3% remain unhealed at 12 weeks, with 27.3% unhealed 24 weeks and a further 2.9% recurring. Thus under half of ulcers unhealed at 12 weeks will heal in the subsequent 12 weeks, supporting a second inclusion criterion of ulcers that remain unhealed at a 12-week time point.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A parallel entry route was therefore introduced to allow patients with ulcers of ≥12 weeks duration, that are considered hard to heal by the treating MDT team, to proceed directly to randomisation.</p>
                <p>Following challenges in recruiting patients and the supporting evidence that a large proportion of patients with hard-to-heal ulcers were being missed, a decision was made to drop the registration phase for all patients. Instead, included ulcers will have failed to reduce in area by &gt;50% over at least 4 weeks as measured using local measurement techniques. This allows a more pragmatic approach to be taken in identifying patients with hard-to-heal ulcers by using local wound measurement policies, thereby minimising the risk of missing potentially eligible patients while ensuring the trial results are more generalisable to the target patient population.</p>
