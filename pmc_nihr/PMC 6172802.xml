                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents approximately 13% of deaths worldwide and is the leading cause of death in the UK with considerable associated health care costs. After a CHD event, timely cardiac rehabilitation optimises patient outcomes. However, a high percentage of these services do not meet necessary performance indicators such as course length and follow-up attendance. Uptake of such services is only 50% in UK patients and support provided 12 months after an event is often limited. To delay and prevent further CHD events leading to hospitalisation, supplementary self-management strategies such as group education, are necessary.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a single-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) recruiting participants (<italic>n</italic> = 290) aged ≥18 years who are 12 to 48 months post diagnosis of a CHD-related cardiac event (myocardial infarction, angina and any other acute coronary syndrome). The study aims to implement a structured education programme, with text-message support over 12 months, and identify whether delivery of the programme, to individuals who have a history of a cardiac event, would be an effective and cost-effective strategy for increasing walking. The primary outcome, objectively measured average daily physical activity, specifically step count through walking activity, is assessed using the wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometer at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes at 12 months include cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking status, blood pressure, lipid profile, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), obesity, self-efficacy, quality of life, physical activity and physical function.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Participants are randomised to either the control group receiving standard care and a physical activity information leaflet, or the intervention group whose partcipants receive the leaflet and are invited to attend two group-based structured education sessions. These encourage participants to adopt and maintain healthy behaviours and self-manage their lifestyle. They are delivered approximately 2 weeks apart by trained facilitators and reinforced via subsequent text-message support.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">To our knowledge, this is the first trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a group education programme 12 to 48 months after a CHD event diagnosis. If successful, the PACES programme could be translated into effective post-operative cardiac care and complement the current post-operative services available.</p>

              <p id="Par32">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number-one cause of death globally representing 31% of all global deaths, with coronary heart disease (CHD) representing approximately 13% of deaths worldwide (7.4 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CHD-related mortality in the UK accounts for one in six men and more than one in ten women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Health care costs are considerable with nearly £2 billion per year spent on the treatment of CHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Whilst UK mortality rates from CHD have been decreasing since the 1970s, they are still relatively high compared to other countries in Western Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">After a CHD event, the risk of further CHD events is greatly increased compared to the general population, unless there is intensive management of CHD risk factors including physical activity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Following a CHD event, as per the UK National Service Framework, patients are offered a structured education and exercise programme of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) typically at 4 weeks after an acute cardiac event, after which risk factor management is usually transferred to primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">The UK National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation Annual Statistical Report 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] has compared current national figures with CR delivery recommendations. The current European guidance suggests that such services should be 12 weeks in duration and delivered soon after the cardiac event in order to promote long-term self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Currently, the median duration of such programmes in the UK is 9 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At present only 50% of UK patients uptake CR multidisciplinary services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, even for those who have attended CR, support is limited thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. To delay and prevent further CHD events leading to hospitalisation and potentially death, supplementary strategies are necessary.</p>

                <title>Physical activity in the prevention of subsequent CHD events</title>
                <p id="Par35">Performing physical activity regularly is independently associated with a decrease in CHD risk, which elicits a positive dose-related response on cardiovascular risk factors and should be a predominant focus in both primary and secondary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Individuals with CHD benefit significantly from physical activity, with higher fitness levels predicting lower mortality rates and CHD-associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The large multi-centre NAVIGATOR trial demonstrated that subsequent risk of a cardiovascular event is inversely associated with both baseline levels and change in ambulatory activity in individuals at high CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Specifically, an increase or decrease in daily ambulatory activity of 2000 steps between baseline and 12 months was associated with an 8% higher or lower CVD event risk, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These data strongly support interventions that increase physical activity in high-CVD-risk patients.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Previous UK studies have shown benefits in a number of physical activity parameters through structured education and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Let’s Prevent, a large NIHR-funded randomised controlled trial (RCT), extensively evaluated the implementation of a structured education programme in people at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and showed improvements in step count and sedentary time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The MOTION study, which looked at effects of structured exercise in non-diabetic subjects 12–24 months after bariatric surgery, has shown benefits in improved physical activity, weight and functional performance; specifically, the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The ISWT is a valid field test of fitness in patients undergoing conventional CR. Following cardiac rehabilitation 62% of patients achieve the minimum clinical difference of &gt; 70 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">After completing CR, patients are encouraged to self-manage their condition and to pursue a healthy lifestyle. Patients’ long-term management plan should be a collaboration between the patient and primary and secondary care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The National Service Framework for CHD (2000) states that 1 year after cardiac rehabilitation, at least 50% of patients should be undertaking 30 min of moderate physical activity at least five times a week, maintaining a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and not smoking. UK National Audit figures for 2011–2012 showed that 12 months after cardiac rehabilitation there was a 14% increase in exercise levels, a 1% reduction in BMI in patients with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a reduction in smoking of 4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Physical inactivity accounts for 76% of England’s cardiac rehabilitation population upon referral to cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and there is a 30% increase in individuals meeting the physical activity guidelines of 150 min per week after completing cardiac rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is well noted that timely cardiac rehabilitation optimises patient outcomes; however, patient support is limited after discharge back to primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>

                <title>Lifestyle education and remote text-message support</title>
                <p id="Par38">Research suggests that inadequate support is available after the initial 12-month period post cardiac event, with half of patients not taking up post-operative support offered. Regular face-to-face contact with health care professionals is expensive and time-consuming and cost-effective strategies to deliver interventions are urgently required in the UK. The delivery approach of behaviour change and self-management education for chronic diseases, such as CHD, should be directly relevant to primary care pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is recognised that structured education is a method of promoting self-management in clinical populations, specifically those with CHD, and that ambulatory physical activity positively affects future cardiovascular event risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par39">With the advent of increasingly sophisticated mobile phone technology, text messaging has been used to deliver health education messages which reinforce and promote behavioural change. Whilst some studies suggest that text-message reminders of health education and medication are not beneficial in terms of self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], others have demonstrated that it can be used effectively to reduce CHD risk; for example, by preventing type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], increasing levels of leisure-time physical activity and walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], or adherence to antiplatelet therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A recent mixed-methods observational cohort study of automated text messaging and remote nursing as part of mobile phone diabetes programmes demonstrated improvements in the taking of medications, healthy eating, foot care, exercise, and glucose monitoring as well as self-efficacy, social support, and health belief measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this study, behavioural theory was used to inform, identify and evaluate efficacy of the mobile phone intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par40">It is apparent, given the above factors, that more support 1 year after a cardiac event is needed to complement current services. There is a need to develop and evaluate a structured education programme focusing on lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, for individuals who have a history of a cardiac event.</p>

The Physical Activity after Cardiac EventS (PACES) education programme has been designed according to the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions in health behaviour change programmes, along with Michie et al<italic>.</italic> and the NICE guidelines, to inform behaviour-change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The main goal of the PACES programme is to increase physical activity; specifically, walking activity.

The trial is sponsored by the University of Leicester and approval was granted by the West Midlands – Solihull Research Research Ethics Committee and the UK Health Research Authority.

                <title>Participant invitation and recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par46">Participants are identified 12–48 months after a CHD cardiac event diagnosis from the University Hospitals of Leicester cardiology department and phase 4 community-based cardiac rehabilitation providers. Phase 4 cardiac rehabilitation typically refers to community-based cardiac rehabilitation, which provides people with known coronary heart diseases (myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention and stable angina), the possibility to benefit from weekly supervised exercise sessions. People who are eligible for phase 4 cardiac rehabilitation include those who have participated in a 6–12-week cardiac rehabilitation programme. Phase 4 is often referred to as a maintenance programme and is only available to those who meet certain medical criteria and have been assessed by their general practitioner (GP).</p>
                <p id="Par47">Potential participants identified as living in Leicestershire and within the post-CHD event diagnosis window (12–48 months) are invited to participate by postal invitation. The postal invitation includes an invitation letter and a short version of the participant information leaflet. A follow-up telephone call is made to non-responders to check that they have received the invitation and ask if they have any questions relating to the PACES study and its procedures. All positive responders to the postal invitation receive telephone screening related to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and are provided with an opportunity to ask questions related to the study. All potential participants who pass the telephone screening phase are invited to visit 1 to ensure that they meet the practical elements of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If deemed able and eligible to participate, written informed consent is obtained after which baseline assessment measurements are carried out (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and randomisation takes place. Ahead of visit 1, the potential participant receives an appointment confirmation letter and the PACES full participant information leaflet.

This is to prevent contamination between people living in the same household but randomised to different arms. The randomisation schedule and list was developed by an independent statistician and allocation of randomisation is carried out by a researcher independent of the team. Participants are informed of their randomisation allocation once visit 1 is completed, ahead of their 6 and 12 months’ follow-ups. As the intervention is a group education programme the participants cannot be blinded to the randomisation. The research nurses collecting the follow-up data are not informed of the randomisation of the participant but it is possible that the information is passed onto them by the participant.</p>

                  <p id="Par69">Development of the intervention followed an iterative pathway comprising various stages of designing, testing and refining the education programme through the use of informant groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The theoretical underpinnings employed and processes used to inform the behaviour-change techniques in the programme include those recommended by Michie et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the NICE 2014 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the behaviour-change taxonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The COM-B system has been employed as an overarching model for understanding the factors underlying behaviour and behavioural change; namely, capability, motivation and opportunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the programme have a rationale and an aim.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">The importance of tailoring interventions to meet the needs of the targeted clinical population has been recognised. All development stages, therefore, comprised of extensive patient and public involvement (PPI) work with health care professionals based in primary care and cardiac rehabilitation and with cardiac patients. Both groups worked closely with the development team to create a bespoke group-based education programme. The education sessions are 2.5 h in duration and delivered by two trained facilitators approximately 2 weeks apart. Sessions are delivered in a facilitative style that encourages participation with the use of reflective questioning and problem-solving activities to promote engagement and build self-efficacy. The PACES programme content is underpinned by an integrated theoretical framework encouraging the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviours and lifestyle; specifically, increasing physical activity levels through daily walking activity, along with diet.

The participants receive 82 physical-activity-related text messages at different weekly frequencies following the second education session until the 12-month follow-up assessment. The text messages are non-interactive and are designed to be motivational in nature. The text-message support used is a validated package of messages designed and shown to be effective in the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The current study is a pragmatic trial, and the target is to attend the education within 2 months of recruitment. However, this will not always be possible.

All facilitators were provided with a curriculum and resource pack to support a successful delivery and give them the opportunity to plan ahead of each session. The facilitators then delivered a ‘have a go session’ before the study started to enable them to practise delivery to a volunteer cardiac patient group. These practice sessions were observed by a member of the training team and feedback and further training were provided to the facilitators as necessary. Continued peer support is provided to the facilitators and self-reflection and peer reflection after every session is encouraged.</p>

                <p id="Par82">All clinical visits are run by trained individuals, predominantly research nurses and health care assistants from the University Hospitals of Leicester. All research staff have been trained in the study procedures and follow standard operating procedures (SOPs) when doing so. Written informed consent is obtained by a trained research nurse before any trial activities take place. Outcome data are collected at three time points – baseline, 6 months (postal) and 12 months (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Participants and their GPs are sent a letter with details of selected clinical results after the baseline and 12-month clinic visits.</p>

                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par84">The primary outcome measure is change in objectively measured ambulatory activity from baseline to 12 months using the GENEActiv wrist-worn, tri-axial accelerometer (GENEActiv model 1.1, ActivInsights Ltd., Kimbolton, UK) with a dynamic range of ± 8 g, where g is equal to the earth’s gravitational pull. Increasing physical activity is an important behaviour to adopt after a cardiac event illustrating why objective ambulatory activity has been selected as the primary outcome. Participants are asked to wear the GENEActiv accelerometer on their non-dominant wrist for eight consecutive days (24 h) (wearing the monitor from the date of the assessment visit or from a specified date when sent in the 6-month postal follow-up). The accelerometer is configured to collect data at 100 Hz and records total physical activity, which includes light, moderate, vigorous and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behaviour and sleep in milli-gravitational units (mg). Participants are also asked to complete a log whilst wearing the monitor to provide their waking hours and wear-time information. An appropriately trained individual instructs the participant on correct placement of the monitor using the SOPs. Participants are given a stamped addressed envelope to return the monitor once completed. Upon return the data are downloaded to a computer using the software supplied by the manufacturer and are then ready for analysis. The accelerometers are processed by staff blinded to the intervention group allocation.</p>

The test has a total of 12 levels lasting 1 min each (total distance 1020 m). Participants perform a practice ISWT to minimise the influence of learning effects and are then asked to walk for as long as possible until reaching test termination criteria whilst the assessor records the total number of shuttles performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The participant remains in the clinical area for at least 15 min following the test where measures of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rating of perceived exertion (RPE Borg Scale) and breathlessness (the modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale) are taken. The participant must achieve level 3 or above on the ISWT (120 m), and, if they are not able to achieve this, they are excluded from the study and directed back into cardiac rehabilitation (a letter is sent to the cardiac rehabilitation team suggesting referral; their GP is sent a copy of this letter) as a process of good practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This test is conducted by a basic life support (BLS)- or immediate life support (ILS)-trained member of the study team, experienced in conducting the ISWT. If the ISWT is being conducted by a BLS-trained individual, an ILS-trained member of staff is also available within the PACES clinic.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par104">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to deliver a lifestyle intervention combined with follow-up text-message support in this population 12–48 months after diagnosis of a CHD cardiac event. It is well noted that lifestyle education and intensive risk factor management is needed after a CHD event to minimise the increased risk of future events occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Given that a high percentage of cardiac rehabilitation services are currently failing to meet important service performance indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], a cost-effective method of support is needed to tie in with the current services provided. The PACES education programme combined with follow-up text-message support is low cost in application, designed to complement the current post-operative services available and could be easily translated into post-operative cardiac care should the intervention be successful.</p>
              <p id="Par105">As reported in the National Audit of Cardiac Rehabilitation Annual Statistical Report 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the current dominant profile of individuals attending cardiac rehabilitation in the UK is male, White British, married and retired. The reason for non-completion of cardiac rehabilitation is still unclear, thus making it challenging to design an education programme which targets and overcomes specific barriers. In order to address this the development of the PACES programme encompassed a large element of PPI work, targeting as wide a population as possible and appealing to both those who did and did not take part in cardiac rehabilitation. This development process ensured that the programme provides added value to current cardiac care provision.</p>
              <p id="Par106">Structured education programmes underpinned by theory and delivered using a curriculum have been recognised by NICE and shown to be successful in the prevention and management of other long-term conditions such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (DAFNE; Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DESMOND; Diabetes Education and Self-Management in On-going and Newly Diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and XPERT diabetes education courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). The PACES structured education programme has been designed according to the Medical Research Council guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions in health-behaviour-change programmes whilst being established and refined in conjunction with extensive PPI work and through the use of existing infrastructure to meet the needs of patients in Leicestershire 12 to 48 months after a cardiac event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. A well-established training and monitoring plan has also been developed to support the PACES facilitators. This is to ensure that the PACES programme can be easily disseminated to the necessary health care professionals likely to deliver this programme to ensure the quality of delivery and ultimately consistency amongst facilitators.</p>
              <p id="Par107">The importance of managing CHD and preventing secondary events in at-risk individuals is recommended in national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently, patients’ long-term management plans should be a collaboration between the patient and primary and secondary care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], where structured physical activity, BMI and smoking are main focal points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is also recognised that timely cardiac rehabilitation optimises patient outcomes and support thereafter is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is, therefore, important to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of lifestyle education focussing on self-managing CHD risk factors in secondary prevention. The current study will provide us with additional information to inform this research area.</p>
