                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The Prevention of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy–2 (PROMISE-2) study was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Adults with CM were randomly assigned to receive IV eptinezumab 100 mg, eptinezumab 300 mg, or placebo administered on day 0 and week 12. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) over weeks 1 to 12.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Among treated participants (n = 1,072), baseline mean number of MMDs was ≈16.1 across groups. Treatment with eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was associated with significant reductions in MMDs across weeks 1 to 12 compared with placebo (placebo −5.6, 100 mg −7.7, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 vs placebo; 300 mg −8.2, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 vs placebo). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 43.5% (100 mg), 52.0% (300 mg), and 46.7% (placebo) of patients. Nasopharyngitis was the only TEAE reported for &gt;2% of eptinezumab-treated patients at an incidence of &gt;2% over placebo; it occurred in the 300 mg eptinezumab arm (eptinezumab 9.4%, placebo 6.0%).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>In patients with CM, eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was associated with a significant reduction in MMDs from the day after IV administration through week 12, was well tolerated, and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Migraine is a common, disabling neurologic disorder<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>; its most burdensome form is chronic migraine (CM), clinically defined by the presence of headache on ≥15 d/mo for ≥3 months, with ≥8 d/mo of headaches linked to migraine.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Relative to episodic migraine, CM is associated with significantly greater disability, higher rates of comorbidity, and increased direct and indirect costs.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Reducing the burden of CM is an important goal of preventive treatment, although randomized trials in CM are a recent phenomenon.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Currently, onabotulinumtoxinA and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)‒targeted monoclonal antibodies are the only agents approved for the prevention of CM. In the United States, diagnosis and treatment rates for CM are low, and migraine preventive treatment is frequently discontinued prematurely.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
            <p>The Prevention of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy (PROMISE) phase 3 studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of repeat IV administration of the monoclonal antibody eptinezumab (ALD403) for migraine prevention in patients with episodic migraine (PROMISE-1) and CM (PROMISE-2). Eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the CGRP ligand.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Blockade of the CGRP pathway is an established method in the acute and preventive treatment of migraine.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This report presents the primary results of the PROMISE-2 study.</p>

                <title>Study design and patients</title>
                <p>This phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety study was performed at 128 sites in 13 countries (United States, Spain, Ukraine, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Republic of Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia, Germany, Czech Republic, Denmark, and Belgium) during the period of November 30, 2016, to April 20, 2018.</p>
                <p>Adults 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of migraine at or before 50 years of age were eligible for participation if they had a history of CM for ≥12 months before screening, completed the headache electronic diary (eDiary) on ≥24 of the 28 days after screening visit and before randomization (the screening period), and experienced ≥15 to ≤26 headache days and ≥8 migraine days during the 28-day screening period.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Patients taking prescription or over-the-counter medication for acute or preventive treatment of migraine were eligible only if the medications had been prescribed or recommended by a health care professional; migraine preventive medication use had to be stable for ≥3 months before screening. Hormonal therapy (e.g., contraceptive, hormone replacement) was also permitted if it was stable and ongoing ≥3 months before screening. Patients using barbiturates or prescription opioids ≤4 d/mo were eligible for participation if use was stable for ≥2 months before screening, and this restriction was maintained through week 24 of the study. Other medications for the treatment of acute migraine such as triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and simple analgesics were not restricted. Patients with CM and medication-overuse headache with the exception of the overuse of barbiturates or opioids were eligible for inclusion. The study steering committee wished to include patients using opioids and barbiturates because more than one-third of people in the United States who have migraine use these medications as acute prescription treatments. The study steering committee chose to limit opioid and barbiturate use because high use often makes the patient refractory to preventive treatments.

                <title>Study procedures</title>
                <p>Patients used an eDiary to document headaches and migraines for 4 weeks after the screening visit to confirm eligibility criteria and to establish baseline values. Eligible patients were then randomly assigned to receive eptinezumab 100 mg, eptinezumab 300 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was stratified by the number of migraine days recorded during the screening period (≤17 vs &gt;17 days) and preventive medication use during the 3 months before screening (use vs no use). The total duration of the study was 32 weeks, with 10 scheduled visits (screening, day 0, and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32). After the last patient completed the week 12 visit, the analysis of the primary endpoint was performed.</p>
                <p>Patients received up to 2 treatments of eptinezumab or placebo (administered IV on day 0 and at week 12). Assignment was concealed. Investigational product (either eptinezumab 100 mg or placebo) was shipped frozen on dry ice as a single-use, preservative-free solution in a tamper-proof 2-mL type I glass vial. Each individual vial was labeled with protocol-specific information to meet International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use and country-specific requirements. On randomization, study sites were provided with enough appropriate investigational product for 1 patient to be dosed, with subsequent treatment packs shipped automatically before the next scheduled treatment visit. Investigational treatments were reconstituted in a total volume of 100 mL 0.9% saline and administered over a period of 30 minutes (plus an additional 15 minutes, per protocol, if required) by the blinded investigator. Patients were monitored for ≥2 hours after treatment. All research participants, clinicians, and research personnel were blinded and remained blinded throughout the duration of the clinical trial.</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p>Patients completed a daily eDiary from the time of screening through week 24; this included a daily evening report (completed regardless of whether the patient had a headache) and a headache report, which was event based (i.e., per headache). In addition to capturing headache episodes and migraine attacks, the daily eDiary captured acute medication use (including type). A migraine day was defined using information from the eDiary and followed the definition of a CM outlined in ICHD-3. Specifically, a migraine day had to meet 3 criteria: (1): lasted ≥4 hours or lasted 30 minutes to 4 hours and believed by the patient to be a migraine that was relieved by acute medication; (2) had ≥2 of the following: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity; and (3) had ≥1 of the following: nausea and/or vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia.</p>
                <p>Monthly results (e.g., monthly migraine days [MMDs]) were based on the results of the 4-week intervals. If the headache diary was completed for ≥21 days of a 4-week interval, the observed frequency was normalized to 28 days. If the diary was completed for &lt;21 days of a 4-week interval, the results were a weighted function of the observed data for the current interval and the results from the previous interval, with the weight proportional to how many days the diary had been completed.</p>
                <p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in MMDs over weeks 1 to 12, assessed with eDiary data. eDiary data also were used for evaluating several of the key secondary efficacy endpoints: ≥75% migraine responder rate over weeks 1 to 4, ≥75% migraine responder rate over weeks 1 to 12, ≥50% migraine responder rate over weeks 1 to 12, percentage of patients with a migraine on the day after dosing, change from baseline in daily migraine prevalence from baseline to week 4, and acute migraine medication use during weeks 1 to 12.</p>
                <p>During the scheduled visits, patients completed several patient-reported outcome measures, including the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (version 2.0), the EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-Levels, and the Patient Global Impression of Change. The Most Bothersome Symptom was evaluated as a tertiary endpoint and is not reported here.</p>
                <p>The HIT-6<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> version 1.0, an α control endpoint in this study for the 300 mg treatment group, was administered at screening, day 0, and at week 4, 12, 16, 24, and 32 visits to measure the impact of headaches on the ability to function normally in daily life. Patients rated the HIT-6 items using a Likert-type scale anchored by “never” and “always” and including the following response scores: never = 6, rarely = 8, sometimes = 10, very often = 11, and always = 13. Response scores were summed to produce a total score. Scores ≥60 were indicative of severe life impact, 56 to 59 of substantial life impact, 50 to 55 of some life impact, and ≤49 of little to no life impact.</p>
                <p>Safety was assessed throughout the study via adverse event (AE) monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and concomitant medication use. AEs of special interest also were monitored and included AEs associated with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale score, cardiovascular AEs, hepatic AEs, and those associated with study drug administration, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis AEs.</p>
                <p>Blood samples for immunogenicity analyses were collected on day 0 and at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 32, including monitoring development of anti-eptinezumab antibodies and assaying for neutralizing potential.</p>

                <p>A total of 350 patients per group provided at least 90% power for the primary endpoint for each comparison, assuming a treatment effect of ≥1 day and a common SD of ≤4 days. These sample size calculations were performed with PASS 2008<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and were based on a <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test that approximated the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) used for the primary endpoint.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
                <p>All patients who received study medication were included in the safety and efficacy populations. For the safety analyses, patient results were summarized within the group representing the treatment they received; if they received 2 different doses, they were summarized in the treatment arm of the highest dose received. For the efficacy population, patients' results were summarized within the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned.</p>
                <p>A serial procedure was used to account for multiplicity associated with &gt;1 dose level and for multiple endpoints (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Statistical testing was conducted to maintain a study-wide 2-sided 5% α level. The procedure first evaluated the 300 mg vs placebo comparison for the primary endpoint. If this was significant, testing continued to the first subset of key secondary endpoints for 300 mg. If a significant difference was detected for all tests within this series, the procedure then moved on to the second subset of key secondary endpoints for 300 mg. The procedure then moved on to the 100 mg group for the primary endpoint and subsequently the key secondary endpoint groups for 100 mg. If these endpoints were significant, the procedure moved to the final key secondary endpoints for 300 mg. Within each endpoint group, the Holm procedure<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> was used.</p>

                <p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in MMDs (weeks 1–12) in an ANCOVA model. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥75% migraine responder rates during weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12, ≥50% migraine responder rates during weeks 1 to 12, percentage of patients with a migraine on the day after dosing, reduction in average daily percentage of patients with migraine from baseline to week 4, change in HIT-6 total score from baseline to week 12 (300 mg dose only), and acute migraine medication use from baseline to week 12 (300 mg dose only). A ≥50% or ≥75% migraine responder was defined as a patient who achieved ≥50% reduction or ≥75% reduction in MMDs from baseline, respectively. These reductions were evaluated by comparing the baseline frequency of migraine days to the migraine frequency in 4-week intervals. Results from these 4-week intervals will be combined to produce 12-week responder endpoints. The week 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 12 changes from baseline measures were averaged, and the average value was compared to baseline. A percent change from baseline was determined, which was used to determine the responder status.</p>
                <p>For the key secondary endpoints (migraine responder rates and percentage of patients with a migraine on the day after dosing), testing was based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel/extended Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. The tests were stratified by the randomization stratification factor. For the HIT-6 and Acute Migraine Medication endpoints, an ANCOVA model similar to the one used for the primary endpoint was used for testing. Exploratory and safety endpoints were summarized with descriptive statistics. All analyses were conducted with SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) version 9.2 or higher.

                  <p>A total of 122 patients (11.4%) had ≥1 TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: 93 patients (13.2%) in the eptinezumab groups and 29 patients (7.9%) in the placebo group. The most frequently reported study drug-related TEAEs were fatigue (eptinezumab n = 13 [1.8%], placebo n = 3 [&lt;1%]) and nausea (eptinezumab n = 11 [1.6%], placebo n = 1 [&lt;1%]). The remaining study drug-related TEAEs occurred in &lt;1% of patients.</p>
                  <p>No deaths were reported in this study. A total of 10 patients (&lt;1%) experienced a serious TEAE (7 patients who received eptinezumab and 3 who received placebo). The most frequently reported serious TEAEs were in the system organ class of nervous system disorders (eptinezumab n = 4 [&lt;1%], placebo n = 1 [&lt;1%]); injury, poisoning, and procedural complications (eptinezumab n = 2 [&lt;1%], placebo n = 0); and psychiatric disorders (eptinezumab n = 2 [&lt;1%], placebo n = 0). One serious AE (SAE) was assessed as related to the study drug by both the investigator and the sponsor. This was a single episode of worsening migrainous visual phenomena in a patient with a medical history of migraine with visual aura, considered part of the disease under study, which occurred 126 days after the second dose of eptinezumab 300 mg and lasted 4 days. No patients had life-threatening SAEs.</p>
                  <p>A total of 13 patients (1.2%) experienced a TEAE that led to study drug withdrawal: 3 (&lt;1%) in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, 8 (2.3%) in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, and 2 (&lt;1%) in the placebo group. A total of 6 patients (1.7%) who received eptinezumab 300 mg had the study drug withdrawn due to hypersensitivity. Three of these events occurred after the first dose and 3 after the second dose. All were mild to moderate in severity, were considered related to the study drug, and occurred on the treatment day. Five of the 6 events resolved on the same day as onset (1 resolved within 2 days). The occurrence of individual symptoms or symptom constellations coded as the preferred term of hypersensitivity was based on the sponsor's established framework for evaluating treatment day events. The clinical presentation of these events was most commonly reported as nonspecific allergy-type reactions. Hypersensitivity symptoms (i.e., immunoglobulin E mediated) such as hives, angioedema, and documented respiratory manifestations were rare.</p>
                  <p>One patient who received eptinezumab 300 mg experienced an SAE of seizure that required hospitalization and led to study drug withdrawal. This SAE was assessed by the investigator as not related to the study drug and resolved on the same day as the hospitalization. All TEAEs of special interest occurred in &lt;1% of the total eptinezumab and placebo groups.</p>

                  <title>Anti-drug antibodies</title>
                  <p>The incidence of anti-eptinezumab antibodies was maximal at 24 weeks (eptinezumab 100 mg 56 of 326 patients, eptinezumab 300 mg 56 of 329 patients) and then declined despite continuation of dosing (week 32: eptinezumab 100 mg 37 of 325, eptinezumab 300 mg 29 of 321 patients). There was no clear dose-response trend in the number of patients with anti-drug antibody (ADA)‒positive results. Among ADA-positive patients, 26 in the eptinezumab 100 mg group and 19 in the eptinezumab 300 mg group had ADAs with neutralizing potential (NAbs). The incidence of NAbs generally increased over time from week 2 to 24 (except at week 4). Of the 112 ADA-positive patients at week 24, NAb-positive status was reported in 24 patients (21.4%). Formation of ADAs with or without neutralizing potential did not affect efficacy (change in MMDs over weeks 1–12 for ADA-positive vs ADA-negative patients: eptinezumab 100 mg −6.1 vs −8.1, eptinezumab 300 mg −9.3 vs −8.1, respectively). Similarly, the results showed no evidence of an impact from the development of ADA, including NAbs, on the safety profile of eptinezumab.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PROMISE-2 demonstrated that both the 100 and 300 mg doses of eptinezumab resulted in significant reductions in the primary endpoint, MMDs, over weeks 1 to 12 after the first IV administration. The ≥75% and ≥50% migraine responder rates for the eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg dose groups were greater than for placebo. These findings are consistent with previous results from the phase 2 study of CM.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The preventive effects of eptinezumab in patients with CM were demonstrated on the first day after administration. During the baseline run-in phase, patients experienced a migraine headache on 57.5% of days. On day 1 after administration, 42.3% of placebo-treated patients reported having a migraine headache compared with 28.6% of patients treated with eptinezumab 100 mg and 27.8% of patients treated with eptinezumab 300 mg. This &gt;50% reduction in migraine the day after dosing is statistically significant. The reduction in migraine that occurred on day 1 was maintained throughout the study. Over weeks 1 to 4, migraine occurred in 30.6% in the eptinezumab 100 mg group, 27.9% in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, and 38.9% in the placebo group.</p>
              <p>Speed of onset of preventive benefit is viewed by patients as desirable, second only to effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Current oral preventive therapies usually require dose titration and develop benefits over weeks to months.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Early onset of effect with eptinezumab may translate into meaningful benefits for patients with CM, allowing them to get back to work, school, household, and family obligations sooner than with previously available options.</p>
              <p>Treatment with either dose of eptinezumab was associated with reductions in days of acute medication use. Reduction in acute medication use is an important benefit because overuse of acute medication is associated with headache exacerbation, side effects, and cost.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Reduction in acute medication use has been identified as a positive factor influencing patient acceptance of preventive therapy.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Eptinezumab was well tolerated in this study. The percentages of patients with any TEAEs were similar across the active and placebo groups; most events were mild or moderate in severity, and no deaths were reported. Eptinezumab was similarly well tolerated in previous clinical study reports.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The immune response to eptinezumab was characterized by positive ADA results at every time point through week 32 (peak at week 24), with no clear dose-response trend in the number of patients with ADA. The data show a remarkably consistent treatment response to both the 100 and 300 mg doses of eptinezumab, with no impacts on the safety or efficacy profiles of the drug.</p>
              <p>PROMISE-2 was designed for consistency with guidelines recently (2018) updated by the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Standing Committee.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It should be noted that individuals with a history or evidence of significant cardiovascular disease or any clinically significant concurrent medical condition were excluded from participation; thus, the findings may not be indicative of safety and efficacy in patients with excluded comorbid conditions.</p>
              <p>The overall response to placebo was high in this trial. High placebo rates may be attributed to a number of factors, including the novelty of treatment, route of administration, number of active treatment arms increasing patient expectations, and number of patients previously naive to preventive therapy.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">–</xref><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The intensive amount of patient contact with migraine care experts throughout the trial also may have contributed to the higher-than-expected placebo response, including professionally supervised IV administration and frequent follow-up contact via telephone and in-person visits. Despite the high placebo rates, statistical significance was achieved for eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg for the primary and all secondary endpoints.</p>
              <p>The results of this study demonstrate that IV eptinezumab (100 and 300 mg) is associated with a clinically meaningful migraine preventive effect over multiple efficacy measures, is well tolerated, and has an acceptable safety profile in adult patients with CM. The migraine preventive effect of eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was observed as early as day 1 after administration, with &gt;50% of patients reporting a significant decrease in migraine incidence compared to baseline levels. Furthermore, during the first month after the initial administration, more than one-third of patients in the eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg groups experienced a ≥75% reduction in migraine days. Similar meaningful results were reported for clinical and patient-reported outcomes as early as month 1. The migraine preventive effect of eptinezumab 100 and 300 mg was maintained throughout the full 12-week dosing interval, with patients who received a single dose of eptinezumab experiencing significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean migraine days during weeks 1 to 12 relative to those receiving placebo.</p>
