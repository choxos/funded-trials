                  <p>Anaemia is highly prevalent in people with advanced, palliative cancer yet
sufficiently effective and safe treatments are lacking. Oral iron is poorly
tolerated, and blood transfusion offers only transient benefits. Intravenous

people with advanced, palliative cancer lacks evidence.</p>

                  <title>Design:</title>
                  <p>A multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of
intravenous iron (ferric derisomaltose, Monofer<sup>®</sup>). Outcomes
included trial feasibility, change in blood indices, and change in quality

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Anaemia affects over 70% of people with advanced cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Symptoms include fatigue,
breathlessness and reduced physical activity, which impact negatively on quality of
life.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
In the palliative care setting treatments for this anaemia should focus on
alleviating these debilitating symptoms. However, sufficiently effective, and safe
treatments are lacking. Blood transfusions are a finite and costly resource and
carry a risk of significant harm to recipients. They may only offer a temporary
benefit, with improvements in fatigue lasting less than 2 weeks for most
people.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
There is controversy regarding the use of erythropoietin in this setting. For people
not receiving concurrent chemotherapy erythropoietin may be associated with an
increased mortality risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, in people receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy
this association has more recently been refuted.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Oral iron has been a popular treatment, but nausea and gastric irritation are
common,<sup><xref rid="bibr7-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> resulting in non-adherence rates of up to 40% among
recipients.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Importantly, efficacy is impeaded by a relatively poor oral
bio-availability (about 16%–21%)<sup><xref rid="bibr9-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> that is reduced to potentially
negligible levels in people with cancer due to the inflammatory upregulation of
hepcidin, the key determinant of the availability of absorbed iron.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

tumours not amenable to curative treatment were recruited. Participant inclusion
criteria included anaemia according to the WHO definition (haemoglobin
&lt;130 g/L men and &lt;120 g/L women), a fatigue score ⩾4 out of 10 on a linear
scale (0 no fatigue, 10 worst fatigue imaginable) and an ECOG performance status
⩽2. People with a haematological malignancy, those who had received intravenous
iron in the preceding 3 months, an allogenic blood transfusion in the last
2 weeks, or those with signs of active bleeding were excluded. Those who had
undergone chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy within 8 weeks
were also excluded due to the confounding myelosuppressive effect of these
treatments. Participants taking oral iron were required to stop 1 week before
their infusion and for the duration of enrolment. Full inclusion/exclusion

unit by two unblinded nurse investigators. The difference in the appearance of
the iron and placebo was concealed using an opaque intravenous administration
set (Intrafix Primeline UV protect, B. Braun Ltd, Melsungen, Germany). Iron was
dosed according to the simplified dosing regimen which calculates body iron
deficit by weight and baseline haemoglobin (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692163221145604" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental Table 2</ext-link>). For individuals exceeding the maximum
20 mg/kg/week dose an infusion of the maximum permitted dose was administered at
a first visit with a second dose of the remainder administered 7–10 days later.
The same protocol was undertaken for participants in the placebo arm to ensure
blinding was maintained. Adherence to the administration protocol, participant
monitoring via 15 min observations during and after the infusion, and
maintenance of successful blinding were all recorded. Participant follow up was
conducted at 4 and 8 weeks after infusion.</p>

(range 0–4). Recruitment in the latter stages of the trial was disrupted due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and further accrual was not possible during this time. As the
trial had achieved its primary aim of assessing feasibility and had surpassed the

                <p>Seven hundred nine people were assessed for eligibility (596 from palliative care

participate in the study. A reason for decline was not required but many people
volunteered their thoughts. Two declined on the grounds of randomisation – and a
wish to avoid the placebo arm. One stated that their health insurance would not
permit participation in a trial. In all other cases people declined due to the
extra burden of visits. None declined due to the chosen outcome measures.

were similar between groups (<xref rid="table2-02692163221145604" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) but at both 4 and 8 weeks

difference [95% CI] 3.38 [−14.94 to 8.18], week 8 3.49 [−17.52 to 10.53]). A
similar improvement was also seen in the FACIT-trial outcome index score (MCID
5.0 points) at 8 weeks for participants in the iron arm. Baseline subscale
scores across all FACIT-F domains were also well matched for participants across
scales for physical, functional, social and emotional wellbeing (<xref rid="table3-02692163221145604" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There was

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>The ICaRAS trial has demonstrated that intravenous iron administration was
feasible and well tolerated in people with advanced cancer being managed in a
palliative setting according to recruitment and attrition rates. The chosen
research questions were all assessed via the feasibility outcomes and the
results of the trial now act as a guide for the design of a definitive study.
The direction of effect in our secondary outcome measures suggests that
intravenous iron may be an efficacious means of improving haemoglobin compared
to placebo in this group of people. These changes were sustained until at least
8 weeks after treatment and anaemia resolution was achieved in a higher
proportion of participants in the intravenous iron group. We also found that
changes in ferritin and transferrin saturation follow similar trends to those
seen in the literature<sup><xref rid="bibr29-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and indicate that a single dose of ferric derisomaltose
may be efficacious at replacing iron stores in these individuals.</p>
                <p>The three quality of life questionnaires were acceptable and feasible within the
present study design and the successful blinding of participants to their study
allocation further adds validity. Despite our small sample size there was a
signal that threshold of the minimum clinically important difference across
several quality of life measures was passed for participants in the iron group.
Namely, the fatigue scales of both the FACIT-F and QLQC30 as well as the FACIT-F
Trial Outcome Index.</p>
                <p>It was not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions on the impact of
intravenous iron on the frequency of blood transfusion in this group of people,
but it is encouraging that no transfusion events occurred in the iron group.
Further data are needed to examine this observation.</p>

                <title>What this study adds</title>
                <p>The study has demonstrated that it is feasible to recruit people to a randomised
controlled trial of intravenous iron according to our enrolment of 1–4
participants per month. The participant attrition rate was also in keeping with
the rate proposed in our protocol at 25%. Further, the feasibility target of 30
participants was also passed<sup><xref rid="bibr27-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and our acceptance rate
was 47% indicating that around half of people approached agreed with the
prospect of randomisation. These findings are encouraging given that similar
trials in advanced cancer usually experience participant dropout in the region
of 22%<sup><xref rid="bibr30-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>
but can be as high as 60% or more<sup><xref rid="bibr31-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> particularly in studies
of fatigue.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Median attrition rates due to participant death before
study completion have been reported to be in the region of 8% of all cases of
dropout in other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Changes seen in haemoglobin with iron offer an important objective measures
through which clinicians might evaluate treatment response among recipients and
will guide future trial design. Similar, retrospective, uncontrolled studies of
iron therapy in people with iron deficiency receiving palliative care have
reported higher haemoglobin increases of 15.1–18.7 g/L over 4–8 weeks following
iron infusion<sup><xref rid="bibr32-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Such studies also recruited participants with a lower
baseline haemoglobin to those in ICaRAS. Importantly, there is also a degree of
both laboratory and physiologic that is diurnal variation in
haemoglobin.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Although these factors would affect participants in
both study arms their impact may be amplified in a small feasibility study.</p>
                <p>A positive correlation was seen between haemoglobin rise and selected quality of
life domains such as the FACT-G derived score. This highlights an area for
further evaluation given that previous studies suggest that only a weak
correlation might exist.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Participant haemoglobin
response according to classification of iron deficiency (absolute or functional)
also generated some interesting observations. We found haemoglobin response
appeared to occur later in people with functional iron deficiency indicating
that ferric derisomaltose may be more efficacious at correcting absolute iron
deficiency. It must be stressed that this analysis was undertaken on a subgroup
of study participants and as such should be interpreted with caution.
Regardless, this observation has not been reported in the literature and further
exploration may guide treatment response or repeat dosing in a clinical
setting.</p>
                <p>Quality of life reporting should be seen as the most important participant
centred outcome, and this is likely to represent the most meaningful primary
outcome measure in a definitive trial. ICaRAS was not powered to detect
clinically meaningful changes in quality of life but there is an indication that
intravenous iron may offer favourable improvements for participants compared to
placebo for the FACIT-F fatigue scale. The FACIT-F has been widely studied among
similar participant populations and has been used as a primary outcome measure
in contemporary trials of treatments for fatigue in people with advanced
cancer<sup><xref rid="bibr35-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> allowing a degree of comparison between intravenous
iron and other interventions. Median baseline FACIT-F fatigue scores for all
participants (placebo 22.2, intravenous iron 22.6) were also in keeping with
those quoted in the literature (23.9) for anaemic, fatigued people with
cancer<sup><xref rid="bibr36-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> demonstrating that ICaRAS has correctly targetted the
population of interest.</p>
                <p>The observations seen in fatigue scale scores for placebo group participants
indicated an increase in fatigue over the 8 weeks. These data support the
understanding of a functional decline in people with advanced cancer,
particularly in the last year of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> This may also offer
support for intravenous iron to prevent or delay increasing fatigue associated
with disease progression. Importantly, several quality of life measures improved
for placebo group participants during follow up. These improvements may reflect
the multidisciplinary palliative care support being received outside of the
trial setting with subsequent improvements in psychological and physical
wellbeing. We also hypothesise that improvements in placebo group participants
may have occurred due to the ‘Hawthorne effect’<sup><xref rid="bibr38-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> which can still arise
despite concealing treatment allocation.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Similar results have been
seen in other placebo-controlled trials studying fatigue in people with advanced
cancer, even with the use of blinding.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> To counter this effect,
we may have to eliminate placebo responders during a run-in phase of any future
clinical trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>The secondary outcome measures are intended to indicate a direction of effect and
all such results should be interpreted with caution in this unpowered study.
Participant recruitment and attrition data are encouraging but may differ
outside of a specialist palliative service within secondary care. The disruption
of the COVID-19 pandemic also impacted final recruitment figures. Despite this
there were important indicators of efficacy for intravenous iron across both
objective and subjective outcome measures and our recruitment threshold of 30
participants was passed.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-02692163221145604" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In conclusion, the present study design was feasible and demonstrated that
intravenous iron may be efficacious at improving haemoglobin and iron stores in
people with palliative cancer suffering from symptomatic anaemia. These changes
appeared to be linked to improvements in participant quality of life across
select measures including fatigue-specific domains. The results should inform
the design of a definitive trial of this treatment for people with anaemia in
advanced cancer.</p>
