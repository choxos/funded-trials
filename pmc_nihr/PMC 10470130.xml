                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">People with type 1 diabetes and raised glucose levels are at greater risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, sexual health problems and foot disease. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends continuous subcutaneous ‘insulin pump’ therapy for people with type 1 diabetes whose HbA1c is above 69 mmol/mol. Insulin pump use can improve quality of life, cut cardiovascular risk and increase treatment satisfaction. About 90,000 people in England and Wales meet NICE criteria for insulin pumps but do not use one. Insulin pump use also varies markedly by deprivation, ethnicity, sex and location. Increasing insulin pump use is a key improvement priority.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Audit and feedback is a common but variably effective intervention. Limited capabilities of healthcare providers to mount effective responses to feedback from national audits, such as the National Diabetes Audit (NDA), undermines efforts to improve care. We have co-developed a theoretically and empirically informed quality improvement collaborative (QIC) to strengthen local responses to feedback with patients and carers, national audits and healthcare providers. We will evaluate whether the QIC improves the uptake of insulin pumps following NDA feedback.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We will undertake an efficient cluster randomised trial using routine data. The QIC will be delivered alongside the NDA to specialist diabetes teams in England and Wales. Our primary outcome will be the proportion of people with type 1 diabetes and an HbA1c above 69 mmol/mol who start and continue insulin pump use during the 18-month intervention period. Secondary outcomes will assess change in glucose control and duration of pump use. Subgroup analyses will explore impacts upon inequalities by ethnicity, sex, age and deprivation. A theory-informed process evaluation will explore diabetes specialist teams’ engagement, implementation, fidelity and tailoring through observations, interviews, surveys and documentary analysis. An economic evaluation will micro-cost the QIC, estimate cost-effectiveness of NDA feedback with QIC and estimate the budget impact of NHS-wide QIC roll out.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Our study responds to a need for more head-to-head trials of different ways of reinforcing feedback delivery. Our findings will have implications for other large-scale audit and feedback programmes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par31">Over 192,000 people in England have type 1 diabetes, almost half of whom have HbA1c levels above 69 mmol/mol putting them at greater risk of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, sexual health problems and foot disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ('insulin pump') therapy for people with type 1 diabetes whose HbA1c is above 69 mmol/mol despite receiving a high level of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Insulin pump use can improve quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], reduce cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and increase treatment satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Yet the National Diabetes Audit (NDA) demonstrates slow and unequal progress in uptake of insulin pumps; around 90,000 people who meet NICE criteria are not prescribed insulin pumps (NDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Pump use varies markedly by locality (2% to 47%; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]), by deprivation (16.3% most deprived; 23.8% least deprived; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]) and by ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The NDA has identified accelerating the uptake and equality of insulin pump use as a key priority in reducing mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">The NDA is one of around 60 national audits in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Funded by the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales, it provides feedback on recommended processes of care (e.g. proportions of people with diabetes having foot checks) and attainment of treatment goals (e.g. blood sugar or blood pressure control) to specialist teams. Feedback from the audit highlights areas for improvement to stimulate change. Whilst audit and feedback has shown modest improvements on care delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there are considerable opportunities to improve the impact of national audit programmes such as the NDA by, for example, incorporating goals and action plans for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, a common challenge amongst those leading national audits is that even well-designed feedback may only have limited impact in the absence of robust local quality improvement arrangements. For example, we found no improvements in care from enhanced feedback reports in two trials embedded within a national audit programme which aimed to reduce inappropriate blood transfusions; a major reason for the absence of any improvement was the lack of effective local responses to feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Evidence (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]), theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and stakeholder prioritised hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] highlight an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of national audits by enhancing the ability of feedback recipients to mount concerted quality improvement efforts.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), the main commissioner of national audits in England, states that, “health care providers require additional support to make best use of performance feedback data. This is likely to be most effective as part of a coordinated regional or national improvement programme” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several frameworks propose that significant improvements in care can only be achieved by launching and coordinating quality improvement efforts across all levels of healthcare systems (national, organisational, team, and individual) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Whilst national audit may provide the impetus for change at clinical team and individual levels, there is often insufficient local organisational capability to enable change by, for example, systematically aligning actions to barriers to, and levers for, improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Local quality improvement may also be undermined by a lack of motivation to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], limited opportunities for improvement actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and poor adaptability to local organisational context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. HQIP guidance states “national clinical audits need to be put into the local context to inform action plans addressing areas where quality improvements can be made” (p8; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]).</p>
              <p id="Par35">We have developed a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) that supports providers to improve by selecting actions tailored to local contexts and generating organisational commitment for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] included multi-method co-design to understand current responses to national audits and further co-design of a stakeholder-, theory- and evidence-informed intervention to support recipients.</p>
              <p id="Par36">We have explored the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of this intervention when delivered with two national audits (NDA and National Audit of Dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]). We recently delivered the intervention to 28 diabetes teams and evaluated feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity and scalability. We found that the behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] identified in the manual were delivered by facilitators. There was evidence for fidelity of enactment of target behaviours. Participants reported positive attitudes towards the intervention and that the intervention was appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We consider that the intervention is now ready for a definitive effectiveness evaluation.</p>
              <p id="Par37">We will evaluate the effectiveness of NDA feedback with QIC compared to NDA feedback alone, understand intervention implementation, engagement, fidelity and tailoring of actions, and estimate value for money of NDA feedback with QIC.</p>

One hundred twenty specialist diabetes teams (clusters) will be allocated on 1:1 basis to either control (NDA feedback alone) or intervention (NDA feedback plus QIC) arms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Control arm teams will receive the intervention after the study follow-up period, but prior to completion of data analysis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2023_1293_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par45">Teams allocated to the intervention arm will receive standard NDA feedback (described in Supplementary materials <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and the QIC to promote the uptake of insulin pumps.</p>
                <p id="Par46">The QIC will be delivered through two virtual workshops (6 h in total), two virtual outreach sessions (30 min) and virtual facilitated multisite meetings (1 h each). Delivery will be by the NDA Quality Improvement Lead, the DiabetesUK Engagement Lead, the NDA Clinical Lead and clinicians with expertise in improvement and insulin pump use. The intervention will be delivered virtually via Microsoft Teams and Google JamBoard.</p>
                <p id="Par47">We will ask participating teams to attend workshops and ensure a team member attends at least 8 of the 12 multisite meetings. Teams are supported over a 15-month period. Only identified, invited members from participating sites will have access the virtual workshops and meetings. Delivery will be in three parallel cohorts of 20 teams, with each cohort forming a ‘collaborative.’ Learning will be shared between cohorts by the facilitator. Teams will be asked to identify a replacement if any team member leaves. The replacement will be offered a 30-min one-to-one call to support within-team discussions about the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par48">The logic model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) outlines the behaviours targeted by the intervention. It also describes the mechanisms that influence their implementation and the behaviour change techniques intended to address these mechanisms.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>EQUIPD Protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2023_1293_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

In summary, the intervention supports teams to specify a goal; analyse influences upon care; link influence to the improvement action; collaborate; review feedback; engage stakeholders; link the work to priorities; and consider existing work. We anticipate that enactment of these target behaviours will provide the informational appraisal to select effective actions and generate organisational commitment needed to bring about those actions.</p>

                <title>Follow-up</title>
                <p id="Par50">We have chosen an 18-month follow-up period for two reasons. First, it reflects the duration of the QIC, plus 3 months to assess sustainment. Second, it allows for a period for teams engaging with the QIC to consider, plan and initiate changes in clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="Par51">All teams will be given the opportunity to receive the intervention alongside standard NDA feedback. It is not possible to support all teams at once. We will therefore randomly allocate half to receive the intervention, whilst the other half will receive the intervention 18 months later (control group) 3 months after intervention arm delivery is completed. Teams that choose not to be included in the evaluation will receive the intervention alongside the control group.</p>
                <p id="Par52">Allocation concealment is not feasible in this trial. We will maintain a log of those unblinded to allocation. This will include the intervention delivery team and those research team members who need to know allocations to undertake the study. The intervention supports teams to engage local patients to identify potential barriers and actions to improvement, as such patients may not be blinded to involvement in the intervention arm.</p>

                <p id="Par84">The evaluation will draw upon the same theories applied in developing the QIC intervention: Organisational readiness to change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to describe the target behaviours undertaken by intervention recipients; Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to explore implementation, and Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to describe delivery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par85">The process evaluation will investigate whether hypothesised mechanisms for achieving change in both professional behaviour (what intervention recipients do) and patient-level outcomes (the use of insulin pumps) are evident when the QIC is used in practice, and what wider (and perhaps unanticipated) factors affect these mechanism-outcome relationships.</p>
                <p id="Par86">The logic model outlines the BCTs intended to trigger NPT mechanisms within the QIC intervention and targeted behaviours of specialist diabetes teams. We will draw on this logic model and the fidelity assessment approach of Lorencatto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to assess the extent to which intervention components are delivered by intervention facilitators and received by specialist diabetes teams and if targeted behaviours are enacted as intended.</p>
                <p id="Par87">The QIC supports teams to explore influences upon performance, identified using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and to select improvement actions aligned to these influences. Previously identified influences upon insulin pump use include patient factors (e.g. knowledge and skills), staff factors (motivation; beliefs about acceptability to, and consequences for, patients; beliefs about capacity and capability) and contextual factors (e.g. culture, funding, time). The tailoring evaluation will describe the selected improvement actions using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compilation of implementation strategies, and the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) framework. The analysis will be ongoing and iterative and draw upon other approaches from implementation science where relevant.</p>

                <p id="Par90">To limit participant burden, we will sample from around half (30) of the intervention teams for interviews, but from all intervention teams for observations and documentary analysis. Documents will include those produced within QIC workshops (for which we will give authors the opportunity to have their data excluded from the analysis) and organisational documents (e.g. local reports with appropriate permissions).</p>
                <p id="Par91">For interviews, we will undertake strategic sampling within the intervention arm, for example, by baseline proportion moving onto a pump in the 15 months prior to the intervention period (above or below median) and number of patients served by the specialist team (above or below median). We will sample from 8 to 12 control arm teams.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p id="Par92">We will collect data from both intervention and control (teams assigned to later receipt) arms to explore ‘implementation as usual’ work for the NDA and any potential contamination between study arms. We will use four qualitative methods: around 60–80 theory-informed, semi-structured interviews, 4–8 surveys, analysis of up to around 120 documents and an estimated 55 h or less of observations. Where appropriate, the data will be used for all three process evaluation objectives (process and engagement, fidelity, tailoring) and the WP3 economic evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par93">We will interview diabetes team members at multiple time points. The interviews will use a topic guide developed from our aforementioned theoretical approaches, including open questions for exploring barriers, facilitators and mechanisms related to NPT and BCTs. Interviews will also include more tailored questioning, developed from prior analysis of other data sources (documents and observation), and serving as prompts for more detailed investigation. An initial round of approximately 20 interviews will include both intervention deliverers and intervention arm participants early during intervention delivery to assess intervention engagement, fidelity, and tailoring. A further 40–50 interviews towards the end of the intervention period will seek more reflective data on intervention engagement and perceptions (including tailoring) and data required to complete fidelity assessment. This latter set of interviews will include 8–12 interviews with control arm participants to focus on team experiences of undertaking quality improvement in relation to the NDA in the absence of intervention, thus providing contextual data about ‘implementation as usual’. Combined with data from intervention participants, this will also provide scope to explore and understand any contamination across trial arms (e.g. if control participants mention access to QIC intervention documentation).</p>
                <p id="Par94">We will collect up to 55 h of observational data with intervention participants only, contributing data on implementation, engagement, fidelity and tailoring. This will capture participant descriptions of both planned and completed improvement actions. The observations will include recorded virtual interactive educational workshops, virtual outreach sessions and multisite facilitated meetings. Around two thirds of these data will be captured within the first 3 months of intervention delivery, allowing later interviews to focus more directly on issues arising from the observations. We will record intervention exercises and monthly virtual facilitated meetings for subsequent structured observational analysis. We will conduct more focused qualitative observations at some sites (identified at interview), to include meetings of implementation teams and meetings with key stakeholders (either in real time or recordings), as available and appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par95">Around 120 documents for analysis will include materials concerning intervention exercises and activities, including stakeholder maps, logic models, action plans, and summaries of any discussions and meetings available to the research team. We anticipate the majority of these will concern intervention arm participants and provide additional detail for assessing fidelity of delivery, receipt and enactment and understanding tailoring activity. We will seek some documentation for analysis from control arm participants towards the end of the intervention period. These documents will be identified during control participant interviews and requested for inclusion in the study if available. They will likely comprise internal quality assurance reports and will help understand ‘implementation as usual’.</p>
                <p id="Par96">We will use an online survey to collect data from those intervention deliverers who provide brief input into intervention delivery. The survey will be emailed within the first 3 months of intervention delivery.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par97">Iterative analysis of interview data will use both inductive and deductive approaches, according to standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, the fidelity assessment will deductively seek the presence or absence of the enactment of target behaviours; the evaluation of implementation will inductively explore influences on engagement. Documents will be read in parallel by two researchers who will extract data for analysis according to the different process evaluation objectives. For implementation and engagement, these documents will be used to develop prompts and more detailed questions within the topic guide when interviewing the team members who authored them. For investigation of tailoring processes, documents will prompt questioning about the influences teams identified and how (and why) they linked these to their documented strategies. For fidelity, documentary analysis will focus on enactment of target intervention behaviours (e.g. use of the TDF to identify influences; the development of a list of stakeholders for engagement). We will take a more structured approach for observational data, assessing fidelity through coding and comparing the BCTs in the manual with those observed in delivery. In total, 36 h of the delivered intervention sessions will be coded (12 h of virtual interactive educational workshops, 12 one-to-one virtual outreach sessions and 12 multisite virtual facilitated meetings). These will be distributed across the delivery period, in accordance with the National Institutes for Health Behaviour Change Consortium recommendations. Eighty to 100% adherence to intervention specifications represents ‘high’ fidelity of delivery, 51 to 79% represents ‘moderate’ fidelity, and &lt; 50% or less represents ‘low’ fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par98">Our multi-stage analysis will occur concurrently with data collection to allow for emerging trends found in earlier fieldwork to be explored later. We will share interim analyses with stakeholders to identify additional avenues for exploration in later interviews and documentary analysis. This wider group will include clinicians, people with diabetes, policy leads and implementation scientists.</p>
                <p id="Par99">We will undertake workshops for integrative analysis of the different data sources (from interviews, observations and document analysis) to address the three investigative objectives of the process evaluation: implementation and engagement; fidelity and tailoring (1–2 half-day workshops per investigation). The analysis workshops will explicitly reconnect and explore the data and findings to develop higher level analyses with reference to NPT, organisational readiness and BCTs, and the matching of improvement strategies to barriers and facilitators using causal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Project team and stakeholders will be invited to these workshops as appropriate.</p>

                <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                <p id="Par109">Economic evaluation outcomes are typically reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) or net (monetary or health) benefit. Net (monetary) benefit is a rearrangement of the ICER and estimated as (λ x QALYs)–Costs, where λ is the willingness to pay threshold per health gain (in the case of NICE, £20,000-£30,000 per QALY). The primary analysis will present incremental net monetary benefit for NDA feedback with QIC versus feedback alone.</p>
                <p id="Par110">The value for money of insulin pumps has been evidenced by previous clinical and cost-effectiveness research, summarised in systematic reviews. This evidence was of sufficient weight to lead to a positive recommendation from NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par111">The current evaluation will not seek to re-estimate the value of the technology and will not therefore build a de novo economic model of type 1 diabetes. Instead, we will estimate the value of the alternative implementation strategies alone. As such, this evaluation uses the general principles of value of implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A targeted review of relevant published literature, NICE appraisals and guidelines will identify trial and model-based economic evaluations of insulin pump cost-effectiveness in the UK context. Several of these are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] as well as reviews in the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We will use selected studies to identify the most plausible estimates of net benefit along with (if appropriate) other candidate estimates to use in scenario analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par112">The value of the intervention will be defined as the most plausible incremental net benefit of insulin use (versus no use, i.e. multiple daily injections) multiplied by the probability of uptake, minus the costs of the improvement strategy for each arm. The probability of uptake will be derived from adjusted statistical estimates (e.g. as odd ratios). We will develop a simple decision tree model (DTM) to estimate cost-effectiveness which will use value for money (i.e. lifetime net benefit) as model pay-offs and incorporate probability of pump prescription and probability of sustained pump use. We will conduct extensive deterministic sensitivity analyses to test analytical assumptions and the values adopted. We will define distributions around analysis parameters (strategy cost, probability of uptake, net benefit of insulin use) and conduct a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] report confidence intervals or variance around cost-effectiveness estimates which could be used for this purpose. Where these are not available, we will use existing studies to inform assumptions around likely distributions.</p>
                <p id="Par113">The analysis will report the incremental net benefit of NDA feedback with QIC versus feedback alone, and the probability that the QIC is cost-effective.

                <p id="Par117">We have gained ethical and Health Research Authority approval. We have recruited and allocated 77 clusters, where a cluster includes up to 3 specialist teams within an organisation or patient pathway. This is the majority of diabetes specialist teams in England and Wales. More recent NDA data suggests that the control group may improve by 2%, rather than the estimated 3% figure used in our initial power calculations.</p>
                <p id="Par118">Although our actual recruitment figure is lower than planned (<italic>n</italic> = 120 teams), 77 clusters will allow us to detect an absolute increase of 8% in prescribing of insulin pumps (i.e. 2% in control arm versus 10% in intervention arm) whilst retaining 87% power. This assumes a parallel design without baseline measures. Therefore, after adjusting for baseline, the power should increase beyond what is estimated above. We therefore believe that our trial is sufficiently powered to detect a clinically important improvement. We have discussed this with our independent Project Steering Committee (Supplementary materials 1) who agree with this assessment.</p>

We will test a theory-, evidence-, and stakeholder-informed intervention to enhance feedback recipients’ capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The intervention, a form of QIC, will be offered to all specialist diabetes teams in England and Wales. Teams will be allocated at random to intervention and waiting-list control arms.

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par122">Fifteen years after NICE guidelines recommended insulin pumps for people with type 1 diabetes and an HbA1c greater than 69 mmol/mol, many NICE-eligible people are not using insulin pumps. Gaps in the uptake of insulin pumps and high variations in use might relate to care delivery factors. The NDA QIC seeks to improve the quality improvement capabilities of national audit recipients as a route to addressing these care delivery factors and increasing the use of insulin pumps.</p>
              <p id="Par123">The specified QIC targets specific practices in the response to national audit data. Evaluating the delivery of the QIC will provide valuable insights to national audit providers and commissioners, diabetes policy-makers, practitioners and implementation scientists. If effective, the QIC will implement NICE-recommended care associated with improved patient outcomes.</p>
