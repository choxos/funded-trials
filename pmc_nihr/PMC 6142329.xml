                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Lifestyle interventions for obese pregnant women have been widely researched but little is known about predictors of low adherence or poor outcomes. This study evaluated the prospective associations between elevated symptoms of antenatal depression and gestational diabetes, adherence and gestational weight gain in a large RCT of a behavioural intervention for obese pregnant women. The effect of the intervention on symptoms of depression at follow-up was also examined.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The UPBEAT RCT randomised 1555 obese pregnant women to receive a dietary and physical activity lifestyle intervention or standard care. Symptoms of antenatal depression were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline (15<sup>+ 0</sup>–18<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) and follow-up (27<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation). Gestational diabetes was assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test at 27<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation. Adherence was pre-defined as receiving at least 5 of 8 intervention sessions. Gestational weight gain was calculated as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight (estimated as measured baseline weight minus 1.25 kg) and last measured weight at 34<sup>+ 0</sup>–36<sup>+ 0</sup> weeks’ gestation. Due to substantial missing data in certain variables, multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Women who were no longer pregnant at 27<sup>+ 0</sup>–28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation were excluded from the sample for these analyses.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">One thousand five-hundered twenty-six women were included in these analyses following multiple imputation; 797 (52.2%) had complete data. 13.4% had elevated symptoms of antenatal depression at baseline. There was no evidence for associations between antenatal depression status and gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.30), adherence (adjusted OR 1.16, 95%CI 0.63 to 2.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.63) or gestational weight gain (adjusted regression coefficient 0.52, 95%CI -0.26 to 1.29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19). The intervention was not associated with change in depressive symptoms at follow-up (regression coefficient 0.003, 95%CI -0.49 to 0.49, <italic>p</italic> = 0.99). Similar results were obtained in complete case analyses.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Elevated symptoms of antenatal depression did not predict gestational diabetes, adherence or gestational weight gain in this large RCT of a lifestyle intervention for obese pregnant women. The intervention also did not influence symptoms of depression at follow-up. Obese pregnant women with elevated symptoms of depression should not be excluded from lifestyle interventions.</p>

              <p id="Par13">In recent years, there has been an abundance of research examining lifestyle interventions for obese pregnant women that aim to improve diet, increase physical activity and reduce gestational weight gain. However, these interventions often have limited effectiveness, and low adherence or high drop-out rates are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There has been little research into predictors of adherence or outcomes in these interventions for pregnant women, but studies of weight management interventions for non-pregnant adults have found that elevated symptoms of depression can be associated with higher attrition and lower adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Depression is common during pregnancy and systematic review evidence has demonstrated that obese pregnant women are more likely to experience depression than normal weight women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, antenatal depression has been associated with excessive gestational weight gain in some, although not all, observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is important to identify whether depression is a risk factor for poorer outcomes in lifestyle interventions for obese women during pregnancy.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Amongst the few previous studies examining these associations in pregnancy, one found no evidence that symptoms of depression predicted adherence to the intervention or gestational weight gain in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a diet and exercise intervention among 205 obese pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, this study was underpowered to examine clinical outcomes of interest such as gestational diabetes, and requires replication. It is also necessary to examine whether taking part in a lifestyle intervention influences symptoms of depression among pregnant women. The few findings on this topic to date have been inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">This study examined the prospective associations between elevated symptoms of antenatal depression and 1) gestational diabetes, 2) intervention adherence, and 3) gestational weight gain in the UPBEAT trial, a large RCT of a complex behavioural intervention for obese pregnant women. The effect of the intervention on symptoms of depression at follow-up was also examined.</p>

                <title>The UPBEAT trial</title>
                <p id="Par16">The UPBEAT trial (UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial) is a multicentre randomised controlled trial of a complex behavioural intervention for obese pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The intervention focused on improving diet and increasing physical activity with the aim of reducing the risk of gestational diabetes among obese pregnant women, and of delivery of large for gestational age infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Women randomised to the intervention attended up to eight weekly group sessions delivered by health trainers, and received an intervention handbook, a DVD of pregnancy-specific exercise routines, a pedometer and a log book for recording weekly goals. Women in the control group received standard antenatal care according to the provision in their local area.</p>
                <p id="Par17">For the UPBEAT trial, obese pregnant women (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at their first antenatal appointment) with a singleton pregnancy were recruited between 15<sup>+ 0</sup> and 18<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation. Exclusion criteria for the trial were lack of informed consent, BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, ≤16 years old, multiple pregnancy, currently being prescribed metformin, and pre-existing medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension requiring treatment, thyroid disease or current psychosis. In addition, women with known miscarriage, termination, fetal death in utero or preterm birth prior to the first follow-up interview (27<sup>+ 0</sup> to 28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation) were excluded from the sample for these analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Women were recruited from eight NHS hospital trusts in the UK between March 2009 and June 2014. Ethical approval for the study was obtained in all centres (UK integrated research application system reference: 09/H0802/5) and the trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials (ISCRTN89971375). Randomisation was performed online using the MedSciNet™ secure data management system, minimised based on age, ethnicity, BMI and centre of recruitment. Given the nature of the intervention, study staff and participants were not blinded to intervention status.</p>

A validated cut-off score of ≥13 was used to indicate elevated symptoms of antenatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The difference between EPDS score at baseline and follow-up was calculated to indicate change in depressive symptoms.</p>

                <title>Main analyses</title>
                <p id="Par24">All analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp, 2015, College Station, Texas). There was no missing data for the majority of baseline variables; however income and EPDS score were missing for 15.5% and 12.6% of participants respectively. There was also missing data in the outcome variables, with approximately 15% missing for GDM and over 20% missing for EPDS at follow-up and gestational weight gain (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Missing data reduces statistical power in complete case analysis and can lead to bias if participants with missing data differ from those with complete data. Based on the assumption of missing at random, which was plausible in this dataset (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), multiple imputation by chained equations was used to impute missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All analysis variables were included in the imputation model alongside other relevant auxiliary variables to improve the prediction of missing values and increase the plausibility of missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The number of imputed datasets was based on the proportion of missing data as simulation studies have suggested that the number of imputed datasets should be greater than the proportion of participants with missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Sixty imputed datasets were produced. Statistical analyses were then carried on each imputed dataset separately and combined using Rubin’s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Full details of the imputation are provided in the Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Using the imputed data, characteristics of the study sample were summarised for socio-demographic variables, BMI, parity and centre of recruitment. Characteristics of women with EPDS scores ≥13 and EPDS scores &lt; 13 were presented as frequencies or means (with standard deviations (SD)) and compared using univariate regression analyses. The relationship between antenatal depression at 15<sup>+ 0</sup> to 18<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation (independent variable) and gestational diabetes (dependent variable) was then examined using univariate logistic regression. The interaction of depression and intervention group on risk of gestational diabetes was tested and if this was found to be significant, subgroup analyses were performed to examine the intervention and control groups separately. If the interaction effect was not significant, the association between antenatal depression and gestational diabetes was examined in the sample as a whole. The relationship between EPDS score (as a continuous variable) and gestational diabetes was also examined using unadjusted logistic regression. In addition, fasting blood glucose levels (mmol/L) and gestation at the time of the oral glucose tolerance test were compared between women with and without elevated symptoms of antenatal depression (EPDS &lt; 13 and EPDS ≥13). Multiple logistic regression was then used to examine the association between depression (EPDS≥13) and gestational diabetes adjusted for potential confounders (BMI, age, ethnicity, relationship status, educational level, household income, index of multiple deprivation, parity and study centre). The association between antenatal depression and high adherence (receiving five or more intervention sessions out of a possible total of eight) was then examined for women in the intervention group only, using logistic regression with and without adjusting for confounders (as above). The relationship between EPDS score, as a continuous variable, and adherence was also examined. Next, the association between antenatal depression and gestational weight gain was examined using linear regression, again with adjustment for confounders. Assumptions of linear regression were checked (normality of residuals, homoscedasticity and independence of predictors) and one outlier for gestational weight gain was removed prior to imputation. The relationship between EPDS score, as a continuous variable, and gestational weight gain was also examined. Finally, the effect of the intervention on the change in symptoms of depression from baseline to follow-up was examined using linear regression. The main unadjusted and adjusted analyses were then repeated using complete case analysis, for comparison with the imputed data.</p>

              <p id="Par26">In total, 1555 women were recruited into the UPBEAT trial. One participant was excluded after enrolment in another trial, leaving 1554 participants. The CONSORT diagram is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The number of participants included in the trial represented 19% of the 8259 eligible women approached to participate (8820 women with BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were approached, of whom 561 were not eligible to participate). Women with known miscarriage, termination, fetal death in utero or preterm birth prior to 27<sup>+ 0</sup> to 28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation (<italic>n</italic> = 28) were also excluded from the sample for these analyses. One thousand five hundered twenty-six women were therefore included in this study (757 randomised to standard antenatal care and 769 randomised to the intervention).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2018_2004_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par27">Among the 1526 women included in this study, 797 (52.2%) had complete data for all analysis variables. In total, 47.87% (<italic>n</italic> = 729) of participants had missing data for at least one analysis variable but only 5.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 76) had missing data for more than three analysis variables. Overall, 6.2% of the total observations in the analysis variables were missing. 12.6% of women were missing EPDS score at baseline but there was complete data for most other baseline characteristics except for household income, which was missing for 15.5% of women (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The pattern of missing data was examined and the assumption of missing at random was plausible (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Multiple imputation by chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] was therefore performed (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>) with 60 imputed datasets produced. Overall, characteristics of the imputed data were similar to the observed data (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). For example, 13.1% of women scored ≥13 on the EPDS at baseline in the observed data, and 13.4% in the imputed data.

                <p id="Par33">Mean gestational weight gain was 7.41 kg. Based on antenatal depression status, mean gestational weight was 7.58 kg among women with elevated symptoms of depression, compared with 7.39 kg among women without elevated symptoms. There was no evidence for a difference in the total period of time over which gestational weight gain was assessed, based on baseline antenatal depression status (EPDS &lt; 13: 18.1 weeks (SD 3.3); EPDS ≥13: 18.5 weeks (SD 5.9), <italic>p</italic> = 0.23).</p>
                <p id="Par34">There was no association between antenatal depression status and gestational weight gain in the unadjusted regression analysis (regression coefficient 0.19, 95%CI -0.59 to 0.97, <italic>p</italic> = 0.63), no evidence for an interaction of depression and intervention group on gestational weight gain (<italic>p</italic> = 0.41), and no evidence of an association between EPDS score (as a continuous predictor) and gestational weight gain (regression coefficient 0.04, 95%CI -0.02 to 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = 0.22). There was also no significant association between elevated symptoms of antenatal depression and higher gestational weight gain after adjusting for confounders (adjusted regression coefficient 0.52, 95%CI -0.26 to 1.29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.19).</p>

                <p id="Par36">For the complete case analyses, sample size varied based on the amount of missing data in the included variables. There was no evidence for an association between elevated symptoms of antenatal depression and gestational diabetes in the unadjusted (OR 0.72, 95%CI 0.47–1.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14; <italic>n</italic> = 1143) or adjusted analyses (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.42–1.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.17; <italic>n</italic> = 972), and no evidence for an interaction of depression status and study group on gestational diabetes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.29).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par37">Elevated symptoms of antenatal depression (EPDS score ≥ 13) were reported by almost one in seven (13.4%) obese pregnant women participating in the UPBEAT trial. However, elevated depressive symptoms did not predict risk of gestational diabetes, adherence or gestational weight gain. There was also no evidence that receiving the dietary and physical activity lifestyle intervention during pregnancy influenced symptoms of depression at follow-up.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Our findings are in keeping with a previous RCT of a lifestyle intervention for obese pregnant women which found no association between symptoms of antenatal depression and intervention adherence or gestational weight gain (Bogaerts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). In this study, we extended previous research by examining gestational diabetes, which many previous trials have been underpowered to assess, but again found no association with antenatal depression. We also found no interactions between depression status and intervention group, meaning that the effectiveness of the intervention for the outcomes examined did not differ between women with and without antenatal depression. Future studies could examine whether antenatal depression is associated with differences in diet or physical activity in lifestyle interventions for obese pregnant women.</p>
              <p id="Par39">The intervention in the UPBEAT RCT was found to have no effect on symptoms of antenatal depression at follow-up. Previous findings on this topic are mixed. One small study from Spain, conducted by Perales et al. (2015), found that overweight and obese pregnant women randomised to an exercise programme had a lower prevalence of depression in late pregnancy than women in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bogaerts et al., in contrast, found that their intervention had no effect on symptoms of antenatal depression, but symptoms of anxiety were reduced compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Anxiety symptoms were not assessed in the UPBEAT study so this could not been examined here. However, in an large RCT of a lifestyle advice intervention for overweight and obese pregnant women (<italic>n</italic> = 2212), Dodd et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] also found no effect of the intervention on symptoms of depression or anxiety at follow-up, including follow-up at 4 months postpartum. Considering our results in the context of these previous findings it appears that lifestyle interventions during pregnancy, including the extra contact received and any lifestyle change occuring as a result of these interventions, do not reduce symptoms of depression for the majority of obese women. It may be that structured exercise interventions, as used by Perales et al., have more effect on mental health than lifestyle interventions providing counselling around diet and exercise. However more high quality RCTs of structured exercise interventions for pregnant women are needed to conclude whether these are effective and feasible in routine clinical practice. It is important to ensure that mental health services are available for all women who require treatment for depression during pregnancy. No data were available on mental health interventions received by women in the UPBEAT trial, which is a limitation of these analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par40">The UPBEAT RCT included over 1500 obese pregnant women. This large sample size is a key strength of the study, and enabled clinical outcomes such as gestational diabetes to be assessed. The main findings of the UPBEAT trial (reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) showed that the intervention was not effective in preventing gestational diabetes (the primary maternal outcome), although it did improve diet quality and physical activity, reduce gestational weight gain and reduce maternal adiposity. The assessment of gestational diabetes was a particular strength of this study; the International Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] were used to diagnose gestational diabetes and all women were given a glucose tolerance test at 27<sup>+ 0</sup> to 28<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks’ gestation rather than relying on clinical records to obtain outcome data.</p>
              <p id="Par41">A number of limitations of this study must also be taken into account. Only 19% of the 8259 eligible women approached about the UPBEAT RCT agreed to participate. This is similar to recruitment rates in other studies of lifestyle interventions for overweight or obese pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] but limits the representativeness of the sample and the likely generalisability of the findings. Routine data (collected from non-participants who gave permission) showed that women who did not participate were younger, more likely to be of black ethnicity and had slightly lower BMI. Routine data from non-participants could not be collected on depression status but women with depression might be expected to be less likely to participate. The prevalence of elevated symptoms of antenatal depression observed in the UPBEAT sample at baseline (approximately 13% of women scored ≥13 on the EPDS) is similar to other prevalence estimates during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the UPBEAT study included obese and largely low-income women, and both of these characteristics have been associated with increased risk of antenatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which may suggest that women with depression were underrepresented in the sample. It is also important to note that the EPDS is a screening measure which identifies women with elevated symptoms of depression rather than those meeting diagnostic criteria, meaning that conclusions cannot be drawn about women with depressive disorders from this study. However, the EPDS is widely used to assess antenatal depression in research and clinical practice and has been validated to indicate probable depression during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The main analyses were conducted using the EPDS as a dichotomous variable, but additional analyses using the EPDS as a continuous predictor gave similar findings.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Finally, missing data is a common problem in longitudinal studies including the UPBEAT RCT, leading to loss of statistical power and potential bias. This study included 1526 women, of whom only 52% (<italic>n</italic> = 797) had complete data for all analysis variables. However, the amount of missing data for each participant was generally low, with 95% of participants missing three or fewer variables. The main analyses for this paper were conducted using multiple imputation to impute missing data, which gives unbiased estimates based on the assumption that data are missing at random (i.e. that missing values can be predicted as a function of the observed data). It is not possible to conclusively test whether data are missing at random, but this was highly plausible in this sample. There were rich baseline data available on sample characteristics, the majority of which had no missing data, and these characteristics predicted missing data in the follow-up interviews. It is often argued that data on mental health is unlikely to be missing at random as participants with poor mental health may be more likely to have missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, in this study the vast majority of missing baseline EPDS data occurred during a short period of the study in which this variable was not recorded, so this missing data is not related to unmeasured participant characteristics and can be characterised as missing at random.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Our conclusions are also strengthened by a complete case analysis which gave very similar findings. The only difference observed between the complete case and imputed analyses is that elevated symptoms of antenatal depression were significantly associated with increased gestational weight gain after adjustment for confounders in the complete case analysis, which was not the case in the imputed analyses. However, it is plausible that this association in the complete case analyses was the result of bias from the exclusion of participants with missing data. A previous study on this topic also found no association between symptoms of antenatal depression and gestational weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in keeping with the results of the imputed analyses.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par44">Elevated symptoms of depression are common among obese pregnant women. In the UPBEAT RCT there was no association between elevated symptoms of antenatal depression at baseline and adherence to the intervention, risk of gestational diabetes, or gestational weight gain among obese pregnant women. There was also no evidence that the effectiveness of the intervention differed based on antenatal depression status, or that the intervention influenced symptoms of depression at follow-up. We conclude that obese pregnant women with elevated symptoms of depression should not be excluded from lifestyle interventions due to concerns about intervention adherence and effectiveness, or concerns about impact on depressive symptomatology. Awareness of depression among health professionals providing care for obese pregnant women nonetheless remains crucial for detection and treatment of this disorder.</p>
