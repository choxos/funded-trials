                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), an exercise and education programme for people with chronic lung disease, aims to improve exercise capacity, breathlessness and quality of life. Most evidence to support PR is from trials that use specialist exercise equipment, for example, treadmills (PR-gym). However, a significant proportion of programmes do not have access to specialist equipment with training completed with minimal exercise equipment (PR-min). There is a paucity of robust literature examining the efficacy of supervised, centre-based PR-min. We aim to determine whether an 8-week supervised, centre-based PR-min programme is non-inferior to a standard 8-week supervised, centre-based PR-gym programme in terms of exercise capacity and health outcomes for patients with chronic lung disease.</p>

                  <p>Parallel, two-group, assessor-blinded and statistician-blinded, non-inferiority randomised trial. 436 participants will be randomised using minimisation at the individual level with a 1:1 allocation to PR-min (intervention) or PR-gym (control). Assessment will take place pre-PR (visit 1), post-PR (visit 2) and 12 months following visit 1 (visit 3). Exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), dyspnoea (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ)-Dyspnoea), health-related quality of life (CRQ), frailty (Short Physical Performance Battery), muscle strength (isometric quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction), patient satisfaction (Global Rating of Change Questionnaire), health economic as well as safety and trial process data will be measured. The primary outcome is change in exercise capacity between visit 1 and visit 2. Two sample t-tests on an intention to treat basis will be used to estimate the difference in mean primary and secondary outcomes between patients randomised to PR-gym and PR-min.</p>

                <p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), an evidence-based exercise and education programme, is widely accepted as a cornerstone of management for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory disorders.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The most recent Cochrane review, comprising 65 randomised controlled trials (n=3822), stated that no further trials comparing PR and standard care in patient with COPD were necessary as the evidence supporting the benefits of PR on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were conclusive.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
                <p>The majority of evidence to support PR has come from trials conducted in hospital or rehabilitation centres that use specialist exercise equipment such as treadmills, cycle ergometers and weights machines (PR-gym).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, in clinical practice, supply does not meet demand, and routine access to specialist equipment may not be feasible.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For example, the 2015 Royal College of Physicians National Audit identified that PR services in England and Wales received 68 000 referrals in 2014 out of an estimated 446 000 eligible patients with COPD.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Furthermore, 82% of patients enrolled in a PR programme in England and Wales in 2017 were hosted in a community site such as a community centre or church hall, of which 61% most likely did not exercise using specialist equipment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Accordingly, exercise training at these sites, although supervised by PR professionals, was completed with minimal equipment (PR-min), typically using portable equipment such as free weights, elastic resistance bands (eg, Theraband), walking courses and bodyweight resistance exercises.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
                <p>Apart from improving accessibility, it has been argued that PR-min may have other advantages over PR-gym. Exercise-training using minimal equipment may better reflect activities of daily-living than training using specialist equipment and therefore be easier to replicate and maintain at home following discharge from PR. However, it may be more difficult to prescribe and progress exercise, particularly resistance exercise, without the use of specialist equipment.</p>
                <p>A systematic review, conducted by Alison and colleagues, identified eight randomised controlled trials that compared outcomes following exercise interventions completed with minimal equipment to usual care without an exercise intervention in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The results were conflicting for exercise outcomes. In four studies (n=182) where the 6 min walk test was used as the primary outcome measure of exercise capacity, the pooled effect showed a mean (95% CI) between-group difference of 40 (13 to 67) m favouring the intervention group.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Conversely, in the other four studies (n=389) that used the incremental shuttle walk test (ISW), there was no significant mean (95% CI) between-group difference: 21 (−9 to 51) m.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For health-related quality of life, results were similarly conflicting.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Whereas in the four studies that used the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire there was a sizeable difference between the intervention and control groups (mean (95% CI): −7 (−12 to −3)), the mean between-group difference of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnoea (CRQ-D) and fatigue domains (CRQ-F) did not reach the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in three other studies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Only one of the eight studies measured muscle strength but results were reported descriptively with no statistical testing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, only one of the eight studies would fulfil the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines definition of PR,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with seven studies not offering any education component.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
                <p>To our knowledge, no trial has compared supervised centre-based PR using minimal and specialist equipment. A previous National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment-funded randomised 2×2 trial compared PR undertaken in community venues with PR undertaken in a hospital venue, in 240 patients with COPD.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Participants were block randomised (hospital n=129; community n=111). Both groups received two times a week PR for 6 weeks with the exercise training protocol identical in both venues. Importantly, neither community nor hospital sites had access to specialist exercise equipment. Patients in both groups improved their walking distance, exceeding the MCID of the endurance shuttle walk test, and there were similar improvements in health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although the results support the conclusion that the efficacy of PR-min is not influenced by hospital or community locations, this study did not address whether PR-min is non-inferior to ‘gold standard’ PR-gymOur group recently conducted an observational cohort study to compare if an 8 week supervised, centre-based PR-min programme was non-inferior to PR-gym in terms of core PR outcomes in patients with COPD.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Using propensity score matching, 318 consecutive patients undergoing PR-min were compared 1:1 with a control group of 318 patients who underwent PR-gym. Similar short-term improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were observed in both groups (mean (95% CI) difference: ISW: 3 (−16 to 9) m; CRQ-total: 0.9 (−2.7 to 4.5)). Furthermore, the 95% CI between-group differences for these outcomes did not cross the predefined non-inferiority margins. These data suggest that PR-min is non-inferior to PR-gym with regard to short-term improvements in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life. However, this study was not randomised, only included short-term outcomes and no attempt was made to estimate costs. A randomised controlled trial with more varied outcome measures (such as lower limb muscle strength), longer follow-up and a health economic analysis, is required to confirm these findings.</p>
                <p>The aims of the research are to determine whether an 8-week outpatient supervised PR-min programme is non-inferior to a standard 8-week outpatient supervised PR-gym programme in terms of health benefits for patients with chronic respiratory disease.</p>
                <p>The primary objective is to determine whether PR-min is non-inferior to PR-gym regarding change in exercise capacity measured using ISW<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> distance from baseline (visit 1) to post-PR assessment at 8 weeks (visit 2).</p>
                <p>The secondary objectives are to: (1) determine whether PR-min is non-inferior to PR-gym regarding changes breathlessness (CRQ-D), health-related quality of life (CRQ) and quadriceps strength (isometric quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction) from baseline (visit 1) to post-PR assessment at 8 weeks (visit 2) and from baseline (visit 1) to 12 months after the baseline assessment (visit 3); (2) evaluate the trial process by recording the participant recruitment and retention, participant uptake of PR, PR attendance, PR completion, reasons for PR non-completion and participant satisfaction in each arm of the study, at the appropriate stage of the trial; (3) estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness during the trial period.</p>

                <p>Randomisation by minimisation will ensure that participant characteristics are balanced between the groups with respect to previous completion of PR (yes/no), multiple deprivation index (most deprived quintile of index: yes/no<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and frailty status (Short Physical Performance Battery score &lt;10/≥10.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A proportion of patients will be entered initially using simple randomisation in order to create a level of initial imbalance and the minimisation algorithm will maintain a level of randomness in order to preserve prerandomisation allocation concealment. Once randomised, the system will automatically generate a full audit trail of the process and send email to relevant investigators in a blinded or unblinded format, depending on their role. For each arm, participants will be provided with a choice of three sites in northwest London to undertake PR.</p>
                <p>Owing to the nature of the interventions, participants and providers of the intervention will not be blinded.

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>Previous audits of Harefield PR Unit have shown that in participants undergoing PR-gym achieve a mean (SD) change in ISW of 58 (67) m. The null hypothesis is that PR-min is inferior to the standard treatment PR-gym. The alternative hypothesis is that PR-min is not inferior to PR-gym. The non-inferiority margin will be defined as half the known MCID using the fixed-margin method with a preserved effect of 50% as recommended by previous guidance, including from the United States Food and Drug Administration.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> The MCID of the ISW is 47.5 m,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and therefore 24 m will be considered the non-inferiority margin. If there is truly no difference between PR-min and PR-gym, then a minimum of 246 patients (123 in each group) is required to be 80% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 97.5% CI (or equivalently a 95% two-sided CI) will be above the non-inferiority limit of −24 m. Based on audit data, we anticipate 32% dropout from PR (12% from assessment to starting PR and 20% from starting PR to completing PR). Taking into account dropout, the original minimum sample size required for analysis was 362 patients (181 patients per group). However, owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the study (described in the Amendment section), the study sample size was increased by a further 74–436 (218 patients per group).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>For baseline data, continuous and categorical variables will be summarised with descriptive statistics. No significance testing will be carried out. The outcome measures will be described by trial arm and at visits 1, 2 and 3 using descriptive statistics.</p>
                <p>The main statistical analyses will estimate the difference in mean primary and secondary outcomes between patients randomised to PR-gym and PR-min by intention to treat principle from visit 1 to visit 2 (8 weeks following visit 1) and visit 1 to visit 3 (12 months following visit 1). Group difference estimates and associated one-sided 97.5% CI will be reported. The group differences will be compared using one-sided two independent sample t-test or non-parametric equivalent. The significance level is set at one-sided significance level of 0.025.</p>
                <p>Regarding missing data, the number of baseline variables with complete data will be reported and the primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed as per the recommendations of White <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Missing postrandomisation assessments will be dealt with using an appropriate method of imputation, depending on the missing mechanism.</p>
                <p>Adherence is defined as the number of supervised sessions the participant attends irrespective of the assigned intervention (maximum 16). This will be recorded in both intervention arms. As a dichotomous indicator with eight as the cut-off. The following variables will be recorded in a 3×2 table according to allocated intervention: (1) compliers always receive the allocated treatment; (2) complete defiers do the opposite of the allocated treatment, that is, attend no sessions in allocated treatment; (3) partial defiers are all others not falling in the above groups. Dropout cause will be recorded using the MORECARE classification of reason for attrition.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>In addition to the primary intention-to-treat analysis, the effect of actually receiving treatment as defined in the protocol will also be estimated. If non-compliance rate with PR sessions is &gt;10%, a Complier-Average Causal-Effect (CACE) will be estimated.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The following sensitivity analyses are planned: (1) per protocol; (2) including only those in the upper quartile for baseline ISW; (3) complete case; (4) complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) analysis<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and (5) primary diagnosis of COPD; (6) a generalised estimating equation-based analysis to estimate the treatment effects, adjusting for imbalance if the group difference in the percentage of smokers, participants age &lt;70 years, or females is greater than 20% at baseline.</p>

                <p>Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic the study was suspended for 13 months between February 2020 and 2021 and, at the date of study suspension, there were 74 recruited and randomised participants waiting to start PR but were unable to receive either intervention due to the pandemic. Accordingly, a substantial amendment to increase the sample size from 362 to 436 and extend the recruitment and follow-up periods by 1 year to 31 March 2022 and 2023, respectively, was submitted to the funders (National Institute for Health Research), the Health Research Authority and research ethics committee on 5 February 2021. These amendments were approved on 24 February 2021.</p>

              <p>We will use a broad strategy to maximise dissemination of our findings: (1) sharing of scientific findings via open-access publication in high impact journals and presentation at international meetings; (2) plain English summaries of findings for public bodies and web-sites (eg, NIHR, CLARHC, British Lung Foundation, patient.co.uk) to communicate evidence through a user-friendly interface; (3) online pages about the project on websites of contributing organisations (Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, Cicely Saunders Institute, King’s College London); (4) social media (eg, Twitter); (5) public engagement via talks with service user groups and open public events, so patients and their caregivers can learn about the research; (6) direct sharing of findings with public bodies (eg, National Horizon Scanning Research and Intelligence Centre) and policy makers to whom the applicants have direct access (eg, BTS Pulmonary Rehabilitation Advisory Group, European Respiratory Society, American Thoracic Society, Society for Research in Rehabilitation) to facilitate uptake of findings into research strategy and policy; (7) education of commissioners to influence future NHS service delivery.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PR is a core strategy in the management for COPD and other chronic respiratory disorders.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The majority of evidence to support PR has come from trials conducted in locations that use specialist exercise equipment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Data from a national audit indicate that many PR programmes in England and Wales do not have access to specialist exercise equipment with exercise training completed using simple equipment.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is a paucity of robust literature examining the efficacy of PR-min and to our knowledge, there have been no trials comparing supervised centre-based PR-min and PR-gym. One observational study demonstrated that PR-min is non-inferior to PR-gym in terms of exercise capacity and health-related quality of life but indicated that further investigation using a randomised controlled trial is required.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, this study aims to bridge the gap in knowledge by identifying whether PR-min is non-inferior to PR-gym regarding change in core PR outcome measures. This is an important and current health service question given the increasing disparity between supply and demand of PR that has implications for the delivery and future development of this programme at national and international levels.</p>
              <p>The strengths of this study include the design: a parallel, two-group, assessor-blinded and statistician-blinded, non-inferiority randomised trial which is the appropriate design to assess the primary and secondary outcome measures. The intervention, PR, is delivered according to national guidelines and the population of interest is people with chronic respiratory disease, both of which mean the results will be generalisable. In addition, study involves a 12-month follow-up period (from visit 1) to evaluate the long-term effect of the intervention and a health-economic analysis which aims to understand the potential cost-effectiveness of the trial which may have implications for the NHS and Clinical Commissioning Groups. A limitation of the study is that it is a single-centre study based in northwest London which may mean that the findings may not be generalisable to other populations in different locations.</p>
