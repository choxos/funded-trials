                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is recommended by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence as the first-line imaging tool for diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Reporting WB-MRI scans requires expertise to interpret and can be challenging for radiologists who need to meet rapid turn-around requirements. Automated computational tools based on machine learning (ML) could assist the radiologist in terms of sensitivity and reading speed and would facilitate improved accuracy, productivity and cost-effectiveness. The MALIMAR study aims to develop and validate a ML algorithm to increase the diagnostic accuracy and reading speed of radiological interpretation of WB-MRI compared with standard methods.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This phase II/III imaging trial will perform retrospective analysis of previously obtained clinical radiology MRI scans and scans from healthy volunteers obtained prospectively to implement training and validation of an ML algorithm. The study will comprise three project phases using approximately 633 scans to (1) train the ML algorithm to identify active disease, (2) clinically validate the ML algorithm and (3) determine change in disease status following treatment via a quantification of burden of disease in patients with myeloma. Phase 1 will primarily train the ML algorithm to detect active myeloma against an expert assessment (‘reference standard’). Phase 2 will use the ML output in the setting of radiology reader study to assess the difference in sensitivity when using ML-assisted reading or human-alone reading. Phase 3 will assess the agreement between experienced readers (with and without ML) and the reference standard in scoring both overall burden of disease before and after treatment, and response.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is strong evidence in the existing literature for the use of whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) in the management of patients with multiple myeloma. In 2016, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) made the recommendation of using WB-MRI as the first-line imaging tool for diagnosis, based on the literature.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A consensus from the International Myeloma Working Group agreed that identification of focal lesions more than 5 mm on MRI should now be used as an indication to treat.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Evidence suggests that diffusion-weighted (DW) WB-MRI (WB-DW-MRI) is the most sensitive magnetic resonance technique for detecting marrow disease<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–8</xref> and superior to fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT for the detection of small sites of disease and diffuse infiltration.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Therefore, WB-MRI is increasingly being adopted at centres worldwide for patients with myeloma. Treatment of high-risk patients is known to improve overall survival,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> therefore improved diagnostic accuracy is likely to translate into improved patient selection for treatment and prolonged survival.</p>
              <p>Despite the acknowledged benefits of WB-MRI for patients with myeloma, with publication of the NICE guidance, one of the major concerns is how these complex scans can be reported by a radiology workforce in crisis. Specificity of disease detection in the marrow is improved by viewing source DW images alongside quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. This allows differentiation of active sites of disease with restricted diffusion from treated sites of disease and vertebral haemangiomas, which conversely return a very high ADC.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Dixon images are also integral to image interpretation and morphological imaging is also necessary to identify mechanical complications of myeloma bone disease. Therefore, diagnostic accuracy is dependent on viewing multiple imaging sequences<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and typically over 1200 image slices per WB-MRI scan in order to achieve whole body coverage. Consequently, reading time for the scans may be significant. At least 9% of UK radiology posts are unfilled,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and in 2015, clinical radiology was placed on the national shortage occupation list. The time-consuming process of reporting WB-MRI scans is a concern for radiologists who need to provide rapid turn around with a high productivity to support the National Health Service (NHS). Automated computational tools based on machine learning (ML) could support reporting of these large data sets and facilitate translation of this valuable imaging technique into the NHS, not only in detecting active disease but also in identifying response to treatment. Ideally, an ML algorithm would automatically detect and highlight suspicious regions and could reduce reading time. An accurate and automatic detection of pathology may also increase diagnostic accuracy.</p>
              <p>The possibility of using computer-assisted ML techniques has been considered in aiding interpretation of complex imaging data sets.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> Current work in the EME NIHR (Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation National Institute of Health Research) funded MALIBO study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> (13/122/01) has demonstrated fully automatic multiorgan segmentation using WB-MRI in healthy volunteers (HV) and ML detection of primary colorectal cancer and metastatic lesions.</p>

                <title>Aim</title>
                <p>The aim of the MALIMAR study is to develop and validate an ML algorithm to improve the sensitivity of radiologists to detect the presence and extent of active myeloma before and after treatment, with high reproducibility and reduced reading time (WB-MRI with ML, the intervention) when compared with the standard of care radiology read (WB-MRI without ML support, the comparator).</p>

                    <p>In phase 1, the ML algorithm will be trained using both HV and myeloma patient scans to recognise active myeloma deposits as distinct from cases with no active disease, classifying disease as ‘focal’, ‘diffuse’ or ‘inactive’.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>In phase 2, the ML algorithm will be validated using a second unseen data set against a reference standard (ie, ground truth) to assess how accurately radiologists classify disease using scans with the ML algorithm and compared with readings without ML. Diagnostic accuracy on a per patient and per region (using 16 predefined anatomical sites—<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) basis and reading time will be measured.</p>

Up to 50 HVs aged 40 years or above will be recruited using approved advertisements at the Sponsor site and consented with the help of clinical research network (CRN) resources (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1a</xref> for consent form). The HV information sheet (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1b</xref>) will clearly explain the MRI scanning procedure and the actions that will be taken in the event of incidental (ie, unexpected) findings.

HV scans will be classified as normal (ie, non-diseased). Scans will be allocated to Phase one or two as per <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>. To minimise bias or ‘over-learning’, no more than five scans from the same patient will be allocated to Phase 1. Phase two scans will not include any patient scans that have been used in Phase one and thus comprise only those previously unseen by the ML algorithm. A subset of scans from phase 1 and 2 will be used to further train the algorithm at the start of Phase 3. Phase three validation scans have previously been acquired for the iTTiM trial (NCT02403102) and include a unique series of paired scans, previously unseen by the ML algorithm.</p>

This will ensure that the ML algorithm is able to interpret all scans consistently. Curation scripts will be written in python and ensure that scans exhibit consistent characteristics such as: correct sequential display of images, no missing slices, noting presence of unusual artefacts that might interrupt ML reads and other factors which might compromise interpretation. Further details on the data curation will be published elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>Phase 1 scans will then be manually segmented into 16 bone regions (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) using a boundary box approach.

                  <p>Phase 2 scans will be subjected to the ML algorithm, which will provide an ML overlay on all scans, indicating areas of disease by means of a heat map. For each scan, a ‘standard’ and ‘ML’ version will be available. The trial statistician will randomly allocate reads to each of the (approximately 15–20) readers, using trial-specific algorithms written using Stata software (StataCorp, Texas). The reads will be performed in two batches to incorporate a wash-out period. Each batch will have 50% of cases with ML support and 50% without, to avoid reader training bias. The reading process will be described in a reader manual and all readers will receive appropriate training in viewing scans using the Biotronics 3D web-based platform and completing a Read CRF available via Microsoft Forms (see <xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 3a</xref>). In the case of ‘inexperienced’ readers, training will comprise a review of the CRFs and the viewing software with a basic training on reporting lexicon. A scribe will be provided to assist readers during the reading process and input data to the CRF in each batch of reads. Following a 4-week wash out period, readers will be presented with the second batch of reads with the opposite reading paradigm with regards to the ML support. The same cases will be allocated to the same readers. A subset of approximately 50 scans will be read a second time by a different reader as an inter-rater check.</p>

Reads will again be randomly allocated to the readers by the trial statistician. Readers will follow similar procedures to that outlined above with one set of paired scans having the ML overlay and the other with no ML overlay (for CRF, see <xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 3b</xref>).

                  <p>We will train the ML algorithm on a set of scans without and with active disease that will reflect the categories of disease that may be encountered in clinical practice.

                  <p>In a meta-analysis, Wu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> have reported a pooled sensitivity of 88% and a pooled specificity of 86% (0.86 for WB-MRI with DW-MRI).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We anticipate that the addition of ML could increase this by at least 7.5%, from 88% to 95.5%. There is no background data to indicate the expected proportion of discordant pairs, so we have estimated this as (1–0.955)×0.88+0.955×(1–0.88), which is equal to 0.154. To achieve 80% power using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 would require a total of 203 patients positive for myeloma using the gold standard.</p>
                  <p>If it is assumed that the specificity will be unchanged using ML, a total number of cases with no active disease of 150 (50 HV, 100 inactive treated myeloma) will give 80% power to show that the difference is above a non-inferiority limit of 10%.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study aims to develop and validate an ML algorithm to augment the performance and efficiency of the radiology reading process using WB-MRI. The results will show the impact of using the ML tool and outcomes of the study will have implications for the application of ML with WB-MRI in patients with patients across the NHS. It is anticipated that feasibility analysis will follow the successful completion of this study to pilot the implementation of the ML tool in a real-time prospective study prior to future clinical setting.</p>
              <p>To avoid bias, we ensure: (1) comparator and intervention tests are read by readers that are fully blinded to the reference standard, (2) a mixture of cases with and without disease, (3) the reads will be presented such that radiologists must read a mixture of cases without or with ML support during each round of reading including a wash out period. We will have unavoidable incorporation bias, as the expert reference panel will use the MRI as part of the reference standard. The reference panel will consist of a single person’s opinion, which is a limitation to our study. If resources had allowed, the gold standard would have been to have two blinded opinions with a consensus panel in cases of disagreement. Other limitations include varying scan quality as data are acquired over a 9-year period; and replicating clinical reporting in a retrospective study setting can be challenging.</p>
              <p>In conducting this study, we will have acquired possibly the largest set of characterised myeloma patient MRI scans in the UK and we anticipate that this will form the basis of a unique training resource in the future.</p>
              <p>ML techniques in WB-MRI scans of patients with myeloma are likely to be transferable to other malignancies. In prostate and breast cancer, quantification of metastatic bone disease is an unmet need as bone only disease is not uncommon and is currently classified as non-measurable by RECIST V.1.1.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The participating HVs will be consented to allow the anonymised datasets to be a future resource for the wider research community.</p>
