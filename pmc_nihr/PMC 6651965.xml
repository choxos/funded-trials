                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Almost one-half of 12–15 year olds living in deprived areas of the UK have dental caries (tooth decay) with few oral health promotion programmes aimed at children of this age. Mobile phone-based interventions such as short messaging service (SMS) interventions have been found effective at changing certain behaviours and improving health outcomes. This protocol describes the BRIGHT Trial, investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a behaviour change intervention—classroom-based session (CBS) embedded in the curriculum and a series of SMS delivered to participants twice daily to remind them to brush their teeth, compared to usual curriculum and no SMS—to reduce the prevalence of dental caries in young people from deprived areas.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This is a school-based, assessor-blinded, two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot trial. Overall, the trial will involve approximately 5040 11–13 year olds in 42 schools with a 3-year follow-up. The trial will take place in secondary schools in England, Scotland and Wales. The primary outcome is the presence of carious lesions in permanent teeth at 3 years. Secondary outcomes are: number of carious teeth, frequency of twice-daily toothbrushing, plaque levels, gingivitis, child health-related quality of life and oral health-related quality of life. A cost-utility analysis will be conducted.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">Untreated dental caries (tooth decay) is the most prevalent condition worldwide, affecting 2.4 billion people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The consequences for children include pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], loss of sleep, problems with eating and speaking and time off school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dental caries has a significant impact on young people’s daily lives with around 50% of 12–15 year olds reporting toothache and around one-quarter of 12–15 year olds reporting difficulty eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dental caries can also affect the general health and quality of life of children, interfering with nutrition, school attendance and school performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent systematic review found children with one or more decayed teeth had a higher probability of poor school performance and poor school attendance than children free of obvious caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Dental caries affects an average of one in three 12 year olds in the UK and although it affects all parts of society, it shows a positive, linear association with deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In 2013 in England, 32% of 12 year olds experienced dental caries and required treatment, ranging from 46% of those eligible for free school meals (FSM) to 30% of those ineligible. For 15 year olds 44% required treatment, 59% of those eligible for FSM and 43% of those ineligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Treating oral diseases is expensive, costing NHS England £3.4 billion annually. Children’s tooth extractions alone, carried out under general anaesthesia, and as a result of dental caries, costs an estimated £36 million annually in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">The use of fluoridated toothpaste is considered to have been largely responsible for the dramatic reduction in the levels of dental caries from a mean of 8.4 decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in 1973 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] to 1.4 in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Brushing with fluoridated toothpaste is one of the most highly effective preventive measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Observational studies have shown current levels of efficacy, frequency and duration of toothbrushing to be inadequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], increasing the risk of dental caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">Mobile health (mHealth) describes multimedia technologies that interface with healthcare delivery and are supported by mobile devices, almost exclusively mobile phones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In 2017, 86% of 12–15 year olds in the UK owned a mobile phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], providing the potential to deliver large-scale health behaviour change interventions. While young people of lower socio-economic status are subject to inequality in access and use of health services, research suggests they have equivalent mobile phone access to their more affluent peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Short messaging service (SMS) are short text messages sent from computers, phones or other mobile devices usually to phones and are the most widely studied mHealth interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">A recent systematic review of preventive health behaviour change SMS interventions found a small but statistically significant weighted mean effect size for the impact of SMS on preventive health behaviour change (d = 0.24) with positive effect of SMS interventions in 11 of the 35 included studies, with a further 13 studies having mixed effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The key features of SMS interventions include duration, tailoring, targeting of the content and how SMS are used along with other activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The duration of interventions typically ranged from 1 to 66 weeks with a median duration of 12 weeks. There was some suggestion that interventions lasting 6–12 months were associated with greater effects than shorter interventions. The frequency of messages varied from five times per day to once a month depending on the expected frequency of the targeted behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The limitations of existing studies included a lack of a specified theoretical framework, insufficient power to detect change, only short-term follow-up after the end of the intervention, low retention rates and failure to blind assessors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It was recommended that future studies ensured the intervention, including the SMS, was developed rigorously, the SMS were written to be appropriate for the target population and the SMS were tailored to individuals according to their age and gender and used the participant’s name.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Although the mobile phone has been investigated as a vehicle for health behaviour change using SMS interventions, there is a paucity of research with adolescents and involving oral health behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One recent study, of unemployed young people aged 18–24 years in New Zealand, investigated the Keep on Brushing (KOB) programme of weekly SMS and free toothbrushes/toothpaste, seeking to boost motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The KOB intervention was underpinned by the Health Belief Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This study was conducted in a branch of the New Zealand Government’s employment and beneficiary services and 171 participants were recruited and completed a baseline survey and then received a series of motivational SMS over 10 weeks. Self-reported toothbrushing frequency was the primary outcome measure. Other socio-demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, employment status) and method-specific (level of attrition, distribution of successful text messages deliveries, active withdrawal) variables were also collected. Self-reported toothbrushing of twice or more per day increased from 51% at baseline to 70% at week 3, 74% at week 6, and 73% at week 9. No important differences were noted between ages, gender or ethnic groups, although attrition was relatively high with only 26% participating by week 9. The authors concluded that motivational SMS improved the self-reported oral health of this hard-to-reach group and suggested a randomised controlled trial including a longer intervention with tailoring of the messages was needed.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The aim of this study is to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a SMS behaviour change programme to improve the oral health of young people living in deprived areas.</p>

The research team and schools will then be informed of which year group has been allocated to receive the BRIGHT intervention and which has been assigned to the control arm. Since the statistician performing the allocation and the teams recruiting the schools are completely separate, and the allocation schedule cannot be known to anyone but the statistician in advance of randomisation, allocation concealment is assured.</p>

The intervention consists of two components: (1) a CBS delivered by teachers in the schools’ curricula followed by (2) a series of twice-daily SMS to mobile phones. The intervention meets the Medical Research Council definition of a complex intervention in terms of the interactions between components and the difficulty of behaviours required by those receiving the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The control group will not receive the CBS or SMS messages. The KOB intervention has been refined to be more acceptable to young people and informed by recent behaviour change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par83">The University of Dundee and York Trials Unit (YTU) at University of York will act as the data controllers for this study. All information collected during the course of the trial will be kept strictly confidential. YTU and the regional sites will comply with all aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 applicable in the UK from May 2018.

                    <title>Sample size</title>
                    <p id="Par86">The estimated proportion of UK 12 year olds with caries is 32%, with estimates of 46% for those eligible for FSM and 30% for those not eligible for FSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Based on a systematic review of interventions for caries prevention to increase the frequency of toothbrushing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], an absolute reduction in the proportion of young people with caries of 8% might be expected with this intervention. An individually randomised trial powered at 90% (5% two-sided α) to detect a reduction in the proportion of young people with caries from 32% to 24% would require a sample size of 1320. Since this is a cluster trial, this figure needs to be inflated to account for the correlation of the outcomes within schools, as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Few estimates of a school-level ICC are available for dental data. In a previous study evaluating a behaviour change programme for preventing dental caries in primary schools, an ICC of 0.01 was used, which was estimated using their own unpublished data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]; a more conservative ICC of 0.02 has been chosen for this trial.</p>
                    <p id="Par87">Additionally, since randomisation is taking place at the level of the year group, and not at the school-level, there is the potential for some contamination (e.g. pupils in the year group assigned to the control arm receiving information about the intervention from pupils in the other participating year group assigned to receive the intervention). There is an argument to therefore increase the sample size further to account for some level of contamination, which has the potential to dilute the treatment effect. We have assumed only partial contamination effects (i.e. those contaminated gain half the treatment benefits as it is unlikely that any pupil in the control group would receive all the intervention) for 27% of the control group pupils (based on findings from the internal pilot phase of the trial). In total, 40 schools are required assuming within-school (year group level randomisation), an average of 60 pupils per year group, an ICC of 0.02, and 20% pupil-level attrition at follow-up. This would give us 90% power (5% two-sided α) to detect an 8% absolute reduction, from 32% to 24%, in the proportion of pupils with caries. An attrition rate of 20% was estimated as the pupils will continue to be at school for the duration of the trial so it will be possible to reach and engage with them through the school and in an environment they recognise as educational and supporting their interests. Overall, 42 schools will be recruited to allow for the potential that a small number of schools may withdraw.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par88">All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis, including all randomised young people in the groups to which their year group was allocated irrespective of deviations based on non-compliance, unless otherwise stated. Data from the internal pilot will be used in all analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par89">The primary analysis will compare the proportion of young people with any treated or untreated caries in permanent teeth at 2 and 3 years between the intervention and control groups using a repeated measures binary logistic multilevel model, with the primary time-point of interest at 3 years. The model will control for presence or absence of caries at baseline, year group, time and an interaction between treatment and time as fixed effect covariates. Pupils and school will be included as random effects (to allow for clustering of data within each pupil (over time) and school). Cohen’s kappa coefficient will be used to measure the intra-examiner agreement of presence of carious lesions at ICDAS code 4–6 for 5% of participants who will be examined twice at a particular time point.</p>
                <p id="Par90">A subgroup analysis will be conducted looking at participants with baseline caries by including presence or absence of caries at baseline in an interaction with treatment group in the primary model. The hypothesis is that young people with caries at baseline are more likely to have caries at follow-up than those who do not have caries at baseline.</p>
                <p id="Par91">Secondary analyses will compare self-reported twice-daily brushing frequency at 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years using a repeated measures binary logistic multilevel model. Continuous measures (Plaque Index Gingival Index of Löe), mean number of bleeding gingival sites per child and CARIES-QC will be analysed using a covariance pattern model. Other secondary outcomes will be analysed using appropriate regression techniques.</p>

This will estimate the mean differences in costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each pathway. The cost-utility analysis will be conducted in line with current recommendations from NICE. In particular, an NHS and Personal Social Services perspective will be taken for costs, and health benefits will be quantified using QALYs. The longer term cost-effectiveness will be modelled to estimate the longer term resource use and HRQoL implications of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par93">QALYs will be estimated using the CHU9D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] reported at baseline and annually thereafter. The CHU9D will be valued using published population tariff values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], allowing QALYs to be estimated for each arm using the trapezium rule to calculate the area under the curve.NHS resource use will be measured for each participant at baseline and annually up to 36 months. This will include all medication costs (e.g. antibiotics) and visits to dental practices for treatment and health services (e.g. referral to specialists in paediatric dentistry, dental admission for a general anaesthetic) using the parent resource use questionnaire.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par105">This trial is the result of a commissioned call in November 2015 by the National Institute for Health Research, Health Technology Assessment Programme, asking the question: “What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a digital behaviour change programme to improve oral health in deprived young people?” The trial was commissioned on the basis of the findings from a study in New Zealand where an increase in self-reported toothbrushing in young adults resulted from the use of a series of motivational SMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The authors concluded that motivational SMS improved self-reported oral health and further research was needed. They suggested an RCT that included a longer intervention with tailoring of the messages. The protocol for this trial meets the commissioning brief and has used evidence and theory to design a deliverable trial evaluating a complex intervention (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par106">This trial is the first school-based RCT of an mHealth intervention targeting oral health behaviour in adolescents. A number of interventions have been influential in reducing caries in younger children but adolescents are an often neglected group who also experience the impact of dental caries on their daily lives and into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. There has been an increased interest in the use of digital technology for health improvement with adolescents given the potential to deliver large-scale health behaviour change interventions and the ubiquity of mobile phone use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The results of this study will help to inform evidence-based practice for mHealth interventions aimed at improving oral health. The study will also address limitations of existing studies in that it will have sufficient power to detect change, includes a 3-year follow-up period and dental assessors will be blinded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par107">The variety of comprehensive and validated clinical and child-centred measures in this trial is a strength which will help the findings to be compared to, and possibly combined with, other trials investigating interventions to improve children’s oral health. We are looking at the veracity of the self-reported measure of toothbrushing by using two proxy clinical objective indicators (clinically assessed plaque and gingivitis measures using validated tools). Additionally, HRQoL and OHRQoL will be assessed using self-reported data from young people using validated child-centred questionnaires.</p>
              <p id="Par108">Other strengths of the trial include its being conducted across three of the four nations (England, Scotland and Wales), which increases the generalisability of the findings within the UK education systems. We have worked with secondary schools to ensure the intervention fits within the curricula around health and well-being. The SMS message delivery system used can be automated should future roll-out be indicated.</p>
              <p id="Par109">While a further strength of the study is the focus of the recruitment of schools with above the national average percentage of pupils eligible for FSM, this does create challenges. These schools may have limited capacity to cope with the demands of involvement in a RCT while also demonstrating educational improvement of their pupils. For this reason schools judged as having serious weaknesses were excluded.</p>
              <p id="Par110">One of the limitations of this trial is the risk of contamination within schools between one participating year group and the other. We investigated this within the internal pilot trial and found that 27% of the control group pupils had potentially received some of the intervention messages. However, it is highly unlikely that all 27% received the full intervention effect (i.e. received the classroom based session and be receiving bi-daily SMS toothbrushing reminders). The sample size calculation accounts for the possibility of partial contamination effects (i.e. those contaminated gain half the treatment benefits) for 27% of the control group.</p>
              <p id="Par111">If the findings of the trial show that the intervention is effective, this will inform policy to encourage embedding of the intervention into school curricula and the adoption into guidance produced by departments of education and public health and dental organisations.</p>

              <p>A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) has been formed and includes an independent chair and other independent members, such as a statistician, health economist and patient public involvement representatives. Sponsor and funder representatives are also included in this committee as observers. Other members of the research team may attend meetings as and when necessary. The TSC will provide an overall supervision of the trial and ensure that the study is conducted according to the protocol and within the overarching ethical framework through its independent chair. Members will also provide advice outside these meetings according to their area of expertise at key stages via email, phone or, if needed, face-to-face.</p>
