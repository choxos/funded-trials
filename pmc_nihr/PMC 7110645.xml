                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is offered to all patients with a psychosis diagnosis. However, only a minority of psychosis patients in England and Wales are offered CBTp. This is attributable, in part, to the resource-intensive nature of CBTp. One response to this problem has been the development of CBTp in brief formats that are targeted at a single symptom and the mechanisms that maintain distress. We have developed a brief form of CBTp for distressing voices and reported preliminary evidence for its effectiveness when delivered by highly trained therapists (clinical psychologists). This study will investigate the delivery of this intervention by a cost-effective workforce of assistant psychologists following a brief training and evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of conducting a future, definitive, randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a feasibility study for a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel-group, superiority 1:1:1 RCT comparing a Guided self-help CBT intervention for voices and treatment as usual (GiVE) to Supportive Counselling and treatment as usual (SC) to treatment as usual alone (TAU), recruiting across two sites, with blinded post-treatment and follow-up assessments. A process evaluation will quantitatively and qualitatively explore stakeholder experience.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Expected outcomes will include an assessment of the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT, and data to inform the calculation of its sample size. If evidence from a subsequent, fully powered RCT suggests that GiVE is clinically and cost-effective when delivered by briefly trained assistant psychologists, CBTp offered in these less resource-intensive forms has the potential to generate benefits for individual patients (reduced distress, enhanced recovery and enhanced quality of life), service-level patient benefit (increased access to evidence-based psychological therapies) and economic benefits to the NHS (in terms of the reduced use of mental health inpatient services).</p>

              <title>Introduction {6a}</title>
              <p id="Par31">Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has robust evidence for clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to promote the recovery of psychosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, implementation in the UK is extremely poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with only 26% of psychosis patients being offered CBTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The most consistently reported barrier to implementation is insufficient resources, including a lack of trained therapists with dedicated time to deliver CBTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">The Department of Health’s Forward View for Mental Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and Long Term Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] include a commitment to increase access to evidence-based psychological therapies for patients with psychosis. However, future investments in additional trained therapists with dedicated time to deliver CBTp are unlikely to be made on a large enough scale to significantly and comprehensively increase access to CBTp in the near future. Consequently, additional strategies for increasing access may be required, including a reduction in the resources required to deliver CBTp.</p>
              <p id="Par33">NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] recommend research into two issues that could potentially reduce the resources required to deliver CBTp. Firstly, the duration of CBTp – how many sessions are required to generate sufficient benefit? Our meta-analysis of 10 controlled studies indicated that CBTp delivered over less than the recommended 16 sessions is effective in reducing psychosis symptoms when delivered by trained therapists (typically clinical psychologists) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This focus upon shorter forms of CBTp has recently been taken forward through the development of single-symptom therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] which target only one specific psychotic symptom, with some promising early results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sepsychosis patients and the NHS.condly, the ability of ‘briefly trained’ practitioners to deliver CBTp – can CBTp be delivered by a more cost effective alternative workforce (i.e. not highly trained therapists)? Evidence to date suggests that case managers cannot fulfil this role as outcomes from trials have been inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and there are competing demands upon their time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Psychology graduates, however, are well-positioned to undertake such a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as there is a large number of psychology graduates in the UK, the USA and elsewhere; their degree provides them with training in psychological models of emotion and behaviour; and they can be readily employed in assistant psychologist (AP) roles at lower cost than more specialist therapists.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Our response to the questions posed by NICE was to develop a brief form of CBTp targeted at distressing voices. We collaborated with Lived Experience Consultants to turn our self-help CBT book (Overcoming Distressing Voices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) into a Guided self-help CBT intervention package (GiVE) supported by a workbook. Our first step was to demonstrate the validity and viability of the GiVE intervention package, confirming that it can be delivered by expert therapists with benefits for patients. We conducted a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of GiVE compared to usual care (<italic>N</italic> = 28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Results were encouraging with high levels of retention within the study (96%), and a very large between-groups effect for the pre-determined primary outcome of negative voice impact (<italic>d</italic> = 1.78) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">Our second step within this current study will be to assess the feasibility of conducting a RCT to evaluate the outcomes of GiVE when it is delivered by briefly trained APs. If found to be feasible, the definitive RCT will form the third step within our programme of research. If GiVE is found to be clinically and cost-effective in a future definitive RCT when delivered by APs, it could substantially increase the number of psychosis patients who are able to access CBTp, which will generate benefits for psychosis patients and the NHS.</p>

              <title>Objectives {7}</title>
              <p id="Par37">The long-term aim of this programme of research is to increase access to CBTp for psychosis patients. This aim will be achieved if a brief and targeted CBTp intervention delivered by a less costly workforce of briefly trained APs is found to be clinically and cost-effective.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The specific aim of the current study is to explore the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of GiVE delivered by APs. A process evaluation, using mixed methods and drawing on Normalisation Process Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], will be used to explore mechanisms and contextual factors that may affect the future uptake and implementation of the intervention, in both research and clinical contexts.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Specifically, this feasibility study aims to assess: (1) the acceptability of the brief and targeted intervention to clinicians (will they refer patients to the study?); (2) the acceptability of the brief and targeted intervention to patients (can patients be recruited and retained, and what are their experiences of the intervention?); and (3) the ability of APs to adhere to the therapy and clinical supervision protocols. We will also estimate the standard deviation of outcomes in order to facilitate a sample size calculation for use within a definitive trial.</p>

Time 1 and 2 assessments will be conducted by a researcher who is blind to group allocation. Adherence to the therapy protocol will be assessed by APs after each session. AP competence will be assessed by independent raters reviewing a random selection of early, middle- and late-recorded sessions.</p>
              <p id="Par42">A mixed-methods process evaluation drawing upon Normalisation Process Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] will be used to capture participants’, clinicians’ and APs’ experiences of the study and the interventions (GiVE and SC), and their views on the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of GiVE within routine psychosis care pathways. The results will be used to develop logic models for a future definitive trial and for NHS implementation.</p>

                  <p id="Par63">After an introductory session on coping, the intervention will cover three core modules: (1) beliefs about the self, (2) beliefs about voices and (3) relationships. Modules (1) and (2) draw upon psychoeducation and cognitive behavioural strategies to help participants to re-evaluate their negative or unhelpful beliefs related to the self and voices. Module (3) additionally involves work on how to relate to others and voices more assertively. GiVE will be delivered over eight sessions offered over a maximum of 16 weeks. Sessions may be delivered in NHS clinics, participants’ own homes and other community locations as preferred and appropriate. Each session will last for up to 1 h, and sessions will be held weekly where possible (16 weeks are given for the eight sessions to allow for periods of absence, illness, holidays, etc.). Participants in the GiVE arm will continue to receive their usual treatment throughout their participation in the study.</p>

It will be delivered over the same number and duration of sessions as GiVE, with the aim of matching the duration of total therapist contact time across both arms. SC will offer a supportive and non-judgemental space for the discussion of topics and issues determined by the participant. The SC therapy protocol contains specific guidance for the AP on how to respond to participant disclosure of distressing voices in a manner that does not provide specific intervention strategies.</p>

                  <p id="Par66">The same APs will deliver GiVE and SC in order to minimise the influence of therapist effects; for example, differing levels of therapist competence. They will receive a 5-day training in GiVE and SC (one introductory day, 2 days on GiVE and 2 days on SC), delivered by experienced clinical psychologists and an experienced counselling psychologist, respectively. Weekly clinical supervision will be provided by these clinical/counselling psychologists.</p>

Interested patients will be able to contact either the Research and Development Department or the research team directly and enquire about the study. They will be invited to discuss the study with their CC who can then complete a referral form. The research team could support potential participants to discuss the study with their CC if this is needed.

Completeness of data will be assessed. Variability in standard care will be explored, and the use of EQ-5D-5 L and SF-12 compared. Differences in service use between groups will be investigated for indications of potential savings associated with GiVE that might offset the intervention costs. The full range of outcomes will be investigated in a cost consequences framework and a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis conducted.</p>

These themes will be used to adapt the study design, manuals, training, supervision and intervention delivery where necessary before proceeding to a definitive trial. In addition, the qualitative data will be used to develop both: (1) a system-based logic model for the implementation of the trial and subsequent therapy; and (2) a process-based logic model of the potential mechanisms from therapy experience to outcomes. These will be further refined in the future definitive RCT.</p>

                <p id="Par112">The scientific integrity of the trial will be overseen by the TSC. The TSC will also serve the functions of a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC), as a combined TSC and DMEC is appropriate within the size and scope of the present feasibility trial, including oversight of the safety and data integrity of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par113">A separate LEAP will provide Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) oversight of the trial. The LEAP will consult at regular intervals throughout the trial (approximately six meetings in total) and will advise on issues relating to design, delivery, interpretation of findings, dissemination and preparation for a future definitive RCT. Prior to the submission of the grant application for the current study, the LEAP reviewed the differences between the training and role of clinical psychologists (who delivered GiVE in our initial pilot RCT) and APs (who will deliver GiVE in the current study) and emphasised the need for APs to have experience of working with people with psychosis. This became an essential criterion for appointment to the AP post.</p>

Adverse events will include: an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness; an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition; a condition that is detected after trial intervention administration; and continuous persistent disease or a symptom present at baseline that worsens following administration of the trial treatment – and may be expected or unexpected. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are those considered to be life-threatening, resulting in death, requiring inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, resulting in significant or persistent incapacity/disability or a birth defect or congenital abnormality. The number (events and individuals) and nature of all events (AEs and SAEs) reported to blind and unblind members of the research team will be recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par115">The period for AE reporting will be following the signing of the study consent form until last follow-up assessment 28 weeks after randomisation. All AEs will be recorded and reviewed by the chief investigator. If an AE is considered to be serious (an SAE), it will be reviewed for causality and expectedness by an independent rater and the sponsor’s representative. The TSC will be informed of the number, nature and review outcome for all SAEs and will be asked to recommend any necessary actions. SAEs will be reported to the NHS Research Ethics Committee as appropriate.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par117">CBTp is an evidence-based psychological therapy recommended for psychosis patients within the UK. However, only a minority of patients are offered CBTp. Limited resources have been cited as a prominent reason for this lack of access, leading to calls for shorter forms of CBTp to be developed that can be delivered by briefly trained therapists.</p>
              <p id="Par118">We have responded to this call by developing a brief and targeted form of CBTp for distressing voices – Guided, self-help intervention for Voices (GiVE). We have generated preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of GiVE when delivered by highly trained therapist (clinical psychologists). The next step is to evaluate the experience of stakeholders when GiVE is delivered by briefly trained therapists (APs). The current study will explore the feasibility of conducting this evaluation in the form of a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel-group, superiority 1:1:1 RCT comparing GiVE to an active control intervention (SC) and TAU.</p>
              <p id="Par119">CBTp offered in these less resource-intensive forms has the potential to generate benefits for: (1) individual patients (reduced distress and enhanced recovery and enhanced quality of life); (2) service-level patient benefit (increased access to evidence-based psychological therapies); and (3) economic benefits to the NHS (in terms of the reduced use of mental health inpatient services).</p>

              <p id="Par121">The study is sponsored by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust which will provide at least annual monitoring and audit of the trial and governance procedures. NHS Research Ethics Committee (London – Surrey, reference number 18/LO/ 2091), Health Research Authority and local Research Governance (at both sites) approval were granted before the commencement of the trial (study protocol – version 1, dated 5 November 2018 (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for approved amendments to protocol)). Participants will provide written informed consent prior to the completion of any study procedures. The sponsor played no part in study design; collection, management, analysis and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the report for publication.</p>

              <title>Competing interests {28}</title>
              <p id="Par122">There is a potential conflict of interest as some members of the research team (MH, CS and CH) are also authors on the self-help book and/or published workbook being used within the GiVE intervention. Therefore, the research team agrees to publish the results of this feasibility trial, irrespective of the findings.</p>
