                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We aimed to evaluate the safety and optimal dose of a novel inactivated whole-virus adjuvanted vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: VLA2001.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted an open-label, dose-escalation study followed by a double-blind randomized trial using low, medium and high doses of VLA2001 (1:1:1). The primary safety outcome was the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions within 7 days after vaccination. The primary immunogenicity outcome was the geometric mean titre (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 two weeks after the second vaccination. The study is registered as NCT04671017.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Between December 16, 2020, and June 3, 2021, 153 healthy adults aged 18–55 years were recruited in the UK. Overall, 81.7% of the participants reported a solicited AE, with injection site tenderness (58.2%) and headache (46.4%) being the most frequent. Only 2 participants reported a severe solicited event. Up to day 106, 131 (85.6%) participants had reported any AE. All observed incidents were transient and non-life threatening in nature. Immunogenicity measured at 2 weeks after completion of the two-dose priming schedule, showed significantly higher GMTs of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titres in the highest dose group (GMT 545.6; 95% CI: 428.1, 695.4) which were similar to a panel of convalescent sera (GMT 526.9; 95% CI: 336.5, 825.1). Seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were also significantly higher in the high-dose group (&gt;90%) compared to the other dose groups. In the high dose group, antigen-specific IFN-γ expressing T-cells reactive against the S, M and N proteins were observed in 76, 36 and 49%, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>VLA2001 was well tolerated in all tested dose groups, and no safety signal of concern was identified. The highest dose group showed statistically significantly stronger immunogenicity with similar tolerability and safety, and was selected for phase 3 clinical development.</p>

                <p id="para0011"><italic>Evidence before this study.</italic> We searched PubMed for research articles published from database inception until June 30, 2022, using the terms “COVID-19″ OR “SARS-CoV-2″ AND “vaccine” AND “inactivated”. Filters applied: Clinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial. No language and date restrictions were applied. 58 reports were identified, among which 19 described <italic>Sinovac-CoronaVac</italic> (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing, China), 7 <italic>Covilo</italic> (<italic>BBIBP-CorV</italic>, Sinopharm, Beijing, China), 4 <italic>Covaxin</italic> (<italic>BBV152,</italic> Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India), 1 <italic>WIV04</italic> (Sinopharm, Beijing, China) and <italic>HB02</italic> (Sinopharm, Beijing, China), 1 <italic>KCONVAC</italic> (Minhai Biotechnology, Beijing, China), 1 <italic>BIV1-CovIran</italic> (Shifa Pharmed, Tehran, Iran), 2 compared two or more inactivated vaccines, 10 unspecified inactivated vaccines, and 13 were not relevant to our analysis. <italic>Sinovac-CoronaVac, Covilo</italic> and <italic>Covaxin</italic> are currently granted Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization (WHO); but are not authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], nor the European Medicines Agency [EMA]. Despite their global importance, the reported safety and the immunogenicity profile of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines is lacking.</p>
                <p id="para0012"><italic>Added value of this study:</italic> We report the safety and immunogenicity profile of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001. VLA2001 induces neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19 and is well tolerated. For example, fever rates, which are commonly reported after vaccination with other COVID-19 vaccines, were below 2%. It is based on a traditional and reliable manufacturing protocol utilized also for other vaccines that have received marketing approval. This type of vaccine may prove acceptable to populations that show vaccine hesitancy towards new biotechnologies (e.g., mRNA, adenovirus vaccines). Manufacturing costs are low, the production is up-scalable and can be updated to new CoV variants. The vaccine can be stored at 2–8 °C, making it particularly suitable to be distributed around the globe.</p>
                <p id="para0013"><italic>Implications of all the available evidence:</italic> The development of safe, affordable, effective and reliable vaccines against COVID-19 that can reassure people and encourage them to get vaccinated, continues to be of great importance.</p>

              <p id="para0014">High coverage mass inoculation against SARS-CoV-2, particularly when targeted efficiently at the age and risk groups at highest risk of severe disease, can impact massively on the deaths and morbidity due to COVID-19 and the consequent social and economic damage caused by the pandemic.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Even though several vaccines, developed using novel platforms, are currently approved by western regulatory agencies EMA and FDA (e.g., <italic>Comirnaty, Spikevax, Vaxzevria, Janssen</italic>), there are some individuals and groups that have not chosen to receive them, perhaps wary of the new biotechnologies used in their development (i.e., mRNA, adenoviral vectors). Since less than a quarter of people in some low-income countries have received even a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g. only 12% in Nigeria, 21% in Ethiopia), additional efforts to increase vaccine affordability and global access are essential - COVID-19 vaccination needs to be as inclusive as possible.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>

              <p id="para0015">Historically, inactivated viral vaccines, including those against polio and influenza, have been used widely and successfully worldwide and are seen as safe, reliable and effective - including in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and immunocompromised people.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> These inactivated inoculates contain the whole virus and, in many cases, adjuvants, inducing a broader immune response than vaccines that only include one specific viral antigen. These vaccines are readily transportable and generate few logistic problems, since they can be kept refrigerated for long periods of time. With these features in mind, <italic>Valneva</italic> has developed VLA2001 – an inactivated whole-virus vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which includes a novel adjuvant.</p>
              <p id="para0016">The aim of this Phase 1/2 trial was to assess safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of VLA2001 in healthy adults, and to establish an optimal dose for the subsequent stages of clinical development.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para0018">This study is an open label, dose-escalation trial in groups of 5, followed by a double-blind randomized trial of low-, medium- and high-doses of VLA2001 in 3 planned groups of 45 subjects with a 1:1:1 allocation for the three specific dose regimes. Written informed consent was received from all participants and the trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The study was approved in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (43185/0002/001-0001) and the London, Brent ethics committee ref 20/HRA/5205.</p>
                <p id="para0019">Key exclusion criteria were acute illness, pregnancy, known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and any immunosuppressive condition or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. Full eligibility criteria are listed in the protocol (<xref rid="sec0016" ref-type="fn">Appendix 1</xref>). The study participants were enrolled from 4 study sites across the UK. The investigators at each hospital were responsible for the conduct of the study as per approved protocol and were blinded for study assignments.</p>
                <p id="para0020">Dose escalation was done at a single site to ensure permanent oversight on safety data by one Principal Investigator. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the accrued safety data at day 4 of all 15 sentinel participants. After favorable DSMB review, recruitment of the remaining participants (eventually 138 randomised) across all sites was initiated.</p>

                <title>Randomization and blinding</title>
                <p id="para0021">In the blinded trial, the participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of the dose levels of VLA2001: low-, medium-, or high-dose. The randomization code was generated by the statistician, and allocation by the trial team was done via interactive web response system assigned at the screening visit. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) was provided to the trial sites in identical packaging for all strengths of VLA2001. IMP allocation was based on an identifier linked to the randomization; and, since there was no visual difference between the doses, all trial staff and participants remained blinded to dose allocation. The randomization assignment was not to be revealed except in emergency cases where unblinding was necessary for clinical management.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para0022">The vaccination schedule consisted of two vaccinations for each study participant 21 days apart, administered by intra-muscular (IM) injection into the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. VLA2001 is an inactivated, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (0.5 mg/dose). The antigen units (AU) of the different VLA2001 dosages were evaluated and confirmed in the final product using Spike-protein ELISA: 3 AU (low-dose), 7AU (medium-dose) or 35AU (high-dose). The active substance was combined with CpG 1018 (1 mg/dose) to reach the final concentrations in 0.5 mL immediately before administration.</p>
                <p id="para0023">At baseline (visit 0), participants were physically examined and medical history was sought for any pre-existing conditions. At visit 1, prior to vaccination, any abnormal conditions were recorded and at all other study visits, any new abnormal or worsened pre-existing conditions were recorded as adverse events (AE).</p>
                <p id="para0024">To ensure safety, the first 15 participants were included into the study in an open-label, non-randomized manner following a staggered dose escalation of VLA2001. First, a single sentinel participant in the low dose treatment group received their first vaccination. After vaccination, the first participant of each dosing group was observed for the development of any acute reaction at the study site for 3 h after the vaccination procedure. The study site contacted the participant by phone approximately 24 h after vaccination to assess their safety status. The subsequent 4 participants of each successive dosing group were vaccinated with a minimum 1 h interval between each and likewise observed. After confirmation by the Investigator that no stopping criteria had been met, the study proceeded to the next dose level. The minimum observation period before initiation of vaccination at a new dose level was 48 h.</p>
                <p id="para0025">In the blinded randomized trial of the remaining participants, vaccinations were administered on days 1 and 22. Participants were asked to complete an eDiary daily for 7 days following each vaccination in which solicited local (injection-site pain, tenderness, redness, itching, swelling, and induration) and/or systemic (fever/body temperature, fatigue, headache, myalgia and nausea/vomiting) AEs, including all cases of COVID-19, were recorded throughout the study. Serious AE and AESI, including severe COVID-19 cases and immune-mediated disorders that might be caused by the adjuvant CpG1018, were collected in compliance with local requirements for SAE reporting, as well as immune-mediated disorders that might be caused by the adjuvant CpG 1018, were collected. Investigators followed all AEs and assessed likelihood of any causal relationship with study vaccines based on clinical judgement. Participants who developed any potentially COVID-19-related symptoms after randomization were requested to attend for PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 without delay if they had high fever (≥38.0 °C or ≥100.4 °F) or shortness of breath or after two consecutive days, if symptoms were milder (e.g., sore throat, chills, cough, body aches, new loss of taste or smell, runny nose, nausea, or diarrhea).</p>
                <p id="para0026">Venous blood samples were taken on days 1, 8, 22, 36 and 106. Antibody responses at these time points were measured using an immunoassay for IgG to full length Spike-protein (S-protein, Nexelis, Canada), and a live microneutralization assay MNA<sub>50</sub> against the Victoria strain performed by Public Health England (Porton Down, UK; now UK Health Security Agency and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities).<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralizing antibody were also compared to a published panel of COVID-19 convalescent sera.<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Cellular immunity against Spike-protein (S-protein), Nucleocapsid-protein (N-protein) and Membrane-protein (M-protein) were assessed at Oxford Immunotec using T-Spot Discovery SARS-CoV-2 (Oxford, UK).

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para0027">The primary safety outcome was the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions within 7 days after vaccination. Secondary safety outcomes were the frequency and severity of any adverse event throughout the study, including serious adverse events (SAEs). The primary immunogenicity outcome was the geometric mean titre (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at day 36 (2 weeks after the second vaccination). GMT of IgG SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding antibodies as well as seroconversion in terms of neutralizing and S-binding antibodies were secondary outcomes. GMT and seroconversion rates were determined at days 1, 8, 22, 36 and 106.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para0029">This was a descriptive trial and formal power calculations were not performed. It was agreed with regulators in advance that a total of 150 participants would be sufficient for initial safety evaluation, allowing for 95% confidence that an AE with a true underlying incidence of about 2% would be observed. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least a single dose of vaccine. The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the per-protocol population, which excluded any participants who received less than two vaccinations, received the wrong trial medication or fulfilled pre-defined exclusion criteria. The results for all participants were combined for analysis and reporting including those enrolled in an open label, non-randomized manner. Differences between treatment groups relating to AEs were assessed for significance using Fisher's exact test. The number and percentage of subjects with solicited injection site and systemic AEs within 7 days after vaccination along with the exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval (CI) for all AE rates were presented for each dose group and overall. Differences between the dose groups were assessed for significance using the Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test and p-values are presented for this test. GMTs (CI) were calculated by taking the antilogarithm of the mean (CI) of the log10 transformed titres. P-values were also calculated using the Kruskal Wallis test to check whether the results were significantly different among dose groups at 5% level of significance. If the test suggested significance, then a pairwise group comparison was performed using the Dwass, Steel, Critchlow-Fligner (DSCF) multiple comparisons post-hoc procedure to determine which pair of dose groups differed significantly. Secondary immunogenicity analyses included comparison of the seroconversion rates (SCRs) on days 22, 36 and 106 using the Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test. If the overall difference between groups was statistically significant (i.e., p-value for Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test was ≤0.05), then multiplicity adjusted p-values (using Hochberg method) for pairwise group differences were calculated using Fisher's exact test. Seroconversion was defined as at least a four-fold increase in GMT from baseline. Statistical analyses using SAS<sup>Ⓡ</sup> version 9.4 was performed by Valneva and were independently verified by LD using R version 4.0.2.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0046">Here, we report interim safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity results of a phase 1 safety and dose-finding vaccine trial with an initial open label sentinel dose-escalation phase, followed by a double-blind randomized phase for the whole-virus inactivated adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine, VLA2001. The vaccine was well tolerated, and no safety signals of concern were detected. The observed solicited adverse events such as injection site tenderness, pain, headache were mostly mild with rates similar to those commonly seen with other inactivated vaccines, while fever was hardly ever reported following vaccination. All of the incidents observed were transient in nature and no serious adverse events considered related to treatment were reported. These results suggest the reactogenicity profile of this vaccine at the doses tested is likely to be favourable and support progression to further studies in order to create a larger and more robust safety database.</p>
              <p id="para0047">The immunogenicity results of this trial show a dose-dependent rise in both neutralizing and binding antibody titres which occurred predominantly after the second vaccine dose and which was substantially greater in the high dose group than in the two lower dose groups, reaching functional antibody titres that were very similar to those seen in a panel of early COVID19 convalescent sera<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>. These data encourage us to speculate that this formulation, used at the higher dose tested, may be efficacious against SARS CoV2 infection and disease and, given its low reactogenicity, may prove to be a clinically useful tool.</p>
              <p id="para0048">Peak antibody titres were reached 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine, with 90% of those in the high dose group achieving seroconversion with regards to neutralizing antibody titres. In contrast, 3 weeks after the first dose of vaccine only 10% of participants had successfully seroconverted and this modest response after one dose of VLA2001 is also reflected in the GMTs of both neutralization and binding antibody after that dose. This suggests that both doses of the vaccine may be needed for an adequate immune response, and it is not clear how this would translate into efficacy, if any, after only a single dose. High levels of effectiveness have been reported after single doses of other approved vaccines that were designed to be given as a 2-dose priming regimen.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our results may reflect the relatively early time point at which immunogenicity was initially evaluated. Vaccine induced antibody concentrations usually peak about 4 weeks after immunization, although this may vary between different vaccine types and longer dose intervals may improve the immunogenicity of two dose regimens as has been demonstrated for other COVID-19 vaccines.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>

              <p id="para0049">In addition to the humoral immunogenicity, VLA2001 also induced detectable specific T-cell responses against the S-protein, M-protein and N-protein in many subjects. Few data on T-cell responses have been published for the aluminum adjuvanted inactivated COVID-19 vaccines to date.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Zhang et al. reported poor T-cell response measured by ELISPOT, although only S-protein specific responses were reported.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In the Phase 1 study of BBV152, another whole virion, inactivated vaccine against COVID-19 formulated with a Toll like receptor 7/8 agonist, T-cell ELISPOTs performed on a small number of participants demonstrated an increase in antigen specific IFN-γ secreting CD4+ T<italic>-</italic>cells in vaccinated participants, suggestive of a Th1 response.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The induction of a broad T-cell response by VLA2001 described in this study may be due to a higher antigen content compared to other inactivated vaccines or the presence of the CpG1018 adjuvant, which was shown to enhance immunogenicity in preclinical studies of VLA2001. Cellular immunity is considered to be important for protection against natural infection, so that an effective COVID-19 vaccine would ideally need to induce both cellular and humoral immunity while avoiding generation of potentially harmful Th2 responses.<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

              <p id="para0050">The main limitation of this study is that is has been performed on younger, predominantly white, adults, therefore there are no data on older adults and other ethnic groups who have a greater risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Only one dosing interval was evaluated, therefore it may be that longer dosing intervals would result in improved immunogenicity.</p>
              <p id="para0051">In conclusion, VLA2001 was highly immunogenic with more than 90% of all study participants developing significant levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein across all dose groups tested. VLA2001 induced a dose dependent response with statistically significantly higher GMTs for both IgG and neutralizing antibodies in the high dose group compared to the low and medium dose groups. The high dose group (35AU) of VLA2001 was selected for further Phase 3 development on the basis of a comparable safety profile and superior immunogenicity as compared to the low and medium dose groups enrolled in study VLA2001–201.</p>
