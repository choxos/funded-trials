                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is one of the commonest respiratory diseases in the United Kingdom, accounting for 10 % of unplanned hospital admissions each year. Nearly a third of these admitted patients are re-admitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge. Whilst there is a move within the NHS to ensure that people with long-term conditions receive more co-ordinated care, there is little research evidence to support an optimum approach to this in COPD. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing standardised packages of care i.e. care bundles, for patients with acute exacerbations of COPD as a means of improving hospital care and reducing re-admissions.</p>

                  <title>Methods / Design</title>
                  <p>This mixed-methods evaluation will use a controlled before-and-after design to examine the effect of, and costs associated with, implementing care bundles for patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD, compared with usual care. It will quantitatively measure a range of patient and organisational outcomes for two groups of hospitals - those who deliver care using COPD care bundles, and those who deliver care without the use of COPD care bundles. These care bundles may be provided for patients with COPD following admission, prior to discharge or at both points in the care pathway. The primary outcome will be re-admission to hospital within 28 days of discharge, although the study will additionally investigate a number of secondary outcomes including length of stay, total bed days, in-hospital mortality, costs of care and patient / carer experience. A series of nested qualitative case studies will explore in detail the context and process of care as well as the impact of COPD bundles on staff, patients and carers.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>The results of the study will provide information about the effectiveness of care bundles as a way of managing in-hospital care for patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Given the number of unplanned hospital admissions for this patient group and their rate of subsequent re-admission, it is hoped that this evaluation will make a timely contribution to the evidence on care provision, to the benefit of patients, clinicians, managers and policy-makers.</p>

                <title>Epidemiology of COPD</title>
                <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (UK). It is estimated that the prevalence of COPD in the UK is over 3 million, of which only about 900,000 cases have been diagnosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The majority of people with COPD also have other medical problems; most commonly ischaemic heart disease which occurs in some 25 % of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many people discharged from hospital after an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) also report feelings of depression (64 %) and anxiety (40 %). This multi-morbidity means that managing patients’ healthcare needs is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

                <title>COPD and unplanned hospital admissions</title>
                <p>COPD accounts for 10 % of unplanned hospital medical admissions – totalling over 90,000 annually in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nearly a third of these patients are re-admitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and this proportion is steadily rising, with a 2 % increase in the re-admission rate between 2003 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. During the same time period, there has been little change in in-hospital mortality rates; estimated at 7.5 % in 2003 and 7.7 % in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As well as being an important cause of unplanned admissions, COPD is the second most common cause of emergency admission to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the fifth largest cause of re-admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], costing the National Health Service (NHS) an estimated £491 million per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indeed, the number of admissions has increased by 50 % in the last decade and now accounts for one million bed days per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All of these figures suggest that acute, urgent and emergency COPD healthcare will continue to challenge the NHS for the foreseeable future and, as such, there is considerable pressure on managers and clinicians to work to resolve the issue.</p>

                <title>Evidence-based COPD care</title>
                <p>Emergency admissions to hospital for long-term conditions - including COPD - form part of the NHS Outcomes Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and are the subject of a number of admission reduction initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been suggested that 10–34 % of COPD admissions could be avoided through the implementation of evidence-based care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A Royal College of Physicians Audit conducted in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] found that, on average, patients spend 8.7 days in hospital during an admission for COPD but also that there was wide variation in terms of both treatment provision and outcomes amongst hospitals. This disparity was particularly marked in relation to mortality. The audit showed that a significant proportion of the observed variability could be explained by availability and access to expert care and evidence-based interventions which have, in turn, resulted in a reduced length of stay and lower mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This, therefore, presents a potential opportunity to improve outcomes for patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] by ensuring that their care is consistently provided to a high standard.</p>

                <title>COPD care bundles</title>
                <p>One example of an evidence-based intervention is the use of care bundles. These are a simple way of focusing service improvement efforts on a set of defined actions which will contribute to the achievement of a clearly specified aim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Improvement theory suggests that, properly implemented, the use of care bundles should enable clinical teams to concentrate on a range of measurable activities and optimise certain associated outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In practical terms, this should mean that protocol-based care bundles for COPD will enable staff to see quickly what course of action should be taken, when and by whom, and that this will result in standardisation of practice in the treatment of patients. COPD care bundles could also be an important tool in improving the quality of care, since any deviation from the agreed care pathway can be measured easily, enabling systemic factors that might inhibit provision of best care to be identified and subsequently addressed.</p>

                <p>Some evaluation of the effectiveness of a number of types of care bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] has taken place, but there is little UK-based evidence at present<sup>,</sup> about their impact on the processes and outcomes of care for COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The preliminary findings of single pilot sites in the UK indicate that the implementation of in-patient care pathways or bundles can improve clinical outcomes such as mortality, hospital re-admission rates and length of hospital stay. Indeed, a study by Hopkinson and colleagues has shown a downward trend in 30-day re-admissions in patients with COPD in whom a bundle approach to discharge was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, in order to improve outcomes for COPD, greater understanding of clinical care, service delivery gains and cost-effectiveness is required. In doing so, more in-depth knowledge will be gained about the potential for COPD care bundles to reducing unplanned hospital admissions and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <p>The intervention of interest in this study is COPD care bundles delivered as part of in-hospital patient care. In order to encompass the full range of measures required, two separate care bundles were derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The first is to be completed at the point of hospital admission and aims to reduce length of stay and in-hospital mortality for COPD. The second is to be completed before discharge from hospital and aims to reduce re‐admissions for COPD. Together, these two co-ordinated packages of care comprise ten evidence-based actions which, when successfully completed, are designed to lead to an improvement in the overall care for those patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For the purposes of this study, all participating hospitals who deliver some form of care bundles i.e. implementation sites at either Level 1 or 2, will be offered a series of training and networking opportunities in order to promote quality improvement and to facilitate their local implementation processes. Further details of both care bundles are provided in Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Summary of COPD admission care bundle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12890_2016_197_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Summary of COPD discharge care bundle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12890_2016_197_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

If however, the data extraction is conducted in ‘real time’, they may choose to provide it on a monthly basis.

                  <p>Level 2 data will be used in a series of appropriate regression models - depending on the outcome type - to compare the difference in change between the implementation and comparator groups. These models will include a ‘group x time-period’ interaction term to estimate the difference in change in outcome between the implementation and comparator sites before and after implementation of the care bundles. This approach will reflect the fact that the samples in the ‘before’ and ‘after’ periods will have captured data from sets of predominantly different individuals. All models will take appropriate account of the matched design by including indicator variables to distinguish each pair of sites. This will accommodate any between-site variation i.e. clustering, in outcomes. If it proves possible to identify patients who are admitted several times during the study period, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted with just the first of their admissions included, and the primary analysis elaborated if necessary to accommodate any correlation in outcome between a single patient’s episodes of care.</p>

This will involve the estimation of per-patient secondary care NHS costs using a more in-depth HRG unit-costing methodology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21905152/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21905152/</ext-link>) where patient-specific resource use will be valued using comprehensive, nationally representative sources e.g. NHS reference costs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-reference-costs-2014-to-2015/">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nhs-reference-costs-2014-to-2015/</ext-link>), the British National Formulary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (BNF) and Unit Costs of Health and Social Care (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pssru.ac.uk/project-pages/unit-costs/2014/">http://www.pssru.ac.uk/project-pages/unit-costs/2014/</ext-link>). Information on procedures and investigations undertaken during an in-patient stay e.g. x-rays, onward referrals, and drugs prescribed will be collected from a review of medical records and from routine data. The per-patient cost estimate will include the cost of admissions and re-admissions during the 90-day period. Linked information on 90-day mortality (including the number of days between discharge and death) will also be collected. The duration of the interactions between a sub-sample of admitted patients and clinical staff will be recorded in a ‘time and motion’ study at Level 3 sites in order to provide an estimate of the staff time involved in treating COPD patients, which will be costed using the sources described above and used to inform the Level 2 cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
                  <p>This information on costs and mortality will allow an estimate of cost-effectiveness to be calculated as a ratio of the difference in NHS secondary care costs between intervention and comparator sites to the between-site differences in 90-day mortality. Uncertainty surrounding this estimate will be quantified using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). We will also use deterministic sensitivity analysis where appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Information on post-discharge resource use will also be collected from a sub-sample of consented Level 3 patients during telephone interviews. This information will be used to provide a descriptive analysis of differences between types of site in the use of primary care services, community care, and informal care up to 90 days post-discharge.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative analysis</title>
                  <p>The observational data will be collected in note form, developed as soon after the period of observation as possible and then word processed and uploaded into a proprietary qualitative analysis package e.g. NVivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All interviews will be digitally recorded, fully transcribed and anonymised and, similarly, will be uploaded and stored in readiness for coding and analysis. Both observational and interview data will then be examined using a cross-case thematic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This approach will be used to draw out the key issues in the data, using a coding framework which will be developed collaboratively by members of the research team. This process will enable both inductive and deductive analysis; focussing on the research questions, and also enabling the emergence of views and experiences expressed by interviewees. All data will be analysed and interpreted by at least two qualitative researchers, in order to cross-reference findings and ensure consistency and clarity. The analysis will seek to identify similarities and differences between sites, highlighting aspects that are likely to be transferable to other hospitals implementing – or intending to implement – care bundles.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite the fact that COPD is one of the most common causes of hospital admissions in the UK, there is no clear evidence as to how it can be most successfully managed either within or outside the acute setting, in order to improve in-patient care and reduce further re-admissions.</p>
              <p>This study will use a controlled before-and-after design to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing standardised treatment packages i.e. care bundles, for patients with exacerbated COPD. Trust-level and patient-level data collected from a sample of hospitals across England and Wales will provide sufficient power to detect a meaningful difference in outcomes as regards the clinical effectiveness of COPD care bundles. In addition, a range of resource use data will inform a detailed analysis of their cost-effectiveness. Finally, the nested qualitative case-studies will offer insight into the processes underpinning care bundle implementation as well as the complex array of ‘real life’ factors implicated in looking after patients with this type of long-term respiratory illness.</p>
              <p>Given the number of unplanned hospital admissions for this patient group and their rate of subsequent re-admission, it is hoped that the results from this evaluation will make an important and timely contribution to the existing evidence-base for the benefit of patients, clinicians, managers and policy-makers.</p>
