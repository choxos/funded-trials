                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Death was a part of life: these very old people mainly live day-to-day. Most were ready to die, reflecting their concerns regarding quality of life, being a nuisance, having nothing to live for and having lived long enough. Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly. Most were not worried about death itself, but concerned more about the dying process and impacts on those left behind; a peaceful and pain-free death was a common ideal. Attitudes ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting its inevitable approach to longing for its release. Preferring to be made comfortable rather than have life-saving treatment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid hospital, were commonly expressed views. There was little or no future planning, some consciously choosing not to. Uncertainty hampered end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon. Some stressed circumstances, such as severe dependency and others’ likely decision-making roles, would influence choices. Carers found these issues harder to raise but felt they would know their older relatives’ preferences, usually palliative care, although we found two discrepant views.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study’s rare data show ≥95-year-olds are willing to discuss dying and end-of-life care but seldom do. Formal documentation of wishes is extremely rare and may not be welcome. Although being “ready to die” and preferring a palliative approach predominated, these preferences cannot be assumed.</p>

              <p>Living longer means dying older. Demographic changes mean more people are living their last years in very old age.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] How does this affect their attitudes towards death, dying and care towards the end of life? The experiences and preferences of ‘older old’ people, or their carers, are rarely heard, but their voices are crucial to shaping end-of-life care services to reflect the priorities of increasingly older people approaching death.</p>
              <p>The existing literature on end of life preferences and experiences of older people is limited, and particularly so in relation to very old people.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Research to date has typically sought bereaved relatives’ views,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] though some pioneering studies with older people have been largely in long-term care settings,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] occasionally with just community-dwelling older people,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but to our knowledge none so very old and none except our cohort[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] taking a population-based approach.</p>
              <p>The present study informs policy, planning and practice by exploring thoughts on death and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representative sample of very old people—over-95-year-olds, their relatives and formal carers.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>A qualitative interview was added to the regular quantitative survey data collection at the 7<sup>th</sup> wave follow-up (Year 21) of a longitudinal study of ageing, the Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study. Full study methods have are described elsewhere[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/">http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/</ext-link>). The original population-based sample (n = 2166, 95% response rate) enrolled in 1985/87 using general practice lists have been re-interviewed every few years following Cambridge Research Ethics Committee approval and renewed consent. To avoid under-representation of the most frail, proxy informants were also interviewed. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in the interviewee’s usual home or occasionally, with proxies, by phone. Mortality was the main source of attrition.</p>
              <p>In this Survey 7, following completion of the CC75C interviewer-administered structured questionnaire (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/questionnaires">http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/questionnaires</ext-link>), participants were invited to a further interview “more like a conversation than the usual survey” with the aim of understanding “what it is like to be so old, your experiences of care and your views on some of these issues that are more complex than a survey can explore.” A topic guide of open-ended questions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/additionaldata">http://www.cc75c.group.cam.ac.uk/pages/additionaldata</ext-link>) explored issues participants had raised in past surveys, where quantitative methods had been inadequate to fully explore the depth of responses. When proxy informants were interviewed, they were asked what they believed would be the response from the older person as well as their own views and experiences. Multiple strategies maximised inclusion of these very old and often frail participants in qualitative data collection [see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pone.0150686.box001">Box 1</xref>].</p>

              <p>To maximise the value of these data sources, the entirety of this relatively large qualitative archive was included in the analysis. A descriptive thematic analysis was conducted using a framework approach,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which facilitates working with large data sets, particularly where data collection is more structured, and where co-researchers share analysis. NVivo software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx">http://www.qsrinternational.com/products_nvivo.aspx</ext-link>) was used to manage and index the data prior to charting, mapping and interpretation. The analysis team, trained in framework analysis, consisted of two to three analysts at any one time (four individuals trained in qualitative methods) working independently, in parallel and together at various steps of the analytic process.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>Of 54 study participants alive when Survey 7 started, 6 died before they could be interviewed. Of the 48 remaining, 44 (92%) took part in the usual survey. Qualitative data were collected for all but two people. For the majority (n = 30, 71%) both the participant and a proxy informant were interviewed, usually separately (n = 26) or for a few jointly (n = 4). For a small minority (n = 3, 7%) only the participant was interviewed and for one in five (n = 9, 21%) only proxy interviews were possible [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150686.g001">Fig 1</xref>]. All but six proxy informants were relatives, most commonly daughters (n = 20) or sons (n = 7); non-family included care-home staff, a live-in care-assistant and a friend. Participants were aged 95–101, mainly women (n = 37, 88%); 57% were community-dwelling (n = 20 in private dwellings, half of these living alone, n = 4 alone in sheltered accommodation) [see <xref rid="pone.0150686.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for further demographics]. The full archive for qualitative analysis comprised 112 source documents (1269 pages) including anonymised transcripts from 95.5 hours of audio-recordings from 91 interviews relating to 42 older people.</p>

                <p>Participants vividly described the context in which they were living their later years, a context where contemporaries’ deaths heightened awareness of dying, though interviews revealed considerable variation in views on readiness to die or not, medicalisation of dying, euthanasia and life outlook.</p>

                  <title>1a) Everyone dying</title>
                  <p>The age of these older people was so great that most of their contemporaries had died. Their circles of friends and family had diminished and death was a regular feature of life, leading some to question why they were still alive.</p>
                  <disp-quote>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>One proxy measured this by the size of her mother’s Christmas card list–“<italic>down to five now</italic>”–and quoted her frequently asking “<italic>for at least ten years ‘Why am I still here</italic>? <italic>All my friends have gone</italic>.<italic>’</italic>”(1077-proxy)</p>
                  <p>However, there were positive outlooks. One proxy described her mother as a survivor, acknowledging deaths of others but able to carry on; others celebrated their survival:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic>“…they became great buddies</italic>. <italic>And I do think she was sad when she died</italic>, <italic>but […] she didn't miss a beat […]</italic>, <italic>she carried on with her life</italic>. <italic>So I think there's obviously the survival thing there</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Thus, for many, death and dying framed their outlook on their remaining lives. Some spoke, more negatively, of being on borrowed time:</p>

                    <p><italic>“Maybe she feels she’s on borrowed time</italic>.<italic>[…] She’s had underlying heart problems over time</italic>, <italic>so she must have had a sort of taste of her own mortality</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p>

                  <p>Well-intended medical interventions were viewed negatively as prolonging life by a handful of interviewees, an issue usually, but not exclusively, raised by proxy informants. One care home manager offered the explanation that <italic>“in hospitals they do feel […] death is not something they want</italic>, <italic>so they will over-medicalise because it’s better than doing nothing”(142-proxy)</italic>. She exemplified this with the ethical issues posed by enteral tube feeding decisions: “<italic>It’s harder to take the thing out than to put one in</italic>.”<italic>(142-proxy)</italic> However, relatives questioned the logic of some medical practices:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“<italic>I was annoyed […] the doctor gave her her pneumonia injection […]—she had no quality of life… was ready to go […] [but] there was no consultation with us at all about it</italic>. <italic>[…] I was very angry with him</italic>.”</p>

                <p>Thinking about death, talking about death and what might follow death emerged as separate themes in the interviews.</p>

                  <title>2a) Thoughts about dying</title>
                  <p>As well as framing their thoughts on their remaining life, the deaths of others and faith perspectives provided a context for thoughts about death and dying. Most were not afraid of dying, either reporting it did not worry them or proxies saying they had not expressed any worries or fears about it:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic>“I’m not afraid of dying […] at my age anything can happen</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>For some this absence of fear was rooted in positive experiences of others’ dying:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic>“When I look back in my family</italic>, <italic>my parents</italic>. <italic>They were alive</italic>, <italic>then they were dead</italic>, <italic>but it all went off as usual</italic>. <italic>Nothing really dramatic or anything […] Why should it be any different for me</italic>?<italic>”</italic></p>
                    <p>(1502)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>But where the experience of others’ deaths had been negative, there was worry—not about death itself, but the process of dying:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic>“[My aunt] found my mother’s end quite distressing</italic>, <italic>because she [pause] was not herself for quite a long time before she died</italic>. <italic>My mum was in hospital for a long time</italic>, <italic>and then in the home</italic>. <italic>[…] I think she worries that she’s going to be like that when the end comes</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Worries about death also related to the impact death might have on others. This usually related to the emotional impact on the family or resulting loneliness for a remaining partner, but also to financial concerns.</p>

                  <p>A few reported thinking about death and dying, suggesting it was a worry, but for most it was something occasionally crossing their minds and not a great concern.</p>

                  <p>There were some who stated explicitly that they didn’t think about, or preferred not to think about, or discuss, death. A care manager proxy suggested this was born out of fear.</p>

                  <p>Death was welcomed where it was seen as a release. One older person said he was not afraid of death as it meant there was probably something wrong. Others felt death was both inevitable and approaching.</p>

                  <p>The older people and their proxies seemed to accept this inevitability quite philosophically as beyond their control: <italic>“Well</italic>, <italic>it’s no good making a fuss</italic>. <italic>If you can’t alter it</italic>, <italic>abide by it</italic>.<italic>”(1079)</italic></p>

              <title>Discussion, Implications and Conclusions</title>
              <p>We sought thoughts on death and dying and preferences for end-of-life care with a representative sample of very old people, their relatives and formal carers. This rare dataset of qualitative interviews described ≥95-year-olds’ lives as contextualised by death, with the majority wondering why they were still there and a minority celebrating their survival. Death was now a part of life for these very old people who were mainly living day-to-day. Most were ready to die, reflecting their concerns for quality of life, not being a nuisance, having nothing to live for and feelings of having lived long enough. Contrasting views were rare exceptions but voiced firmly. Unwanted medical prolongation of life was an issue for some and mention of euthanasia related to loss of quality of life, usually raised by proxy informants for whom legal implications were a concern. Most were not worried about death itself. Concerns, coloured by experience of others’ dying, were more about impact on those left behind and the dying process; a peaceful and pain-free death, preferably during sleep, was a common ideal. The wide variation in attitudes ranged from not wanting to think about death, through accepting it as inevitable and approaching, to welcoming or even longing for its release. Preferring to be made comfortable rather than have life-saving treatment if seriously ill, and wishing to avoid going into hospital, were both commonly expressed views, again with a few firm exceptions. Some stressed choices would be affected by circumstances, such as likelihood of severe dependency. They fatalistically accepted decisions might well be taken by others, family and healthcare professionals, and trust in decision-makers was important. Some felt their destiny lay with God or fate. Uncertainty hampered end-of-life planning even when death was expected soon. There was little or no planning for the future, some consciously choosing not to. Written documentation of wishes was virtually unheard of, except sometimes for funerals or wills; the only mention of living wills was in relation to a reluctance to prepare one, and the only example we came across of an advance care plan, in nursing home notes, had been ignored. Despite a notable willingness to discuss end-of-life preferences in most interviews, and death being so ubiquitous, previously having talked openly about death was uncommon, often only alluded to or couched in humour. Not all the older people wanted to have such discussions; for the minority who had, these explicit discussions had usually been with care professionals. Families and care professionals found these issues hard to raise, generally saying preferences had never been discussed. They felt they knew their older relatives well enough to predict their preferences, usually palliative care, mirroring what most older participants wanted, although we found two discrepant views.</p>
              <p>Rarely are the views of the very old heard. Our sizeable qualitative dataset uniquely evidences the perspectives of a representative sample of over-95-year-olds. In contrast to much qualitative research that aims to capture diversity through purposive sampling, these were population-based cohort participants and moreover were well-characterised by the mixed methods CC75C study’s quantitative epidemiology. Although a single-centre study, sample characteristics are in line with national data available for this age-group and other developed countries. Non-response potentially limits research validity, but 79% of the surviving cohort were interviewed in person and proxy interviews maximised participation to 92%, ensuring people across the cognitive and health spectrum were included. Proxy informants frequently quoted participants themselves, but there are inevitable uncertainties regarding the validity of perspectives heard second-hand. Reliance on informants to represent older relatives’ preferences, as we found most could, is not only a research issue; the occasional discrepant views we found have implications for practice, highlighted in other studies too.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, including these reported views, despite the limitations of proxy reporting, ensured we captured some of the voices of those least able to express themselves. A further limitation was the study’s inability to explore how very old peoples’ views might change over time, particularly as they neared death, a question of importance given their unpredictable circumstances that merits further research.</p>
              <p>Our study adds to the few studies to date that have sought the views of older people themselves,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] rather than just through relatives.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Although previous research generally interviewed younger old people, we found overlapping themes, also highlighted in the few relevant reviews.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Heterogeneity of views is unsurprising,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] but some common themes are striking: even in their late 90s or beyond our participants generally conveyed a ‘living for today’ approach previously reported[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and comfortable acceptance of death.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Others too have found a readiness to talk about dying and end-of-life care,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] though this rarely happened,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and willingness to make plans was less clear-cut[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]: one UK study found people living alone in their 80s “wanting to prepare for and to have a choice with regard to where and when they might die”,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] but a US study found housebound older people were reluctant to plan for serious illness or dying, especially resisting decision-making on hypothetical future dilemmas, preferring to wait till they “cross that bridge”.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Other studies of people with dementia and their family carers have also reported the perceived difficulty of making formal plans for unknown futures.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Other researchers found, as we did, a minority who preferred not to discuss dying at all[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and an expectation by some that others might make decisions when necessary.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] As in our study, generally people were more likely to plan for death—funerals or wills—than dying,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] although only a minority worried about death itself, most were more likely worried about the manner of dying.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p>
              <p>Our study found that an over-whelming majority of our very old sample had strong preferences for palliative care–“being made comfortable”–versus “life-saving treatment”. Others have also reported a majority preferring not to have interventions[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and found preferences for life-sustaining treatment declined with decreasing physical or psychological functioning.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Some questioned the value of intervention: “Why are we being kept alive?”[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Although only a minority wanted life-saving treatment, these were strong preferences but had not been communicated. Although current policy encourages early discussion and documentation of end-of-life care preferences,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] our study and others illustrate how multiple barriers to advance care planning[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] apply also to other relevant options rarely discussed, such as moving into long-term care,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] not least how unpredictability and changing contexts may change choices.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Others have given thoughtful consideration to the need to recognise that more dying people are following longer frailty trajectories and the implications for care services.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Previous research has highlighted challenges of improving communication about preferences[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; we noted with interest other researchers’ comments that participants welcomed interviews as an opportunity to express thoughts,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as did many of ours. We found questions on specific topics could open up dialogue with people hesitant to discuss dying in general. Interviewees themselves suggested that “being surrounded by death” provided opportunities to start conversations, and both family and professional carers admitted being hesitant to broach the matter, at times leaving an older person with concerns and information needs, for instance pain relief, that no-one addressed.</p>
              <p>We and others have described the complex transitions often experienced by very old people approaching the end of life,[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and there is widespread recognition that transfers between care settings may be detrimental.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Most of our participants viewed the prospect of hospital negatively, but supporting older people to achieve current preferences in changing circumstances is a major challenge for research and practice. Prognostication uncertainties in frailty trajectories make determining when hospital admission is ‘inappropriate’ challenging, and too much ‘admissions avoidance’ risks denying very old people diagnosis, treatment and care that may be entirely appropriate.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] Half of UK deaths aged ≥85 are in hospitals and a third in care homes[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] so improving end-of-life care for very old people in all settings is a priority.[<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>;<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150686.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] Prospective population-based research with older old people, and their informal and formal carers, examining determinants of staying-in-place or transitions is needed to understand what would enable older people to die in the place and with the support they would choose.</p>
