                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The CRADLE Vital Signs Alert intervention (an accurate easy-to-use device that measures blood pressure and pulse with inbuilt traffic-light early warning system, and focused training package) was associated with reduced rates of eclampsia and maternal death when trialled in urban areas in Sierra Leone. Subsequently, implementation was successfully piloted as evidenced by measures of fidelity, feasibility and adoption. The CRADLE-5 trial will examine whether national scale-up, including in the most rural areas, will reduce a composite outcome of maternal and fetal mortality and maternal morbidity and will evaluate how the CRADLE package can be embedded sustainably into routine clinical pathways.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">CRADLE-5 is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial of the CRADLE intervention compared to routine maternity care across eight rural districts in Sierra Leone (Bonthe, Falaba, Karene, Kailahun, Koinadugu, Kono, Moyamba, Tonkolili). Each district will cross from control to intervention at six-weekly intervals over the course of 1 year (May 2022 to June 2023). All women identified as pregnant or within six-weeks postpartum presenting for maternity care in the district are included. Primary outcome data (composite rate of maternal death, stillbirth, eclampsia and emergency hysterectomy) will be collected. A mixed-methods process and scale-up evaluation (informed by Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions and the World Health Organization ExpandNet tools) will explore implementation outcomes of fidelity, adoption, adaptation and scale-up outcomes of reach, maintenance, sustainability and integration. Mechanisms of change and contextual factors (barriers and facilitators) will be assessed. A concurrent cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">International guidance recommends that all pregnant and postpartum women have regular blood pressure assessment, and healthcare staff are adequately trained to respond to abnormalities. Clinical effectiveness to improve maternal and perinatal health in more rural areas, and ease of integration and sustainability of the CRADLE intervention at scale has yet to be investigated. This trial will explore whether national scale-up of the CRADLE intervention reduces maternal and fetal mortality and severe maternal adverse outcomes and understand the strategies for adoption, integration and sustainability in low-resource settings. If successful, the aim is to develop an adaptable, evidence-based scale-up roadmap to improve maternal and infant outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction: background and rationale {6a}</title>
              <p id="Par14">In Sierra Leone (SL), the reduction of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality are high priorities of the health sector, in line with the third Sustainable Development Goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite an almost 40% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) from 1165 per 100,000 in 2013 to 717 per 100,000 live births in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], SL still has one of the highest MMR in the world. One in thirty-one women die during childbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with a 40 to 60 percent higher risk for teenage mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Perinatal mortality is high (34 per 1000 live births), with a stillbirth rate of 24 per 1000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Infants whose mothers die are up to ten times more likely to die within the first two years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Data from the CRADLE-3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] correlate with national statistics; 76% of maternal deaths are caused by haemorrhage, hypertension and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; all of which are marked by abnormalities in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). If deteriorating vital signs are detected early, maternal morbidity and mortality are preventable with simple, cost-effective interventions that are widely available in SL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, there are often disparities in access to vital sign assessment and skilled intervention, and delays in delivery and escalation of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], varying by geographical area and socio-demographic characteristics.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Vital sign measurement is an international standard part of maternity care. The CRADLE Vital Sign Alert (VSA) device is a hand-held, semi-automated, low-cost BP and HR measuring device with a built-in traffic-light warning system that has been especially developed for use in low-income settings during pregnancy and the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The device has additionally been validated as accurate for use in women with preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and in those who develop low BP from sepsis or haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">The CRADLE-3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] investigated the introduction of the CRADLE intervention into routine maternity care in ten clusters across Africa, India, and Haiti. Freetown, SL’s urban capital city, reported a 40% reduction in the primary outcome (at least one of eclampsia, emergency hysterectomy, and maternal death) [odds ratio (OR) 0.60 (95% CI 0.50–0.72), <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001] and a 60% reduction in maternal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.37 [95% CI 0.25 to 0.55], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This trial confirmed that deaths and associated morbidity are avoidable with appropriate triage and escalation. A concurrent process evaluation across all CRADLE-3 trial sites found considerable variation in the implementation, reach, adoption and context; analysis in individual countries was recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">This evidence base combined with an increased focus on timely maternity triage and escalation led the SL Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) to advocate for the pilot of the CRADLE intervention across eight out of the county’s sixteen districts between March 2020 and January 2021 (funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office, the World Health Organization and UNICEF). Full results will be published separately, but in summary, 160 CRADLE Champions and 40 Master Trainers were trained, and 2800 CRADLE devices and 1200 large cuffs distributed. The rollout reached 716 peripheral health unit (PHU) facilities providing maternity care, and rolled out to 2031 frontline healthcare staff, showing high levels of feasibility and acceptability. Strong acceptance from frontline healthcare staff and robust evidence prompted buy-in and advocacy by the MoHS in Sierra Leone for horizontal scale-up of the CRADLE intervention to the rest of the country (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Map of Sierra Leone. Districts which already have the CRADLE intervention are marked (1) and districts included in the CRADLE-5 trial are marked (2).

              <p id="Par19">Our set goal is the scale up of the CRADLE intervention to improve access to quality and timely maternity assessment to enable appropriate care for pregnancy hypertension and shock related to obstetric haemorrhage and infection. The remaining eight districts are rural and provide the opportunity to evaluate the impact of CRADLE in this setting, where appropriate triage and referral may have greater impact on outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par20">This protocol describes the stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial to evaluate both the clinical impact and scale-up of the CRADLE VSA and training package in Sierra Leone. In-depth context and system specific pilot work highlighted district-specific adaptations and implementation strategies which, alongside our theory of change workshops, has substantially informed the CRADLE-5 trial scale-up strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our aim is to ultimately develop an adaptable, evidence-based roadmap for scale-up in order to achieve sustainable impact on maternal and fetal outcomes. We have been guided by four key principles: systems thinking; a focus on sustainability; the need to determine scalability; and respect for gender, equity and human rights principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

              <title>Hypotheses</title>
              <p id="Par21">We hypothesise that integrating the use of the CRADLE VSA device into routine maternity care and scaling-up focused CRADLE training to the remaining half of SL will increase <italic>availability</italic> of vital signs monitoring equipment, <italic>engage</italic> and <italic>empower</italic> healthcare workers, communities and women to understand the importance of vital sign measure, and enable <italic>reassurance</italic> or alert users and women to when results are abnormal, ensuring prompt life-saving <italic>communication</italic>, <italic>action</italic> and/or <italic>referral</italic> for both mother and unborn baby from the three leading causes of maternal death: obstetric haemorrhage, sepsis and pregnancy hypertension.</p>

              <title>Objectives {7}</title>
              <p id="Par22">The primary objective of the trial is to determine whether real-world scale-up of the CRADLE VSA device and focused education package to community and facility level maternity care in SL is sustainably adopted and reduces a composite of (all-cause) maternal mortality or major morbidity and fetal loss by ≥ 20%.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The trial is complemented by a simultaneous process and scale-up evaluation informed by Medical Research Council guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and WHO ExpandNet tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The specific goals of the process and scale up evaluation are to (1) analyse how, and to what extent, the CRADLE intervention has been implemented, (2) assess how the different contexts can influence the implementation process and scale-up strategies and (3) assess the process and sustainability of the scale-up. This will include an evaluation of cost-effectiveness.</p>

                <p id="Par25">The CRADLE-5 trial is a pragmatic, mixed-methods, multi-district, stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial of the scale-up of the CRADLE intervention (CRADLE VSA device and CRADLE training package) into routine maternity care settings in SL and will be reported in line with the CONSORT stepped wedge cluster randomised trials update [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par26">The study is taking place in SL, a country on the southwestern coast of Africa with a population of 8.8 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">SL is a least developed country according to the OECD list [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and has one of the highest mortality rates in the world, with a high burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. It struggles to provide basic universal health coverage, portable water and sanitation. All public health facilities offer free healthcare services to pregnant women, lactating mothers and children below the age of five; however, 72% of women report at least one serious problem in accessing health care for themselves when they are sick; the most commonly cited problem is getting money for treatment (67%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. SL suffers an inadequacy of human resource and diagnostic readiness for health. Nineteen per cent of health facilities have no BP device, and 82% of maternal deaths occurred in a health facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Latest figures report 0.7 doctors and 7.5 nurses and midwives per 10,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], well below WHO’s health workforce targets for UHC and SDGs of 23 doctors, nurses and midwives per 10,000. Suboptimal maternal healthcare coverage contributes to preventable deaths, disability and high out-of-pocket spending in a country with an incipient financial crisis, exacerbated by the 2014 Ebola epidemic and further weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The capacity and resources to develop and implement national strategies and to produce robust needs-based staffing remain a priority. Our proposed interventions will be evaluated for impact on maternal and fetal outcomes, and cost-effectiveness to take all aspects into account.</p>
                <p id="Par28">The country is divided into five administrative regions (Northern, Southern, Eastern, North-western, and Western) which are further subdivided into 16 districts. Each trial cluster is made up of a specific district in SL; the following eight districts, which have not yet received the CRADLE intervention, were included in the trial: Bonthe, Falaba, Karene, Kailahun, Koinadugu, Kono, Moyamba and Tonkolili. From our selected districts, populations range between 200,781 (Bonthe) to 531,435 (Tonkolili). Bonthe is the smallest, covering an area of 3469 km<sup>2</sup>, whereas Koinadugu is 12,121 km<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Each district comprises a secondary hospital health centre with multiple satellite primary peripheral health units in the community. The total number of peripheral health units per district ranges from 50 in Falaba to 109 in Moyamba. The trial will work across all levels of healthcare facility in the country, reaching the most deprived, remote, and rural communities. Seven of the districts comprise of at least one secondary health facility with multiple satellite primary care centres (called peripheral health units in Sierra Leone) that refer into the secondary hospital. One district (Falaba) does not have a secondary hospital, and referrals from its satellite primary care centres go primarily to the secondary hospital in Koinadugu, as well as to other neighbouring districts.</p>

None of the districts will receive the intervention at time point 0. One district will be randomly allocated to receive the intervention at time point 1, whilst all the remaining areas contribute to the control at this time point. A second district is randomly allocated to the intervention at time point 2 and so on. Each randomisation cluster will cross over from the control to the CRADLE intervention at six-weekly intervals (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7587_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                  <title>Component 1—Microlife® CRADLE Vital Sign Alert device</title>
                  <p id="Par36">The Microlife® CRADLE VSA is a hand-held, upper-arm, semi-automated device that measures BP and pulse. The device has undergone extensive testing for accuracy and is one of few BP devices to have been validated as accurate in pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia and hypotension) and in non-pregnant adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is cost-effective (less than $20) and can be used effectively by unskilled personnel after minimal training. The device incorporates a traffic-light early warning system that alerts all levels of healthcare provider to abnormalities in vital signs, secondary to obstetric haemorrhage, sepsis and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The thresholds that trigger the traffic lights were determined through pregnancy-specific prediction studies. The device fulfils the World Health Organization requirements for low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Other unique developments suited to low-income countries include a micro-USB charging ability and a “traffic light” early warning system for hypertension and shock (secondary to either obstetric haemorrhage or sepsis). The CRADLE intervention will be incorporated into routine maternity care. All primary and secondary level health facilities in eight districts will be provided with CRADLE VSA devices and emergency obstetric triage training via the Train-the-Trainer model. Devices are allocated per health facility according to health facility size and capacity, with 30% total stock kept at the district stores as buffer stock.</p>

The training package is as described below but can be adapted to meet specific contextual factors. It includes a short, animated video describing the device and how it is used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cribs-i.org/professionals/cradle-vsa/microlife-cradle-vsa-user-guide/">https://cribs-i.org/professionals/cradle-vsa/microlife-cradle-vsa-user-guide/</ext-link>), an interactive session with the trainees, a reference booklet, a wall poster showing how the device is used and an aide-memoire card attached to the CRADLE device for quick reference. The animated film is in English and has also been translated into Krio, the most commonly spoken language across Sierra Leone. The content of this training material covers: (1) use of the Microlife CRADLE VSA device, (2) basic clinical assessment of pregnant women, (3) understanding pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, obstetric haemorrhage and sepsis and review of local management guidelines and protocols, (4) triggers for treatment and/or referral and familiarisation with local referral pathway, (5) CRADLE VSA device troubleshooting and (6) CRADLE VSA maintenance manual.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">Components of the training have been adapted to meet the SL specific contextual needs: the training was expanded to include a more extensive focus on Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) training as well as an increased focus on community engagement, training facilitation tips, respectful maternity care and a CRADLE maintenance practical session. A training aide in the form of the CRADLE song, to a local popular tune, was integrated.</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par52">Several strategies have been employed to promote adherence to the intervention protocol. A theory of change workshop bringing together key stakeholders across community, district management and national levels facilitated discussion around the pathways of change for the CRADLE intervention to improve uptake and quality of maternity services, particularly learning from the pilot phase across the first eight districts. Engagement visits to all eight districts were undertaken prior to the feasibility phase and trial. Two offline mobile phone applications were developed to aid primary outcome and process evaluation data collection; both have integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) geotagging capabilities allowing real time monitoring of data collection and CRADLE training adherence. Three-monthly monitoring trips are undertaken to supervise, monitor and audit data collection of primary and secondary outcomes, in addition to real time online data monitoring. Based on the pilot within the first eight districts, the CRADLE training was refined to include a more in-depth focus on emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC), increased community engagement to facilitate patient referral acceptance by stakeholders and increased hospital engagement to support adoption of the CRADLE intervention across multi-disciplinary teams and cadres. Full pilot phase implementation strategies will be published elsewhere.</p>

                <p id="Par98">Sample size estimation has been provided by the CRADLE senior statistician, using Stata version 13.1 and the methods of Hemming and Girling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The power of the study will depend on three factors: (1) the design (eight groups, six-weekly time periods, around 1000 deliveries/period/centre), (2) the event rate and treatment effect (5% falling to 4%) and (3) the data structure, specifically the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and cluster autocorrelation (CAC) coefficients.</p>
                <p id="Par99">Sample size calculations for longitudinal cluster randomised trials, such as our proposed stepped-wedge trials, necessitate the estimation of the correlation structure underlying the study. This entails assessing both the within-period intra-cluster correlations, which differ from conventional intra-cluster correlations due to their reliance on the period, and the cluster autocorrelation coefficients to account for correlation decay. For the purposes of the power calculation, we assume that there are up to 1000 deliveries per district per six weeks (half the 2000 we consider likely), across eight districts, each observed for 12 months. It is difficult to estimate more accurately at present, as we have no suitable multi-centre, multi-time period data in a single low-income country. However, if the ICC is suitably low and the CAC is suitable high, at the time of analysis, we do not predict any difficulties. We will obtain this information from our observational pilot data gathered in January to May 2022 in all eight districts of the study. Feasibility data suggests the CAC is likely to be 1. Therefore, even with an extremely high intra-cluster correlation of 0.5, power would be close to 100%. We have used <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clusterrcts.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/">https://clusterrcts.shinyapps.io/rshinyapp/</ext-link> for the calculations. As per Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, with a CAC of 1, power will be more than adequate with 1000 women per month per centre.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Demonstration modelling of cluster size calculation if ICC 0.01, 0.02 and 0.5 with CAC = 1</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7587_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par100">We intend to consider whether the treatment effect can be linked to the extent and quality of the implementation of the intervention in each district, as measured by our implementation and scale-up metrics. An absolute difference of 0.25% in the treatment effect between districts would clearly be important. Given the high power for the main treatment effect, we anticipate that we will have more than adequate power to detect such a difference.</p>

                <p id="Par109">The date at first presentation to health facility will be used to determine the period in which a woman experiencing a primary event is analysed in.

The regression model (binomial, with a log link) that we propose to use will estimate the risk ratio for the effect of the planned intervention. It will include fixed effects for separate linear trends in each region, with a single step at the time the intervention is introduced into the district. As the method is robust to how the correlation structure is specified, further allowances for the data structure, as used in multi-level modelling, are not needed. Odds ratios will be given if models fail to converge when estimating risk ratios. Effects of treatment on primary outcomes will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals and significance at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.

The PMG will convene every month, with all co-investigators convening every 3 months to review progress, troubleshoot and plan strategically. This group will report to the trial steering committee (TSC), which is part of a bigger International Advisory Group that oversees all activities of the different workstreams of the NIHR Global Health Research Group CRIBs. The TSC will include dependent and independent members. Members will be provided with a TSC Charter and will be invited to attend, at least, annual TSC meetings.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par128">Three quarters of maternal deaths in SL are caused by haemorrhage, hypertension and sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], all of which cause abnormalities in vital signs. The majority of deaths are preventable if deteriorating vital signs are detected early, enabling simple interventions to be delivered, which are available in SL. However, access to vital signs monitoring equipment and skilled intervention is often limited, especially in rural settings, leading to delays in escalation and delivery of care. Clinical effectiveness of introduction of the CRADLE intervention to improve maternal and perinatal health in rural areas, and integration and sustainability have yet to be investigated. This trial will evaluate whether national scale-up of the CRADLE device combined with focused training reduces maternal and fetal mortality and severe maternal adverse outcomes and will explore strategies for adoption, integration and sustainability of the intervention in Sierra Leone, which will be relevant to other low-resource settings. Developing a robust clinical trial, to address life-threatening maternal health issues, whilst taking into account the reality of the trial environment is challenging, but there is an urgent need to generate evidence specific to the local context and to evaluate interventions where they are most needed. Examples of potential limitations include capacity and engagement of district medical teams to coordinate and deliver sufficient staff refresher training, given multiple active healthcare initiatives across the country, and technical issues related to the CRADLE device, i.e. charging and broken parts, which could limit sustainable integration and impact. However, this trial design has a strong, context specific evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with substantial pilot and feasibility work, and is underpinned by several sustained collaborative partnerships in Sierra Leone, including with the MoHS. The trial protocol was developed with strong and enthusiastic in-country advocacy, with top-down and bottom-up involvement and resultant widespread acceptance of the intervention. Strong stakeholder buy-in, achieved through long-term engagement, theory of change workshops and a policy lab has led to integration of CRADLE into other programmes and initiatives including the National EmONC training package and the ‘train-the-trainer methodology galvanises local teams to take ownership at both district and community level. In summary, this intervention has been tailored for delivery to rural populations, who are amongst the most vulnerable, in terms of access to healthcare, with the worst outcomes. The study aims to generate a pragmatic, evidence-based, adaptable road map to reach, impact and empower women and healthcare workers, even in the most challenging settings.</p>
