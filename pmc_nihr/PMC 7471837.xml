                  <p>To describe visual outcomes, frequency of treatment and monitoring visits, and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor drugs used in usual care in participants who exited a trial in which treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) was initiated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Multicenter cohort study up to 7 years after trial exit.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Patients enrolled in the Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial; after excluding participants from 2 sites and who died or withdrew during the trial, 537 were included in this follow-up cohort.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Data were collected between May 26, 2016, and August 24, 2017. Distance visual acuity (DVA) (letters read) in both eyes and treatments for nAMD administered to either eye at all usual care visits were extracted from medical records of all participants until the point of data collection (duration of study eye monitoring).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Main Outcome Measures</title>
                  <p>Rate of change of DVA during active surveillance of the study eye (study eye monitoring), estimated using a multivariable linear random effects model. Other outcome measures were visit and treatment frequency and switches in anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Data were obtained for 99% (532/537) of eligible participants. The median duration of study eye monitoring after IVAN exit was 3.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.3–4.7), and median DVA was 58.0 letters (IQR, 34.0–73.0). Study eye DVA deteriorated by 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7–4.9) letters per year. Injection rate did not influence the rate of change in DVA after adjusting for key covariates. After IVAN exit, 174 participants (32%) received no treatment; 332 of 358 (93%) were treated first with ranibizumab, 78 (23%) of whom switched to aflibercept. The DVA was similar among participants who switched or did not switch at the end of study monitoring.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Approximately 5 years after the IVAN study finished, with unprecedented completeness of follow-up for such a trial, the trajectory of functional decline in the study eye was shown to be greater than that previously reported for incomplete trial cohorts. Anti-VEGF injection rates and treatment switches were not important factors in determining visual acuity outcomes.</p>

            <p id="p0010">The current standard of care for managing neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is treatment with biological molecules that bind or suppress anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies. Commonly used agents are ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept. The benefits of these agents over 2 years of treatment have been thoroughly evaluated in well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</p>
            <p id="p0015">Outcomes beyond 2 years, on average, at 5 and 7 years after release from protocol,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> have been characterized by follow-on studies of participants previously enrolled in RCTs. However, these reports are subject to bias because of incomplete follow-up, for a variety of reasons: the age of patients with nAMD, which is approximately 80 years, the associated high levels of morbidity and mortality, and patients’ ability to pay.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0020">Data from real world datasets also show that more than two-thirds of the patient population are no longer under review by an ophthalmologist 4 years after starting treatment.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> There is broad agreement that visual acuity (VA) progressively worsens over time. However, because of the selected nature of the patients for whom data are available, the extent of the decline is likely to have been underestimated in reports of outcomes in subgroups of study populations who have continued to attend for treatment.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
            <p id="p0025">Universal access to care in the United Kingdom’s National Health Service provides an opportunity to combine the advantage of characterizing long-term outcomes in a phenotypically well-defined trial cohort<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> with the advantage of complete follow-up, minimizing bias. In this report, we describe the visual outcomes, monitoring and treatment frequency, cessation of treatment in the study eye, and survival for up to 5 years in participants who were enrolled in the IVAN clinical trial.</p>
            <sec id="sec1">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="p0030">The IVAN trial findings and detailed protocol have been described.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Briefly, this trial was conducted in 23 sites across the United Kingdom and enrolled 610 participants with a diagnosis of treatment naïve nAMD. A factorial design was used with study eyes randomized to 1 of 2 anti-VEGF drugs ranibizumab or bevacizumab, and monthly versus treatment as needed.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> After release from the IVAN protocol (last participant released from protocol in October 2012), all patients were managed within the National Health Service with free access to health care. The IVAN trial,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> including this follow-up study, is covered by the original trial registration (ISRCTN92166560) and approved by the office of the research ethics committees Northern Ireland (07/NIR03/37). Participants’ written informed consent at enrollment in the IVAN trial allowed for continued follow-up through collection of clinical data after participants exited the trial but not for any additional research visit.</p>
              <p id="p0035">For the follow-up study,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> we invited all surviving participants who had not withdrawn from the trial to confirm their consent for passive collection of data from their medical records. Participants were also invited to attend an extra study visit. Ethics approval was obtained for passive collection of data for participants who had died during the follow-up period (15/NI/0177). We also asked surviving IVAN participants if they wanted to withdraw their original consent, that is, precluding passive data collection. Those who attended the research visit gave written informed consent for the extra visit at the time of attendance.</p>
              <p id="p0040">The research adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. An independent study steering committee appointed by the funder had oversight of the scientific integrity of the follow-up study.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p id="p0045">The IVAN follow-up study is a multicenter cohort study of all participants who had completed the IVAN clinical trial and who had not withdrawn their consent.</p>

              <sec id="sec1.2">
                <title>Study Population</title>
                <p id="p0050">The eligible study population for the IVAN follow-up study comprised 537 of the original 610 participants who completed 24 months of follow-up, had not withdrawn, and had been treated at a center participating in the follow-up study.</p>

                <title>Outcome Measures</title>
                <p id="p0055">The primary outcome was the rate of change in distance visual acuity (DVA) per year during usual care monitoring and treatment of the study eye during follow-up (duration of study eye monitoring), based on all the routinely collected measurements. These measurements were not made to a mandated protocol with refraction. Thus, we distinguish DVA from best-corrected distance visual acuities (BCVA), the latter having been obtained during the IVAN trial or at the research visit for this follow-up study. Other outcome measures were frequencies of visits and injections during study eye monitoring, retinal morphology from the most recent retinal images available (to be reported elsewhere), and length of survival.</p>

                <p id="p0060">Information extracted from medical records included dates of all usual care visits, DVA at every visit, and anti-VEGF drug used on release from protocol and any subsequent changes in treatment along with the relevant dates.

                <p id="p0065">Duration of study eye monitoring after release from protocol was defined as the period of active surveillance of the study eye only up to the time of data collection. Study eye monitoring was considered as having stopped if the patient was described in the medical record as having been discharged from the participating hospital clinic into community care or if treatment was only being administered to the contralateral eye. This latter definition was applied when the date of the most recent injection to the study eye was 1 year or more before the most recent usual care visit and more recent injections were administered only to the fellow eye. The duration of study eye monitoring was not revised if treatment was restarted in the study eye after discharge or after study eye monitoring had been discontinued. All visits and injections were counted during the period of study eye monitoring. If injections were recorded with intervals &lt;25 days, these were assumed to be recording errors and merged with the intervention assigned to later of the 2 dates.</p>

              <p id="p0140">This report describes the long-term functional outcomes in participants in the IVAN trial after release from protocol. Our main findings were as follows:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>•</label><p id="p0145">DVA in the study eye deteriorated by more than 4 letters per year during the follow-up period.

Approximately one-fifth of study eyes switched treatment from ranibizumab to aflibercept.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="p0160">Our findings confirm those of other long-term follow-up studies that anti-VEGF therapy has radically altered the natural history of untreated nAMD; overall, one-third of study eyes had a DVA of 68 letters or better 3 to 5 years after exiting the IVAN trial (i.e., 5–7 years after starting anti-VEGF treatment), maintaining a level of vision that allowed participants to continue driving. To estimate VA changes over time in patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy, investigators have attempted to obtain information on participants after exit from major clinical trials.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> However, the completeness of data has been a potential source of bias since the majority of trials and real world studies have reported data from less than 50% of their original cohorts.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0165">The most complete follow-up data to date are from the CATT trial, which measured BCVA 5 years after enrollment in 647 participants (70.7% of 914 invited to attend a research visit and 57.9% of those who had completed 2 years in the trial).<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Mean BCVA among this group declined by 11 letters over 3.5 years since trial exit, that is, 3.14 letters per year. Among those who attended for the research visit, the mean change in BCVA from IVAN exit to the research visit provides the best comparison; we found that this was −19.7 letters over 5.3 years (BCVA at IVAN exit = 71.5 letters [SD, 14.3] and BCVA at research visit = 51.8 letters [SD, 26.2]), that is, 3.72 letters per year. This estimate contrasts with the average reduction in DVA during study eye monitoring when the entire IVAN cohort including those who died during follow-up are included. We observed a reduction in DVA of 4.3 letters per year, based on the data that were available for 99% of the eligible cohort, highlighting the bias that can arise when only a selected subset of participants are considered. This type of bias has likely occurred in those reports in which the estimates of visual acuity decline are low. For example, Berg et al<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> reported an overall loss of 2.1 ETDRS letters compared with baseline after 8 years of follow-up (and an improvement of 6.1 letters in the first year) using a treat and extend regimen, but less than 40% of the original cohort were included in the long-term VA outcomes. A recent study of 67 patients reported a mean VA after 7 years of follow-up of 65 letters (∼7 letters better than baseline) but only included 6.7% of patients who met their specific follow-up criteria.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0170">We chose to estimate the change in DVA during study eye monitoring (i.e., active surveillance), recognizing that participants might continue to attend usual care visits for surveillance and treatment of the fellow eye. We considered this to be the most appropriate period over which to estimate change, because it represents the time during which there was active management of the study eye to control neovascular lesion activity. Because we had limited information on reasons why study eye monitoring was stopped, we assumed that it ended on the date of the most recent study eye injection if that date was 1 year or more before the most recent usual care visit and injections were continuing to the fellow eye.</p>
              <p id="p0175">The multivariable analysis of DVA showed that the rate of deterioration during study eye monitoring was unaffected by the BCVA level at IVAN exit. This finding is concordant with previously published data on the outcomes of nAMD treated with anti VEGF therapies.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The multivariable analysis also revealed a strong interaction between age and time: DVA declined faster in older participants. Several studies<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> have identified increasing age as an adverse predictor of visual outcome but have merely reported findings for dichotomized age groups, for example, comparing those aged 80 years and above with those younger than 80 years of age. Our finding is of high clinical relevance both for counseling and in the management of patients, acknowledging that age is likely a proxy for complex underlying comorbidity.</p>
              <p id="p0180">We also provide information on visit and injection rates by BCVA category at IVAN exit. We observed the lowest injection rates in study eyes were in the worst BCVA category at IVAN exit but accompanied by only a marginally lower visit rate compared with the other categories of BCVA, indicating that monitoring of the study eye was continuing despite the low level of vision. It was also notable that study eyes with BCVA better than 38 letters but less than 67 letters (the 2 middle categories of BCVA at IVAN exit) had similar visits and injection rates as the best BCVA category. Of note, injection rate did not significantly influence the rate of VA loss as shown in the multivariable model. This finding should be viewed with caution because it is contrary to other studies that report better VA outcomes with higher injection rates.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In support of our observation, we have provided information on the distribution in injection rates across individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S6</xref> [available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aaojournal.org" id="intref0090">www.aaojournal.org</ext-link>] in addition to the multivariable effects shown in detail in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There are 2 reasons why we believe our findings are robust. First, we calculated injection rate by each year of follow-up and analyzed its effect as a time-varying covariate, along with a sensitivity analysis. Second, we distinguished between a main effect of injection rate and the interaction of injection rate and time. Neither effect was statistically significant, and the point estimates were small (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>): −0.5 letters (main effect, at IVAN exit: eyes read 0.5 letters fewer per additional 3 injections) and 0.2 letters (interaction: eyes read 0.2 letters more per year per additional 3 injections).</p>
              <p id="p0185">We identified a group of study eyes in which the anti-VEGF agent that was commenced at IVAN exit was subsequently changed at some point during study eye monitoring. Compared with study eyes that were maintained on the same treatment throughout monitoring, switchers were younger, had marginally better BCVA at IVAN exit, were monitored for longer, and had similar DVA at the end of study eye monitoring to non-switchers. We did not attempt to compare the rate of change in DVA per year in study eyes or the number of treatments given in switchers with non-switchers because switch occurred at different times during study eye monitoring and the comparison would have been confounded by differences in the characteristics of the participants.</p>
              <p id="p0190">Although CATT reported a higher frequency of treatments compared with IVAN in their 5-year follow-up,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> their visual acuity outcomes were similar to ours. Westborg et al<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> reported an average of 21 injections over a 7-year period from treatment initiation, and the gain in VA seen in initial years was lost with a mean change of −1 letter from baseline at the final follow-up. However, these represent findings from less than one-fifth of the original cohort of 322 patients, because data from 82% were not included.</p>
              <p id="p0195">The data on injection rates in the IVAN follow-up study are not easily compared with other published data for 2 main reasons. First, most long-term follow-up studies cite the injection numbers from treatment initiation that will reflect the high frequency of treatments in the early years after diagnosis. Second, in these studies, no data are available on participants lost to follow-up temporarily or permanently. Most studies have not reported data on reasons for ceasing treatment. Injection rate is also particularly susceptible to bias from attrition, because injections that are administered in those who are lost to follow-up cannot be counted. Unlike in previous studies, we calculated injection rates for almost all participants after release from trial protocol, including patients who had died during study eye monitoring.</p>
              <sec id="sec3.1">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p id="p0200">Key strengths of the study are the high proportion of the trial cohort for whom we collected information and the resistance to attrition during follow-up of the rate of change in DVA in usual care, our chosen visual function measure. We were able to analyze the rate of change in DVA because we extracted information on this measure at all usual care visits. We also showed that in a subset of participants who attended a research visit, DVA at the most recent monitoring visit agreed well with BCVA measured at the research visit. In this regard, our data differ markedly from real world studies<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the longer-term follow-up outcomes reported on participants previously enrolled in RCTs of anti-VEGF therapies for nAMD.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Given these strengths, we believe that our findings should provide a reference of the decline in visual acuity that ophthalmologists and health policy makers should expect to observe when treating nAMD with anti-VEGF drugs over 5 to 7 years after starting treatment.</p>
                <p id="p0205">There are 4 main limitations of the study. First, approximately one-half of the IVAN cohort were being actively monitored at the time data were extracted. However, we obtained data on 95% of IVAN participants from their usual care visits, and their trajectories were estimated over the period in which they received usual care; therefore, we believe that the estimates of decline in DVA that we show are likely to represent a truer picture than that reported previously.</p>
                <p id="p0210">Second, for the majority of the cohort we depended on DVAs measured in usual care. A large proportion of these were obtained on ETDRS charts, and by comparing DVA at the last monitoring visit with BCVA at the research visit among participants who attended a research visit within 60 days, we were able to show the validity of the DVA measurements (the average difference was only 1.8 letters). Third, we were unable to be sure when monitoring of the study eye ceased. This date was known when the fellow eye never developed nAMD during the IVAN trial or the follow-up study or when the fellow eye had a nAMD lesion on IVAN entry that was never treated. However, we did not know the date when study eye monitoring ceased if the fellow eye developed a nAMD lesion during the IVAN trial or follow-up study and continued to receive treatment after treatment to the study eye ceased. In these instances, we inferred the date on the basis of the time of cessation of treatment to the study eye if treatment continued in the fellow eye. Fourth, although the patterns of re-treatment that we observed suggest in the main that a pro re nata approach to patient management was used by the majority of sites, it is possible that a treat-and-extend posology was being used in some patients because this has been adopted widely in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in recent years.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However, our data collection finished in August 2017, and we did not observe the emergence of any change in the patterns of re-treatment; therefore, we do not have evidence on how the treat-and-extend posology might have influenced visual outcomes. Nonetheless, images that were analyzed from the most recent patient visit suggested that the majority of eyes had dormant nAMD lesions as key markers of lesion activity consisting of intraretinal and subretinal fluid that were absent in the majority of eyes (data not reported or shown in this article).</p>
                <p id="p0215">In conclusion, 6 years after enrollment in IVAN, we have shown that approximately one-third of eyes with nAMD treated with anti-VEGF therapies can retain a level of vision that is sufficient for driving, but on average DVA deteriorates by approximately 4.3 ETDRS letters per year. Anti-VEGF injection rate was not an important factor in determining visual acuity outcome because injection rate per se did not influence the rate of DVA loss. Notable new findings include the characterization of the higher rate of visual acuity decline in older people. These data obtained during the IVAN follow-up study have important implications for healthcare providers in terms of planning and resource allocation and for clinicians in terms of patient counseling and treatment planning.</p>
