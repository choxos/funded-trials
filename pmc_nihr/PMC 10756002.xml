                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a purposive sample of patients receiving SRT, the practice nurses who delivered the therapy, and also GPs or practice managers at the participating practices. Qualitative data were explored using framework analysis, and integrated with nurse comments and quantitative data, including baseline Insomnia Severity Index score and serial sleep efficiency outcomes to investigate the relationships between these.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In total, 16 patients, 13 nurses, six practice managers, and one GP were interviewed. Patients had no previous experience of behavioural therapy, needed flexible appointment times, and preferred face-to-face consultations; nurses felt prepared to deliver SRT, accommodating patient concerns, tailoring therapy, and negotiating sleep timings despite treatment complexity and delays between training and intervention delivery. How the intervention produced change was explored, including patient and nurse interactions and patient responses to SRT. Difficulties maintaining SRT, negative attitudes towards treatment, and low self-efficacy were highlighted. Contextual factors, including freeing GP time, time constraints, and conflicting priorities for nurses, with suggestions for alternative delivery options, were raised. Participants who found SRT a positive process showed improvements in sleep efficiency, whereas those who struggled did not.</p>

                  <p>SRT was successfully delivered by practice nurses and was generally well received by patients, despite some difficulties delivering and applying the intervention in practice.</p>

              <p>Insomnia disorder, characterised by persistent problems with sleep initiation and/or maintenance and daytime consequences, is associated with mental and physical conditions and significantly impaired quality of life.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Affecting 10%–12% of adults, it is the commonest sleep disorder and the second most prevalent mental health complaint in Europe.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The economic impact of insomnia is high because of the direct and indirect costs associated with increased healthcare usage, absenteeism, reduced productivity (‘presenteeism’), and accidents.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Current guidelines recommend cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the first-line treatment,<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but lack of access to CBT-I in primary care<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> means GPs provide sleep hygiene advice, hypnotics, or sedative antidepressants in preference.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Sleep restriction therapy (SRT), a key ingredient of CBT-I, involves restricting and standardising a patient’s time in bed to address key perpetuating factors, including excessive or irregular time in bed, and daytime napping.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Meta-analysis suggests that SRT can reduce insomnia symptoms,<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> but most trials have been performed in specialist research settings. In one small randomised controlled trial (RCT), a brief version of SRT significantly reduced insomnia severity compared with sleep hygiene alone at 6 months (Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 0.54) when delivered in two sessions by a GP to a highly selected group of patients with insomnia, free from comorbidities or medication use.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The need for a pragmatic trial testing a scalable model of treatment delivery in primary care, with a representative sample of people with insomnia, led to the design of the Health-professional Administered Brief Insomnia Therapy (HABIT) trial.</p>
              <p>HABIT was a parallel, open-label RCT to determine the effectiveness of nurse-delivered SRT compared with sleep hygiene alone in adults (aged ≥18 years) meeting criteria for insomnia disorder recruited within primary care.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Participants randomised to SRT received instructions from the nurse to keep a sleep diary, implement an agreed bed and rise time, and calculate their sleep efficiency before each consultation. Patients received one consultation per week for 4 weeks, adjusting bed and rise times (sleep window) depending on reported improvements in sleep efficiency.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Nurse-delivered SRT was found to be clinically effective in reducing insomnia symptoms and improving sleep-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, mental health-related quality of life, and work productivity at 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow up.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> SRT was also highly likely to be cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>

Lack of access to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, led to the development and evaluation, through a randomised controlled trial, of sleep restriction therapy (SRT), a component of CBT-I, delivered by primary care nurses. This process evaluation of the Health-professional Administered Brief Insomnia Therapy (HABIT) trial of SRT with sleep hygiene compared with sleep hygiene alone, showed that SRT was successfully implemented with high fidelity by nurses and positively received by patients despite some initial difficulty adapting to changes in sleep schedules.</td>

              <p>The current study is a process evaluation of the HABIT intervention, in line with UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines, to understand intervention delivery, fidelity, and acceptability from the perspective of patients, practice nurses, and other stakeholders.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The aim was to explore how nurse-administered SRT in primary care worked, by examining implementation, mechanisms of impact, and contextual factors. ‘Implementation’ explores how the intervention is delivered and what is delivered, including the training and resources available as well as fidelity of delivery and any adaptations made. ‘Mechanisms of impact’ explores the impact on participants, including perceived benefits and unintended or adverse effects. Exploring ‘contextual factors’ affecting implementation can help to understand the potential for sustaining and scaling the intervention more widely.</p>

                <title>Qualitative interviews</title>
                <p>Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with patients who had received SRT, nurses delivering the intervention, and the practice managers or GPs at participating practices, using separate interview schedules (see Supplementary Boxes S1–S3).</p>
                <p>The aim was to interview 15 patients, five in each of the three trial areas: Oxford, Manchester, and Lincolnshire. Patients were asked during their baseline assessment appointment for consent to be interviewed. Interviewees were selected from those consenting who had completed SRT within 6 months of interview, allowing exploration of how participants felt at various stages of the intervention. All nurses who delivered the intervention were contacted by the research team following consent and interviewed to explore their perceptions of providing SRT. Finally, practice managers or GPs from each participating practice were invited for interview, and those who consented were asked about their perceptions of the impact on the practice, and the sustainability and scalability of the intervention. Interviews were conducted by telephone and were digitally recorded and transcribed.</p>

                <title>Quantitative data</title>
                <p>Patient interviewees’ perceptions of the intervention were compared with two quantitative measures, baseline Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep efficiency recorded at each intervention session. ISI is a seven-item self-reported questionnaire, scoring between 0 and 28, which assesses the severity, nature, and impact of insomnia,<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> whereas sleep efficiency is the percentage of time in bed spent asleep (0%–100%), which typically increases in participants for whom SRT is successful. Self-reported sleep efficiency was measured with a sleep diary over 7 days at baseline, and during the nurse intervention (recorded in nurse notes for treatment sessions 2–4). Sleep efficiency was also measured at baseline using actigraphy in all participants and in a proportion of participants at 3- and 6-month follow up. Fidelity assessments of audiotaped consultations were conducted by a clinical psychologist (one of the authors independent of the initial analysis) using a bespoke rating system and expressed as a percentage score.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

              <p>Nurses are designated by number and whether they were a clinical research network nurse (CRN nurse) or practice nurse (Nurse). As a result of a lack of availability of nurses at specific practices, two regions utilised research nurses (employed by their local CRN rather than practice nurses). Local CRN research nurses covered &gt;1 practice and therefore 13 nurse participants were interviewed.</p>

                  <p>Practice staff felt it would be helpful to designate specific times and days for the SRT clinic to be held. This would help staff organise clinics, book patients for appointments, and free up time for nurses to complete additional administrative tasks associated with SRT delivery. One suggestion was to consider treating SRT like other behaviour change clinics, including using set weekly times:
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">‘The way I see it running is, if we treat it like a behaviour change intervention, just like our weight management courses.’</italic></p><attrib>(Practice manager 5)</attrib></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Several practice managers wondered about using other staff members such as healthcare assistants:
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">‘We have a very capable HCA</italic> [healthcare assistant]<italic toggle="yes">, who would be more than capable of actually sitting and going through this with someone; and obviously that would be a lot more cost effective.’</italic></p><attrib>(Practice manager 2)</attrib></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Small group therapy sessions were also suggested as a means of delivery and a way of optimising nurse time:
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">‘I think it probably is good for the patients as well because as a group meeting for that education and going through it, there’s like a bit of a support group there for them as well.’</italic></p><attrib>(CRN nurse 1)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">‘… for me I think a group environment with a nurse would have been just as effective as the one to one.’</italic></p><attrib>(Patient AF57)</attrib></disp-quote></p>
                  <p>Practice staff, including GPs, were supportive but had reservations about time constraints, availability, and set days for clinics. To ensure the intervention could be delivered in routine general practice, suggestions were made that SRT should be delivered in the format of other behavioural interventions (for example, smoking cessation and weight management).</p>

Supplementary Table S1 provides a joint display of baseline ISI and baseline and subsequent sleep efficiency data together with summary extracts from any notes made by the nurses during the SRT sessions and a ‘representative’ quote from each patient regarding the SRT process. This indicated, not unexpectedly, that participants who found SRT a positive process were more likely to show improvements in sleep efficiency, whereas those that struggled with SRT did not. Fidelity of nurse delivery was found to be high throughout the trial by the independent reviewer (audiorecordings for session 1, median percentage fidelity score 100% [IQR 96–100], and for session 3, median percentage fidelity score 87.5%, [IQR 75–100]).

                <p>This was a process evaluation of, to the authors’ knowledge, the largest pragmatic clinical trial of psychological therapy for insomnia to date delivered in primary care. A limitation of this study is that the participants interviewed had mostly completed all four SRT sessions. The authors did, however, speak to one participant who left the intervention midway because of an underlying health condition. A better understanding of why people withdrew from the intervention might inform changes to the intervention and ongoing support, leading to better retention.</p>

                <title>Comparison with existing literature</title>
                <p>Patients and nurses reported that they were able to quickly grasp the purpose of SRT and related processes. Patients preferred face-to-face consultations and felt that these helped maintain motivation. Although face-to-face interactions have been found to be preferred in some studies, overall the evidence is lacking that therapeutic alliance, disclosure, empathy, attentiveness, or participation differs in face-to-face compared with telephone delivery of psychological interventions.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Some patients found calculating sleep efficiency difficult and felt that they needed help from the nurse, and nurses pointed out that helping someone with calculations over the telephone was harder than in person.</p>
                <p>All patients interviewed found the first week of therapy difficult because of reduced time in bed and strict bed and rising times. This is consistent with previous evaluations of SRT, where participants reported worsening of daytime functioning in the first week with improvements felt after a period of adjustment.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Previous research has shown that restriction of time in bed out-performs fixed bed and rise times without restriction.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This suggests that although the initial increase in side effects is challenging, they may also be a necessary part of the therapy linked to the need to harness homeostatic sleep pressure.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In this study there was negotiation between the nurses and the patients regarding sleep times and the need for flexibility, which was supported to some extent by the protocol.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Changing ingrained behaviours, in this case fixed night-time (or daytime nap) routines, was challenging, and the flexibility on the part of the nurses allowed patients to feel some level of control. The flexibility was built into the protocol, and so did not affect the fidelity of delivery. One nurse interviewed did mention sharing delivery of the intervention with a colleague for one patient, which would only have been problematic if the patient was given inconsistent advice.</p>
                <p>Participants reported adverse effects such as increased tiredness, ‘exhaustion’, and worries about driving, which have been found in other studies.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Others reported sleep disturbance because of menopause and use of sleep aids (for example, sedatives) that affected allocated sleep time, which should be considered in future rollouts of SRT.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Implications for research and practice</title>
                <p>Patients that did have improved sleep efficiency also reported concerns, most commonly that 4 weeks of SRT was not long enough. All participants found the first week of the intervention very difficult as their body adjusted to limited time in bed. By the third week some were seeing significant benefits. For example, one participant who had improvements in sleep efficiency spoke of being woken by their alarm for the first time in years. Others only started to see benefits by the final week and as such felt the loss of support at the end of the intervention had a direct impact on their motivation to continue. Those that saw improvements earlier expressed being more likely to continue after treatment, whereas those that felt benefits later were more likely to revert to previous habits. One patient reported taking a nap in the afternoon the day after the final session and that they quickly reverted to their previous habits as there was no-one ‘watching over them’. This is a significant finding that indicated the importance of individual, personalised delivery with regular checks continuing for some until new habits and sleep patterns were reinforced. It may be relevant to think about cost-effective refinements to SRT based on these findings, such as extending SRT weekly sessions beyond 4 weeks.</p>
                <p>Previous research has shown that it was possible for a GP to deliver an adapted version of SRT in general practice,<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and this current study confirmed that it was possible for practice nurses to consistently deliver the intervention. Practice managers and GPs also agreed that the intervention could be successfully delivered by nurses in this setting, which they considered may free up time for GPs. Suggestions to facilitate wider roll out included setting up specific clinics at set times that could be run by healthcare assistants, and running small group sessions like other behaviour change clinics (for example, smoking cessation or weight loss), but this would require further evaluation.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, SRT can be successfully delivered by nurses in general practice and was generally well received by patients. Ongoing support after the initial intervention period should be assessed to determine whether this leads to improved adherence and outcome.</p>
