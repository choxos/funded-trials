                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Healthcare technologies are becoming more commonplace, however clinical and patient perspectives regarding the use of technology in the management of childhood asthma have yet to be investigated. Within a clinical trial of asthma management in children, we conducted a qualitative process evaluation that provided insights into the experiences and perspectives of healthcare staff and families on (i) the use of smart inhalers to monitor medication adherence and (ii) the use of algorithm generated treatment recommendations.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Staff and families indicated that there were technical issues associated with the smart inhalers. While staff suggested that the smart inhalers were good for monitoring adherence and enabling communication regarding medication use, parents and children indicated that smart inhaler use increased motivation to adhere to medication and provided the patient (child) with a sense of responsibility for the management of their asthma. Staff were open-minded about the use of the algorithm to guide treatment recommendations, but some were not familiar with its’ use in clinical care. There were some concerns expressed regarding treatment step-down decisions generated by the algorithm, and some staff highlighted the importance of using clinical judgement. Families perceived the algorithm to be a useful technology, but indicated that they felt comforted by the clinicians’ own judgements.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>The use of technology and individual data within appointments was considered useful to both staff and families: closer monitoring and the educational impacts were especially highlighted. Utilising an algorithm was broadly acceptable, with caveats around clinicians using the recommendations as a guide only and wariness around extreme step-ups/downs considering contextual factors not taken into account.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Technological advancements in healthcare are rapidly evolving and transforming patient experiences and outcomes both within the UK and around the world [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several national and global policies and frameworks have been developed to encourage and govern the introduction of healthcare technologies into standard practice [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The advantages of healthcare technology over “traditional” healthcare include standardising care, limiting medical errors, providing better coordinated care, improving effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions, equity and increasingly pro-active surveillance [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Healthcare technologies can be used to monitor and manage patient results, communicate health related information, allow real-time outcomes to be measured and facilitate clinical decision making in a range of chronic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], including asthma [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Childhood asthma care is an area in which technology is starting to be introduced [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Over 8 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with asthma, and the incidence is higher in children than in adults [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The prevalence of asthma in the paediatric population (worldwide) is approximately 11% [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Healthcare technologies could potentially help many individuals manage their asthma. One form of healthcare technology which is increasingly used as part of asthma management is the smart inhaler, or adherence monitor, and this provides an objective measure of adherence to asthma preventer treatment, delivered by inhaler [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A second genre of healthcare technology used for the provision of care of childhood asthma is digital support tools, or algorithms, which aid clinical decision making [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Parent and healthcare staff perspectives on healthcare technologies, such as smart inhalers, for asthma care in children have been described in prior studies [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The use of algorithms in decision making for asthma care has been explored [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but not specifically within the context of childhood asthma. Within a randomised clinical trial of asthma management in children, we conducted a qualitative process evaluation which provided insight with regards to the experiences and perspectives of healthcare staff and families on (i) the use of smart inhalers to monitor medication adherence and (ii) the use of algorithm generated treatment recommendations.</p>

                <title>Context</title>
                <p>The current study was embedded within the RAACENO trial (Reducing Asthma Attacks in Children using Exhaled Nitric Oxide) [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (trial registration: ISRCTN67875351). RAACENO explored whether the addition of exhaled nitric oxide measurements to usual care reduced asthma attacks among children, and used both smart inhalers and a web-based algorithm to inform treatment decision making. The trial involved 12 months of participation by 509 children aged 6–15 years, with assessments 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after randomisation. Participants were randomised to the intervention group, which used Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) measurements to inform treatment decisions, or the control group which did not consider FeNO measurements. In both groups, treatment recommendations were guided by a web-based algorithm developed for the purpose of this trial (described elsewhere–[<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). The algorithm considered current asthma symptoms, treatment adherence, current treatment and (in the intervention arm) FeNO measurements. The research teams entered data into the algorithm at baseline and at each follow-up visit, and this algorithm made a recommendation in terms of stepping up (increasing) the child’s asthma preventer treatment, stepping down (decreasing) the treatment, or maintaining the same treatment. Participants in both groups were provided with a smart inhaler to measure adherence to treatment.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This was a primary qualitative process evaluation that used semi-structured interviews with trial staff and families (children with their parents). The process evaluation initially set out to explore experiences and ascertain acceptability of the trial intervention, and to solicit in depth feedback on taking part in the trial from the perspectives of both families and trial staff. The process evaluation used qualitative interviews to collect data, but it was not designed to be an in-depth qualitative study with an underpinning philosophy used to guide the conduct of it. We nevertheless elected to report the findings in this paper as additional insights that emerged around the use of technology in the management of childhood asthma.</p>
                <p>Two separate topic guides were used for interviews with trial staff and families (see <xref rid="pone.0280086.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). These were designed and developed by two researchers (HMM and DB). The topic guides were revised after a short internal pilot. Audio recordings of the practice interviews were assessed by two researchers (LL and HMM) who adjusted the order of the questions presented within both topic guides based on the content of the audio recordings and in response to feedback received from the (pilot) interviewees. An iterative approach was adopted to revising the topic guides throughout the qualitative process evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Both interview guides explored perspectives related to recruitment, randomisation, the smart inhalers, algorithm, and the future of asthma management.</p>

                  <title>Staff</title>
                  <p>We aimed to recruit five research nurses, based on the literature and our experience of conducting qualitative health research. We revised this target to 15–20 participants (expanded to include different roles)–this was in response to informal feedback and conversations with sites. We elected to recruit more staff members compared to families because they played a key role in implementing the algorithm recommendations. We also considered that there was a diversity and richness of experiences and insights to be gleaned from staff at different sites and performing diverse roles.</p>
                  <p>Email invites were distributed to a purposive sample of members within research teams who occupied various roles in the trial (e.g., Research Nurses, Consultants and Principal Investigators) across ten different UK sites. These sites were selected to obtain interview data from staff who worked with different levels of recruitment to the RAACENO trial (smaller vs. larger numbers) and based on trends that demonstrated the sites associated with low/high adherence to algorithm recommendations. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant low uptake of individuals responding to our initial invite at the time, we elected to adopt a convenience sampling method to improve recruitment figures. Reminder invites were subsequently distributed and staff at three additional sites were approached. Interviews with trial staff who agreed to participate were arranged and conducted by a researcher (LL) who was not known to the participants prior to data collection.</p>
                  <p>Fifteen trial staff members were included in the final sample size. An additional three individuals had initially expressed interest in participating but 1 was unavailable due to the pressures of the pandemic and 2 did not reply to further contacts. Data saturation became evident following the first 6 interviews [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but data collection continued to ensure we obtained a more representative sample of staff occupying various roles within the trial and at different sites [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The researcher introduced herself as a qualitative researcher with no involvement in clinical data collection. Interviews were conducted via telephone, audio-recorded and transcribed by an external transcription company. Field notes were generated to facilitate data analysis. Participants were interviewed from March 2020 till June 2020.</p>

                  <title>Families</title>
                  <p>We set out to interview 20 families drawn from both arms of the trial. Families were first approached and invited by research nurses across seven trial sites. Site selection was initially based on recruitment levels at sites and the convenience of accessing the hospitals for face-to-face interviews based on geographical location (prior to the requirement for remote working due to COVID-19). Thereafter, potential interviewees identified by research nurses as interested in being interviewed were followed up by one researcher (HMM) by telephone during the study and then approached again by the research nurses at their 6-, 9- or 12-month assessments to ask whether they would still be happy to be interviewed following their 9-month (penultimate) or 12-month (final) assessment (see <xref rid="pone.0280086.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> for further information regarding participant follow-up procedures). Of the 17 families who initially expressed interest in participating, 6 families (mother-child pairs) were interviewed between March 2020 till May 2020. The remainder of those who initially expressed an interest in taking part did not reply to further invitations. Interviews were conducted by a researcher (LL) who had no previous correspondence with the families and who introduced herself as a qualitative researcher independent from the clinical team involved in the data collection and analysis for the host trial. Interviews were conducted via telephone, audio-recorded and transcribed by an external transcription company. Field notes were generated to facilitate data analysis. Recruitment continued for both trial staff and families until data saturation was reached.</p>

                <p>This RAACENO study, including this interview component, was reviewed and approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (IRAS 212541). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Written consent was provided by 3 staff members who were interviewed at the beginning of the data collection process. Due to the pandemic, verbal consent was obtained (and approved by the ethics committee) for the remainder of the interviews. Verbal consent was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim (provided by parents for the family interviews).</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p><underline>A thematic approach was used to analyse transcripts from the qualitative interviews within and across cases, and data management was assisted by Microsoft Excel/Word.</underline> Initially, one researcher (LL) identified key themes and categories by listening to the interviews via the audio recordings and reading the associated transcripts. This was part of the process of coding data and developing themes. A second researcher (HMM) conducted a more granular analysis, independently, by reviewing the transcripts line-by-line and generating common themes representing topical ideas that were identified within the data. Both researchers (LL and HMM) met to discuss the themes that resulted from these independent analyses and agreed on the key findings from within the data. Notes taken during interviews by the interviewer (LL) were referred to during analysis. Transcripts were not returned to participants for feedback. Findings were reviewed by the local RAACENO team and trial steering committee.</p>

                  <title>Smart inhalers</title>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Technological challenges</italic>. Overall, smart inhalers were perceived to be generally appreciated, but with some technical problems relating to recording/uploading data (9RN1, 8RN1, 7RN1, 6CT2, 5RN1, 4RN1, 3CT1). Accuracy of the smart inhaler data indicating patient usage was questioned by one staff interviewee (3CT1). There was disappointment if a score had to be disregarded:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“In the beginning a few seemed to work, but towards the end I was disappointed not to be able to show the parents good results if they said their child was being compliant…So we had to you know, to ignore the [adherence] score even though the child… the child wanted to beat their last score and it could be disappointing…” (2RN1).</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Monitoring adherence</italic>. Smart inhalers were considered good for monitoring adherence (8RN1) and providing an objective index of adherence (6RN1), as well as for setting targets:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“… The ones that were downloaded, they were really happy with them and it gave them a focus. One of my early recruits, hers always worked amazing and her mum was really good at encouraging her and saying, “Right, we want the number higher next time, come on, we want better there,” you know? So really used it as a tool to encourage them…” (5RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Staff believed that adherence improved (6CT2) and thought that smart inhalers for non-adherent children (9RN1) were ‘a bit of a game’ with tech to monitor adherence (7RN1) and to manage some patients (6RN3), although it was acknowledged that some would probably not take their inhalers properly even if monitored (6RN3). For example:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“What you don’t want to be doing is to continually escalate doses down an algorithm when in fact the reality is, is they’re not taking their medicine at the required frequency.” (4CT2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some families were reportedly excited about seeing the results and their performance (6RN1), but it was identified as a potential reason for drop out of children who were not adherent (7RN1). However, even when adherence was low, families did not seem to mind being monitored (6CT2), although one clinician mentioned the ‘big brother’ factor:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“I think there is a big brother factor, they get a bit anxious about us scrutinising how well they take their medicines. But having something that brings it to the forefront so that you can have an honest discussion I think is very, very valuable.” (4CT2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Enabling communication</italic>. The data were useful for facilitating ‘difficult conversations’, for example, helping to have conversations and improve adherence to see asthma under better control (3CT1); discussing when adherence had drifted off, e.g., during holidays (8RN1); and uncovering when a child had not been taking medication with parents assuming that they were (7RN1). Improved adherence of some was reported initially, but this was not always sustained (6RN3, 4CT2), although the smart inhalers could be used as an incentive to obtain a score (5RN1, 4CT2, 2RN1). For example:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“I think the children enjoyed that game you know, they always tried to guess what it was going to be and then they tried to beat their score the next time, and they understood how to achieve that and what the significance that inflammation can mean in combination with their lung function test. It helped them to understand it a little bit better and the importance of using their inhaler as per what the doctor said.” (2RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Staff perceived that parents wanted access to their child’s data so that they could monitor them (8RN1) and suggested that it would be better if there was an opportunity for instant download at home rather than in clinic (2RN1). Factors that were concerning staff around data capture, also highlighted above in terms of missing data affecting the algorithm’s recommendation, were: weekends when children go to the other parent and forget the smart device (6CT2, 2RN1) and cut offs/timings automated within the device:</p>

                    <p>“… So, if you’ve got a teenager that’s getting up at 1.00 in the afternoon, they’ll get up, they’ll take their inhaler and then they’ll go and do whatever, and then they’ll take it again, but that was saying “No” for the morning dose because it had a cut off of 12.00…” (6CT2)</p>

                  <p>And being able to check on other aspects was also considered as helpful, e.g., expiry date (8RN1).</p>

                  <title>Familiarity with algorithms—staff perspectives</title>
                  <p>There were a range of considerations regarding experiences and acceptability of the algorithm’s role in the diagnostic and decision-making process. Familiarity with using algorithms in treatment was a factor: one staff member said that they had never used algorithms before to determine treatment (4RN1). Another expressed a very clear interpretation of what should happen, suggesting that a ‘purist’ would follow the algorithm to the letter (9RN1). Staff seemed to express an open mind to using such an approach in clinical practice. But there were some caveats, for example, as long as it was considered ’reasonable’ (8RN1) or ‘appropriate’ (6CT2), staff said they would accept the recommendation, however, if not, staff explained how they would use it:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“If you were stepping down as you went into the school return in September it made you more anxious if you knew that in historical years that they’d had asthma attacks at that time. So that did influence a minority of patients in terms of whether the algorithm was followed or not.” (4CT2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Concerns regarding step down recommendations</italic>. There was concern if a step-down was recommended in the context of continuing emergency department visits and needing to look more closely (1CT1) or causing emergency department visits through a step-down that led to exacerbation (6CT2). The use of the algorithm was considered to be beneficial when a step down meant that a patient could be returned to community care rather than being managed in secondary care (7RN1). For this participant, the algorithm recommendations provided additional evidence which harmonised with their clinical judgement. Internal ‘missing data’ problems and external contextual factors were also considered, for example one staff interviewee said that there may be a problem if the algorithm was not operating on a full dataset due to missing data (6RN1), also highlighted elsewhere where data were missing because the child was staying with their other parent and forgetting their smart inhaler (6CT2).</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Using clinical judgement</italic>. There were perceptions that people–both staff and families–were not accepting of ‘technology’ on its own:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“I think most families who were accepting of the algorithm but only with the proviso that it’s never just the technology and the algorithm, and the doctor can always override that if necessary.” (2RN2)</p>
                    <p>“Reassuring them that the computer’s not dictating to them what’s going to happen, that the doctor will overall decide what’s safe for them.” (2RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Clinician judgement was considered to be critical to applying the algorithm’s recommendation (6RN1) and the notion that understanding among trial participants that the algorithm recommends, and the clinician decides, was highlighted (7RN1). Trust in the consultant and families accepting clinical judgement, whether or not this involved adhering with the algorithm (9RN1), was raised. The notion of ‘computer says no’ and that algorithms are pretty limited was raised, alongside the idea that patients and their families come to see an expert in whom they trust and with whom they have a personal relationship, which cannot be replaced by a computer and algorithm (3CT1). Staff perceived that parents were sometimes reluctant to go ‘too low’ or alarmed about ‘how high’ (8RN1) the algorithm-recommended treatment, and if a parent was unhappy about a step down, staff believed that their feelings needed to be taken into account (6CT2). One staff member indicated:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“Yes, actually fairly frequently, we haven’t agreed with the algorithm. Well, for various reasons. Probably more often that parents have felt a bit more cautious when a step–down is suggested.” (2RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Research nurses checking adherence with the algorithm rather than parents was noted by one site (1CT1) and not using the word ‘algorithm’ with families was highlighted at another (7RN1). Ultimately, providing the best care was the main factor:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“To them it was just like, at the end of the day, we’re going to give you the best care we can and the best treatment” (5RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>In terms of rates of agreement with algorithm recommendations, sites indicated that they had different experiences. For example, at one site, there was an estimate of disagreeing about 20% of the time due to the time of year and triggers (apprehensive about stepping down, 5RN1), whereas at another site, it was suggested that there was disagreement about half of the time (4RN1). One site perceived that the algorithm was ‘chopping and changing’ and preferred more settled treatment (9RN1), whereas another site considered that there were ‘too big jumps’ (8RN1). However, sites expressed satisfaction around obtaining data:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“One of our consultants, in particular, struggled with that a little bit, because you could have a child that would have… so step–downs were frequently suggested and when actually their lung function was decreasing, with those patients we had to override the algorithm.” (2RN1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The need for GPs to have a better tool for use in primary care, i.e., using the algorithm, was noted (1CT1).</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Technological challenges</italic>. Smart inhalers were considered to be useful, but many encountered problems with their accuracy (Family 1, Family 2) and reported that the battery required regular charging (Family 4, Family 3). One parent said that it was difficult to use, even for adults:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“…Obviously from my experience, I work as support worker and when I give my residents the smart inhaler, they don’t know what to do with it, so some… even adult people don’t know what to do with this…” (Family 1)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>There was a suggestion of a battery indicator being helpful (Family 5) and also that children are more tech savvy and would manage charging better than their parents (Family 4). One parent suggested having the option to download at home, perhaps weekly, to monitor their child would have been useful (Family 3). Another parent wanted to buy a smart inhaler:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“…As a parent, it’s been unquestionably my favourite thing about the study. I really echo what she said, I wish that we could buy it. I mean, I said I would buy it for somebody else in the study that maybe couldn’t afford it, I have no idea how much they are, but I know they said it would be difficult to get the software or something on a phone…” (Family 6)</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Motivation and accountability for medication adherence</italic>. Families (parents/children) reported that they liked being monitored (Family 4) and the computer being able to account for adherence to generate recommendations after technical issues were fixed. Most families specifically mentioned that the monitoring was a motivator to be adherent with treatment, even when the asthma was well managed (Family 5, Family 4, Family 2, Family 3, Family 6). One parent said:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“… in my opinion it makes the child a little bit more conscious about making sure they take it knowing that it’s being recorded…” (Family 4)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Two parents described that a child feeling more responsible was a positive consequence of smart inhaler usage (Family 5, Family 6). Smart inhalers encouraged patients to adopt a degree of accountability in terms of their medication adherence. One parent said that their child had learned to manage their asthma better due to their study participation (Family 5).</p>

                  <title>Algorithm</title>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Perspectives on usefulness</italic>. One parent felt that the algorithm made good decisions (Family 5), and another mostly agreed with both the step-ups and step-downs in preventer treatment (Family 4): this was linked to their perception about how the condition was experienced by their child at the time. Another liked the close monitoring with recommendations about stepping up and down and ‘being on the right amount’:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“No, the doctor always just did what the computer recommended. But he always explained it and always said, you know, he always kind of justified it because her asthma had been fine, or because, you know, she hadn’t been on steroids for the previous three months or whatever. So, he always talked it through.” (Family 3)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The fluctuating nature of asthma symptoms (Family 4, Family 3, Family 6) were identified by parents as being relevant to how the algorithm was used. It was noted that the use of the algorithm required flexibility based on the family/patient lifestyle. For example, one family did not adhere to the treatment recommendations for a month, after consulting a clinician, because of travel plans to an area of poor air quality (Family 3). One parent cited that they respected decisions based on the algorithm because they trusted the clinical staff:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“It’s a programme that works out information. I don’t know anything about that, very technology behind, but yeah, they did explain it to me. I just trusted that they knew what they were doing.” (Family 2)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Some parents remembered the word ‘algorithm’ (Family 5) and one said that it was communication on multiple occasions (Family 4), whereas others said they did not remember the word, but felt that the language used by staff to describe the trial interventions was appropriate to their level of understanding (Family 3). In response to questions designed to elicit perceptions of the role of the algorithm in treatment decisions, one said it was initially daunting, but that this seemed acceptable for making recommendations about treatment and was described as ‘clever’:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“…the computer seemed to pick up on all of that, which I think was…I think it was really, really clever. But obviously having… knowing that there was a doctor overseeing it as well was that little bit of reassurance.” (Family 4)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Most parents reported that the algorithm had suggested changes, a step-up/down from current treatment recommendations, on one to three occasions (Family 1). Some liked the fact that a step-down was recommended as this meant taking less medication (or had been taking more than required) (Family 1), but others did not and were anxious about a step-down, even though they also wanted less steroid (Family 6), or a maintained level of treatment based on discussion between parents and clinicians, even where the algorithm suggested no treatment (Family 5). One parent considered algorithm recommendations to be reliable as they seemed to recommend a step-up when the asthma had felt bad but suggested that it would have never recommended no treatment (no medication) and as such was reliable:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“… She did have a bad asthma year the year of the study, but not particularly worse than it would have been anyway, I don’t think. She’s just got pretty bad asthma. But I liked that they were very responsive to everything.” (Family 3)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Enabling communication</italic>. Regarding a step-up decision, one parent liked to be able to have a conversation about the computer recommendation and was reassured that their clinician would not follow the algorithm if everyone perceived a step-up was too big a step (Family 4<italic toggle="yes">)</italic>. Another felt similarly confident that, should they want to override it, for example because the child was not keen due to increased usage of steroids [and the perceived consequence of reduced growth], their consultant would step in:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“… she was really paranoid about the more steroids that she took, the shorter she would end up. So, every time the computer said she needed to increase her steroid dose she said, ‘Oh I don’t think so’.” (Family 2)</p>

The majority of trial participants’ parents reported feeling comforted by the idea that they could ultimately depend on a doctor’s interpretation and overriding the algorithm’s recommendation based on knowledge of the case and adapting to season (Family 1, Family 5), or taking into account a previous bad reaction (Family 6). The fact that the algorithm was being used as a guide and not on its own (Family 5, Family 4, Family 6) was identified as important in the acceptability of the algorithm.</p>

                <title>Principal findings</title>
                <p>Smart inhalers were welcomed by families and clinicians, especially regarding adherence [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0280086.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Staff welcomed data as a way to raise the subject of adherence, a known contentious issue [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] especially with children [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Smart inhalers were not considered as user friendly by our interviewees compared to a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Staff, but not parents, had concerns about ‘big brother’ and surveillance, despite the perceived clinical benefit (see research note [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which discusses interpretations of surveillance and digital technology in healthcare).</p>
                <p>For the algorithm, both staff and parents (and children) expressed confidence in the recommendations, but also maintained how having clinical oversight was important. This is in line with discussions in other areas of healthcare about the role of algorithms and the development of artificial intelligence to guide decision making [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lennartz et al [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] described a sense of “cautious optimism” amongst patients who perceived the clinical capabilities of artificial intelligence in a positive light, yet regarded physician input as superior.</p>
                <p>Concerns around strictly following the algorithm’s treatment recommendations were raised due to contextual factors not being taken into consideration beyond the data considered by the algorithm. Some technical issues/downsides with both smart inhalers (e.g. missing data) and algorithm (e.g. not accounting for seasonal changes) were reported, but the benefits of using novel technology in managing and treating asthma were recognised, especially objective tests [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
                <p>As Lupton indicated [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], establishing the effective and responsible delivery of digital health technologies and collection, protection and sharing of health data is highly complex. Infrastructure, ethical and social issues need to be considered. The training of artificial intelligence using algorithms and patient data also needs to be transparent and accountable to build trust [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

                <title>Implications</title>
                <p>The use of healthcare technologies within healthcare is increasing, and it is important to consider perspectives of stakeholders, e.g. clinical staff and patients. Doing so may limit misunderstandings and concerns regarding technology use. There are currently evidence-based clinical guidelines on the management of asthma available to standardise practices [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These guidelines include information about Computerised Decision Support Systems and its’ use in clinical decision making. As technology is becoming more commonplace, we need clinical guidelines to standardise practices. For example, guidelines should outline suitable algorithms to follow and information pertaining to the implementation of algorithms within the appropriate pathway of treatment (e.g., primary or specialised care). Further research is required to assess whether nurses and consultants might differ in their opinions of algorithm clinical use, particularly if it is to become standardised practice [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths, limitations, and future research</title>
                <p>The main strengths of this qualitative process evaluation are that it was conducted by a team of qualitative researchers with backgrounds in a range of disciplines, undertaken over time in phases, including developing materials and collecting data, with two researchers independently coding and analysing all data [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fact that we were able to collect data during a pandemic was also a strength.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, our sample was adapted to include more staff members, but we were unable to achieve our planned recruitment among families. We initially elected to recruit more staff members due to their key role in implementing the interventions within the trial–namely the algorithm. It would have been interesting to interview clinicians regarding intentional non-adherence. However, we consider that saturation was achieved among both staff and the heterogeneous family samples [<xref rid="pone.0280086.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] within six interviews for each group, which we considered to be early. This could be attributed to sample bias, especially among families due to having only managed to recruit participants who were from the intervention group. Furthermore, given that this was a sub-study within a clinical trial, and this paper reports on that process evaluation, it was not possible to resource the recruitment of a larger sample. Researchers should consider our findings and whether it is necessary to pursue small/in-depth or larger surveys on related research to develop knowledge on this topic further.</p>
                <p>The implications of the pandemic encouraged us to adopt a convenience method of sampling, as opposed to purposive, due to time constraints of healthcare professionals. It may have been more insightful to investigate perspectives of trial staff with varied years of clinical experience. Furthermore, as we were unable to interview parents and children separately, it is unclear whether they may have provided different responses.</p>
                <p>Potential areas for further exploration include the use of lung function scores in algorithm decisions and the involvement of patients and families within trial and intervention designs. It is likely that the involvement of patients and families could improve the acceptability of technological interventions in the future.</p>

              <p>In this qualitative process evaluation, trial staff representing several roles and across different sites were interviewed to understand the acceptability of the intervention from their points of view. Several families (mother and child pairs) were interviewed about their experiences and views, too. Overall, experiences within both groups were positive. Key was that the use of technology and individual data within clinical appointments was considered useful: closer monitoring and the educational impacts were especially highlighted. We also ascertained that using an algorithm was broadly acceptable, with caveats around clinicians using the recommendations as a guide (rather than being dictated by it) and wariness around extreme step-ups/downs considering contextual factors not taken into account by the algorithm.</p>

              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. <!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The topic is relevant, interesting. However, Line 80- 82 describes previous research conducted on the topic. This indicates the sole novelty of this work being a focus on the use of algorithms in decision making, within the context of childhood asthma. if so, would it have been more worthwhile to gather insights from a larger sample on this topic?</p>
              <p>Line 73: Additional details relevant to the cited prevalence rate would be useful such as location. Additional information on the global burden of asthma or at least, in the UK would be useful additions here as well.</p>
              <p>Line 117: The study design is described as a process evaluation, while the title indicates this is a qualitative study. Further, the title as well as early sections which preceded the Methods section point towards a study focusing on the lived experiences of staff and families in this context. The methods section does not sufficiently describe the focus on lived experience, which is essentially the methodology underpinning this work. It also seems quite irrelevant to explore perspectives related to recruitment and randomisation in this context.

              <p>Line 143 states "set out to interview 20 families". However, the final sample size has not been described.</p>
              <p>Line 169: Identification of themes post listening to the audio recording is not a commonly used method. Perhaps use a reference to indicate it has been used by others. Also, it would be useful to explain why member checks were not conducted (e.g. lack of resourcing). Especially, as Line 176 notes findings were reviewed by the clinical teams. Additionally, this is not traditionally an approach undertaken to ensure the findings authentically represent the user experience, which is the purpose of member checks.</p>
              <p>Line 191-193: This seems a poor rationale for the sample size of families recruited into the study, given the focus is on medication adherence, and therefore in particular the experiences of the users.</p>
              <p>If there were 17 families who expressed an interest in participating, did the participant information sheet state that recruitment would be discontinued once saturation had been reached? Did the research team notify the remaining prospective participants that they would not be interviewed as data saturation had been reached? I feel these are important aspects to be addressed in the study design and description.</p>
              <p>The results section is interesting and has been presented well.</p>

              <p>Line 505-506: This claim is not entirely accurate as the methods section noted the first researcher developed themes post listening to audio recordings and therefore could not have undertaken coding of the data.</p>
              <p>I wondered if the data revealed user and staff experiences related to using this technology during a pandemic. It would be an interesting angle to explore if there is existing data on this within the interviews.</p>
              <p>Please review the reference list to ensure formatting is consistent (e.g. journal name is presented in upper and lower case )</p>
              <p>Overall, the findings are relevant, and interesting. However, I would urge the authors to consider the concerns noted above and the overall strength and generalizability of these findings given the small sample size of parents interviewed. Perhaps, it is worthwhile considering the collection of additional data from families who meet the same inclusion criteria and increasing the overall sample size of the research undertaken.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors evaluate healthcare technologies (including treatment recommendation algorithms and smart inhalers) using clinical trials in childhood asthma.</p>
              <p>The paper is logically structured and well-written. The authors could expand the introduction including additional information on the prevalence of asthma.</p>
              <p>In the method, it is recommended to include final sample sizes for staff and families and add justification for the sample size selections.</p>
              <p>It is recommended to justify through references the use of audio recordings.</p>
              <p>The results are presented well. The authors could strengthen the claims with additional references.</p>
              <p>It would be interesting to expand the finding related to the use of technology in pandemics if applicable.</p>

              <p>Thank you very much for reviewing our manuscript. Please see below for our responses to the reviewers. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 Comments:</p>
              <p>1) The topic is relevant, interesting. However, Line 80- 82 describes previous research conducted on the topic. This indicates the sole novelty of this work being a focus on the use of algorithms in decision making, within the context of childhood asthma. if so, would it have been more worthwhile to gather insights from a larger sample on this topic?</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for your positive feedback.</p>
              <p>The reviewer is right that the novelty is algorithms in childhood asthma. The research reported was a qualitative sub-study within a clinical trial. The sample size was limited by the trial study design - it was not possible to resource the recruitment of a larger sample. Nevertheless, the data that we obtained from the interviews was both in-depth and extensive. We reached data saturation for both samples (families and clinical staff). We recommend that teams consider our findings and whether it is necessary for them to pursue small/in-depth vs. larger surveys on related research to develop knowledge on this topic further. This suggestion has been included within the discussion section of the paper (lines 517-520 – tracked changes).</p>
              <p>2) Line 73: Additional details relevant to the cited prevalence rate would be useful such as location. Additional information on the global burden of asthma or at least, in the UK would be useful additions here as well.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for this suggestion. </p>
              <p>We have now included more information about the number of people diagnosed with asthma in the UK and clarified the prevalence of asthma in the paediatric population worldwide. This is highlighted in the introduction section (lines 67-70 – tracked changes). </p>
              <p>3) Line 117: The study design is described as a process evaluation, while the title indicates this is a qualitative study. Further, the title as well as early sections which preceded the Methods section point towards a study focusing on the lived experiences of staff and families in this context. The methods section does not sufficiently describe the focus on lived experience, which is essentially the methodology underpinning this work. It also seems quite irrelevant to explore perspectives related to recruitment and randomisation in this context. Please consider revisiting the framing of the methods section, consider the methodological merits of phenomenology in this research context and either changing the title to indicate this was a process evaluation or reframing the methods section to indicate being more strongly guided by qualitative methodology.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have amended the paper to clarify that this was a process evaluation. </p>
              <p>The process evaluation initially set out to explore experiences and ascertain acceptability of the trial intervention, and to solicit in depth feedback on taking part in this trial from the perspectives of both patients and trial staff. The process evaluation used qualitative interviews to collect data, but it was not designed to be an in-depth qualitative study with an underpinning philosophy used to guide the conduct of it. We nevertheless elected to report the findings in this paper as additional insights that emerged around the use of technology in the management of childhood asthma. We have clarified this within the Design sub-section of the Methods (lines 106-112 – tracked changes). More sophisticated analyses was therefore conducted to examine these additional insights – outlined in the findings section.</p>
              <p>4) Line 135-140 and Line 151-156 are repetitive. Please consider a creative way to present this section to address this.</p>
              <p>Our response:</p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now changed the wording of these sentences. </p>
              <p>5) Line 143 states "set out to interview 20 families". However, the final sample size has not been described.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>The final sample size is described on page 10. We interviewed 6 mother-child pairs.</p>
              <p>6) Line 169: Identification of themes post listening to the audio recording is not a commonly used method. Perhaps use a reference to indicate it has been used by others. Also, it would be useful to explain why member checks were not conducted (e.g. lack of resourcing). Especially, as Line 176 notes findings were reviewed by the clinical teams. Additionally, this is not traditionally an approach undertaken to ensure the findings authentically represent the user experience, which is the purpose of member checks.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included a reference [22] as suggested.</p>
              <p>We recognise the merit of conducting member checks. However, we would like to re-iterate that this was a process evaluation which was designed to solicit in depth feedback on taking part in the trial from the perspectives of both patients and trial staff. Findings were reviewed by clinical teams in order to facilitate the conduct of the trial. It would have been difficult to complete member checks in this context – data collection was undertaken in the first year of the pandemic, when clinical staff time was even more costly. We may have conducted member checks for the data-set arising from the family interviews, but this study was designed as a process evaluation as opposed to an in-depth qualitative project and therefore member checks were not done. </p>
              <p>8) Line 191-193: This seems a poor rationale for the sample size of families recruited into the study, given the focus is on medication adherence, and therefore in particular the experiences of the users.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>The increased sample size of clinical staff, compared to families, arose namely due to feedback which suggested that there were multiple occasions when clinical staff deviated from the treatment recommendations provided by the algorithm. We therefore shifted our focus to establish the reasons behind the deviations. The process for sample selection (families) is described in lines 147-156 (tracked changes). </p>
              <p>We would like to highlight that it was difficult to recruit families – we cannot say with certainty that this was related to the pandemic but do acknowledge that it could have been. Families were approached on 4 separate occasions – firstly by research nurses at selected sites, and thereafter on 3 separate occasions by the qualitative researchers. Families who initially expressed an interest in taking part did not reply to further invitations. </p>
              <p>9) If there were 17 families who expressed an interest in participating, did the participant information sheet state that recruitment would be discontinued once saturation had been reached? Did the research team notify the remaining prospective participants that they would not be interviewed as data saturation had been reached? I feel these are important aspects to be addressed in the study design and description.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>The participant information sheet did not state that recruitment would be discontinued once saturation had been reached. The remaining (prospective) participants were not notified that they would not be interviewed because they did not respond to follow-up invitations (telephone calls). We have included more information related to the procedure used to follow-up potential participants in an Appendix (S1 Appendix). This is also referenced within the manuscript. </p>
              <p>10) The results section is interesting and has been presented well.</p>
              <p>Our response:</p>
              <p>Thank you for this positive feedback. </p>
              <p>11) Line 473-474: is this a novel findings or replicates the study findings referred to in text as (31)?</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>This is a novel finding - we have now clarified within the manuscript that citation 31 is a research note (opinion piece) which discusses interpretations of surveillance and digital technology in healthcare, as opposed to a research study. </p>
              <p>12) Line 478: The strength of this claim will benefit from additional references, if they can be sourced.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for highlighting this. We have now included an additional reference [33] to support this claim. </p>
              <p>13) Line 505-506: This claim is not entirely accurate as the methods section noted the first researcher developed themes post listening to audio recordings and therefore could not have undertaken coding of the data.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>We would like to clarify that listening to the audio recordings was part of the process of coding data and developing themes to describe key issues highlighted. This has been clarified in lines 177-178 (tracked changes). Both researchers coded the data and developed themes. </p>
              <p>14) I wondered if the data revealed user and staff experiences related to using this technology during a pandemic. It would be an interesting angle to explore if there is existing data on this within the interviews.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>We agree that this would have been an interesting angle to explore. We did not collect any data related to the use of technology during the pandemic. </p>
              <p>15) Please review the reference list to ensure formatting is consistent (e.g. journal name is presented in upper and lower case)</p>
              <p>Our response:</p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing this out. This has now been rectified. </p>
              <p>16) Overall, the findings are relevant, and interesting. However, I would urge the authors to consider the concerns noted above and the overall strength and generalizability of these findings given the small sample size of parents interviewed. Perhaps, it is worthwhile considering the collection of additional data from families who meet the same inclusion criteria and increasing the overall sample size of the research undertaken. </p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for your review. Please refer to our previous responses to comments 1 and 8 above. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2 Comments </p>
              <p>Reviewer: The paper is logically structured and well-written. The authors could expand the introduction including additional information on the prevalence of asthma.</p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for the positive feedback. </p>
              <p>We have now included this information in the introduction section (lines 67-70 – tracked changes). </p>
              <p>Reviewer: In the method, it is recommended to include final sample sizes for staff and families and add justification for the sample size selections. </p>
              <p>Our response:</p>
              <p>Please refer to our responses to comments 5 and 8 from Reviewer 1. Lines 125-163 (tracked changes) in the revised paper describe the processes for selecting the samples. The final sample size is described in line 193 (clinical staff) and line 209 (families). </p>
              <p>Reviewer: It is recommended to justify through references the use of audio recordings. </p>

              <p>Thank you. We have presented additional references in the discussion section. </p>
              <p>Reviewer: It would be interesting to expand the finding related to the use of technology in pandemics if applicable. </p>
              <p>Our response: </p>
              <p>We agree that this would have been an interesting angle to explore, this has also been picked up by Reviewer 1. Please refer to our response to comment 14.</p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the “Comments to the Author” section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the “Confidential to Editor” section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: All comments have been addressed</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p>
              <p>3. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>6. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for your comments and revisions,</p>
              <p>Regarding the review comment about the final sample size.</p>
              <p>Authors should update the final sampling size with justification in the section "Sampling and recruitment". Without this, it is confusing and hard to follow from the reader's perspective.</p>
              <p>7. PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?). If published, this will include your full peer review and any attached files.</p>
              <p>If you choose “no”, your identity will remain anonymous but your review may still be made public.</p>
              <p>Do you want your identity to be public for this peer review? For information about this choice, including consent withdrawal, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>[NOTE: If reviewer comments were submitted as an attachment file, they will be attached to this email and accessible via the submission site.

              <p>Editor comment: </p>
              <p>Thanks for the revisions, please address the final comment from R2: "the final sampling size with justification for selecting this size, in the section "Sampling and recruitment". </p>
              <p>Authors' response: </p>
              <p>Thank you for the positive feedback on our manuscript. We have now included the final sample size in the “Sampling and recruitment” section of the methods (line 135, tracked changes – staff sample and line 155, tracked changes – family sample). The justifications for sampling size/method/criteria is also highlighted in the same section (lines 117-123, tracked changes – staff sample, and lines 154-157, tracked changes – family sample). This information was originally presented in the findings section.</p>
              <p>We have changed the order of the references to accommodate for revised changes (as specified above) that included references.</p>
