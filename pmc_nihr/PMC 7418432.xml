                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">PDSAFE is an individually-tailored, physiotherapist-delivered, balance, strength and strategy training programme aimed at preventing falls among people with Parkinsonâ€™s. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PDSAFE compared with usual care for people with Parkinsonâ€™s at higher risk of falling, from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service perspective.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Resource use and quality of life data (EQ-5D-3L) were collected from 238 participants randomised to the PDSAFE intervention and 236 participants randomised to control, at baseline, 3â€‰months, 6â€‰months (primary outcome), and 12â€‰months. Adjusted cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using generalised linear models and uncertainty estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Over 6 months, the PDSAFE intervention was associated with an incremental cost of Â£925 (95%Â CI Â£428 to Â£1422) and a very small and statistically insignificant QALY gain of 0.008 (95%Â CI âˆ’â€‰0.006 to 0.021). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was Â£120,659 per QALY and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at aÂ UK threshold of Â£30,000/QALY was less than 1%. The ICER varied substantially across subgroups although no subgroup had an ICER lower than the Â£30,000 threshold. The result was sensitive to the time horizon with the ICER reducing to Â£55,176 per QALY when adopting a 12-month time horizon and assuming a sustained treatment effect on QoL, nevertheless, the intervention was still not cost-effective according to the current UK threshold.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Evidence from this trial suggests that the PDSAFE intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective at 6 months. The 12-month analysis suggested that the intervention became closer to being cost-effective if quality of life effects were sustained beyond the intervention period, however this would require confirmation. Further research, including qualitative studies, should be conducted to better understand the treatment effect of physiotherapy and its impact on quality of life in people with Parkinsonâ€™s given existing mixed evidence on this topic.</p>

              <p id="Par11">Improving balance and reducing falls are identified as the leading priority of the James Lind Alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] top 10 priorities for people with Parkinsonâ€™s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. People with Parkinsonâ€™s are twice as likely to fall as healthy older people; a recent US study revealed that the overall falls incidence rate ratio comparing people with Parkinsonâ€™s versus non-Parkinsonâ€™s subjects was 2.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88â€“2.24), adjusting for comorbidity and medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Falling can have serious health and quality of lifeÂ consequences such as fractures, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] immobility and fear of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] leading to dependency and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Falling also increases the psychological burden on informal caregivers, increases personal costs (e.g. home alteration), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] as well as costs to the health care system. A recently published (2018) 10-year UK cohort study analysed linked health care data from 7060 people with Parkinsonâ€™s, and the cost of inpatient care was found to be Â£900 per year greater compared to age and sex matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Among the reasons for admission to inpatient care (e.g. infection, dementia etc.), falls and related fractures were most frequently cited, accounting for 13% of the total cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Germany, direct costs among the people with Parkinsonâ€™s who experienced falls was considerably higher than among people with Parkinsonâ€™s who did not fall (â‚¬3180 and â‚¬1300 respectively) due to the longer duration of hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">Frequent and repeated falls are not prevented with medication, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] however, several studies have shown that physiotherapy can be beneficial through exercise, strength and balance training, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] yet it is unclear whetherÂ physiotherapy reduces the rate of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A UK multi-centre, single blind, randomised controlled trial, was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel, home-based physiotherapy programme, PDSAFE, compared to usual care for falls management in people with Parkinsonâ€™s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">Economic evaluation alongside clinical trials compares the cost and outcomes of health care interventions implemented in the randomised arm of the trial and makes recommendations to decision makers regarding intervention cost-effectiveness. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the PDSAFE intervention compared to usual care in people with Parkinsonâ€™s who had a history of falling.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Between 2014 and 2016, 474 participants were randomised to receive the PDSAFE intervention (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰238) or usual care (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰236) for a six-month period. Patients were eligible if they: had a confirmed consultantâ€™s diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s; were independently mobile; experienced â‰¥1 fall in the previous 12â€‰months; scored â‰¥24 on Mini-Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; and were able to give informed consent, understand and follow commands, and complete a guided personalised exercise and strategy programme. These participants were on average aged 71 (SD 7.7) and 73 (SD 7.7) in the intervention and control group, with a mean of 8 (SD 6.6) and 8 (SD 5.8) years of diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s respectively, a median HoehnÂ &amp;Â Yahr scale stage of 3 in both groups, and a mean Movement Disorder Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score of 32 (SD 15.2) and 33 (SD 17.3) respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The proportion of participants that had freezing of gait in the past month prior to randomisation was 64% in the intervention group and 59% in the control group. Both of the groups had a median of 3 falls in the 12â€‰months prior to screening, and 78% in the intervention group and 80% in the control group had repeat falling during the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the 3â€‰months prior to randomisation, the intervention and control participants had a median of 2 and 1 fall respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The trial protocol, including a summary of economic evaluation methods, and the detailed trial primary outcome results are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par15">The PDSAFE programme was personalised to each participant by a physiotherapist through a clinical assessment and targeted specific problems in their home environment. Exercises and strategies were selected from a menu of activities and provided to participants in a booklet accompanied by video vignettes on a DVD. Each participant was provided up to 12 one-hour sessions. Participants in the control group received usual care plus a DVD on Parkinsonâ€™s and one advice session after trial completion. All participants were assumed on appropriate doses of medications during the trial following specialist Parkinsonâ€™s services. The primary outcome was the risk of repeat falling during the 6 months post randomisation.</p>

                <p id="Par16">A â€˜within-trialâ€™ 6-month cost-utility analysis was conducted from the perspective of UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Service (PSS) under the principle of intention-to-treat, following recommendations for good practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Costs included intervention costs and NHS and social care cost. Resource use, and QoL measured using the EQ-5D-3L instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation methodsÂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared with a Â£20,000â€“Â£30,000 per QALY threshold currently applied by UK'sÂ NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses in relation to cost reduction strategies and longer follow-up period up to 12â€‰months were conducted. A non-parametric bootstrap with 1000 iterations was conducted to explore the uncertainty around the ICER estimate. All analyses were undertaken in STATA/SE 12.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Details of methods were previously published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par17">Questionnaires were posted to participants to collect NHS and social care resource use data. These included: i) primary care services (GP visits, routine physiotherapy, etc.), ii) secondary care services (ambulance, hospitalisation, etc.), iii) social care services (home care visits, meals on wheels, etc.), and iv) medication use. Medication was not included in the total costs given the low possibility that the intervention would impact on the consumption of medication, as well as the large number of low-cost medications reported. Unit costs were sourced from the Personal Social Service Research Unit (PSSRU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and the NHS National Schedule of Reference Costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] for a base financial year 2016 (Supplementary material <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

Physiotherapistsâ€™ salaries were estimated based on the UKÂ NHS band six full-time equivalent. Physiotherapists received 2Â days of training, costed as the time spent by the trainer (lead physiotherapist), room hire and training materials. Equipment included printed materials and DVDs of the intervention demonstration provided to each participant in the intervention group, and a variety of assisted equipment provided to a proportion of participants as needed, including weighted vests, balance pads, and steps. All equipment was retained by the physiotherapists and used across participants. Costs associated with the equipment were annualised with aÂ discount rate of 3.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] over the anticipated life span where appropriate.</p>

The imputation was conducted separately within the PDSAFE and control groups. 50 imputed datasets were created. EQ-5D-3L was imputed at the utility value level (rather than at the dimension level), and cost items were imputed as categories (NHS cost excluding hospitalisation, hospitalisation cost, and social care cost) following recommended practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Missingness at item level was imputed with zero assuming no resource was used if any other item within the same cost categories was completed in the questionnaire. Given the relatively high cost of hospitalisation, any missing data in hospitalisation were crossÂ checked with falls diaries before imputation for accuracy purposes.</p>

                <p id="Par21">Adjusted differences in costs and QALYs between the randomised groups were estimated using generalised linear models. Cost and QALYs were estimated using a Gamma distribution and a normal distribution respectively. Baseline utility scores and costs were adjusted. Other covariates adjusted were selected based on statistical significance in a regression predicting the likelihood of missingness from the full list of demographics, medical history, and screening measures. The resulted list of covariates included: age, gender, HoehnÂ &amp;Â Yahr scale, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] Montreal Cognitive assessment score, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] Mini-Mental State Examination score, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] presence of diabetes, history of myocardial infarction, history of ischemic heart disease, history of deep brain stimulation and presence of an informal carer.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The method of recycled predictions was used to estimate mean costs and QALYs of each trial arm. The ICER was estimated by dividing the adjusted cost difference between the randomised groups by the adjusted QALY difference. Uncertainty in the ICER estimate was evaluated using a 1000-iteration bootstrap and the probabilities that the intervention was cost-effective under a wide range of hypothetical thresholds (Â£0 - Â£200,000) were presented in the cost- effectiveness acceptability curve.</p>

                <p id="Par23">A variety of sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact on the cost-effectiveness results. First, an alternative 12-month time horizon analysis was undertaken. In part due to funding cessation, 12-month follow-up data were only available for approximately half of the participants, and cost, outcome and covariate data were imputed for the participants who were not followed up to 12â€‰months. Second, the number of therapy sessions was reduced from the 12 sessions in the base case as implemented in the trial to alternatives of 10 sessions and 8 sessions over a six-month period assuming maintained QoL, to explore the impact of lowering the intervention costs on the cost-effectiveness result. Next, complete case analysis was implemented assuming data were missing completely at random to assess the impact of missing data on the cost-effectiveness results. Lastly, the number of routine NHS physiotherapist visits was excluded from the total cost addressing the possibility that participants could not differentiate between an NHS or trial physiotherapist when answering the questionnaire.</p>

The cost-effectiveness plane crossing the y axisÂ indicates that there was a higher degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimate of the incremental QALY than the estimate of incremental cost, leading to a wide 95% confidence interval for the estimate of ICER.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par30">The results showed that the PDSAFE intervention was unlikely to be cost-effective from an NHS and PSSâ€™s perspective over the trial horizon. There was minimal difference between arms in the total cost of NHS and social service use. The utility values in the intervention group declined slightly less than the control group over the trial period, but the difference was minimal and not statistically significant.</p>
              <p id="Par31">A high degree of uncertainty over the QALYs gained led to a wide confidence interval in the ICER, which may be due to the small mean QALY gained and large variation among the participants. This may also be related to the limitation of the EQ-5D-3L instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] in capturing the impact of the PDSAFE intervention on QoL aspects such as improved falls efficacy and less fear of falling as identified in the effectiveness results and aÂ qualitative investigation as part of the PDSAFE trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Sensitivity analyses indicated that the intervention was more likely to be cost-effective if a 12-month time horizon was adopted. If the difference lasts beyond the 12-month follow-up point, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective would be expected to increase because the cost of intervention would be recouped over a longer time horizon and incremental QALY gainÂ would be larger, however further research would be needed to fully examine this. Exploratory analysis of the observed 6 month data found the treatment effect to be greater among the participants who did not provide 12-month data compared to those who did. This suggests that if those participants were followed up to 12â€‰months, a potentially greater treatment effect at 12â€‰months might have emerged. This may also suggest that the participants who received the intervention later may gain more benefit than the participants who received the intervention early, possibly due to the learning curve of the trialÂ physiotherapists, however these could all be due to chance.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Several studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of exercise programmesÂ or physiotherapy programmesÂ previously and the results were mixed. Clarke et al. (2016) evaluated effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy and occupational therapy versus no therapy in the PD REHAB randomised controlled trial among 762 patients with mild to moderate Parkinsonâ€™s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. They found that individualised physiotherapy and occupational therapy did not have immediate (3 months) or long-term (15â€‰months) clinically meaningful improvements in activities of daily living or QoL measured by PDQ-39. Although no difference in primary outcome was found, the ICER was only Â£3493/QALY (âˆ’Â£169,371 to Â£176,358) with 50.5% probability to be under the Â£20,000 threshold. The authors, noting the wide confidence interval surrounding the ICER as well as the insignificant QALY gain, concluded that the cost-effectiveness result was contingent on a clinically meaningful primary outcome which had not been found. An earlier trial (2012)Â by Fletcher et al. reported a more positive result in favour of a 10-week exercise programme with 0.03 (âˆ’â€‰0.02 to 0.08) incremental QALY gained and Â£35 less health and social care costs, which suggested the intervention was dominant with approximately 80% probability that the intervention was cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The intervention cost Â£76 per participant for the complete 10-week group sessions in community settings in this trial. Notably, the cost-effectiveness analysis alongside this trial incorporated only 93 of the 130 participants who were randomised, and there was no imputation strategy for missing data hence these results could be subject to selection bias. An Australian study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a similar exercise intervention led by a physical therapist (a mixture of group and individual sessions) among Parkinsonâ€™s population and estimated the cost to be $A574 per fall averted and a ICER of $A338,800/QALY with a 0.005 QALY gain over a 6-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The intervention cost was estimated to be $A1,010 (in 2012 Australian dollars, equivalent to Â£559) per participant which incorporated monthly group exercise classes, and 2 to 4 home visits from the therapist over 6Â months. They concluded that the intervention was cost-effective when using a threshold of $A2,000 per fall prevented however the ICER estimate was far over the UK equivalent threshold Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 per QALY gained. Compared to the current study, both Clarke et al. and Fletcher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] reported much more positive cost-effectiveness estimates favouring the intervention, due to the lower intervention costs and higher QALYs gained. The result from the Australian study is consistent with the current study, reporting similar intervention cost (Â£559, vs. Â£649 for PDSAFE) and similar QALY (0.005 vs. 0.008 for PDSAFE) gained. Overall the QALY gained in the three earlier studies and the PDSAFE trial were small and measured with substantial uncertainty. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the treatment effect of physiotherapy and its impact on QALY.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par34">Over the 6-month period, the PDSAFE intervention was associated with a small, statistically insignificant mean QALY gain with large uncertainty, leading to a large ICER with a wide confidence interval. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.5% suggesting that the PDSAFE intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective from the NHS and PSS perspective. Sensitivity analysis showed that even if the number of PDSAFE physiotherapy sessions were reduced from 12 to 8, the ICER would still be three times higher than the current NICE threshold due to the unchanged incremental QALY gain. Therefore, cost reduction strategies only, such as changing home-based to group sessions, are unlikely to result in the intervention becoming cost-effective unless effectiveness also improves. The 12-month analysis, however, suggested that the intervention may become cost-effective were the effect to be sustained beyond the intervention period however this would require a study with longer follow-up beyond 12â€‰months.</p>
