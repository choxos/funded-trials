                  <p>Low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), a marker of vitamin D status, are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but whether this association is causal remains unclear.

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Using several data sources from populations of European descent, including type 2 diabetes cases and non-cases, we did a mendelian randomisation analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near four genes related to 25(OH)D synthesis and metabolism: <italic>DHCR7</italic> (related to vitamin D synthesis), <italic>CYP2R1</italic> (hepatic 25-hydroxylation), <italic>DBP</italic> (also known as <italic>GC</italic>; transport), and <italic>CYP24A1</italic> (catabolism). We assessed each SNP for an association with circulating 25(OH)D concentration (5449 non-cases; two studies), risk of type 2 diabetes (28 144 cases, 76 344 non-cases; five studies), and glycaemic traits (concentrations of fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA<sub>1c</sub>; 46 368 non-cases; study consortium). We combined these associations in a likelihood-based mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate the causal association of 25(OH)D concentration with type 2 diabetes and the glycaemic traits, and compared them with that from a meta-analysis of data from observational studies (8492 cases, 89 698 non-cases; 22 studies) that assessed the association between 25(OH)D concentration and type 2 diabetes.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>All four SNPs were associated with 25(OH)D concentrations (p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>). The mendelian randomisation-derived unconfounded odds ratio for type 2 diabetes was 1·01 (95% CI 0·75–1·36; p=0·94) per 25·0 nmol/L (1 SD) lower 25(OH)D concentration. The corresponding (potentially confounded) relative risk from the meta-analysis of data from observational studies was 1·21 (1·16–1·27; p=7·3 × 10<sup>−19</sup>). The mendelian randomisation-derived estimates for glycaemic traits were not significant (p&gt;0·25).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The association between 25(OH)D concentration and type 2 diabetes is unlikely to be causal. Efforts to increase 25(OH)D concentrations might not reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes as would be expected on the basis of observational evidence. These findings warrant further investigations to identify causal factors that might increase 25(OH)D concentration and also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

              <p id="para50">Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that has a crucial role in the modulation of bone homeostasis. It has been described as a wonder vitamin because of its possible benefits related to diverse health outcomes including bone disease, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is a circulating metabolite used as a clinical indicator of vitamin D status. Results from prospective epidemiological studies have shown that low circulating 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, whether or not this association is causal is unknown;<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> it might be the result of residual confounding, which is plausible in observational studies of incident type 2 diabetes. Measurements of confounders (eg, physical activity) are susceptible to errors and are not adequately controlled for in epidemiological analyses.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Although results from clinical trials<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> have shown no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, these findings require cautious interpretation because of issues with doses, combination treatment with calcium, compliance, and generalisability.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para60">Studies of genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) that specifically affect 25(OH)D concentration can provide another route to draw causal inference. Investigators of a genome-wide association study<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> identified SNPs within or near four genes significantly related to 25(OH)D concentrations: <italic>DHCR7</italic> (encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; involved in 25[OH]D synthesis in the skin) and <italic>CYP2R1</italic> (encoding cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1; involved in hepatic 25-hydroxylation), both representing 25(OH)D synthesis; and <italic>DBP</italic> (also known as <italic>GC</italic>; encoding vitamin D-binding protein; involved in 25[OH]D transport) and <italic>CYP24A1</italic>; (encoding cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1; involved in 25[OH]D catabolism), both representing vitamin D metabolism. SNPs within or near these genes have been investigated as instruments to predict 25(OH)D concentrations independent of potential confounders and to study causal associations of 25(OH)D concentrations with health outcomes.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Using a mendelian randomisation approach, investigators of previous studies have examined causal associations of 25(OH)D with risk of type 2 diabetes, but these studies were unable to confirm or refute causality because of small sample sizes, few included SNPs, or the absence of validation (ie, through assessment of intermediate risk factors including glycaemic traits).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Larger studies are needed to assess more precisely the potential causal association between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of type 2 diabetes. If causality does exist, interventions such as sunlight exposure or increased vitamin D intake (diet or supplementation) could provide a simple, inexpensive, and safe prevention strategy for type 2 diabetes. Resolution of this uncertainty is therefore important.</p>
              <p id="para70">In this study, our main aim was to estimate the unconfounded, causal association between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of type 2 diabetes using a mendelian randomisation approach, combining data from several studies. We also examined causal associations between 25(OH)D concentrations and glycaemic traits as secondary outcomes.</p>

                <p id="para80">Based on the genome-wide associations previously identified,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> we used four SNPs as primary genetic instruments: rs12785878 near <italic>DHCR7</italic>, rs10741657 near <italic>CYP2R1</italic>, rs4588 of <italic>DBP</italic>, and rs17217119 near <italic>CYP24A1</italic>. Mendelian randomisation analysis requires genetic variants to be related to a main exposure, but not to potential confounders.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Thus, we first assessed the association of each of the four SNPs with 25(OH)D concentrations and other baseline factors (eg, BMI, blood pressure, and physical activity). Second, we examined the association between each SNP and risk of type 2 diabetes. Third, we combined these findings to estimate the unconfounded, causal association between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of type 2 diabetes by mendelian randomisation analysis. Fourth, we also did mendelian randomisation analysis to estimate the unconfounded, causal association between 25(OH)D concentration and four glycaemic traits: concentrations of fasting glucose, 2-h glucose (during a standard oral glucose tolerance test), fasting insulin, and HbA<sub>1c</sub>. Finally, for comparison with the mendelian randomisation-based estimates, we meta-analysed data from prospective observational studies that assessed the association between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

              <p id="para290">In a Norwegian study,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> the investigators reported significant associations of 12 SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism with 25(OH)D concentration, but not with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Consistent with the null findings for any of the individual SNPs, our findings also do not support a causal association between 25(OH)D concentration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with even greater precision than the Norwegian study. Moreover, the findings from our mendelian randomisation analysis suggest that 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with neither increased nor decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. This finding is supported by the results of our mendelian randomisation analysis of 25(OH)D concentrations and glycaemic traits (to our knowledge, the first such analysis that has been reported), which showed no causal association.</p>
              <p id="para300">Our findings challenge some views about the biological roles of vitamin D. Although the direct mechanisms are unclear, previous findings have suggested roles for vitamin D in type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For example, results of rodent experiments showed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D), an active form of vitamin D, regulates calcium-dependent signalling, modulates insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells, and reduces lipotoxicity of free fatty acids.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Notably, concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D are weakly correlated (<italic>r</italic>&lt;0·3).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Thus, our mendelian randomisation analysis and others<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> might be limited in their ability to elucidate a causal role of biologically active vitamin D. This finding should therefore stimulate future research into 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, which remains understudied because of its short half-life (12–36 h <italic>vs</italic> 3 weeks for 25[OH]D) and its low concentration in blood (less than 1% of the concentration of 25[OH]D).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para310">Cautious interpretation is also necessary because of the roles of genes related to vitamin D metabolism. The <italic>DBP</italic> gene encoding vitamin D-binding protein, involved in 25(OH)D transport, is an unconfounded determinant of 25(OH)D concentration, but might have an opposing genetic effect on 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. The <italic>DBP</italic> gene product associated with increased 25(OH)D concentrations might sequester 25(OH)D in blood and reduce bioavailability of 25(OH)D. This possibility has been supported by evidence from Powe and colleagues,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> who reported that <italic>DBP</italic> alleles that increased blood concentrations of 25(OH)D were associated with reduced bone mineral density. Therefore, 25(OH)D represents vitamin D status, but not necessarily the amount of bioavailable vitamin D. Thus, existing mendelian randomisation analyses, including ours, cannot to accurately predict amounts of bioavailable vitamin D. This possibility and the potential of mendelian randomisation analysis to be used to investigate bioavailable 25(OH)D, as well as circulating vitamin D-binding protein and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, need to be studied. Moreover, functions independent of diabetes aetiology should also be investigated in the future, since vitamin D-binding protein might have diverse anti-inflammatory functions and results of mendelian randomisation analyses have supported a causal antihypertensive role of vitamin D.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
              <p id="para320">Our analysis has several strengths. It is the largest mendelian randomisation analysis for 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of type 2 diabetes, with four times as many cases of type 2 diabetes as previous research.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Furthermore, it includes a novel mendelian randomisation analysis of four glycaemic traits and an updated meta-analysis of observational studies assessing 25(OH)D concentration and risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
              <p id="para330">Our study also has limitations. Our mendelian randomisation analyses and meta-analysis of observational studies combined data from several studies to maximise power, which could introduce bias due to different study designs that can be difficult to quantify with respect to the definition of endpoints and measurement of exposures. Despite no evidence of such bias, we cannot rule it out as an explanation for the null finding. The four SNPs investigated in this study account for only 3·6% of the variation in 25(OH)D concentration, as previously reported.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This limitation could be minimised by examining several SNPs from a single gene or from the whole genome as polygenic effects, although increasing the diversity of the SNP panel also brings increased potential for pleiotropic effects.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Another limitation is that the use of total 25(OH)D concentration cannot distinguish between endogenous 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and exogenous vitamin D, including 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>. Future research to separate the two should improve genetic evidence further. Additionally, we assumed linear associations between SNPs, 25(OH)D concentrations, and risk of type 2 diabetes, and did not examine different physiological ranges of 25(OH)D concentration. Threshold effects of genes on 25(OH)D concentration and of 25(OH)D concentration on risk of type 2 diabetes could be present, for example, depending on amounts of sunlight exposure and latitudes of residence. Future detailed analyses are warranted, including stratification by demographic characteristics and a range of 25(OH)D concentrations. Finally, because we studied only white European populations, our findings might not be generalisable to other ethnic groups.</p>
              <p id="para340">Our findings suggest that interventions to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing concentrations of 25(OH)D are not currently justified. Rather, our findings emphasise the need for investigation of the discrepancy between the observational evidence and the absence of causal evidence. Such discrepancy could be accounted for by possible residual confounding in observational studies that cannot fully control for confounding. For example, physical activity might be a strong confounder, because it reduces risk of type 2 diabetes but is independently related to sunlight exposure and therefore vitamin D status. Existing observational studies generally recorded self-reported physical activity, which is subject to errors and residual confounding. To resolve this issue, research in which physical activity is measured objectively—eg, with accelerometers—will be needed to minimise potential confounding.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para350">Adiposity might also confound the association substantially. Increased adiposity both lowers 25(OH)D concentration and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, as the results of previous mendelian randomisation studies have shown.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Most observational studies adjusted for measures of adiposity, including BMI, but this adjustment might also involve measurement error, allowing residual confounding. Additionally, the discrepancy between findings of observational and mendelian randomisation studies suggest reverse causality. For example, subclinical diseases such as liver disease can lower production of 25(OH)D as well as increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Overall, underlying bias might account for the discrepancy between observational and causal evidence, justifying further research into detailed measurements of vitamin D exposure, more precise estimates of lifestyle factors, and subclinical characteristics. Such research will help us to identify causal factors that increase 25(OH)D concentration and also reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
