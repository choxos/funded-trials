                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)-associated uveitis is a chronic paediatric ocular inflammatory condition that can result in visual impairment. Adalimumab, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor, effectively controls joint and eye inflammation; however, its long-term use may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes and place an undue financial burden on the patient and healthcare system given its high cost. There is great interest for patients to stop adalimumab following remission due to these reasons but there is a lack of information on the ability to maintain control after discontinuing adalimumab.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The Adalimumab in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis Trial (ADJUST) is a multicentred, international trial that will randomise 118 participants aged 2 years and older with controlled JIA-associated uveitis to either continue adalimumab or discontinue adalimumab and receive a placebo. The trial will compare the time to uveitis recurrence between the two groups over 12 months. All participants will receive the standard weight-based dose of adalimumab or placebo: 20 mg biweekly (if &lt; 30 kg) or 40 mg biweekly (if ≥ 30 kg).</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of discontinuing adalimumab after demonstrating control of JIA-associated uveitis for at least 12 months. The results of ADJUST will provide information on clinical outcomes to guide clinicians in their decision-making regarding discontinuation of adalimumab.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par29">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common paediatric rheumatological condition with an estimated prevalence of 3.8 to 400 per 100,000 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Upwards of one third of patients diagnosed with JIA develop uveitis—a chronic, asymptomatic, anterior inflammation of the eye—within 7 years of disease onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is significant evidence of poor long-term visual outcomes for JIA-associated uveitis, with one third of all patients developing substantial visual impairment and 10–15% becoming legally blind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">Topical steroids are the first-line treatment for JIA-associated uveitis, yet there are risks associated with their long-term use (e.g., development of cataracts), and many patients are refractory to this treatment alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic DMARDs have been demonstrated to be effective for controlling inflammation in JIA-associated uveitis. Biologics in particular have largely transformed the management of JIA-associated uveitis, and adalimumab, one of the primary biologic DMARDs, has been greatly efficacious for this indication. Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha that has been shown to effectively control inflammation in more than 80% of JIA-associated anterior uveitis cases that are refractory to methotrexate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adalimumab is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in children with polyarticular JIA and non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis; by the UK National Health Service (NHS) in children with paediatric chronic anterior uveitis and JIA; and by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for polyarticular JIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">While adalimumab has successfully been used to treat JIA-associated uveitis, there are safety concerns and financial implications associated with its long-term use. Adalimumab, like other TNF-alpha inhibitors, is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections and the development of immune-mediated resistance to the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is also a black box warning with respect to the risk of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, adalimumab has a high financial cost to patients and society. In 2015, the International Federation of Health Plans reported that two pre-filled syringes—a 28-day supply—cost $2669 in the US (without insurance) and $1362 in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Beyond the direct cost of the medicine, there are many hidden costs of adalimumab therapy, including productivity loss and the psychological burden of administering injections that may cause systemic side effects.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Due to its high cost, insurance coverage for adalimumab varies across the US, and the UK NHS encourages discontinuation among children who respond well to adalimumab therapy. However, no prospective studies have demonstrated whether or not discontinuing adalimumab is safe for children. To date, withdrawal of immunomodulatory therapies for JIA-associated uveitis and other autoimmune diseases has been restricted to retrospective case studies and observational cohorts. These limited studies have demonstrated a high relapse rate within 12 months of discontinuation. In a cohort of 335 children with polyarticular JIA or enthesitis-related arthritis, 89% of participants who withdrew from anti-TNF-alpha therapy (while remaining on methotrexate) experienced a recurrence of inflammation within 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Smaller cohort studies have shown similar results: discontinuing infliximab in participants with JIA-associated uveitis resulted in a median time to recurrence of 76 days, and in another cohort, the median time to relapse in JIA participants who stopped etanercept was 4.3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par33">The Adalimumab in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis Stopping Trial (ADJUST) is the first clinical trial to examine the safety and efficacy of stopping adalimumab in participants with controlled JIA-associated uveitis. The trial will also collect clinical and laboratory predictors of uveitis relapse and assess rates of achieving control of uveitis after restarting treatment. Data from this trial will provide an evidence base to inform treatment recommendations on the use of adalimumab in patients with JIA-associated uveitis.</p>

                <p id="Par68">The primary outcome is the time to recurrence of inflammation, also known as treatment failure. This definition of treatment failure is based on the grading of ocular inflammation and classification of arthritis, both of which are subjective. Given the subjectivity of the primary outcome and the possible biases that investigators, participants, and their family/caregivers may hold regarding adalimumab, a placebo will be used to mask all personnel involved in patient care. The placebo looks and feels identical to the pre-filled syringes containing active adalimumab.</p>

Cycloplegic drops may be added if the participant has active inflammation and is at risk for synechiae. Intraocular pressure-lowering (IOP) drops are always allowed. Oral NSAIDs and local corticosteroid injections to the joints are permitted and are the preferred treatment if joint inflammation recurs. Systemic corticosteroids (unless prescribed for indications not related to the participant’s JIA-associated uveitis), intraocular corticosteroid injections, and NSAID eye drops are not permitted prior to treatment failure.

                <p id="Par75">The primary outcome is time to treatment failure, with censoring at 12 months. Treatment failure is defined as the recurrence of ocular inflammation and/or the recurrence of joint inflammation that is persistent and severe enough to necessitate unmasking to manage the arthritis recurrence. A joint is defined to have active arthritis if the joint has swelling or at least two other signs of inflammation: heat, limited range of motion, tenderness, or painful range of motion. For treatment failure to be declared due to ocular recurrence, at least one of the following criteria must be present in at least one eye:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par76">≥ 3+ AC cells at a single visit;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">≥ 2-step increase from baseline AC cells at 2 separate visits at least 7 days apart;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">&gt; 0.5+ AC cells at 2 separate visits at least 28 days apart;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">&gt; 0.5+ vitreous haze at 2 separate visits at least 7 days apart; and/or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">Active retinal/choroidal lesions or macular oedema at 2 separate visits at least 7 days apart.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par81">Time to treatment failure will be measured in days from the date of randomisation until the first date of increased ocular inflammation that was sustained for either 7 or 28 days (depending on the level of inflammation) or until the date when the rheumatologist declares that unmasking is necessary to manage the persistent and severe arthritis.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants that experience a treatment failure, an arthritis flare, and macular oedema in each treatment group. Differences in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) scores, quality of life scores (from the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], EuroQol 5 Dimension Youth Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Children’s Visual Functioning Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and Effects of Youngster’s Eyesight on Quality of Life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), and Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) values (JADAS-10 and JADAS-27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) will also be compared between the randomised treatment groups. Other clinical indicators, including anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to adalimumab, serum MRP8/14 (calprotectin) levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR), C-reactive protein levels (CRP), and gut microbiome biomarkers, will be explored as predictors for treatment failure.</p>

                <title>Participant timeline {13}</title>
                <p id="Par83">After participants are consented, their eligibility has been confirmed, and they have been randomised to either continue adalimumab or discontinue and receive the placebo, they will follow a 12-month study visit schedule. There are monthly ophthalmology study visits from baseline until month 4, followed by every other month until month 12. Rheumatology study visits will occur at baseline and months 3, 6, and 12. Standard-of-care laboratory samples will be collected every 3 months, and the research laboratory samples will be collected at baseline, month 6, and month 12. If a participant experiences treatment failure, then ophthalmology, rheumatology, and laboratory (standard-of-care and research samples) study visits will take place.</p>
                <p id="Par84">All participants will be followed for a minimum of 90 days after treatment failure occurs. If treatment failure is declared with fewer than 90 days remaining in the 12-month trial period, follow-up will be extended to allow for 90 days, where the maximum total length of follow-up is 15 months.</p>

                <p id="Par99">The primary analysis will consist of a Cox proportional hazards model comparing time to treatment failure (measured in days from participant’s randomisation date) between treatment groups. Country and antimetabolite use will be included as fixed effects in the model. Hypothesis testing will be conducted using Monte Carlo permutation testing, and all tests will be two-sided with a type 1 error probability of alpha = 0.05. Analyses of secondary outcomes (e.g., BCVA scores, quality of life scores, macular oedema) will employ generalised linear models to estimate relative measures of association. The type of model (e.g., linear regression, log binomial regression) for these secondary outcomes will vary depending on the outcome of interest.</p>
                <p id="Par100">Secondary aims include identifying predictors of JIA-associated uveitis recurrence (aim 2) and evaluating if stopping adalimumab leads to overall less control of inflammation at 6- and 12-month visits even if participants restart adalimumab after a uveitis recurrence (aim 3). For aim 2, we will first use univariate log binomial regression, followed by multivariate analysis and model selection using the standard LASSO (least absolute shrinking and selection operator). The LASSO penalty will be estimated using 5-fold cross-validation. The variables selected from LASSO will be fit to the full dataset using logistic and log binomial regression. General elastic net regression will also be conducted to compare the results when using a ridge penalty to account for multicollinearity. For aim 3, we will use log binomial regression to model whether participants achieved corticosteroid-sparing control of ocular inflammation during the study. This analysis will follow the same template as the primary analysis described above.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par112">The Adalimumab in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-associated Uveitis Stopping Trial is the first randomised controlled trial comparing continuing versus discontinuing adalimumab therapy in patients with controlled JIA-associated uveitis. While there is limited evidence of the safety and efficacy of discontinuing anti-TNF-alpha therapy, some health systems and health insurance agencies continue to enforce policies that require patients to discontinue or make it difficult to continue on therapy long term. In fact, the few published retrospective case series suggest that recurrence of inflammation may be common after discontinuing anti-TNF-alpha therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. ADJUST is a well-powered trial that will contribute to the evidence base for this understudied clinical question.</p>
              <p id="Par113">ADJUST will also address other key scientific questions. An important secondary aim is to explore factors that may predict JIA-associated uveitis relapse, including participant demographics, clinical characteristics, and novel biomarkers. These results may guide physicians when deciding which patients should discontinue adalimumab. Another aim of the trial is to identify if there is a risk of reduced responsiveness to adalimumab after restarting treatment following a failed discontinuation attempt. Studies on discontinuing other TNF-alpha inhibitors have raised concerns over a loss in drug efficacy once treatment is restarted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Reduced responsiveness can lead to worse ocular outcomes and thus is an important risk for physicians and patients to weigh when considering stopping therapy. Finally, the results from ADJUST may have an impact on healthcare policy and economics. Currently, there is variation in the coverage of adalimumab among healthcare systems and insurance companies, with some limiting the duration of use before requiring an attempt to discontinue therapy. There is no scientific evidence to support these practices.</p>
              <p id="Par114">One of the anticipated challenges of the trial will be recruitment. Participants are required to have at least 12 consecutive months of adalimumab treatment and control of their JIA-associated uveitis to be eligible for the trial. Many investigators have identified patients who are currently eligible; however, recruitment may become increasingly difficult following these initial enrolments as investigators wait for patients to meet the eligibility threshold. In anticipation of this challenge, a large number of recruiting centres across all regions of the US and the UK, as well as parts of Australia, have been included to provide a wide catchment area. All enrolling centres represent excellent, large centres of care that provide high-calibre paediatric rheumatology and uveitis care. In the event of significant enrolment challenges, the trial network will be expanded to include other institutions that have expressed interest in ADJUST.</p>
              <p id="Par115">There are many motivating factors to discontinue anti-TNF-alpha therapy after achieving control of inflammation, including the high cost of therapy, inconvenience of administering injections, and the risks of adverse events. However, there is a lack of evidence on the success and risks of attempting to do so in patients with JIA-associated uveitis. ADJUST aims to provide rigorous evidence on the safety and efficacy of this practice. The trial’s results will help guide the decision-making of physicians and their patients about whether discontinuing adalimumab is in their best interest.</p>
