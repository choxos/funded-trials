                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Compassionate care continues to be a focus for national and international
attention, but the existing evidence base lacks the experimental methodology
necessary to guide the selection of effective interventions for practice. This
study aimed to evaluate the Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care
(CLECC) intervention in improving compassionate care.</p>

                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Ward nursing teams (clusters) in two English National Health Service hospitals
randomised to intervention (n=4) or control (n=2). Intervention wards comprised
two medicines for older people (MOPs) wards and two medical/surgical wards.
Control wards were both MOPs.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Data collected from 627 patients and 178 staff. Exclusion criteria: reverse
barrier nursed, critically ill, palliative or non-English speaking. All other
patients and all nursing staff and Health Care Assistant HCAs were invited to
participant, agency and bank staff were excluded.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>CLECC, a workplace intervention focused on developing sustainable leadership and
work-team practices to support the delivery of compassionate care. Control: No
educational activity.</p>

                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Primary—Quality of Interaction Schedule (QuIS) for observed
staff–patient interactions. Secondary—patient-reported evaluations
of emotional care in hospital (PEECH); nurse-reported empathy (Jefferson Scale of
Empathy).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Trial proceeded as per protocol, randomisation was acceptable. Some but not all
blinding strategies were successful. QuIS observations achieved 93% recruitment
rate with 25% of patient sample cognitively impaired. At follow-up there were more
total positive (78% vs 74%) and less total negative (8% vs 11%) QuIS ratings for
intervention wards versus control wards. Sixty-three per cent of intervention ward
patients scored lowest (ie, more negative) scores on PEECH connection subscale,
versus 79% of control. This was not a statistically significant difference. No
statistically significant differences in nursing empathy were observed.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Use of experimental methods is feasible. The use of structured observation of
staff–patient interaction quality is a promising outcome measure inclusive
of hard to reach groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Healthcare systems internationally are challenged by the provision of optimal care to an
ageing population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Research into outcomes for
older people admitted to hospital is far from encouraging with hospitalised older people
at significant risk of functional decline<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and
older patients with fraility at increased risk of mortality and readmission.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A recent systematic review on outcomes for older
people in acute care suggests there is an ‘urgent need for the development and
evaluation of effective interventions… that optimise the care outcomes of older
patients’.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This review found
personalised treatment plans and clear communication strategies can reduce readmission
and mortality.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This study aims to pilot an
intervention aimed at improving compassionate hospital care for older people.</p>
              <p>Research indicates that the quality of relationships with staff is key to shaping older
people’s hospital experiences, with older people valuing being seen as people,
listened to and involved in treatment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However,
evidence from English National Health Service (NHS) and international reports<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6–8</xref> indicates that older people
frequently fail to experience positive and caring staff attitudes and behaviours,
resulting in a perceived lack of compassion. Expressed simply, compassion is ‘a
deep awareness of the suffering of another coupled with the wish to relieve
it’.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There are four key components to
the narrative of nursing compassion.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The first
focuses on ideas about the moral attributes of a ‘compassionate’ nurse,
including wisdom, humanity, love and empathy. These moral attributes are expressed
through a kind of situational awareness in which vulnerability and suffering are
perceived and acknowledged. These perceptions underpin participation of the nurse in
responsive action that is aimed at relieving suffering and ensuring dignity, and which
involves the nurse in a participatory relationship in which the nurse exercises

              <p>The apparent need to improve compassionate hospital care for older people has led to the
development of a number of interventions, but there is a lack of evidence for their
efficacy, with utility limited by a seeming reluctance to use rigorous experimental
methods for evaluation. A recent systematic review of evidence for compassionate nursing
care interventions found that most of the 24 studies identified used uncontrolled before
and after designs, with just four using randomised controlled designs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Studies tended to be single site and
small scale. A wide range of outcome measures were deployed between the studies
including staff-based outcomes (eg, empathy), patient-based outcomes (eg, mood) and care
outcomes (eg, patient-centredness), indicating a lack of consensus in the field as to
appropriate compassionate care outcomes and how to measure them. While most studies
(79%) reported a positive effect in relation to one or more outcomes, higher quality
studies were less likely to report positive effects and no interventions were evaluated
more than once. Thus the quality of the evidence for effectiveness in this field is
predominantly low, hampered by a lack of experimental research of sufficient scale.</p>
              <p>Responding to an absence of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of compassionate
care interventions for older patients, the study reported here aimed to pilot the use
experimental methodology to evaluate a compassionate care intervention targeted at work
teams in acute care settings. We aimed to provide an evidence base to guide future trial
design and implementation, including feasibility of ward-level randomisation, selection
of outcome measures including success in blinding, sample size calculation, minimising
contamination between experimental and control clusters and maximising participation of
older patients.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>As part of a wider feasibility study, a multisite pilot cluster randomised controlled
trial was undertaken with randomisation of staff and patients at ward nursing team
level.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Medical and surgical wards with high
proportion of older patients were eligible. Six wards in two NHS hospital Trusts in
England were enrolled and allocated to intervention (n=4) or control (n=2). The number
of clusters was determined by funding availability and the plan to run the study in at
least two hospital organisations, and at least two ward specialties. Randomisation of
clusters was undertaken using the ralloc command in Stata (Release
12, StataCorp) by the team statistician (IM-E) blinded to hospital and ward
information other than ward specialty. Randomisation was stratified by hospital and by
ward type: medicine for older people (MOP) or not MOP. The allocation was communicated
to the chief investigator (JB) who oversaw its implementation in practice.</p>
              <p>The Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care (CLECC) intervention is based
on workplace learning theory with the ward conceptualised as a learning environment and
ward team as a community of practice.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is an
educational programme focused on developing manager and team practices at a group level
that create an expansive learning environment, theorised to enhance team capacity to
provide compassionate care.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Expansive (rather
than restrictive) environments foster workplace learning and the integration of personal
and organisational development.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> The intervention aims to embed ward-based manager and team
practices including dialogue, reflective learning and mutual support. Research suggests
that embedding such practices leads to a longer-term period of service improvement and
sustainable improvements in practice.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> CLECC
training consisted of key activities, such as: monthly ward leader action learning sets;
team learning activities, including local team climate analysis and values
clarification; peer observations of practice and feedback to team by volunteer team
members; team study days focused on team building and understanding patient experiences;
mid-shift 5 min team cluster discussions; and two times weekly team
reflective discussions. A Practice Educator led these activities through a 4-month
implementation period, aiming to develop a team-learning plan that included measures for
continuing to support leader and team practices that underpin the delivery of
compassionate care beyond the initial programmed activities. Usual practice continued on
control wards. Further detail on the theory and development of the CLECC intervention
can be found in Bridges and Fuller.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Outcome measures were assessed at baseline (2 months before intervention and prior to
randomisation to groups) and follow-up (4 months after completion of CLECC
implementation period). Given anticipated patient and staff turnover between assessment
periods, follow-up was at cluster level rather than individual participant level, and so
recruitment for baseline and follow-up assessment periods was independent. There is no
single validated measure for compassionate care, the systematic review cited above
identifying 18 different types of outcome measure (a total of 67 individual outcome
measures) for compassionate nursing care.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The
most commonly used nurse-based measure identified in the review was empathy, with other
measures including compassion, caring and well-being, including burnout and stress.
Patient-based measures focused on overall satisfaction, quality of life, mood, agitation
and well-being. Of measures that focused more on care quality, most studies used
measures of the quality of interaction between nurses and patients. We chose to assess
the performance of three complementary core outcomes: researcher-rated observations of
the quality of staff–patient interactions, patient-reported evaluations of
emotional care and nurse-reported measures of empathy. Baseline and follow-up data were
also gathered on individual and ward team characteristics including patient age,
cognitive impairment, ward leadership and staff turnover. We aimed to maximise the
participation of older people with cognitive impairment and communication difficulties
through recruitment procedures that optimised capacity to make decisions about taking
part in the study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Because there is
insufficient literature to guide the recruitment of these groups, it was not possible at
the outset to predict sample size. Instead, more flexible target recruitment rates were
used.</p>
              <p>The quality of staff–patient interactions was assessed using the Quality of
Interactions Schedule (QuIS), a time sampling tool that measures the volume and quality
of interactions through observation.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
Staff–patient interactions are rated as positive social, positive care, neutral,
negative protective or negative restrictive. Earlier piloting work has established its
validity and reliability in acute settings.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>All adult patients on participating wards were assessed for eligibility to be included
in observations. Patients were excluded if they were unable to communicate their choices
about taking part in the research and a consultee could not be contacted. We also
excluded patients who were unconscious or where there were clinical concerns (critically
ill, in receipt of palliative care, high infection risk). The patient sample for
observations was determined by randomisation of eligible patients, whereby a random
number generator indicated the index patient for approach. Index patients were informed
about the planned observations and if they agreed the observation could proceed, other
eligible patients in the researcher’s field of view were approached for
inclusion. If the index patient declined to take part, another index patient was
randomly selected, and approached as before. Study records were audited to ensure that
allocation determined by randomisation was implemented in practice. Staff were informed
about observations with the option to withdraw if preferred. All interactions between
patients and staff were directly observed by a single researcher for 2 hours and
coded (there were 10×2 hours observation sessions per ward per 3-week
assessment period). Observation sessions were randomly sampled over 3 weeks from
Monday to Friday, 8.00 a.m.–10.00 p.m., and balanced between wards and time of
day. Twelve researchers were trained (4 hours classroom and 6 hours field)
to undertake observations.</p>
              <p>Patient-reported evaluations of emotional care were measured using the Patient
reported Evaluation of Emotional Care in Hospital (PEECH) survey tool which is
validated for use in English hospital settings.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
Designed to measure patient views on the nature of interpersonal interactions with
hospital staff and patient-reported assessment of the extent to which therapeutic
emotional care has occurred, the subscales are security, knowledge, personal value and
connection. PEECH is sensitive to changes in service quality and in ward
environment.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> All eligible patients on the
ward were invited to complete a questionnaire. Patients were excluded if there were
clinical concerns or if they lacked capacity to consent. If recruited, patients were
offered help by the researcher in completing the questionnaire.</p>
              <p>Nurses’ self-reported empathy was measured using the Jefferson Scale of Empathy
(JSE) (Physician/HP version), a 20-item inventory in a seven-point Likert-type
format ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree with higher scores reflecting a
more empathic orientation.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The JSE was
developed and validated for use by healthcare workers, the scale is sensitive to changes
in individual empathy over time and context.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24
25</xref> All nursing staff (registered nurses and healthcare assistants) were
invited to complete a questionnaire, based on a staff list supplied by the ward manager.
Questionnaires in individually named envelopes were distributed by ward managers and
returned via an on-ward postbox.</p>
              <p>A number of measures were employed to enable allocation concealment and blinding.
Clusters were randomly allocated to group following baseline data collection. At
follow-up, researchers conducting observations were blinded to allocation, but
researchers gathering questionnaire data were aware of ward allocation. It was not
possible to conceal allocation from ward team nursing staff. Patients were not informed
of allocation.</p>
              <p>All analyses were carried out on an intention to treat basis. Descriptive statistics
were used to show the proportion of participants that consented to participate in study.
The proportion of QuIS interactions rated for each of the five categories was analysed
and the frequencies of patients with the lowest (most negative) scores for each subscale
were calculated. The differences between groups were tested using x² test. A
three-level mixed-effects logistic regression model was fitted to investigate the effect
of the CLECC intervention on the likelihood of a negative interaction. Predictive
factors were included as fixed effects and presented as ORs with 95% CI, after
adjustment for baseline and ward consecutively. Mean PEECH and JSE scores were
calculated by subscale and in total, and differences between groups at follow-up were
tested using Mann-Whitney U test. In order to determine the appropriate approach for
analysis and the design effect when calculating the required sample in a definitive
trial, estimates of intracluster correlation (ICC) were generated for each
outcome measure.</p>
              <p>A small patient and public involvement (PPI) group and PPI representatives on the
Steering Group oversaw and advised on intervention development, study design, selection
of outcome measures and research team training.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>Six out of seven nursing ward managers invited to take part agreed to randomisation to
either intervention or control. Three wards were recruited in each Trust, and all wards
remained in the study until it closed. The wards had between 28 and 32 beds and mean
patients stays ranged from 6 to 19 days. Data were collected between March 2015 and
March 2016. Procedures for allocation concealment and blinding proceeded as planned,
with the exception of two researcher observers at follow-up reporting that they learnt
of ward allocation from ward staff. No staff audited following observations reported
that their behaviour had changed because they were being observed. Researcher field
notes reflect reports from hospital managers that discussions about CLECC between staff
on intervention and control wards had the potential to influence practice on the control
wards, but we did not detect evidence of contamination.</p>

illustrates the number of approaches rather than individual patients, as some
patients were invited more than once to be involved. Recruitment rate for
observations at baseline was 97% (152 out of 157 approaches to eligible patients),
and at follow-up was 90% (157 out of 175). Recruitment rates were similar between
intervention and control wards (96% vs 98% at baseline, 90% vs 88% at follow-up).
Twenty-three participants declined to participate for reasons including ‘not
feeling up to it’ (17%), or ‘too unwell’ (4%). No specific
reason was recorded for 70%. In 17% (63 out of 362 approaches) patients were assessed
as not having capacity to make the decision to take part. In 67% (42 out of 63) of
these occasions, researchers were able to contact a consultee for advice and in 100%
of these cases the consultee advised that the patient should participate. A final 273
patients were observed (133 at baseline and 140 at follow-up). The mean age of
patients observed was 82 years (84 years in intervention group and 77 in control)
(<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Most patients were female (77%)
and 25% had evidence of cognitive impairment, with no significant differences by
experimental group. All observation data gathered were included in analysis.</p>

                <p>Across both assessment periods, 77% (359 out of 464) of eligible patients agreed to
take part in the questionnaire survey. Overall recruitment rates were similar between
intervention and control wards (77% vs 78%). Most frequent reasons recorded for
patients declining participation in the questionnaire survey were
‘tired’ (40%, n=12) and ‘questionnaire too difficult’
(10%, n=3). The most frequent reasons recorded for excluding patients were
‘not having capacity’ (43%, n=48) and ‘very cognitively
impaired’ (29%, n=32). Ninety-nine per cent (354 of 359) of patients
who consented returned a completed questionnaire, with researchers helping with
completion in 68% of cases. Most patients were female (70%), and aged over 70 years
(83%). Twelve per cent of patient questionnaires were completed by patients
with cognitive impairment. Intervention group patients completing questionnaires at
baseline included a higher proportion of younger patients (22% aged ≤60
years vs 0%) and of males (43% vs 25%). There were no other notable differences by
experimental group (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Of 496 questionnaires distributed to nursing staff, 36% (n=178) were completed and
returned (37% at baseline, 35% at follow-up). Baseline return rates were lower on
intervention wards (31% vs 48%), but at follow-up were more similar between
experimental groups (33% vs 39%). Most staff who returned a completed questionnaire
were female (87%) and median age group was 26–35 years. Questionnaires were
returned by 74 healthcare assistants (42%), 74 staff nurses (42%), and 18
sisters/charge nurses (10%), (missing data=6%). There were no notable differences in
job role by experimental group. All returned questionnaires (91 at baseline and 87 at
follow-up) were included in analyses.</p>

resulting in data collected on 3109 interactions between staff and patients over

                <p>At follow-up, there were more total positive (positive social and positive care) and
less total negative (negative protective and negative restrictive) scores for
intervention wards than control (78% vs 74%, 8% vs 12%). x² testing
suggested these differences were significant (P=0.017). However, multilevel logistic
regression results indicate that once other variables are taken into account, the
odds of a negative interaction are not significantly reduced because of the effect of
the CLECC intervention (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Results are
in the direction of an effect favourable to CLECC, that is, there were less negative
interactions on intervention wards, but this is not a statistically significant
difference (adjusted OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.07 to 1.32)).</p>

              <p>This study aimed to deliver a compassionate care intervention in acute care settings,
pilot the use of experimental methodology and assess the performance of selected outcome
measures. We aimed to provide an evidence base to guide future trial design and
implementation, including acceptability of ward-level randomisation, the feasibility of
assessing outcome measures and other measures of trial implementation such as
recruitment and inclusivity, sample size calculation and clustering for future trial,
blinding and contamination. The high recruitment rate of ward managers on behalf of
their teams and subsequent lack of attrition of any of the ward teams recruited indicate
that trial randomisation and the CLECC intervention are acceptable to medical and
surgical nursing teams in acute care hospitals. Recruitment processes and methods
appeared to be inclusive of all nursing staff levels and of older patients.
Observations, in particular, were highly acceptable to patients with an overall
recruitment rates of 93%. Questionnaire response rates varied, as discussed below. Our
findings suggest that the CLECC intervention may have a favourable effect in reducing
negative interactions between staff and patients, and in reducing patients’
experiences of lack of emotional connection with staff. However as expected, because of
the scale of this pilot, there is no certainty that any apparent positive effects are
not produced by chance alone, rather than the impact of the CLECC intervention.</p>
              <p>Hospitalised older patients with cognitive impairment are a traditionally hard-to-reach
group and even though they appear more prone to negative experiences of hospital
care,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> they are often excluded from
research.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 27 28</xref> It is estimated that
up to 25% of beds in acute hospitals are occupied by people with dementia, with the
figure likely to be higher on specialist older people’s wards.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> While cognitive deficits may limit some
people’s ability to share their experiences, our study has been successful in
devising recruitment and data collection methods that maximise their inclusion. Overall
25% of patients observed in this study had evidence of cognitive impairment, suggesting
a sample representative of the wider hospital population. Twelve per cent of
patient questionnaires returned were completed by patients with cognitive impairment,
indicating the questionnaire method was less inclusive than observation methods.
Participating in an observation does not require any particular state of health,
abilities or performance form the patient in question, whereas participating in a
questionnaire about one’s care experiences requires a minimum orientation to
place, language skills and attention.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In
addition, using questionnaire methods may be psychologically threatening to patients
still in receipt of care, regardless of cognitive status.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>
              <p>The validity of observer ratings as accurate representation of patient experiences
merits attention. Because main study observation and questionnaire data were gathered
from different patient groups, it was not possible to test the validity of observer
ratings against patient-reported experience. However, in earlier piloting work we found
79% agreement (weighted kappa 0.40: P&lt;0.001; indicating fair agreement) between
patients’ and observers’ ratings of interaction quality.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our earlier work did not include people with a
cognitive impairment and validation of QuIS ratings with this patient group may be a
necessary next step in the tool’s development. In addition, if the proportion of
negative interactions is the primary outcome measure in a future study, understanding
which interactions are rated by observers (and, where possible, patients) as negative,
and why, is an important next step, as is working with patient representatives to
establish their views on the size of a meaningful reduction in negative interactions.
Further study can also be used to develop more effective procedures to blind observers
from experimental allocation in advance of an experimental study. In addition, the high
ICC we found at an observation session level merits the exploration of the cause of this
variance and the feasibility of different approaches to data collection that reduce its
impact, for instance, shorter observation sessions. Our findings echo those of Goldberg
and Harwood<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> that structured
non-participant observation appears to be the most promising method to describe the
experiences of older people with cognitive impairment in the general hospital setting,
and so further evaluation and testing of QuIS across these parameters would be a
valuable foundation to its further use as an outcome measure in acute settings.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
              <p>While the response rate to patient questionnaires was good (77%), of all the patient
questionnaires returned, just 12% were completed by patients with cognitive impairment.
While questionnaires provide an opportunity for patient to directly rate their care,
less successful recruitment of a group known to be vulnerable to more negative
experiences in hospital, means that any results may not be a valid representation of
this group’s experiences. The response rate to nursing questionnaires was low
(36%), with some larger scale studies showing response rates of European nurses to be
62%, and US nurses to be around 39%.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Improving
staff survey response rates through further feasibility work would improve confidence
that conclusions in empathy levels across staff groups can be drawn with more
confidence.</p>
              <p>This study was piloted on a small number of wards in two hospitals so the findings are
not generalisable. In addition, being observed could, in itself, change staff
behaviours, and a common limitation of trials of this kind when it is not possible to
conceal allocation from staff, is that bias may influence staff responses to
observations and questionnaires. Additionally the finding of possible contamination
between wards means that intervention and control conditions should not run in the same
organisation over the same time period.</p>
              <p>Findings from our wider study, reported elsewhere, that implementation of the CLECC
intervention was uneven between wards, difficult to sustain and dependent on
organisational support,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> indicate that, while
experimental research in this field is necessary, it will not provide sufficient
explanation of results if conducted in isolation. However, the findings reported here
represent valuable groundwork to the further development of sound experimental design in
a field in which good design and implementation are very much needed.</p>
