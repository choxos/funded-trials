                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most common liver disorder specific to pregnancy and presents with maternal pruritus, raised concentrations of serum bile acids and abnormal liver function tests. ICP is associated with increased rates of spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour, fetal hypoxia, meconium-stained amniotic fluid and intrauterine death. Some clinicians treat ICP with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to improve maternal pruritus and biochemical abnormalities. However, there are currently no data to support the use of UDCA to improve pregnancy outcome as none of the trials performed to date have been powered to address this question.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The PITCHES trial is a triple-masked, placebo-controlled randomised trial, to evaluate UDCA versus placebo in women with ICP between 20â€‰+â€‰0 to 40â€‰+â€‰6Â weeksâ€™ gestation. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if UDCA treatment of women with ICP between 20â€‰+â€‰0 and 40â€‰+â€‰6Â weeksâ€™ gestation reduces the primary perinatal outcome: a composite of perinatal death (as defined by in utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7Â days) or preterm delivery (less than 37Â weeksâ€™ gestation) or neonatal unit admission for at least 4Â h (from infant delivery until hospital discharge). The secondary objectives of the trial are (1) to investigate the effect of UDCA on other short-term outcomes for both mother and infant and (2) to assess the impact of UDCA on health care resource use, in terms of the total number of nights for mother and infant, together with level of care.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for the treatment of ICP is inconsistent, with some units routinely prescribing UDCA, others prescribing very little and the remainder offering it variably. Our previous pilot trial of UDCA in women with ICP demonstrated that the trial would be feasible, and the research question remains active and unanswered. Results are highly likely to influence clinical practice, through direct management and impact on national and international guidelines.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), also called obstetric cholestasis, is the most common liver disorder specific to pregnancy. It presents with maternal pruritus, raised concentrations of serum bile acids and abnormal liver function tests. The maternal symptoms typically resolve postpartum, but affected women have an increased risk of hepatobiliary disease in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ICP is associated with increased rates of spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labour, fetal hypoxia and meconium-stained amniotic fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are also reports of increased rates of intrauterine death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although the incidence is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some clinicians treat ICP with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to improve maternal pruritus and biochemical abnormalities. However, there are currently no data to support the use of UDCA to improve pregnancy outcome as none of the trials performed to date have been powered to address this question.</p>
              <p id="Par9">UDCA is a naturally occurring bile acid that is present in small amounts in humans. It is relatively hydrophilic and has several actions that result in improvement of cholestasis. It increases biliary bile-acid excretion by post-translational modification of hepatic bile-acid transporters, enhances renal bile-acid excretion and has anti-apoptotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. UDCA improves outcomes in primary biliary cirrhosis in addition to maternal symptoms in ICP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Adverse events are only infrequently reported in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; some women experience gastrointestinal side-effects (such as diarrhoea), but in the largest trial to date there were no significant differences in the incidence of reported side-effects in UDCA and placebo groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other therapeutic options in ICP include rifampicin, cholestyramine, <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine, guar gum and dexamethasone, but the small studies of these drugs in women with ICP have not consistently shown that they improve maternal symptoms or serum bile-acid concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">The main clinical research question is whether adverse pregnancy outcomes can be reduced in women with ICP by treatment with UDCA. This is a subject of intense debate. The current UK guideline (from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists) on the management of ICP describes the evidence relating to the use of UDCA and states that â€˜UDCA improves pruritus and liver function in women with obstetric cholestasisâ€™ but â€˜women should be informed of the lack of robust data concerning protection against stillbirth and safety to the fetus or neonateâ€™. The guideline concludes that: â€˜as the pathophysiology of obstetric cholestasis and the mechanism of fetal demise are uncertain, the possible role of UDCA is unclear. Further larger studies are required to determine thisâ€™. The latest updated Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] judged many of the trials of UDCA in ICP to be at moderate to high risk of bias. Trials to date have lacked power to demonstrate whether UDCA is fetoprotective, with numbers of participants and adverse events too small to enable the recommendation of UDCA. The Cochrane review concluded that larger trials of UDCA to determine fetal benefits or risks are needed.</p>
              <p id="Par11">If UDCA is found to be beneficial in ameliorating adverse perinatal outcomes, once published these results would be highly likely to lead to an immediate change in clinical practice, through individual choice of clinicians and women, and through changing national/international guidelines.</p>
              <p id="Par12">The PITCHES trial is a triple-masked, placebo-controlled randomised trial to evaluate UDCA versus placebo in women with ICP between 20<sup>+â€‰0</sup> to 40<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeksâ€™ gestation. The primary objective of the trial is to determine if UDCA treatment of women with ICP between 20<sup>+â€‰0</sup> and 40<sup>+â€‰6</sup> weeksâ€™ gestation reduces adverse perinatal outcomes up to infant hospital discharge. The secondary objectives of the trial are (1) to investigate the effect of UDCA on other short-term outcomes for both mother and infant and (2) to assess the impact of UDCA on health care resource use, in terms of the total number of nights for mother and infant, together with level of care.</p>

                  <title>Formulation and packaging</title>
                  <p id="Par26">In the treatment arm, each film-coated tablet contains the active ingredient: 500Â mg UDCA and the inactive ingredients of magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, providone K 25, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, crospovidone and talc. In the control arm, a matching placebo tablet, identical in colour and shape to the treatment arm contains the inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, providone K 25, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, crospovidone and talc. The coating ingredients for both are talc, hypromellose and macrogol 6000. The IMP will be packaged into high-density polyethylene bottles, with 32 tablets per bottle, and will be administered orally. The IMP does not require any special storage conditions.</p>

                  <title>Dosing</title>
                  <p id="Par27">The starting dose will be 1000Â mg daily (500Â mg twice a day), increased in increments of 500Â mg per day every 3â€“14Â days if there is no biochemical or clinical improvement, based on clinical decision, to a maximum of 2000Â mg per day. The dose of IMP may be reduced to 500Â mg daily. Divided doses will be spread evenly throughout the day. There is no need to take it with or without food and this will be left to participant preference. The IMP will be continued until delivery. The duration of treatment will range from 1Â day to a maximum of 22Â weeks, for a participant randomised at 20Â weeksâ€™ gestation who does not deliver until 42Â weeks. At each antenatal follow-up visit with a member of the research team, women will be asked the percentage of IMP that they have taken since their last appointment and this will be recorded.</p>

                  <p id="Par28">Members of the research team will provide a full verbal explanation and written description of the trial to women who meet the inclusion criteria (as above). The woman will be given sufficient time to consider the information, and to decide whether she will participate in the trial. Written informed consent will be sought from the woman and taken by an appropriately trained physician. Baseline data, including all demography, serum bile-acid concentrations and liver function tests, together with an itch visual analogue score (worst itch in the previous 24Â h) completed by the woman will be entered on a web-based database by members of the research team at the time of study enrolment. On completion of these details, the database will issue a pack number to the local hospital pharmacy for dispensing.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">Participants will be reviewed at routine care clinic visits until delivery. Serum bile acids and liver function tests will be monitored according to usual clinical practice. The woman will be asked for a value of the worst itch she felt during the previous 24Â h. The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) dose will be altered at the discretion of the responsible clinician. If maximal doses of the IMP have been reached, consideration can be given to the addition of other therapy, e.g. rifampicin, in addition to the trial therapy, without breaking the allocation code. The remainder of antenatal care, in particular the timing and mode of delivery will be left to the discretion of the responsible clinician. A schedule of participant enrolment, interventions and assessments in the trial is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schedule of participant enrolment, interventions and assessments in the trial. 1. All screening assessments are part of routine clinical practice. 2. Weekly visits are recommended but not mandatory; normal hospital clinical practice is acceptable.Â 3. No other trial-specific procedures are required before consent. 4. These blood tests are taken as per routine clinical practice and are not trial specific. 5. Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) started after randomisation. IMP dose altered by the research team if indicated by symptoms and/or blood tests taken during normal clinical practice. 6. Cardiotocography only measured 1Â week after randomisation or as per routine clinical practice. 7. All unexpected adverse events occurring during the trial that are observed by the research team or reported by the participant will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form, whether or not attributed to the IMP. Unexpected serious adverse events will be expeditiously reported. 8. All prescribed medications deemed necessary by the investigator to provide adequate supportive care for ICP are permitted during the clinical trial. The medications must be recorded in the participantâ€™s electronic Case Report Form; all other concomitant medication will only be recorded in the event that a serious adverse event is reported</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_3018_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par77">We will recruit 580 women in total; this will allow for the possibility of 5% of infants being lost to follow-up and is a conservative estimate given that some women will have twin pregnancies. The sample size is informed by the most recent Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This includes the trials reported in the previous meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with the addition of the largest trial published in 2012 by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. From these data, we estimate the event rate for the primary outcome (a composite of perinatal death or preterm delivery (less than 37Â weeksâ€™ gestation) or neonatal unit admission) for infants of untreated women as 40% with a plausible and relevant reduction to 27% for infants of women treated with UDCA, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 13% and a risk ratio (RR) of 0.675. This is conservative compared with the effect sizes seen in the Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] for the three individual endpoints (RR 0.31, 0.46 and 0.48 for perinatal death, preterm delivery and neonatal unit admission, respectively). Five hundred and fifty infants of women with ICP (275 per group) are required to have a 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the two-sided 5% level, a reduction in the primary outcome measure from 40% in the control group to 27% in the treated group. Allowing for 5% lost to follow-up requires a total sample size of 580 infants (290 per group).</p>
                <p id="Par78">This number will also allow us to look at the components of the composite endpoints: a trial assessing 550 infants will have 89% power to demonstrate a reduction in neonatal unit admission rates from 17 to 8%, and 99% power for a reduction in prematurity from 41 to 23% (based on the Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]), both effect sizes of the same magnitude as that demonstrated in our previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We do not anticipate enough perinatal deaths to detect reliably any plausible treatment effect, but we have included this due to its clinical importance and will report it separately.</p>
                <p id="Par79">The trial will be undertaken in approximately 30 consultant-led maternity units in England and Wales to achieve this sample size in the anticipated time-frame. Our previous pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has confirmed that women and clinicians are willing to participate in this randomised controlled trial and we have used recruitment estimates from this trial, together with trial management experience and expertise of the Co-investigator Group to inform strategies to meet the required target size.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par80">The allocation ratio of intervention (UDCA) to control (placebo) arms will be 1:1. Randomisation will be managed via a secure web-based randomisation facility. A minimisation algorithm will be used to ensure balance between the groups with respect to study centre (approximately 30 centres), gestational age at randomisation (&lt;â€‰34, 34 to &lt;â€‰37, â‰¥â€‰37Â weeksâ€™ gestation), single versus multi-fetal pregnancy, and highest serum bile-acid concentration prior to randomisation (&lt;â€‰40Â Î¼mol/L, â‰¥â€‰40Â Î¼mol/L).</p>
                <p id="Par81">The minimisation algorithm will be generated by MedSciNet, which will hold the allocation code. Research teams at sites will approach women to confirm eligibility and the intervention will be allocated using the web-based randomisation to provide an alpha numeric pack number which will correlate with a pack to be dispensed by that siteâ€™s pharmacy. The trial is triple-masked: trial participants, clinical care providers, outcome assessors and data analysts will all be masked to allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Emergency code break will be available, but clinicians requesting unmasking must be satisfied that it is a genuine emergency and that knowledge of the treatment allocation (either UDCA or placebo) is needed to guide the appropriate clinical management of the participant. In some cases this may be achieved without unblinding, by stopping the allocated treatment and treating the participant with UDCA.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p id="Par83">The analysis and presentation of results will follow the most up-to-date recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) group. Full details of the Statistical Analysis Plan are given in AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Text S1. Analyses will be completed in StataÂ® version 13.1 or later. Unmasked data will only be made available for analysis after full database lock (after all data outcomes have been completed) or on request by the Data Monitoring Committee. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, i.e. all randomised women (and infants) will be analysed according to the treatment that they were allocated to, irrespective of the treatment they received or whether they received any treatment at all.</p>
                <p id="Par84">Demographic and clinical data will be summarised with counts and percentages for categorical variables, means with standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables, and medians with interquartile or simple ranges for other continuous variables. All comparative analyses will be performed adjusting for minimisation factors at randomisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Centre will be included as a random effect. Both unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates will be presented, but the primary inference will be based on the adjusted estimates.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Binary outcomes will be analysed using log binomial regression models. Results will be presented as adjusted risk ratios plus confidence intervals. If any model does not converge, a Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models and results will be presented as adjusted differences in means with confidence intervals. Continuous outcomes will not be categorised for statistical testing unless pre-specified as an outcome (and clinically relevant). Unadjusted median differences with confidence intervals will be presented for skewed continuous variables, and an adjusted analysis using quantile regression will be presented if possible. Analysis of outcomes that are measured repeatedly over time (severity of itch and biochemistry measures) will use repeated measures analysis techniques. Alternatively, if the data are highly skewed, geometric means of the post-randomisation observations will be reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the trial arms will be compared using a geometric mean ratio, adjusted for the baseline measures and minimisation factors.</p>
                <p id="Par86">The analysis of perinatal outcomes will include all infants born to a randomised mother, so the denominator will be the number of infants. For these outcomes, correlations between twins will be accounted for in the adjusted model by nesting twin cluster as a random effect within centre. Multiplicity (multi-fetal pregnancy) will also be adjusted for as a fixed effect in the models.</p>

Binary outcomes will be presented as risk ratios with confidence intervals on a forest plot. Pre-specified subgroups will be based on the criteria selected for minimisation: serum bile-acid concentration at baseline (10â€“39Â Î¼mol/L/ â‰¥ 40Â Î¼mol/L); gestational age (participants recruited before 34Â weeks, 34 to 36â€‰+â€‰6Â weeks, â‰¥â€‰37Â weeksâ€™ gestation); singletons and twins.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par124">Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for treatment of ICP is inconsistent, with some units routinely prescribing UDCA, others prescribing very little and the remainder offering it variably. We have engaged with all the sites to assess readiness and willingness to participate for the duration of the trial and offer women this placebo-controlled trial. We have also worked for many years with the patient support group, ICP Support, to ensure that we are providing accurate, up-to-date information on treatment options for women with ICP. Our previous pilot trial of UDCA in women with ICP demonstrated that the trial would be feasible and the research question remains active and unanswered. Results are highly likely to influence clinical practice, through direct management and impact on national and international guidelines.</p>

A charter has been completed following the recommendations of the DAMOCLES Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The committee will periodically review trial progress and outcomes and will look regularly at protocol adherence by site and by trial arm, including randomisation processes and patterns of allocation. In the light of interim data on the trialâ€™s outcomes, adverse event data, accumulating evidence from other trials and any other relevant evidence, the Data Monitoring Committee will inform the Trial Steering Committee if in their view there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate that any part of the protocol under investigation is either clearly indicated or contra-indicated, either for all infants or for a particular subgroup of trial participants and the trial should be terminated. Appropriate proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least 3 standard errors in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting or modifying the trial prematurely, for the superiority hypothesis.</p>
