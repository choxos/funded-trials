                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this single-center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, participants with a history of PD and LUTS were randomized to a 12-week bladder training program (BT) or conservative advice (CA). Outcome measures included a 3-day volume frequency diary, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)–Overactive Bladder Module, and ICIQ—Quality of Life Module. Co–primary endpoints were (1) patient perception of change and (2) change in number of urgency episodes at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included change in ICIQ scores, number of micturitions, and volume voided.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thirty-eight participants were randomized (18 to CA, 20 to BT). Both CA and BT were associated with significant improvements in volume voided, number of micturitions, symptom severity scores, and measures of quality of life (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). At 12 weeks, compared to CA, BT was associated with significant superiority on patient perception of improvement (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001), significantly greater reductions in number of voids in 24 hours (mean decrease 2.3 ± 0.8 voids vs 0.3 ± 0.5 [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05]), and greater reductions in interference with daily life (2.1 ± 0.8 point improvement vs 0.3 ± 0.7 point deterioration [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05]). BT was not associated with change in urgency episodes (mean change 2.4 ± 1.5 urgency episodes vs 3.5 ± 1.5 [<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> NS]). At 20 weeks, BT remained associated with greater improvement in interference in daily life. Loss of significance in other measures may reflect loss of power from loss to follow-up.</p>

            <p>Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common in Parkinson disease (PD) and are associated with poorer quality of life (QOL).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> LUTS in PD result from failure of the basal ganglia to suppress micturition. Despite the unique pathology underlying LUTS in PD, trials examining treatments are lacking. Guidelines advocate the empirical use of anticholinergic medication.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, these drugs are associated with fractures, delirium, and cognitive decline in PD.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In the general population without neurologic disease, bladder training (BT) can improve bladder control and continence.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> One pilot study examined the efficacy of BT in PD.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> While the results were promising, the trial lacked a control group. There is a strong behavioral component to LUTS so studies are susceptible to placebo effects. This controlled study examined the efficacy of BT for LUTS in PD.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Participants were recruited from four movement disorder clinics in the North of England. PD was diagnosed by a physician specializing in the diagnosis of PD. All participants reported troublesome LUTS. Exclusion criteria included Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt;24, poorly controlled diabetes, indwelling catheter, renal dialysis, cardiac failure requiring diuretics, urinary tract infection, prostate or bladder cancer, uncontrolled bladder outlet obstruction, pelvic organ prolapse, and previous urogynecologic surgery.</p>

In keeping with guidelines,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> 2 co–primary endpoints were selected: change in number of urgency episodes in 72 hours and patient perception of improvement.

                <p>Participants with at least 1 follow-up assessment were included in the analysis. Analysis at 20 weeks was performed using the last observation carried forward method. Gaussian data were described using mean and standard error and compared using independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine change over time. An interaction between group and time was used to compare BT and CA.

              <p>People with PD report a higher prevalence of LUTS than do age-matched controls. LUTS in PD are associated with a poorer quality of life, falls, and admission to long-term care.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that micturition is under the control of several cortical and subcortical areas that are common sites for Lewy body pathology, the hallmark of PD.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Animal studies indicate that the net effect of the basal ganglia is to suppress micturition.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In humans, subthalamic deep brain stimulation is associated with reduced prevalence of overactive bladder.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, few studies have examined interventions for LUTS in PD.</p>
              <p>This study demonstrates that both CA and BT may improve LUTS in PD. BT was associated with a significantly greater patient perception of improvement than CA alone. In addition, BT (compared with CA alone) was associated with greater improvements in secondary endpoints including urinary frequency and effect of bladder symptoms on daily life. Urinary urgency did not significantly improve. This may be due to the complex interplay between bladder and motor symptoms. Urgency results from a failure to suppress micturition but may be exacerbated by bradykinesia that results in functional incontinence.</p>
              <p>Efficacy of bladder training appeared greatest at 12 weeks. In keeping with other studies, we demonstrated that initial improvements seen on bladder diaries lessen over time.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> It should be noted that although not statistically significant at 20 weeks, changes in QOL measures remained consistently better for the BT group than the CA group. The sample size in this pilot study was relatively small and thus the study was likely to be underpowered to detect differences in all endpoints. This was most pronounced at 20 weeks, where numbers were smallest due to attrition.</p>
              <p>Only one small study has previously examined the efficacy of BT in PD.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In keeping with our results, Vaughan et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> demonstrated significant improvements in QOL, symptom score, and bother scores. These investigators used EMG-assisted biofeedback delivered over 5 clinic visits. In our study, the intervention was delivered in a single session without the need for specialist equipment. This study demonstrates that BT could feasibly be delivered by a specialist nurse and our results appear comparable to those obtained by Vaughan et al.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We elected to include patients with troublesome LUTS with and without incontinence. Although LUTS appear to be common in early PD, urinary incontinence appears to be a relatively late presentation.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Our study demonstrated that BT is of help to patients with PD reporting LUTS without incontinence. Furthermore, this study examined BT in PD compared with a control group. Studies of LUTS are highly susceptible to placebo effects. Inclusion of the CA group demonstrated that BT has significant beneficial effects over those derived purely from trial participation.</p>
              <p>There are important limitations to our study. Patients in the BT group were slightly younger than those in the CA group. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age but previous studies have indicated that age is not a predictor of outcome from bladder training.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The small sample size meant it was not possible to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics such as age, disease duration, and disease severity or to accommodate for differences during training such as concordance with training. Future fully powered studies would reduce differences between baseline characteristics and should allow for adjustment of these factors in the analysis.</p>
              <p>BT is a complex intervention. From this study, it is not possible to ascertain which elements of the program resulted in improved outcomes. The loss of efficacy at 20 weeks may reflect the loss of fortnightly contact from a nurse resulting in loss of concordance with the program, but we cannot say this for certain.</p>
              <p>Attrition in the BT group was greater than in the CA group. BT required greater participant commitment; qualitative work is underway to better understand whether this made BT burdensome and to explore potential causes for attrition.</p>
              <p>Finally, a higher number of potential participants reported one or more exclusion criteria. Future studies should examine the feasibility, efficacy, and sustainability of behavioral techniques in patients with common comorbidities.</p>
              <p>This study demonstrated the potential benefits of BT for LUTS in PD in patients with and without incontinence. Both CA and BT were associated with significant improvements in volume frequency diary and measures of QOL. BT was associated with significantly greater patient perception of improvement, reductions in number of voids in 24 hours, and reductions in interference with daily life than CA alone. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p>
