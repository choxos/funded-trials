                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Routinely recorded data held in electronic health records can be used to inform the conduct of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, limitations with access and accuracy have been identified. <italic>Objective</italic>: Using epilepsy as an exemplar condition, we assessed the attributes and agreement of routinely recorded data compared to data collected using case report forms in a UK RCT assessing antiepileptic drug treatments for individuals newly diagnosed with epilepsy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The case study RCT is the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs II (SANAD II) trial, a pragmatic, UK multicentre RCT assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs as treatments for epilepsy. Ninety-eight of 470 eligible participants provided consent for access to routinely recorded secondary care data that were retrieved from NHS Digital Hospital Episode Statistics (<italic>N</italic>=71) and primary and secondary care data from The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank (<italic>N</italic>=27). We assessed data items relevant to the identification of individuals eligible for inclusion in SANAD II, baseline and follow-up visits. The attributes of routinely recorded data were assessed including the degree of missing data. The agreement between routinely recorded data and data collected on case report forms in SANAD II was assessed using calculation of Cohenâs kappa for categorical data and construction of Bland-Altman plots for continuous data.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">There was a significant degree of missing data in the routine record for 15 of the 20 variables assessed, including all clinical variables. Agreement was poor for the majority of comparisons, including the assessments of seizure occurrence and adverse events. For example, only 23/62 (37%) participants had a date of first-ever seizure identified in routine datasets. Agreement was satisfactory for the date of prescription of antiepileptic drugs and episodes of healthcare resource use.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">There are currently significant limitations preventing the use of routinely recorded data for participant identification and assessment of clinical outcomes in epilepsy, and potentially other chronic conditions. Further research is urgently required to assess the attributes, agreement, additional benefits, cost-effectiveness and âoptimal mixâ of routinely recorded data compared to data collected using standard methods such as case report forms at clinic visits for people with epilepsy.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">There is great expectation that the analysis of routinely recorded healthcare data will provide rapid and efficient answers to healthcare questions and be a vehicle to generate health and wealth for the UK, exemplified by the recent UKRI investment in Health Data Research UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and collaboration between Novartis and National Health Service England to conduct a novel large scale clinical trial using healthcare system data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is vital therefore that we understand their utility in clinical trials in common chronic diseases, epilepsy being the exemplar in this paper.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Routinely recorded data can be defined as data that are routinely recorded for specific, defined primary purposes, other than audit or research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Data regarding clinical care are routinely documented in electronic medical records and stored in administrative healthcare databases in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Routinely recorded data have established use in retrospective observational studies such as record linkage population studies, but their use in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is less well established. RCTs remain the gold standard for assessing the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and publicly funded, pragmatic RCTs typically provide longer-term outcome data to inform chronic disease management. However, the majority of RCTs are time-consuming and resource-intensive as clinicians typically assess participants at clinic visits and record trial data on case report forms. If a trial is assessing outcomes that are important to participants, such as a core outcome set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], one might expect relevant data to be recorded routinely.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Routinely recorded data have been used to inform judgements about the feasibility, sample size and recruitment targets in RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], measure certain participant outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] such as mortality and inform health economic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Routinely recorded data are a potential source of data for a wider range of clinical outcomes, and their use could greatly improve the efficiency of clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], reducing the burden to participants and researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, data from non-clinical routine sources may inform outcomes beyond the standard RCT assessments of clinical efficacy and effectiveness. For example, cost data (such as the use of healthcare resources) and socio-economic data (such as employment and means-tested benefits data) may inform health economic analyses and the assessment of the broader societal impact of healthcare interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Limitations in feasibility, accessibility and accuracy have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, the accuracy of routinely recorded data in identifying incident cases may be reduced compared to prevalent cases which may impact on the utility of routinely recorded data to identify individuals with ânewâ diagnoses, a frequent target group for RCTs. Furthermore, routinely recorded data may have limitations in identifying recurrent events compared to single events. For example, it may be expected that the identification of stroke would be of greater accuracy than the identification of seizure occurrences.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The accuracy of diagnosis of epilepsy using routinely recorded healthcare data compared to an independent review of patientsâ medical records has been assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, there is scant evidence of the assessment of accuracy or agreement compared to standard methods of data collection employed in prospective research, such as the record of data on Case Report Forms (CRFs).</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par22">The case study RCT is the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs II (SANAD II (EudraCT No: 2012-001884-64, ISRCTN Number: 30294119)) trial, a pragmatic, UK multicentre RCT assessing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of selected antiepileptic drugs as first-line treatments for newly diagnosed epilepsy.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Individuals with newly diagnosed epilepsy participating in SANAD II, aged 16âyears or older and with a minimum of 12âmonths follow-up, were eligible for inclusion in this study. Participants were sent a study invitation via post and asked to sign a consent form. One further postal invitation was sent if there was no initial response. Routinely recorded data were retrieved from NHS Digital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which included data for episodes of patient contact with NHS secondary care in England and from The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank (SAIL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], including access to data for episodes of patient contact with NHS secondary care and in selected cases primary care for patients in Wales. All datasets used clinical coding systems, the inpatient and outpatient datasets using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the primary care dataset using UK READ Codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the emergency datasets using unique coding systems. The study was reviewed and approved by the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service and Health Research Authority (29/01/16, REC reference: 16/NS/0007, Protocol number: UOL001183, IRAS project ID: 189002).</p>
              <p id="Par24">To permit assessment of the attributes of routinely recorded data and agreement compared to data collected using case report forms, data variables relevant to each of the following aspects were identified or constructed from the available datasets:

              <p id="Par31">An algorithmic approach was developed for each variable, using knowledge of the coding systems, clinical behaviours and organisational pathways. Similar approaches utilising the clinical interpretation of routinely recorded data have previously been used in studies assessing seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and in other disease areas in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Diagnostic codes indicating the occurrence of relevant events were specified a priori and the âbest-caseâ dataset was used in the analysis, constructed using the available data from all relevant primary and secondary care routine datasets. Throughout the analyses, the included participants were analysed as a complete cohort, without reference to antiepileptic drug (AED) prescribed or SANAD II study treatment arm. The algorithms developed for each variable together with the diagnostic codes are presented as Supplementary Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1-4</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1-6</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> presents as an example the algorithm for the identification of seizure occurrence.

Ninety-eight participants provided consent to participate in this study, 55 males and 43 females with a mean age of 50. Demographics were similar for the 372 patients not providing consent. Routinely recorded data were requested for 71 participants resident in England, with data available in inpatient, outpatient, emergency and critical care datasets and 27 participants resident in Wales, with data available in inpatient, outpatient and emergency datasets. Primary care data were available for a subset of 23 participants resident in Wales.</p>

                <title>Variables relevant to the identification of eligible individuals and SANAD II baseline assessment</title>
                <p id="Par39">Sixty-two of the 98 included participants had a date (day, month and year) of first-ever seizure occurrence recorded in SANAD II during the time period covered by the available routine data and were eligible for the assessment of âdate of first-ever seizureâ. In the routine datasets, a first-ever seizure occurrence was identified in 23 of the 62 participants. The most common recorded codes were non-specific âseizureâ and âepilepsyâ codes. The most common ICD 10 code was âUnspecified Convulsions (R568)â, emergency code âCNS Conditions â Epilepsy (HES 41, SAIL 17A)â and READ codes âConvulsion NOS (R003z)â and âHad a Fit (IB63)â.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows a flowchart for the identification of âfirst-ever seizuresâ in routine datasets. Although sixteen participants had a relevant attendance within 48âh of a seizure occurrence recorded in SANAD II, seizure could not be identified as the cause of the attendance due to inadequate or discrepant diagnostic codes. Codes included âCNS, Non-Epilepsyâ in the emergency datasets and âDisorientationâ and âConfusionâ in the inpatient datasets. The Bland-Altman plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) demonstrates that when a date of first seizure is identified in the routinely collected data; agreement with data collected using CRFs is poor. The 95% confidence limits of agreement between the dates of first-ever seizure are 145 and 313âdays, well in excess of the specified 30âday clinically acceptable limit. The mean of the difference between the dates is 84, indicating that on average the date of first-ever seizure is identified in the routinely collected data 84âdays after the seizure is identified in the SANAD II dataset. Limiting the first-ever seizures to âtonic-clonicâ seizures, the data were marginally more complete with seizures identified for 22 out of 43 participants with a tonic-clonic seizure recorded in the SANAD II dataset, although agreement regarding the date of first tonic-clonic seizure occurrence remains poor.

                <p id="Par41">At the time of recruitment into SANAD II, using routinely collected data 41 of 78 participants met the criteria for diagnosis of epilepsy and agreement was poor for the âdate of diagnosis of epilepsyâ. Seizures could be classified in all participants using data retrieved from routinely recorded datasets; however, agreement was poor (Cohenâs kappa 0.151, <italic>P</italic>=0.018) explained by the disproportionately large number of participants deemed âunclassifiedâ as a result of lack of clinical detail in the codes recorded.</p>

                <p id="Par43">Data regarding adverse events were sparse in routine datasets, and of 97 adverse events recorded in SANAD II only two were identifiable in routine datasets.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Prescribing data were only available from the primary care dataset. Twenty-six âfirst AED prescriptionsâ were identified, all prescription times being within the 90-day clinical limit of agreement with data recorded in SANAD II.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Dates of episodes of outpatient planned and inpatient and emergency unplanned healthcare resource use had fewer missing data compared to clinical variables; for example, 317 outpatient attendances were included in the SANAD II dataset, compared to 350 recorded in routinely collected data. Furthermore, the dates of attendance were within the acceptable clinical limits of agreement.</p>
                <p id="Par46">For some variables, additional data were recorded in the routinely recorded datasets that were not available in the SANAD II CRFs. For three participants in whom the CRF data indicated they were seizure-free, additional seizures were identified in the routine datasets. For one individual without an EEG result on the SANAD II CRF, the routine data indicated that they had an EEG. Two participants of the 23 with available prescribing data in routine datasets were prescribed additional AEDs not recorded in the CRFs. Finally, data regarding AED adherence could be inferred from the routine datasets using the frequency of repeat prescription, noting the assumptions made in reaching this result.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par47">Routinely recorded data are increasingly being used in clinical trials to provide answers to important clinical questions. However, this study shows that for epilepsy, and potentially therefore for other chronic conditions, it is not currently possible to identify important clinical events and outcomes in routinely recorded data in the UK. Therefore, their exclusive use is not a valid substitute for data collected using standard methods such as case report forms completed at clinic visits or via telephone. There is an ongoing drive to incorporate routinely recorded data into RCTs in an effort to improve research efficiency and reduce the burden for participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the results of this study, using epilepsy as the exemplar, raise potentially significant concerns about the suitability of routine data for this purpose.</p>
              <p id="Par48">We assessed the use of routinely recorded data to identify individuals eligible for recruitment into a RCT for people with newly diagnosed epilepsy and to collect baseline, follow-up and outcome data.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Regarding seizure occurrence, it was not possible to identify baseline (pre-epilepsy diagnosis) seizures in the routinely collected data for 63% of patients or seizures during follow-up for 64%. When baseline seizures or follow-up seizures were identified, there was a poor agreement with dates recorded in the trial database. The date of the first follow-up seizure identified was 86âdays (mean) after the first follow-up seizure recorded in the trial database. Follow-up seizures could not be identified in the routine data, either because no event was documented at all, or because codes used did not indicate that seizure was the reason for attendance or admission. As a consequence, analysis of routinely recorded data grossly underestimates the outcomes âtime to first seizureâ and âtime to 12-month remissionâ.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Similarly, a âdiagnosis of epilepsyâ was identified in less than half of the participants using the routinely recorded data around the time of randomisation into SANAD II. It was also not possible to classify seizure types for the majority of participants due to inadequate coding and coding options.</p>
              <p id="Par51">Specific codes labelling âadverse eventsâ were not recorded. Furthermore, healthcare attendances correlating with the dates of adverse events recorded in SANAD II were not identified. SANAD II participants self-reported more unplanned emergency attendances and fewer unplanned inpatient admissions, compared to those events identified in routinely recorded datasets. For these data, it may be more likely that the routinely recorded data are correct, and that recall bias is responsible for the discrepancy in the SANAD II dataset.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Explanations for the results may include the inaccurate recording of codes in routinely recorded datasets or inaccurate initial clinical diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy. Furthermore, certain events may not have been ârecordableâ, for example, if participants did not seek medical attention following seizure occurrence or if relevant codes or detail are not included in the available coding systems and routine datasets. Finally, patients with seizures may frequently be treated and then discharged from the emergency department, where diagnostic coding is not mandatory. This study report refers specifically to outcomes as applied to epilepsy, although it must be noted that in other disease areas, similar results may not be found and these explanations may not apply. For example, disease areas where the diagnosis is more explicit, where the presentation is acute and where admission (rather than discharge from an emergency department) is more commonly required may be more likely to be more completely and accurately recorded in routine datasets. Examples may include âmyocardial infarctionâ or âstrokeâ.</p>
              <p id="Par53">The results of this study have implications for the use of routinely recorded data in RCTs in patients with epilepsy. In SANAD II, exclusively using routinely recorded data would not have allowed reliable identification of eligible individuals for recruitment, collection of baseline data or the collection of data for seizure and adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, only 98 of 470 patients (21%) provided consent for their routine data to be retrieved. Notably, the 470 patients had already consented to participate in the SANAD II RCT.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Whilst routinely recorded data could not be used alone to construct clinical outcomes, routine data could aid the identification of events, such as seizure occurrence or prescription changes, that had been missed, and these data remain important for assessing health service resource use for economic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the limitations in accessing these data, such as cost and lengthy application processes, would need to be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par55">Further research is urgently required to assess the attributes, additional benefits, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of accessing routinely recorded data during RCTs in the UK in epilepsy and other common disease areas. The âStudies Within A Trialâ (SWAT) approach, embedding methodological research within an existing prospective trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], could be suggested as the method to facilitate such research. For example, routinely recorded data could be requested for a subset of participants within existing RCTs. The analysis of such data, compared to the standard RCT methods, may directly inform the use of routine data in the ongoing RCT as well as inform future research.</p>
              <p id="Par56">The âde-identifiedâ nature of primary care data, cost and poor geographical coverage were notable limitations. Development of the infrastructure to record national primary care data coverage is required, either through improved collaboration between existing routine data sources with individual-level data linkage or the development of national data sources, such as the NHS Digital General Practice Extraction Service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further, a number of countries have integrated healthcare systems allowing for national administrative healthcare databases, such as the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, the Danish National Hospital Register and the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System. In these examples, it is possible to retrieve routinely recorded data from electronic medical records for individuals across hospital inpatient admissions and emergency care, outpatient clinic and primary care attendances. In the UK, standardisation of the coding systems used in different care settings and between datasets and greater involvement of clinicians in the clinical coding process may improve the accuracy and completeness of clinical coding. A suggested proposed improvement could include the development of a national, integrated electronic health record for use in direct clinical care, with secondary uses in audit and research. Such a proposal would include direct clinician input and selection of diagnostic codes and would have significant potential for the improved recording of data and improved utility for the datasets in clinical practice and research.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Whilst patients and the public are broadly supportive of data recording and sharing for healthcare research, concerns remain over confidentiality and potential abuses of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Public concerns regarding the sharing and linking of routinely recorded data will hamper future efforts to develop linked routinely recorded administrative databases, despite the likely benefits to individuals and the population. Further research is required with public engagement to define the issues of importance to members of the public and assess perspectives with regards to the routine recording of data and subsequent use for secondary purposes including research.</p>
              <p id="Par58">This study has notable limitations. The variables and constructed outcomes derived from the routinely recorded datasets were defined and extracted using algorithms developed for each comparison. There is a risk that relevant clinical events may not have been identified. To address this limitation and explore the data further, the routinely recorded data for each participant were examined in their entirety to identify additional relevant events. This process was feasible as a result of the small sample size. Furthermore, this study involved the retrospective identification of events in routinely recorded datasets and comparison to events identified in a study designed and completed using standard prospective methods. It must be acknowledged that the comparator study was not designed to be completed retrospectively using routinely recorded datasets, and if this had been the case, alternative methodologies may have been employed.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Substantial further development is now required to improve the utility of routinely recorded data in research. To improve the likelihood of significant progress, initiatives for development should include collaboration from the government, National Health Service, researchers and perhaps most importantly acknowledging recent controversies, patients and the public; re-gaining their trust will be essential in realising the individual and population healthcare benefits of routinely recorded data. Examples of such work in progress include the European Health Data and Evidence Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], whose objectives include standardising real-world health data Europe-wide for purposes including research, Health Data Research UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the PED4PED initiative, a project aiming to improve outcomes for patients with epilepsy by linking data between primary, secondary and the emergency services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
